<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soft-money donations to the political parties are
on a pace to set a record this year, but more and more large
corporations have quietly stopped giving them.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, senior executives say they want to distance
themselves from what they describe as the capital's unseemly
culture of cash and influence, while others acknowledge that their
companies are simply not getting much in return for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one corporations that in each previous election cycle
since 1993-94 contributed at least $100,000 in soft money _
unlimited and largely unregulated gifts to the parties _ have not
donated any soft money in the current cycle, covering the last 15
months, according to a computerized study of Federal Election
Commission records. The list includes prolific past contributors
like Revlon, Advanced Micro Devices, Miramax Films, and Starwood
Hotels and Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 31 companies have made statements announcing an end
to their soft-money contributions, and many still make much
smaller, federally regulated donations through political action
committees. But some executives confirmed, although not for
attribution, that their companies had adopted, or were weighing, a
permanent ban on writing soft-money checks.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few large companies _ General Motors, Monsanto,
AlliedSignal, Time Warner, none of them among the most recent 31 _
have formally announced in recent years that they have sworn off
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Few corporations have followed suit, in at least some cases
because they do not want to risk angering legislators in
Washington. ``There are more and more companies out there who are
refusing to give money, but they are not advertising their
decision,'' said Charles E.M. Kolb, president of the Committee for
Economic Development, an association of corporate executives
fighting for a campaign finance overhaul that would outlaw soft
money. ``I suspect that there are more and more companies asking
themselves if this is really worth it. What's just as interesting,
though, is the fact that companies are scared to tell people.''
</P>
<P>
   Several executives said their corporations had stopped giving
soft money because they had found better use of their resources,
like lobbying, contributing to political action committees and
acting as hosts for fund-raising events. Others have stopped giving
because they believe that soft money plays an unhealthy role in the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   While more companies quietly join the ranks of those forgoing
soft-money donations, other corporate interests, senior executives
and labor unions are redoubling them. Since January 1999, the
Democratic and Republican Parties have raised $160.5 million in
soft money, according to data compiled last week by the nonpartisan
watchdog Common Cause. That was nearly double the $84.6 million in
soft money raised by the parties in the first 15 months of the 1996
election cycle. By November, the parties will have raised nearly
$500 million in soft money, some experts predict, as against $262
million in the 1996 cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But the addition of 31 companies to the roster of those turning
their backs on giving soft money does add muscle to the effort of
two organizations of corporate leaders that are pushing for a
soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began in 1995, when Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of the
leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., created
Campaign for America to fight for an overhaul of the nation's
campaign finance system. Kohlberg is being assisted by Warren E.
Buffett, the acclaimed value investor and chief executive of
Berkshire Hathaway. Last fall, Campaign for America reported that
121 companies that had given at least $100,000 each in 1994 or 1996
had since stopped contributing soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The other group, Kolb's Committee for Economic Development, has
an even larger number of corporate executives, although not all of
them have persuaded their companies to stop giving soft money.
</P>
<P>
   A senior vice president at one company that has stopped giving
soft-money donations said that ``there was not much benefit'' to
them, especially inasmuch as membership fees of the parties' most
elite donor clubs had jumped to $250,000 from $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is by the time you give the base amount to the
House Republicans, Senate Republicans, House Democrats and Senate
Democrats, it costs the company a total of $60,000 and you find you
don't get a lot of action for it,'' this executive said. ``As
companies go through cost-cutting measures, it's an expense that is
harder to justify.''
</P>
<P>
   This executive's company, which stopped giving soft money in
late 1998, has since found no negative ramifications in its
dealings with lawmakers. ``When we were giving $10,000 or
$15,000,'' the officer said, ``it was never enough; you are
constantly asked for more. The no-money pledge is better than the
some-money pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime fund-raisers and political strategists say they
have seen recent signs of what they call ``donor fatigue,''
especially among corporate executives who are bombarded with
solicitations for the parties' elite donor clubs and almost weekly
black-tie dinners and political retreats at resort hotels. The
fund-raisers say the fatigue is the fault of both parties' enormous
appetite for soft money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last few weeks, I have had several clients of mine
say they are getting out of this soft-money business,'' said Lanny
J. Davis, a lawyer and lobbyist at Patton Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both political parties have gotten so excessive in trying to
beat the other in the soft-money hunt,'' Davis said. ``I'm part of
the problem, and I've never seen such disgust with the practice in
all my years here. It has reached critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   In past election years, the Democratic National Committee and
the Republican National Committee were the most aggressive
soft-money solicitors. This year, however, the Senate and House
fund-raising committees of each party are also pushing hard to
collect big soft-money checks. With the battle for control of
Congress intensifying, many donors are being solicited by multiple
party committees at the same time, exhausting some supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund-raisers, however, play down the danger of donor
exhaustion, noting that more corporations are writing larger checks
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the Republican National Committee
brought in $21.3 million _ the most ever raised in a single event _
at its gala in Washington saluting the party's apparent
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. The Republicans received
six-figure contributions _ and fund-raising assistance _ from
Philip Morris, AT&AMP;T and the National Rifle Association, all three
of which are among the most generous soft-money contributors to the
party this year. The Democrats hope to raise a similar amount at a
tribute to President Clinton later this month.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime Republican lobbyist predicted that more
corporations would shun soft-money giving if they learned that
competitors were doing the same. ``I think we are going to see a
rush to the exit, if not a stampede,'' the lobbyist said. ``People
are beginning to say it does not make sense in the context of our
budgeting and our giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb, whose Committee for Economic Development has enlisted more
than 250 executives and retired executives to endorse a soft-money
ban, said an interesting question would be whether companies that
had stopped giving believed that their interests were given short
shrift by Congress as a result.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which stopped soft-money giving in 1997, thinks
not. Bill Noack, a GM spokesman, said the company had found that
its decision had not affected relations with Congress at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many issues that affect us _ the environment,
safety and trade _ there is something every day,'' Mr. Noack said.
``And I can't say our decision has made an impact at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (The company, through its political action committee, still
makes regulated donations, with a $5,000 legal maximum, to federal
candidates.)
</P>
<P>
   Like GM, Monsanto, which had given $88,700 in soft money during
the 1995-96 election cycle, stopped giving it in 1997. And like GM,
St. Louis-based Monsanto, which merged in April with Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn, found that relations with Congress were unaffected, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we gave _ and after we stopped giving _ we always had
wonderful relationships with the members in Congress who represent
our company in Missouri,'' said the spokeswoman, Linda Fisher,
Pharmacia's vice president for government affairs. ``We support
them through our PAC and fund-raisers, and we have found that to be
the most successful way to have our voice heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 31 companies that have most recently abandoned
soft-money giving _ identified through a computerized check for The
New York Times by the nonpartisan Campaign Study Group of
Springfield, Va. _ some, of course, may find reason to make such a
donation before November.
</P>
<P>
   Further, among these companies, some top executives have stepped
up their contributions. The Spanos Cos., for instance, contributed
$295,000 in soft money in 1997-98, and none in the last 15 months.
But its chairman, Alex G. Spanos, gave $250,000 to the Republican
National Committee in March 1999, records of the Federal Election
Commission show.
</P>
<P>
   And while neither Revlon nor its chief executive, Ronald O.
Perelman, has given any soft money this cycle, Perelman has given a
total of $7,000 in federally restricted contributions to various
candidates.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: GAY, MIDDLE-AGED AND STILL MILITANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been so many national marches on Washington by
political movements in the last four decades that they have become
more a tradition than a novelty. The Park and District police have
stopped counting crowds because they found that neither boosters
nor critics were ever satisfied. The events themselves no longer
qualify as automatic front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   But they remain uniquely important, not just for the sheer
numbers involved but for what they tell the nation _ and the
protesting populations themselves _ about the current state of each
movement. There is no better litmus test of the political health
and character of any group than how it responds to the
inconvenience of being asked to march on Washington. That is
especially true of homosexuals, who in times past tended to be
invisible and therefore hard to organize. And the Millennium March
on Washington this past weekend _ the fourth national gay rights
march in the nation's capital in 31 years _ was significant for
what it showed.
</P>
<P>
   The modern movement was born as a radical expression of youth
and sexual liberation in 1969, when patrons of the Stonewall Inn in
New York rioted against a police raid of the bar. But it was a
middle-aged, middle-class movement that crowded the Mall in
Washington with hundreds of thousands of people on Sunday, with
grandparents in wheelchairs and children underfoot. There were more
family, cultural, church and workplace events on the three-day
weekend schedule than parties. There were other differences, too.
The cadaverous look of AIDS, visible on the faces of so many in the
crowd in 1993, when people with HIV were still routinely dying, was
largely absent. In the new panels of the quilt laid on the Mall,
memorializing those who have died of AIDS, the deaths taper off
noticeably after 1998. Nor was there the same level of anger about
the lack of treatment for AIDS, which helped produce a huge turnout
at the last march. Even so, a vast throng showed up.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington's mayor, Anthony Williams, welcomed them at
noon, he told them they were a crowd of ``310,000, on its way to
half a million.'' Some, like Morris Kight, an old radical from Los
Angeles now in his 80's, came for the sheer joy of the progress
made in law and acceptance in the last three decades. ``I'm the
happiest old man in the world today,'' he said. Some, like the Rev.
Troy Perry, who founded the gay Metropolitan Community Churches in
1968, came with a particular mission. Perry began performing
symbolic marriages at the march in 1987, at the request of two men
dying of AIDS, and at the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday he joined
3,000 couples in vows. Many, like Robert Turlington, 41, of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., who played clarinet in the 130-piece band that
led the march, came out of habit and continuity. ``This is my third
march,'' he said. ``The first was for awareness. The second for
anger. This time I brought my family.''
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that the gay rights movement has matured and
mellowed. But what was also evident, as dozens of speakers took
their turns at the microphone for six and a half hours Sunday
afternoon, was the continuing anger and determination of a group
that still feels discrimination. Employees can still be fired for
being homosexual in 39 states. Homosexuals still get murdered for
being gay. They cannot actually marry in any state, and in most
places, the young cannot become Scouts, or even form their own
groups in school.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the gay rights march last weekend was to show the
movement's strength in a presidential election year. Some of the
strongest feelings came from the youngest speakers. ``We will not
be intimidated,'' said Ivy Fox, a Utah high school student, whose
school board closed dozens of student groups rather than let gays
form one. ``And we will not give up.''

PHOENIX LOOKS AT NATURAL FLOOD CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - A fortress of concrete protects the Phoenix area from
flooding: dams, dikes, channels and culverts. But now Phoenix may
go natural, letting washes carry off storm water.
</P>
<P>
   The city will decide in the next few months whether to ``go with
the flow'' in areas about to explode with development, instead of
pouring more concrete ramparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach can be a model for elsewhere in the Valley,''
says Ray Quay, Phoenix assistant planning director, especially as
growth pushes into uplands creased with major washes.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there's a move to leave nature in charge of flood
control. It costs less, preserves wildlife habitat and opens the
door to recreation.
</P>
<P>
   But the natural approach means there's less land available for
development. Channels and culverts allow homes and businesses to be
built right up to the edge of a river or wash.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Larry Lazarus, who represents landowners in the north
Phoenix area, worries that large portions of their property could
be made off-limits to development. He argues that well-designed
flood-control structures can blend in with the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   UNIQUE CONDITIONS
</P>
<P>
   Why worry about floods in the desert? The idea puzzles newcomers
to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the desert's sparse plant cover and the hard soil
encourage runoff. Rapid snowmelt in distant mountains sends spring
floodwaters pouring into the flatlands. Summer thunderstorms can
dump so much water so fast that the ground can't absorb it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, after a heavy storm covering less than a square mile,
water shot down a wash in Safford fast enough to fill an Olympic
swimming pool every minute.
</P>
<P>
   The old approach to controlling all that water was concrete, and
plenty of it.
</P>
<P>
   Take Cave Creek in Phoenix. Like most creeks and rivers in
Arizona, it carries water only after a heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   At Greenway Road and 17th Avenue, Cave Creek has been turned
into a concrete chute, as wide as a two-lane road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain elegance in its ability to move a lot of
water quickly that was probably appropriate for its time,'' said
Doug Williams, senior planner for the Maricopa County Flood Control
District.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost is high. Building a major channel runs $2 million a
mile and up, while annual maintenance on large flood-control
projects averages $12,000 per mile.
</P>
<P>
   INCOMPATIBLE SYSTEMS
</P>
<P>
   Another complication is that flood-control structures have been
built piecemeal over the years. New development may also funnel
water into older systems without enough capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, for example, developers along lower Skunk Creek
reinforced the banks with a variety of materials, from rock to
concrete, and built to varying design standards. ``It was just a
mess,'' Williams said, and the whole area had to be redone.
</P>
<P>
   To head off such problems, the Flood Control District is working
on master plans to control storm water in four large undeveloped
areas that span Avondale, Glendale, Peoria and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They are centered on major washes or dry riverbeds: the Agua
Fria River from the Salt River up to Lake Pleasant; Cave Creek and
Apache Wash; the middle course of New River between Greenway and
Jomax roads; and Skunk Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The county is emphasizing a natural approach. That's not
possible in flatter areas, which get ``sheet flooding,'' where
water spreads across broad areas, and some sort of channel or
culvert is needed to carry it off.
</P>
<P>
   Skunk Creek, east of Interstate 17 and north of the Carefree
Highway, is on the front burner. Last year, Phoenix put development
on hold in the area until Flood Control analyzed strategies for
handling storm water.
</P>
<P>
   The county is examining four alternatives: the natural approach,
the completely structural approach, and two options that make some
use of structures.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC MEETINGS &QL; 
Phoenix will hold public meetings on the proposals in the coming
weeks, with a City Council vote expected in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area is part of a national move toward flood-control
strategies that don't destroy the habitat around washes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, known for its feats of
construction, ``there's a stronger and stronger push to consider
saving natural channels as much as possible,'' senior engineer
Richard DiBuono said.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially critical in the desert, where washes are rich
with plants and animals. Studies of Skunk Creek found twice as many
species and 250 percent more plant cover in wash areas, compared
with surrounding land.
</P>
<P>
   RECREATIONAL AREAS &QL; 
Recreation is another spur to keeping washes intact. Along New
River, Maricopa County will ``armor'' the banks as far as the
existing subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   But above that point, the riverbed would be left in its natural
state. The plan is to use both New River and the Agua Fria to
create the West Valley Recreation Corridor, including parks and
trails.
</P>
<P>
   Money for recreational features must still be lined up, though.
And not everyone is giving up concrete.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE'S APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, city leaders are pushing the Desert Greenbelt, a
$100 million project with five miles of channels, pipes and
retention basins to catch runoff from the McDowell Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say it's vital protection from a devastating 100-year
flood and will preserve the native environment as much as possible.
But critics say it's designed to support more development in
booming north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps of Engineers will decide on a key permit for the
project in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   COMPROMISE URGES &QL; 
Attorney Lazarus says Phoenix shouldn't reject structural solutions
out of hand. His clients could build on just a third of their 120
acres by Skunk Creek under an all-natural plan. With limited
flood-control construction, Lazarus says more land could be
developed without environmental harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is so many people think this is a black-and-white
issue,'' Lazarus said, ``either a concrete conduit or wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus also objects to suggestions that the city prohibit
development in the entire 100-year flood plain, an area that has a
1 percent chance of flooding in any given year. Flooding in some
spots might be only a few inches of water, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve all that land, Lazarus said, ``is not a health and
safety issue, it's an aesthetic one.'' The property is effectively
condemned, he argues, and the owner should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   That solution is gaining steam.
</P>
<P>
   Pima County has bought more than 7,000 acres under its
Flood-prone Land Acquisition Program.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County, which bought about a dozen small properties in
special cases, is looking at a formal buyout program that would
draw on federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix planner Quay says the city should consider purchasing
property when it might be valuable for preservation or cheaper than
flood protection.
</P>
<P>
   LUCRATIVE CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, developers can profit from leaving wash
corridors alone, said Andy Kunasek, chairman of the Maricopa County
Board of Supervisors, because homebuyers will pay the same premiums
to live by open space as by golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbelt Holdings is counting on that in developing Sonoran
Foothills, an 800-acre project by Skunk Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really planned this community around the washes,'' said
Heidi Kimball, Sunbelt vice president. They will be the core of a
trail system and offer vistas for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbelt has the advantage of drainage patterns that leave lots
of land to develop. Still, Kimball said, ``it's never going to be
100 percent natural.'' She doesn't see how to avoid neighborhood
retention ponds or some bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But Supervisor Jan Brewer predicts the Valley won't go back to
the old ways of flood control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a vision,'' she said. ``We're not going to have ugly
cement channels.'' &QL;

MISSOURI OFFICIALLY REMOVES ACCREDITATION FOR KC SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
 CITY-ACCREDITATION-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City schools officially lost state
accreditation on Monday, but Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr.
expressed hope that the district could regain at least provisional
accreditation by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known this day was coming since last November, and we
have been preparing to face the challenges it brings,'' Demps said
at an afternoon press conference at district headquarters. ``Our
No. 1 priority in this district is to regain accreditation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers and the national media also used
the occasion to make observations on the future of the district.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican state legislators gathered at district
headquarters earlier in the day to criticize Democrats and to again
express support for a proposal aimed at splitting up the district.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal never was introduced in the General Assembly for
debate.
</P>
<P>
   And media outlets, including The Christian Science Monitor,
National Public Radio, U.S. News &AMP; World Report and Education Week
all produced stories detailing the problems that confront one of
the nation's most closely watched school systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Board of Education decided in October to strip the
district of accreditation after state education officials found the
district failed to meet any of 11 academic performance standards.
The state board delayed the effective date of the loss of
accreditation until Monday because of a fear by local officials
that students would flee the district in the middle of a school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of accreditation means the state is withdrawing its seal of
approval. More importantly, it means the district now has two years
to raise test scores, boost graduation rates, improve attendance,
or progress in other areas assessed by state performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   If improvement doesn't occur, the district faces the prospect of
state takeover. Ultimately, the district could be dissolved and
students assigned to new or existing districts.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of accreditation also means that students can leave the
Kansas City district for neighboring Missouri districts and that
the Kansas City district would have to pay for tuition and
transportation costs. However, most of those districts are faced
with space problems and cannot accept an influx of new students.
</P>
<P>
   Demps said the district is more focused now than it has been in
recent years and has already improved the student attendance rate,
the vocational program and the number of students enrolled in
advanced courses. District officials hope that improvements in
those areas and in statewide assessment test scores could help
regain at least provisional accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we will succeed because we are placing a strong
emphasis on literacy in every grade,'' Demps said. ``Teachers are
learning new strategies for helping every student achieve to the
best of their abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said district officials met briefly last week and
discussed filing a lawsuit against the Missouri Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education aimed at blocking the state's
action. Officials dropped those plans, at least for now, Demps
said, until the district can get out of the federal desegregation
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislators, including Connie Cierpiot of
Independence, Carson Ross of Blue Springs, Matt Bartle of Lee's
Summit and Annie Reinhart of Liberty, were not as optimistic about
the district's future. They urged lawmakers to put politics aside
and work together on a plan for improving the district. The group's
plan includes splitting the district of about 30,000 students into
five smaller districts, a move they said would make managing Kansas
City schools easier and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two biggest school districts in the state of Missouri are
St. Louis and Kansas City,'' Ross said. ``The two school districts
in Missouri that are failing (the most) are St. Louis and Kansas
City.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ In a season when hardly anything has gone the Astros'
way, this almost seems fitting.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the teams against which Kerry Wood could have made his
long-awaited comeback from shoulder surgery _ the Chicago Cubs have
19 other opponents on their schedule _ fate blew the Astros into
the Windy City for a reunion they would have just as soon skipped.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years to the day after he struck out a
major-league-record-tying 20 batters in a game against the Astros
at Wrigley Field, Wood will return to the majors tonight to start
the opener of a three-game series between the Astros and Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was named the National League Rookie of the Year following
the 1998 season, but he missed all of last season after undergoing
reconstructive elbow surgery. Originally scheduled to make his
return this past weekend against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Wood was
pushed back after developing a blister on the middle finger of his
pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   So by default, not to mention a little misfortune, the Astros
will get an up-close-and-personal look at Wood's first big-league
action since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be exciting,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``I hope he doesn't throw as well as he has the other times we've
faced him, and I'm not just talking about the 20-strikeout game.
He's pitched some very good games against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had as much trouble with his breaking pitches as we did
with his fastball. I sure hope he doesn't have that kind of command
again, and I'm sure our hitters feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who was 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA in 1998, is 1-0 with a 0.53
ERA in two games (17 innings) against the Astros. He also pitched
eight sparkling innings in an appearance at the Astrodome in 1998,
but the game everyone remembers is the 20-strikeout, one-hit
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anyone pitch like he pitched that day,''
Astros catcher Tony Eusebio said. ``He had command of all of his
breaking pitches, and he was throwing his fastball about 97 mph.
That was just his day. Now he's making his comeback, and there are
going to be a lot of people who want to come out and see him pitch.
It's going to be an exciting day. Hopefully, we'll do better this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood's return falls four days shy of the two-year anniversary of
his memorable day against the Astros, but first-year Cubs manager
Don Baylor insists he wasn't trying to be sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 20-strikeout game was one of those in-the-zone games for
anybody,'' Baylor said. ``If it (his return) was going to be
against the Pirates, it has the same meaning to Kerry. It just so
happened that's the way it fell with the Astros. There are some
guys there that had a lot of strikeouts in games that he pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   The day in question was not a particularly pleasant one for
Astros hitting instructor Tom McCraw, who watched his high-powered
offense get overpowered by Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to get his butt this time,'' McCraw said. ``He
dominated us pretty good that day, so I would imagine we'll be
running a few decibels higher this time. It will be interesting to
see how he comes back from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys who have that surgery are never the same, but some
come back a little bit better than they were before. It remains to
be seen how Kerry is going to come back. We won't know that until
he's thrown into the wars. I'm sure he has some doubts, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Wood is certain of is that he won't take memories of
his signature game to the mound tonight before a sellout crowd at
the Friendly Confines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to forget who it was against,'' Wood said of the
20-strikeout game. ``But it's not going to be weighing on my mind,
and I'm not going to go out there and try to strike out guys. I'm
going to go out and get my outs and keep us close and try to give
us a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about expectations. I'm not big into that. I go
out and do my job and let everybody else make expectations. If
everybody else goes out and does their job, then we won't have any
problems.''

 ONLINE AUCTIONS OF ELIAN ITEMS, BUT BIDDING HALTED ON RAFT  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Elian saga continues _ on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose online auctioneer halted bidding Monday afternoon
for what was claimed to be the actual raft used by Elian Gonzalez
and his mother in their ill-fated crossing from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But bidding continued for what was listed as genuine holy water
blessed by a priest in Miami's Little Havana as well as for a
Frisbee that Elian reportedly dropped by accident outside the gate
to his great-uncle's home.
</P>
<P>
   In this latter case, a minimum bid of $3.50 was requested by the
seller. No offers were made.
</P>
<P>
   More than 125 Elian-related items remained up for auction. These
were mostly mementos and trinkets from protesters selling for a few
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gross thing that everything becomes so commercialized,
including the plight of this child,'' said Richard Becker, San
Francisco coordinator for the National Committee to Send Elian Home
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 100 bids received for the raft, the highest was
$10 million. But Henry Gomez, an eBay spokesman, said the bid was
subsequently retracted, leaving the highest standing bid at $1.5
million when the proceedings came to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the right to take down any auction,'' Gomez said.
``We were concerned about this item in particular. It was
attracting a lot of high bids.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay also halted bidding Monday for a tennis ball that Elian
supposedly had played with as well as for what was claimed to be an
actual jar of air from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami
where he had been staying.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said eBay had contacted the seller of the raft at his home
in New Jersey and asked for some sort of proof that it was indeed
the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't able to offer anything,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   An 800 number included with the listing was not operational.
</P>
<P>
   The raft was first placed up for auction Thursday. The listing
was accompanied by a pair of color photographs showing a wooden
platform covered with straw, with an automobile tire at one end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raft is still in the Govt. warehouse where I purchased
it, but it will be cleared for release on June 1st,'' the seller
said in a description of the item. ``I have all necessary papers
for export if it is needed in another country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a genuine piece of American history,'' the description
continued. ``The high bidder will become the owner of the most
desirable piece of memorabilia from the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The seller added that he already had been approached by
``several historical societies,'' and that the raft ``is sure to be
a big money maker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds about as credible as the Shroud of Turin,'' said
Becker of the Send Elian Home committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that this is going on,'' he said. ``But it's
not surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, eBay has evolved into a reliable barometer of public
interest in current events. From Beanie Babies to ``Star Wars''
collectibles, whatever catches the public's fancy in any given week
will almost surely be reflected in a slew of related items for
auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the fun of the site,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, though, more eclectic items _ real and fake _ will
pop up. In the past, these have included listings for human organs,
babies and Nazi artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said eBay will continue scrutinizing Elian-related items
on a case-by-case basis.

GUIDELINES ISSUED FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER DIAGNOSIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Hoping to quell some of the controversy surrounding the use of
psychiatric medications in children, the nation's largest
pediatrics group issued Monday the first detailed guidelines for
diagnosing attention deficit disorder.
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 55,000 members,
said the new guidelines are intended to give doctors a clear,
scientific framework to tell the difference between a child who is
seriously ill and one whose problems may require no medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations apply to schoolchildren between ages 6 and
12. Two years in the making, the guidelines appear in the May issue
of Pediatrics, the academy's scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   Couched in the precise language of clinical practice, the
voluntary guidelines urge doctors to avoid making any formal
diagnosis of ADD, also known as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, or ADHD, unless ``core symptoms'' occur both at home and
at school.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms must significantly impair school performance, family
functioning or social development over at least a six-month period
to fit the criteria of a bona fide psychiatric disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms are often difficult to distinguish from the normal
rambunctiousness of a particularly active youngster, a problem made
all the more difficult by the varying attitudes of parents,
teachers and other caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, children are being prescribed medications
to calm them down, typically Ritalin, a mild stimulant, despite the
lack of uniform diagnostic criteria. The use of Ritalin-type
pediatric drugs has increased dramatically during the past decade,
the pediatricians noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' group is working on a second set of parameters to
guide treatment and medication decisions after the initial
diagnosis has been made.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment recommendations are not expected to be ready for
publication until early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Working out a consensus on treatment of ADHD may well be the
more formidable task for the doctors' group. Some physicians are
loathe to prescribe psychiatric drugs to children under nearly any
circumstances, while others maintain the drugs are entirely
appropriate when used correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sometimes explosive sentiments surrounding the issue,
Dr. Martin T. Stein, a San Diego pediatrician and co-chair of the
academy committee that produced the recommendations, urged a
careful, step-by-step approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get the diagnosis right, the proper course of
treatment will follow,'' he said. ``But it's very important that
the first step is being rigorous about the diagnostic criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, neither he nor the pediatric academy is taking a
position on whether drugs are being overused _ or even if ADHD is
being over-diagnosed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Practices appear to vary in different regions of the country,
and often from one doctor's office to the next, Stein noted, adding
that there's no clear evidence on which to base an overall
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think it's over-diagnosed, but in some parts of
the country, it may be under-diagnosed. We don't have the data to
really answer the question, but I suspect it probably goes a bit
both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Survey results suggest about 8 to 10 percent of schoolchildren
have ADHD symptoms. For the U.S. population as a whole, including
adults, the prevalance of ``behaviors consistent with ADHD'' runs
about 9 percent of males and 3 percent of females, the physicians
said.
</P>
<P>
   The academy noted that brain scans and other high-tech
diagnostic tools for ADHD are being investigated, but so far do not
yield reliable enough results to replace the careful judgment of a
clinician.
</P>
<P>
   One key difference between normal childlike behavior that adults
find difficult and a psychiatric syndrome that needs medical
attention is whether the behavior lasts a long time and severely
affects development.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also were urged to devise ways to draw the relevant
details about the child's behavior from caregivers, because the
child's behavior in the relative calm of a doctor's office may
provide few clues as to what is going on at home or school.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three visits may be needed over the course of six months
for the diagnosis to be made properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough for a child just to have these behaviors,''
Stein said. ``The behaviors have to persist.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are intended to prevent snap judgments by
doctors under pressure who provide medications to satisfy parents
at wit's end, desperate to try anything for a child who may need
much more time-consuming types of attention, &LR;  such as counseling or
special schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Reiff, a behavioral-developmental pediatrician at
Kaiser Permanente's San Francisco medical center, said the new
guidelines leave out a lot of key details, such as how doctors
should best gather diagnostic information.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the detailed recommendations should help by
giving clinicians ``ammunition'' to fend off pressure to scribble
out a scrip against their better judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors face this incredible pressure from parents who come in
saying, `Can't we just try the medication and see if it helps?' ''
he said. ``This will help. Now it's down on paper. We really need
to step back and think about this and get some information in a
more cogent way, a slower, more deliberate way.''

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Nearly 40 years after he was kicked off one campus, Richard Alpert
is back among the college crowd, still on a mission to expand the
minds of undergraduates.
<P>
   Alpert, better known in recent decades as Ram Dass, burst onto
the national scene in May 1963, when the 32-year-old psychology
professor was fired from his post at Harvard University. He and his
research assistant, the late Timothy Leary, had been conducting
consciousness-expansion experiments, dispensing psychedelic drugs
to college students.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass went on to become one of the leading lights of the '60s
and '70s, traveling to India and returning as Baba Ram Dass,
pushing enlightenment through meditation, rather than
hallucination. In the '80s and '90s, the quick-witted guru devoted
much of his time encouraging spiritual seekers to do charity work
and help promote social justice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 69 and still recovering from a stroke he suffered in
the spring of 1997, Ram Dass is back on San Francisco Bay Area
campuses in a program called ``Creating Our Future,'' a series of
meditations and conversations on spirituality and social change.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the author of ``Be Here Now,'' a 1971
counterculture classic, is about to release a new book, ``Still
Here _ Embracing Aging, Changing and Dying,'' to be published this
month by Riverhead Books.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass and his ``Creating Our Future'' partner, yoga teacher
Sat Santokh, hope to build on a recent burst of campus activism
spurred by the protests against the World Trade Organization in
Seattle and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have tremendous energy to put toward things, but
they don't have the skills,'' Ram Dass said in a recent interview.
``They keep spirit and social activism separate. A lot of social
action groups today have forgotten about compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass spoke from a wheelchair in the study of his Tiburon
home, surrounded by pictures of his Indian guru, Neem Haroli Baba,
and a picture window overlooking Richardson Bay. He remains
paralyzed on the right side of his body and still struggles to
express his thoughts in speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ... talking ... thing ... is ... fascinating,'' he says
slowly. ``It's like you have a room (in your brain) where your
concepts are clothed in words, and suddenly that room is destroyed.
You understand the concepts, but can't get the words. Most people
see my stroke as a negative thing, but from a meditative space,
observing that split is fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass and Sat Santokh hold their next college meeting May 15
at the Ananda Church Auditorium, just south of the Stanford
University campus. Two months ago, they attracted about 120
students to a similar discussion at the International House on the
University of California at Berkeley campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a resurgence of student activism since Seattle,''
said Sat Santokh, who in a previous incarnation helped manage the
Grateful Dead from 1967 to 1969. ``It's given students an idea that
they can do something about global issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Have today's undergraduates even heard of Ram Dass?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised how many knew me,'' he said. ``But they see me
as an icon, `the '60s icon.' They see the icon and they forget to
say hello. It's like there's a sheet of glass between you and
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass was asked what two-word label he prefers to '60s icon.
He paused for a long time, then replied, ``Consciousness
explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That pretty much covers it all,'' he said with a smile.

 MAYOR ZIPS HIS LIPS ON INDICTMENTS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five grand jury indictments were handed up last
week, accusations of heavy corruption in San Francisco's minority
contracting program, and we all know exactly where the mayor of San
Francisco stands.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. is angry! He is absolutely opposed to
the use of cell phones in public! He thinks it is rude and
uncivilized!
</P>
<P>
   As for those pesky indictments?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a legal proceeding, and it would be inappropriate at
this time to comment,'' Brown spokeswoman Kandace Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, this seems like a stunningly appropriate time to comment.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a marvelously appropriate time to hold a press
conference (no cell phones allowed! &LR; ) and actually give real
answers to hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more embarrassing than having a scandal like this
come down in your government is trying to make it go away by not
publicly addressing it.
</P>
<P>
   I WISH Willie was talking, because he might be the only one who
can sort out the 49ers' quarterback mess.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Da Mayor helped the team get rid of Elvis Grbac?
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers seem pretty sure they don't want Steve Young back.
They say they're worried about his health, with the concussions and
all, but cynics say the 49ers simply don't want to rebuild the team
around a very expensive and very old quarterback who has a glass
cranium.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve's had several months to make a decision on whether or
not to retire, but he's still scratching his head. Hope he'll read
defenses faster than that.
</P>
<P>
   This is becoming as painfully awkward as the wedding of Darva
and Rick.
</P>
<P>
   How does coach Steve Mariucci feel? On the air with Ralph and
Tom on KNBR, coach Mooch said, ``I don't want to stick my neck out
on a limb here...''
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound more like Willie Brown or Yogi Berra?
</P>
<P>
   I WILL BUNGEE-JUMP to conclusions here and say: Bring Steve
Young back for one more run at the Big Chalupa. Launch the New QB
Project next year. Tell Jeff Garcia, ``May we put you on hold?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, with NFL parity, even the 49ers will have a (distant) shot
at the Super Bowl, with Young.
</P>
<P>
   Young's big salary is a problem because of the salary cap, but
maybe he'll take a senior-citizen discount.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his elderly and fragile state, Young is a thrilling and
dangerous player. And imagine how inspired he will be this season
with his wife watching.
</P>
<P>
   ENEMY TERRORISTS sneaked into my column last week and planted a
typo. Superchef Jeremiah Tower left San Francisco for Manila in
1998, not 1988. Those old decades all look alike to me.
</P>
<P>
   PHONE RINGS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bill Jones from the Philip Morris Co., may I speak to
Michael Haworth?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking. What can I do for you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to ask you some survey questions, if I may.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My oldest son, daughter-in-law and I suffer from bronchitis.
My mother-in-law is dying from emphysema. All due to smoking, even
though we all quit long ago. My youngest son is currently addicted.
Now, what questions do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any questions. Thank you for your time.''
</P>
<P>
   SERIOUS wine fans (grape heads? cork sniffers?) are quietly
hoarding a Wine-Country secret.
</P>
<P>
   Many Napa Valley wineries are owned and run by people with kids.
The kids go to schools that raise money by auctioning donated
items. What these parents donate is cool wine and wine-related
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So at these little school auctions, amazing deals. Cult winery
issues, rare wines, insider tours, etc. At the May 13 auction for
St. Helena Elementary, for instance, you can bid on a magnum of '96
Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   I hate it when eagles scream, but it's for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   SURF'S WAY up: Steven Cannata saw an article in the Los Angeles
Times on the possibility of a tsunami hitting Santa Monica. The
article was accompanied by a list of helpful safety tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tip No. 2: Tsunamis are not surfable. They are not V-shaped or
curling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a challenge, dudes.

WAITING GAME FOR LEFTY PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers bought themselves at least
four weeks in deciding what to do with left-handed pitcher Carlos
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Under major-league rules, a player has the right to refuse an
assignment to the minor leagues once he accrues five years of
service time at the major-league level. Perez reaches that mark
Saturday, but he and the Dodgers agreed to extend the deadline
until May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who makes $5 million this season and is owed $7.5 million
next season, said he had no problem with the extension because he
believes he'll pitch well enough to remain with the Dodgers all
season. He's 2-1 with a 4.62 ERA, and his ERA is 3.07 in his last
three outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it not because the team asked me to do it but because I
have to do it,'' Perez said before Monday's game with Atlanta.
``They pay me to work and I have to pay them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said the players
association was aware of the agreement and won't question it,
particularly because it benefits the player.
</P>
<P>
   If Perez didn't agree to it, the Dodgers were prepared to send
him to Triple-A Albuquerque prior to Saturday's deadline, a team
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us more flexibility and it helps us, at least through
the month of May,'' Malone said. ``It's a nonissue right now
because of the way he's been pitching, so I think we'll deal with
it when it gets closer. Now, we have all of (May) to continue to
evaluate his progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez is scheduled to start Wednesday's series finale with the
Braves and pitch again May 9 in Arizona. But three off days in the
next two weeks make it so the Dodgers won't need a fifth starter
again until May 20, when Perez is tentatively scheduled to pitch in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If Perez falters, the Dodgers are prepared to send him to the
minor leagues and put right-hander Orel Hershiser in the starting
rotation. The possibility also exists that if Perez pitches well
into late May, he and the Dodgers could extend the agreement
longer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Spring-training funding: A bill that would allocate funding
to upgrade or acquire spring-training facilities in Florida,
particularly Dodgertown in Vero Beach, was passed by that state's
House of Representatives on Monday and is expected to breeze
through the Senate today.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which could produce $7 million of funding to keep the
Dodgers in Vero Beach, would then be placed on Gov. Jeb Bush's desk
Wednesday. Bush then has 30 days to sign the bill or veto it.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush signs off on the bill, it also strengthens the Dodgers'
bargaining position with Las Vegas, which is trying to lure several
teams for an extravagant spring-training complex.
</P>
<P>
   __ Off his Rocker: Atlanta closer John Rocker, whose insensitive
comments during the offseason offended nearly every walk of life,
was greeted with mixed reaction before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was booed by the few thousand fans in the ballpark about
45 minutes before the game, but when he walked to the bullpen
moments before the national anthem, the stadium was filled with
jeers and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Wanting to get the maximum amount of starts
out of Kevin Brown, the right-hander will start Friday's series
opener against Houston and push everyone back a day because of
Thursday's day off. That allows Brown to pitch the series finale
May 10 in Arizona. . . . The Dodgers got a scare during batting
practice when left fielder Gary Sheffield stepped on a ball near
the batting cage and collapsed. Sheffield turned his already
injured right ankle. He hobbled off the field but was in the
starting lineup for the 25th time in 25 games. . . . Lefty Onan
Masaoka might not be returning to Los Angeles any time soon.
Masaoka, sent to Triple-A Albuquerque to find his arm strength,
can't find the plate. He walked eight in his last outing and has 19
walks in 10 innings. . . . Johnson spoke to rehabbing right-hander
Antonio Osuna to let him know the Dodgers are thinking about him.
Osuna hasn't allowed a run in 4 innings with Albuquerque.

ON OPENING DAY OF TRIAL, EXAMINER PUBLISHERS ACKNOWLEDGES 
 `HORSETRADING'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ The publisher of the Examiner testified Monday
that he conveyed to Mayor Willie Brown his willingness to
``horsetrade'' favorable treatment in the Examiner's editorial
pages in exchange for the mayor's support of the Hearst
Corporation's purchase of The Chronicle.
<P>
   The revelation came in testimony by Timothy O. White, editor and
publisher of the Hearst-owned Examiner, and was used to show the
lengths to which the company was willing to go to defuse political
and legal opposition to The Chronicle deal.
</P>
<P>
   White was the lead-off witness in an unprecedented federal
antitrust trial challenging Hearst's proposed purchase of The
Chronicle and the acquisition of the Examiner by the Fang family,
publishers of the free, thrice-weekly Independent.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly,
claims that the Fang family's acquisition of the Examiner is a
``sham'' that is doomed to failure, which would leave San Francisco
with a single daily newspaper _ a Hearst-owned Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which is being heard by U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker, is the first to challenge an attempted dissolution of a
joint operating agreement, an exemption to federal antitrust law
that allows competing newspapers like The Chronicle and the
Examiner to share printing, advertising and distribution functions
but remain editorially independent.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, sought to show through
White's testimony and the introduction of confidential memos,
letters and e-mails that both The Chronicle and the Examiner are
currently profitable under the JOA and were planning to compete
head-to-head in 2005, when the JOA expires.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by White, who was questioned by Alioto for more
than three hours, was filled with colorful revelations about
backroom maneuvering at The Chronicle and Examiner and power plays
at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   White testified that he met Brown for lunch Aug. 30 _ several
weeks after the Chronicle sale to Hearst had been announced _ and
conveyed to the mayor that his support for the sale would result in
``more favorable treatment'' for the mayor in the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Brown) was beating up on us,'' White wrote in an e-mail
describing the meeting to Hearst executives in New York, ``it would
be difficult being out there championing (Brown's) initiatives like
muni and the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Alioto if he was ``horsetrading,'' White answered,
``Yes.'' But the publisher immediately qualified his answer, saying
that any favorable treatment would be in the Examiner's editorial
pages _ and not the paper's news pages.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail describing his lunch with the mayor to top Hearst
executives, White wrote: ``I asked him how I would justify to my
superiors in New York wanting to support him and cooperate with him
when he was seeming to go out of his way to make our lives
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Brown talked with White last year, he was running
for re-election as mayor against Reilly, a former political
consultant and wealthy San Francisco real estate investor.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner endorsed Brown for mayor. White testified, however,
that the endorsement was based solely on the candidates' merits and
not linked to The Chronicle deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hallings, the Hearst Corporation's attorney, argued in his
opening statement to Walker that Hearst can close the Examiner
because it is a failing newspaper. He said that without revenues
from the JOA, the Examiner would lose millions of dollars yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can shut it down,'' he said, under current antitrust law,
``or give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can certainly give it away with a subsidy,'' he said,
referring to Hearst's announcement in March that the corporation
would give the Fangs $66 million over three years to take over the
operation of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has admitted that it offered the Fangs the subsidy after
no one stepped forward last year to buy the Examiner and to satisfy
U.S. Department of Justice concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Alioto told Walker that Hearst knows that the Examiner will
fold after the subsidy runs out, leaving a Hearst-owned Chronicle
with a monopoly in San Francisco in violation of federal antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst corporation can not claim the Examiner is failing, he
said, because last year it took $23 million in profits out of the
JOA and is projecting profits of $25 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the Examiner and The Chronicle were preparing for
head-to head competition in 2005 when the JOA ends and that
antitrust laws require that such competition be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto questioned White closely about a number of internal
Hearst memos, e-mails and meetings early last year in which the
company told The Chronicle that it intended to shift the afternoon
Examiner to morning publication in 2005 _ or before _ and compete
directly with The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter dated March 13, 1999, a Hearst Corp. executive,
George Irish wrote that White was sent to San Francisco in January
with the job of assuring that the Examiner will be in a strong
position in 2005, adding that they would acquire the best people
and content to ``give us a sustainable, competitive edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In a March e-mail outlining the Hearst's ``strategic
initiatives'' for competing with The Chronicle, White wrote that
the goal was: ``Strengthen the Examiner's franchise prior to 2005
in every possible way. Use every medium available. Seek every
partnership/alliance and affiliation that will hasten and
strengthen Hearst's presence in the Bay Area. Continue to
communicate Hearst's commitment for the long haul to (Chronicle
Publishing Chief Operating Officer John) Sias and the Chronicle.''
</P>
<P>
   One document described ``talking points'' for a meeting that
White and Irish scheduled in April to discuss the future of the two
papers with Sias.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it is our intent to stay and publish, independent of
the (JOA),'' they planned to tell Sias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you telling the truth to Mr. Sias?'' Alioto asked.
</P>
<P>
   White answered that Alioto would have to ask Hearst
Corporation's Chief Executive Officer Frank Bennack. ``We wanted to
create that impression with Mr. Sias.''
</P>
<P>
   White conceded that he was assigned the role of coach to rally
the team at the Examiner and to try to hire the best columnists in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out here to get (the staff) to run down the field against
tackles and guards twice their size.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that many of the moves were meant to bring The Chronicle
to the bargaining table so Hearst could negotiate buying the paper.
</P>
<P>
   He said that because the Examiner was less than one-quarter the
Chronicle's size, it faced ``extinction'' when the JOA ended. He
called it the ``blowfish'' strategy, meaning that Hearst was trying
to puff up large enough to scare the family that owns The Chronicle
into selling the paper.
</P>
<P>
   White also described the crazy political minefield he was
stepping through to complete The Chronicle deal.
</P>
<P>
   In August, he said, he received a ``fairly bizarre'' phone call
from Warren Hinckle, a columnist for the Independent. Hinckle put
on Jack Davis, the controversial and flamboyant political
strategist for Mayor Brown and a close friend of the Fang family.
</P>
<P>
   White quoted Davis as saying: ``I'll bet before this is over
there will be a lawsuit from an advertiser, a lawsuit from a
subscriber, and a lawsuit from a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   White said he didn't recall feeling threatened, although in
later testimony he described it as a ``thinly veiled threat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disjointed, from a noisy bar in the background. It was
kind of hard to paste it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   White is scheduled for cross-examination when the trial resumes
at the Federal Building in San Francisco Tuesday. &LR;

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (Undated) _ Two members of Congress were back
in Washington Monday after one of the most expensive lobbying
efforts ever undertaken by the Clinton administration, if measured
on a per-vote basis. Hoping to sway legislators who remain
undecided on whether to grant China permanent normal trade
relations, President Clinton set aside funds earlier this year to
fly wavering lawmakers to China where they could gauge trade and
human rights conditions for themselves. But when the group left
last week, there were only two undecided congressmen. So began the

Russian troops tried to take the capital, Grozny, Chechen rebels
had begun on Jan. 31 to fight their way out. Now hundreds of
bloodied militants were waiting for treatment in Baiyev's village
southwest of Grozny. They included Shamil Basayev, the most
notorious of the Chechen warlords, who was wounded as he led his
fighters through a Russian minefield. After administering a local
anesthetic, Baiyev, a surgeon, amputated Basayev's right leg. And
soon after that, the rebels whisked their leader to safety in the
Caucasian mountains. Baiyev's life has not been the same since. By

This summer, Vural is scheduled to return to Ankara to take up a

   NY-POLLUTION-CREDITS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The New York state
legislature has passed a bill that would radically reduce the
amount of air pollution that has for years drifted from Midwestern
and Southern states into New York. The bill would bar New York
companies from selling pollution credits they earned by cleaning up
their own smokestacks to polluters in other states. The legislation
directly challenges the 1990 Clean Air Act, which set up a
marketplace in which companies could trade the right to pollute in
the form of credits, as a commodity. Gov. George Pataki is expected
to sign the measure, which would make New York the first state to
ban these exchanges. By Raymond Hernandez.

   DETROIT-CENSUS (Detroit) _ For a decade, Detroit has feared that
it could become the first American city of more than 1 million
people to have its population fall below that number. The city,
long dogged by its image as a rusting auto giant, barely made it
over the million marker in 1990, and then only after a recount.
Staying at a million is a point of pride. Census anxiety runs so

   NY-LEVY-SCHOOLS (New York) _ If the school system's top

accountable, now he wants them to be more thoughtful, too. Music
and poetry are among the more esoteric parts of his plan to raise
the internal level of debate on education policy, he says. That
means focusing less on administrative minutiae, and adding
intellectual rigor to the often tedious board meetings. Some board
members are not thrilled. By Abby Goodnough.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH-DEVELOP (Pittsburgh) _ For this city's strong-willed
mayor, 61 old downtown buildings and 125 merchants in them are
standing in the way of the downtrodden area's renewal and should be
torn down. But the National Trust calls his plan `the most
wrongheaded revitalization proposal to appear anywhere in this
country in the last 30 years.'' In these economic boom times, many
downtowns are undergoing revitalization, but none are creating as
big a political fight. By Francis X. Clines.

   DISNEY-TIMEWARNER (Undated) _ Millions of television viewers
found themselves without access to ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and many other popular television programs Monday as
the country's two biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt
Disney, fought over the cable television rights to stations owned
by Disney's ABC network. The dispute has its roots in an argument
over how much money Disney should receive for carrying its channels
on Time Warner's cable systems, but it involves larger issues
dealing with the distribution of media content _ including the
longstanding antipathy between the cable and broadcast industry,
the growing competition between cable and satellite companies and
Disney's opposition to the proposed merger between America Online
and Time Warner. It also concerns how much power the new company
will wield in a television industry that is merged with the
Internet. By Bill Carter.

ANGRY VIEWERS MISS SHOWS DUE TO DISNEY-TIME WARNER DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>

(EDITORS: Los Angeles Daily News Staff Writer David Kronke
contributed to this story.) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About 350,000 homes in the Los Angeles area lost
their ABC and local KABC programming Monday in the Disney-vs.-Time
Warner dispute, missing out on the second part of ``Arabian
Nights,'' the celebrity studded ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire''
and other popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the west San Fernando Valley, about 120,000 subscribers were
affected by the blackout that comes just a few days into the highly
competitive -- and commercially critical -- May ratings sweeps
period. Another 20,000 were affected in Canyon Country.
</P>
<P>
   While frustrated viewers blamed both companies, executives and
attorneys for two of the most powerful companies in the
entertainment industry blamed each other while developing legal and
public relations strategies.
</P>
<P>
   No one from either camp was willing to predict how long the
standoff might continue. But it appeared likely to be protracted
since both the Disney-owned KABC (Channel 7) and Time Warner cable
system planned end runs to get the network signal back into homes.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Wednesday, KABC will offer free DirecTV satellite
dishes and installation to all Time Warner subscribers in its
viewing area ``so they can get off Time Warner forever,'' said
Arnold J. Kleiner, the affiliate's president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   When the network's Houston affiliate made that offer last
February, 18,000 subscribers accepted. Details of the Los Angeles
rebate plan had yet to be ironed out late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   KABC also teamed with its sister radio station, 790 KABC-AM, in
a simulcast of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Monday and
tonight. Selected ABC programming will be available on the radio
station, as well as the TV station's Web site, www.kabc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, meanwhile, is offering free switches to customers
that will enable them to switch to an antenna to watch ABC
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The two media powerhouses have been mired in a nationwide
contract dispute since late last year over how much Time Warner
must pay for Disney's networks -- including ABC, owned affiliates
such as KABC and WABC in New York, ESPN and the Disney Channel --
and other terms. The existing agreement lapsed in December but had
been extended several times.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, ABC ran a message during prime time saying Time
Warner would continue to carry ABC programming through May 24 --
the end of sweeps -- while the issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner discontinued its ABC feed just after midnight
and put up a slate advising viewers that ``Disney-owned Channel 7
has pulled its programming off of Time Warner'' and, to further
insult its adversary, said it will be carrying C-SPAN2 in its
place.
</P>
<P>
   KABC's Kleiner said that statement is false.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling our viewers they need to call Time Warner to
complain,'' he said. ``Time Warner took us off and only Time Warner
can put us back on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Time Warner Communications spokesman Michael Luftman
blamed Disney, saying it would have been illegal for the cable
operator to continue to carry ABC without an agreement in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Angry or confused viewers who called KABC Monday were
transferred to a recorded message stating the network's position
and encouraging them to voice their complaints to Time Warner, the
nation's largest cable service. At Time Warner's Chatsworth office,
the customer service line was chronically busy. When calls did make
it through, they were passed to a recording and a long wait for the
chance to talk with a real person.
</P>
<P>
   William Croasdale, a veteran broadcast advertising buyer with
Western International Media, said, ``What happens will depend on
how ABC fares with the overnight ratings. If there is a marked
falloff in viewers, and most of them are in major metropolitan
areas, I think you'll see a quick settlement. If not, this thing
could drag out for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Miereanu, a travel agent and Time Warner subscriber who
lives in Woodland Hills, is one of the viewers who will affect
those numbers. ``We happen to be a Nielsen family, and it's
tough,'' she said. ``Boy, is it going to be skewed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had hopes of watching the celebrity ``Millionaire''
shows as well as the conclusion of ``Arabian Nights.'' She also
routinely watches KABC's ``Eyewitness News,'' ``20/20'' and ``Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just annoying that the consumer is being left in the
lurch, as usual,'' Miereanu said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney chief Michael Eisner was the target of Beth Locicero's
ire. The 47-year-old Northridge waitress was furious and vowed to
carry a sign through her neighborhood reading ``Boycott Disney.''
Locicero said she is annoyed about having to unplug her cable jack
and rehook her antenna to watch her favorite soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many senior citizens, how many children, how many people
in hospitals will have to crawl to the TV to get Channel 7?'' she
said.

GIANTS CRUSH METS, 10-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was the kind of inning the Mets fear with
Bill Pulsipher, the kind when the left-hander allows little
problems to morph into bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher was making his season debut with the Mets on Monday
night, joining the rotation until Bobby J. Jones can come back from
a calf strain. One reason the Mets promoted their former top
prospect was because he had shown better concentration in his
starts at Class AAA Norfolk; he could recover from adversity.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Francisco Giants beat Pulsipher on Monday night,
10-3, at the new Pacific Bell Park, and they did not have to try
too hard. Trailing 1-0 in the fourth inning, Pulsipher walked the
Giants' third and fourth hitters, Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. After
a sacrifice bunt and a run-scoring single, Pulsipher hit J.T. Snow
to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Estalella then singled in two runs, and as Pulsipher
returned to the mound after backing up the plate, catcher Todd
Pratt patted him, offering encouragement. Pulsipher stalked ahead,
without acknowledging it. The Giants starter Shawn Estes squared to
bunt, but Pulsipher walked him on four pitches, all of which missed
the strike zone badly.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Pulsipher, who allowed four runs on three hits
and four walks in three and one-third innings. He was making just
his second start for the Mets since 1995, a promising season that
ended when elbow problems shut him down. That was ominous for
Pulsipher, who was then 21 years old. He would miss most of the
next two seasons while attempting to come back from elbow surgery.
He made just one start for the Mets in 1998 before they traded him
to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher's counterpart, Estes, allowed two earned runs in seven
innings to beat the Mets for the fifth time in seven decisions. But
a impressive as he was, Giants fans will remember the game for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Rich Rodriguez in the sixth inning, the Giants star Barry
Bonds lofted a towering fly that landed in San Francisco Bay, 418
feet from home plate. It was the first ball hit into the water
outside Pacific Bell Park, and it touched off a celebration among
the 40,930 fans, who stood and screamed until Bonds popped from the
dugout, waving his arms to acknowledge the cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Figone, a groundskeeper at the Giants' former home, the
blustery 3Com Park, was the luckiest fan of all. Powering a dinghy
decorated with a Giants flag, Figone outraced a motorboat to the
ball, swooping the prize with a net as the boats bumped together.
Later, Figone raised a bottle of champagne, toasting his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That homer put the Giants up by 9-0, but the Mets had managed
some celebrating of their own before the game unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the third inning, center fielder Jay Payton
raced to his right in pursuit of a deep fly by Bill Mueller. In
front of the 382-foot sign in the left-center-field gap, Payton
leaped and stretched his glove just above that of a fan, his
shoulder crashing into the padded wall and he made the catch.
Payton then grabbed the ball with his right hand, holding it aloft
in excitement as he jogged from the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were playing the game with only one healthy catcher; to
make room for Pulsipher, they had optioned reserve catcher Vance
Wilson to Class AAA Norfolk. Mike Piazza, who hyperextended his
right elbow in a home plate collision on Friday, was still feeling
discomfort on Monday and was planning to begin throwing again on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had emergency options _ Matt Franco, Melvin Mora, Jon
Nunnally and Todd Zeile _ and for a moment it seemed they would
need one. With the bases loaded in the fourth, first baseman Zeile
fielded a grounder and fired it home to catcher Pratt, who was
touching home plate with his right foot for the force out.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, trying to score from third, slid hard into Pratt's knees,
knocking him off his feet for a hard landing on his backside. Pratt
got up and motioned toward Snow, barking at him, and the umpire
Mark Wegner quickly came between the players as both benches
emptied.
</P>
<P>
   But no punches were thrown and Pratt limped away from the fray.
He was examined by a trainer and stayed in, inviting heavy booing
from a crowd that has reason to be enthusiastic.

<P>
   The deal calls for Homestore.com to provide content for a
home-related channel to be created on America Online's service as
well as its other online properties, including AOL.com, CompuServe
and Netscape Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded favorably to the announcement, sending
Homestore.com's share prices up by more than 25 percent. The
company's stock closed Monday at $22.88 per share, an increase of
$4.63.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, America Online receives 3.9 million shares
of Homestore.com's stock, about 5 percent of Homestore.com's
outstanding shares. AOL also gets a guarantee the stock will meet
performance targets and $20 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the stock price guarantee, Homestore.com will secure
a $90 million letter of credit, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   What Homestore.com gets in return is prominent placement before
the eyes of America Online's 22 million subscribers by way of a
dedicated channel, one of 19 on AOL's service including CBS
Sportsline and Smartmoney.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Homestore.com's business is done via
partnerships with other businesses, the America Online deal stands
out, said Stuart Wolff, Homestore.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is about as big as you can get. They're very unique. We
don't expect to run around doing numerous deals of this
magnitude,'' Wolff said. ``When it comes to traffic, this is a very
strong deal from that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is an expansion of an earlier deal between
Homestore.com and America Online. In 1998, the two companies formed
a partnership under which Homestore.com provides some content for
AOL's properties.
</P>
<P>
   America Online chose Homestore.com to provide its real estate
content because of its leadership in the sector, Bob Pittman, AOL's
president and Chief Operating Officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having easy access to its property listings, services and
content will be a real benefit to our members and users of our
Web-based brands,'' Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Homestore.com's leadership has attracted the attention of the
U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which requested
information about the company's business practices as part of an
investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the
online real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said he does not expect the AOL deal to be affected by the
investigation. The company has done nothing wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the content Homestore.com will be providing on AOL are new
and existing home listings, apartment rentals and information about
moving, decorating and home and garden care, Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get programming for all of our different content areas,''
Wolff said. ``We'll create some unique content for them. Some of
the links will be directly to our site.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND, May1 _ Opportunity is running out for Shane Spencer,
like grains of sand plunging through an hourglass. He does not know
how much time he has left to show he can play, but he has been
around the Yankees long enough to know that any losing streak leads
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer is building credentials, however. His two-run double
produced the Yankees' runs as they edged Cleveland, 2-1, on Monday
night at Jacobs Field. Ramiro Mendoza disguised his lack of raw
stuff, deceiving the Indians for six innings before the Yankees'
bullpen took over in seventh. Rain delayed the start of the game
for 2 hours 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Adding another to their list of dramatic victories, the Yankees
escaped a two-on, no-out situation in the bottom of the ninth.
David Justice led off with a single and moved to third when Jim
Thome doubled into the right-field corner. With Alex Ramirez in as
a pinch-runner for Thome, Mariano Rivera struck out Richie Sexson
swinging for the first out.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman, who was 3 for 3, fell behind no balls and two
strikes before lining out to left field. Ramirez took off toward
third, assuming the ball would drop, and was doubled off second
when Spencer threw to Derek Jeter to give Rivera a very shaky
eighth save. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Indians loaded the bases against Jeff Nelson and Rivera in
the bottom of the eighth, but with two outs, Rivera retired Manny
Ramirez on a weak grounder; Ramirez is 0 for 10 in his career
against the Yankees' closer. The Yankees' bullpen has an earned run
average of just 1.44 over the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' record will go a long way toward determining how
much time Ricky Ledee and Spencer are given to prove themselves,
Manager Joe Torre said before Monday night's game. The Yankees have
won two-thirds of their 24 games, and although they have not played
all that well, they can afford to wait before determining what
trades they need to make to augment their roster for the final
months of the regular season and the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee's average is plummeting far below .200, a decline that is
resulting in a grimace on his face, his head hanging down.
Spencer's average has been hovering above .200, but he seems much
less bothered than Ledee does about the uncertainty of his
situation _ not surprising, one member of the organization
remarked, for Spencer spent almost a decade in the minors
overcoming the perception that he was not good enough to play in
the majors. There were several seasons in his career when he faced
the possibility of being released if he did not produce.
</P>
<P>
   Torre maintains that nothing has changed for Spencer and Ledee,
but there has been a subtle adjustment in how Torre is handling the
two. Ledee was the left fielder and Spencer the designated hitter
for much of the first month. But last week, Torre began using
Spencer in left and Ledee at designated hitter so that he would be
in a better position to counter a move if the opposing manager
called on a left-handed reliever to face Ledee late in games; this
way, Torre could use someone like Jim Leyritz to pinch-hit for
Ledee without worrying about who would play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   If Ledee were hitting the way he did at the end of spring
training, however, then Torre would not be pinch-hitting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Back to playing in the field, Spencer had two hits Sunday,
including a two-run homer, and on Monday night he propelled the
Yankees into the lead. Jaret Wright, nearly traded to San Diego for
Sterling Hitchcock on the eve of the season opener, had an
overpowering fastball, and he shut out the Yankees through four
innings, matching Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez lined a single leading off the fifth, however, and
Jorge Posada dumped a double down the left-field line and into the
corner, Martinez stopping at third. Wright challenged Spencer,
throwing a 98-mile-an-hour fastball that Spencer swung through to
make the count no balls and two strikes. Spencer fouled off a
fastball and two sliders as the count went to 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Wright tried another slider, a pitch that confounded Spencer
last year. Spencer pulled a grounder down the third-base line,
hesitating for a split second, thinking it might go foul. And this
is where the Yankees got a little lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman, the Cleveland third baseman, moved over to field the
ball as Martinez sprinted homeward, and Spencer's grounder hit the
base and bounced over Fryman's head. Martinez and Posada scored,
and Spencer rambled into second base, fortunate only because he had
given himself a chance with his persistent at-bat against Wright.

AUTHOR RAY BRADBURY TESTIFIES FOR HIS MENTOR
</HEADLINE>

By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If not for ``Dr. Acula,'' legendary science
fiction author Ray Bradbury testified Monday he might never have
penned such classics as ``The Martian Chronicles'' and ``Fahrenheit
451.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury said he was 17 when he met Forrest J. Ackerman -- later
known as ``Dr. Acula'' -- who invited him to join a group of
science fiction devotees at Clifton's Cafeteria in downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be sitting here today if I didn't meet him when I
was in high school in 1937. I was a man who was a writer but had no
place to go,'' Bradbury told the Van Nuys Superior Court jury.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent illness, Bradbury made his way by wheelchair
into the courtroom to testify on behalf of Ackerman, who is suing a
former employer for trademark infringement and defamation. The
civil suit centers on the cult magazine Famous Monsters of
Filmland, which Ackerman edited from 1958 to 1982, signing
editorials as ``Dr. Acula.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman seeks to defend his legacy as the real ``Dr. Acula,''
but the magazine's new owner, Ray Ferry of North Hills, has
insisted he owns all of the magazine's trademark phrases.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, Bradbury backed Ackerman's claim that he has
used the pen name ``Dr. Acula'' for some 60 years and is inexorably
linked to the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is it -- there's no one else in the world that represents
the totality of science fiction and fantasy,'' Bradbury said.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old author said he was surprised anyone would
challenge Ackerman's association with ``Dr. Acula,'' a play on
Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't dare -- I'd get after them,'' Bradbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury said he has long associated Ackerman with ``Dr. Acula''
because the two men have joked for decades over how to pronounce
it.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ackerman's claim that his battle with Ferry has damaged
his reputation, Bradbury said he has heard no feedback in the
industry about that.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury portrayed Ackerman as a tireless champion of all things
ghoulish, especially as caretaker of the world's largest collection
of science fiction and horror memorabilia, now at his Los Feliz
house.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury said he was a dirt-poor newspaperboy in 1937 when he
posted a note on the bulletin board of a Hollywood science fiction
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   To the amazement of the Los Angeles High School student,
Ackerman saw the note and wrote back, inviting him to Clifton's.
</P>
<P>
   The imagination-rich teen immediately went to work writing for
Ackerman and two years later, with Ackerman's financial backing,
launched his own magazine, Futuria Fantasia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped establish me among simple fans -- people who just
love writing,'' Bradbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Ackerman also acted as his literary agent. ``My
stories were not very good, but he tried his best and achieved some
success,'' Bradbury said.

ATLANTA ROCKS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers bolstered their offensive
numbers against Cincinnati and Florida, but until the powers of
balance change in the National League, the measuring stick is the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Dodgers' offense doesn't measure up well to the best
pitching staff of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   After getting shut down during a three-game sweep last week in
Atlanta, the Dodgers generated little offense in a 2-1 loss in the
opening of a three-game series Monday at Dodger Stadium, but the
28,790 in attendance let Braves closer John Rocker know exactly how
they felt.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker pitched the ninth inning for his sixth save and survived
a few scary incidents. On his run in from the bullpen, several fans
threw things at Rocker, just missing him.
</P>
<P>
   And with two outs in the ninth a fan ran onto the field, stopped
between first and second base, and gestured toward Rocker in a foul
manner. He was escorted away by security.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster then kept the game going by singling in Todd
Hundley to pull the Dodgers within 2-1. But Geronimo Berroa struck
out as Rocker recorded his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   It brought an end to the Dodgers' three-game winning streak
while Atlanta's won a club record 14 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   An offense that scored 25 runs in sweeping three games from
Florida over the weekend managed six singles against the Braves.
Kevin Millwood recorded the win, allowing five hits in seven
innings, and Rudy Seanez pitched a scoreless eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta got a third-inning homer from Quilvio Veras' to
right-center with one out. Other than that, Dodgers right-hander
Eric Gagne was brilliant in facing the Braves for the second time
in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's looking for his first win of the season to go against to
losses. He's allowed five homers in four starts. Gagne yielded four
hits, walked two and struck out six in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers reliever Matt Herges saw his streak of shutout ball
stopped at 15 innings when the Braves made it 2-0 in the top of the
eighth. Of course, Herges wasn't aided by the Dodgers defense.
</P>
<P>
   Veras led off the eighth with a single and should have been
erased on Andruw Jones' grounder to second. But Veras stopped
running so he wouldn't be tagged out by Mark Grudzielanek, who in
turn threw to first to get Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros' throw to second was late and Veras was safe.
Chipper Jones lined to short for the second out, but Herges looked
like he could get out of the inning when Andres Galarraga took a
close pitch with two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It was called a ball and Galarraga grounded a ball that Adrian
Beltre fielded deep behind third base. Karros couldn't handle
Beltre's errant throw, which bounced behind the bag and allowed
Veras to score. Beltre's team-leading eighth error allowed the run
to score. Herges pitched a perfect ninth and is yet to allow an
earned run in 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time in five days Millwood bested Gagne.
Millwood (3-0) allowed five hits and an unearned run in beating the
Dodgers last Wednesday in Atlanta. When the Dodgers were swept in
Atlanta, it came after a 1-0 loss to the Mets but on the heels of
scoring 36 runs in a three-game sweep of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum didn't carry over last time, and it certainly didn't
against Millwood this time, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had runners in scoring position in each of the first
four innings but couldn't deliver the hit to score a run. In the
first inning, Shawn Green was picked off first with Gary Sheffield
on third and two out. An inning later back-to-back one-out singles
by Todd Hundley and Adrian Beltre were wasted when Millwood struck
out Kevin Elster and Gagne.
</P>
<P>
   Veras, who drove in the lone run in the Braves' 1-0 win over the
Dodgers last Tuesday, gave the Braves a 1-0 lead in the top of the
third with his second homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was in trouble in the third inning again as
Grudzielanek singled with one out and Gary Sheffield walked, but
Green struck out and Karros flied out to center to end the inning.
It was the beginning of string in which Millwood retired 10
consecutive batters. He didn't allow another hit.

<P>
   The deal calls for Homestore.com to provide content for a
home-related channel to be created on America Online's service as
well as its other online properties, including AOL.com, CompuServe
and Netscape Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded favorably to the announcement, sending
Homestore.com's share prices up by more than 25 percent. The
company's stock closed Monday at $22.88 per share, an increase of
$4.63.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, America Online receives 3.9 million shares
of Homestore.com's stock, about 5 percent of Homestore.com's
outstanding shares. AOL also gets a guarantee the stock will meet
performance targets and $20 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the stock price guarantee, Homestore.com will secure
a $90 million letter of credit, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   What Homestore.com gets in return is prominent placement before
the eyes of America Online's 22 million subscribers by way of a
dedicated channel, one of 19 on AOL's service including CBS
Sportsline and Smartmoney.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Homestore.com's business is done via
partnerships with other businesses, the America Online deal stands
out, said Stuart Wolff, Homestore.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is about as big as you can get. They're very unique. We
don't expect to run around doing numerous deals of this
magnitude,'' Wolff said. ``When it comes to traffic, this is a very
strong deal from that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is an expansion of an earlier deal between
Homestore.com and America Online. In 1998, the two companies formed
a partnership under which Homestore.com provides some content for
AOL's properties.
</P>
<P>
   America Online chose Homestore.com to provide its real estate
content because of its leadership in the sector, Bob Pittman, AOL's
president and Chief Operating Officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having easy access to its property listings, services and
content will be a real benefit to our members and users of our
Web-based brands,'' Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Homestore.com's leadership has attracted the attention of the
U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which requested
information about the company's business practices as part of an
investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the
online real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said he does not expect the AOL deal to be affected by the
investigation. The company has done nothing wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the content Homestore.com will be providing on AOL are new
and existing home listings, apartment rentals and information about
moving, decorating and home and garden care, Wolff said.
</P>
<P>

Wolff said. ``We'll create some unique content for them. Some of

AVENGERS REMAIN WINLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a school of thought that expansion teams
can immediately be competitive in the Arena Football League. So
far, the Los Angeles Avengers are doing nothing to bolster that
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   They remained winless Monday night after losing to the Oklahoma
Wranglers 59-33 before 9,160 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not quite ready to admit it's impossible to become a
team capable of being in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not far off,'' quarterback Scott Semptimphelter said.
``We're just struggling. It's a very long season. We need to find a
niche and come together.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes L.A. 0-3 to open the season, and loss No. 4 appears
just a few days away when the Avengers play Friday at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly the showing Avengers coach Stan Brock wanted,
especially since he coached the Wranglers last season, when they
were in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Brock took a longer-than-usual amount of time in the locker room
after the game to give the Avengers his take on the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things going on in the players' minds,''
Brock said. ``They have to go back to work. It's just a matter of
getting everyone to play together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played against a very good football team with some guys
that haven't seen any arena football. I'm not making excuses. We'll
learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers cured the turnover problem from their previous
game, but their kicking woes continued, as Kyle Pooler missed three
field goals. He also failed to convert an extra point because of a
bad snap.
</P>
<P>
   Wranglers quarterback Ron Lopez, who played for Pierce and
Glendale colleges before attending Utah State, completed 21 of 33
passes for 258 yards and six touchdowns. Semptimphelter completed
17 of 37 passes for 210 yards, three touchdowns and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (3-0) broke the game open in the third quarter, taking
a 42-19 lead on an 18-yard pass from Lopez to Barry Dillard. The
Avengers finally added a touchdown with 2:40 left as Semptimphelter
found Chris Jackson on a 34-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to
42-26, but L.A. never got closer.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was fairly close until the Wranglers made a late
run in the final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers trailed by five points (21-16) when Semptimphelter
flipped a 1-yard pass to Larry Thompson. But Oklahoma immediately
responded as Lopez hit Bobby McGowens on a 7-yard pass to give the
Wranglers a 28-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Wranglers added a touchdown with three seconds left as Lopez
connected on a 17-yard pass to Melvin Phillips and a 35-16 lead.
Pooler hit a 47-yard field goal at the buzzer to cut Oklahoma's
halftime lead to 35-19.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Quarterback Todd Marinovich, charged last week for
felony sexual assault, was not part of the active roster for the
game. Marinovich had been the backup quarterback fOcjQhe Avengers'
first three game. Quarterback Harry Leons was activated for the
first time this season. Marinovich attended the game in street
clothes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The deal calls for Homestore.com to provide content for a
home-related channel to be created on America Online's service as
well as its other online properties, including AOL.com, CompuServe
and Netscape Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded favorably to the announcement, sending
Homestore.com's share prices up by more than 25 percent. The
company's stock closed Monday at $22.88 per share, an increase of
$4.63.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, America Online receives 3.9 million shares
of Homestore.com's stock, about 5 percent of Homestore.com's
outstanding shares. AOL also gets a guarantee the stock will meet
performance targets and $20 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the stock price guarantee, Homestore.com will secure
a $90 million letter of credit, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   What Homestore.com gets in return is prominent placement before
the eyes of America Online's 22 million subscribers by way of a
dedicated channel, one of 19 on AOL's service including CBS
Sportsline and Smartmoney.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Homestore.com's business is done via
partnerships with other businesses, the America Online deal stands
out, said Stuart Wolff, Homestore.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is about as big as you can get. They're very unique. We
don't expect to run around doing numerous deals of this
magnitude,'' Wolff said. ``When it comes to traffic, this is a very
strong deal from that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is an expansion of an earlier deal between
Homestore.com and America Online. In 1998, the two companies formed
a partnership under which Homestore.com provides some content for
AOL's properties.
</P>
<P>
   America Online chose Homestore.com to provide its real estate
content because of its leadership in the sector, Bob Pittman, AOL's
president and Chief Operating Officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having easy access to its property listings, services and
content will be a real benefit to our members and users of our
Web-based brands,'' Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Homestore.com's leadership has attracted the attention of the
U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which requested
information about the company's business practices as part of an
investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the
online real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said he does not expect the AOL deal to be affected by the
investigation. The company has done nothing wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the content Homestore.com will be providing on AOL are new
and existing home listings, apartment rentals and information about
moving, decorating and home and garden care, Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get programming for all of our different content areas,''
Wolff said. ``We'll create some unique content for them. Some of
the links will be directly to our site.''

ACTORS MARCH ON AD FIRMS TO PRESS FOR PAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of what could become known as the
summer of strikes in Los Angeles, about 2,000 actors from the
nation's two largest entertainment unions rallied Monday with
demands for more money in advertisement roles.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying signs reading ``It Pays to Advertise, But Advertisers
Don't Pay,'' and ``Advertisers ... Making Millions But Paying
Pennies,'' actors marched down Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle
Mile area past the headquarters of several large advertising firms.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers include members of the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Television &AMP; Radio Artists, representing
about 135,000 actors nationwide, half of whom live in the Los
Angeles area. Actors in San Francisco, Chicago and New York also
went on strike Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The SAG/AFTRA action comes just a week after a contract deal
ended the three-week strike of 8,500 Los Angeles janitors. Another
250,000 workers, including teachers, bus drivers and police
officers, are preparing for labor talks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Actor William Daniels, the winner of five Emmys for his role on
the TV show ``St. Elsewhere,'' said the actors are prepared to stop
performing and auditioning for commercials until a new three-year
contract is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think all actors make millions of dollars,''
he said. ``But many commercial actors today are making less than
(television) actors in the 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the negotiations is whether actors should receive
residual payments each time a commercial is aired on cable
television in the same manner as network ads have paid since the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   For broadcast commercials, actors now get nearly $500 the first
time an ad is aired, roughly $120 the second time, and less each
time thereafter, which can add up to thousands of dollars. For
cable, actors get a flat fee, ranging anywhere from $500 to $1,000,
which allows advertisers to air the work as many times as they
choose during 13-week airing cycles.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the cable market has grown swiftly, capturing
40 percent of television viewers in 1997, up from 15 percent in
1987, according to Nielson Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   John McGuinn, a lead negotiator representing advertisers
nationwide, said the industry wants to pay actors a flat fee for
both broadcast and cable commercials because the market has changed
since residuals were first put into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The per-use plan started in the 1950s, when the three major
networks controlled the entire audience,'' he said. ``It's much
more expensive now because we have to show commercials in many
markets to reach that audience today.''
</P>
<P>
   He said commercial production would continue through the strike,
because ``we have plenty of ads in the can'' to use, and there is
an expectation that ``thousands of actors out there'' are willing
to cross picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Contract negotiations, which began on Feb. 14, broke off April
14 and the union voted to strike four days later. There is no date
to resume formal talks.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues at stake include developing a regulated system for
keeping track of when and where commercials air.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Edward Asner, a former SAG president, said the labor
action, SAG's first in 12 years, was a show of new union strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pay issues need to be corrected, especially in this time
of a booming economy,'' said Asner, best known for his portrayal of
a gruff newsman on TV's ``Mary Tyler Moore'' and ``Lou Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, SAG and AFTRA went on strike for three weeks following
a dispute with the advertisement industry.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer for the Los Angeles County
Federation of Labor, marched with the striking actors. He said
increased job actions can be expected in coming weeks as
negotiations in other labor sectors get under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment of workers in Los Angeles is the strongest in
many years, he said. ``We'll have several multiunion demonstrations
in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreras said the Teamsters had also vowed not to cross
SAG/AFTRA picket lines, which could snarl advertising production.
</P>
<P>
   On the picket line, striking actors said they were prepared for
a prolonged action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residuals can make a huge difference in your life if you're
doing hundreds of auditions just to get one job,'' said Brian
Mulligan of the Mid-Wilshire area.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 60 to 70 percent of many of our total incomes are from
commercials on TV and radio,'' said actor Ray Chang. ``We do the
work that makes millions for advertisers; we should get a fair
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Total income for SAG members in 1998 was $1.6 billion, of which
$600 million came from commercial productions, according to union
spokesman Greg Krizman.

   The deal calls for Homestore.com to provide content for a
home-related channel to be created on America Online's service as
well as its other online properties, including AOL.com, CompuServe
and Netscape Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded favorably to the announcement, sending
Homestore.com's share prices up by more than 25 percent. The
company's stock closed Monday at $22.88 per share, an increase of
$4.63.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, America Online receives 3.9 million shares
of Homestore.com's stock, about 5 percent of Homestore.com's
outstanding shares. AOL also gets a guarantee the stock will meet
performance targets and $20 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the stock price guarantee, Homestore.com will secure
a $90 million letter of credit, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   What Homestore.com gets in return is prominent placement before
the eyes of America Online's 22 million subscribers by way of a
dedicated channel, one of 19 on AOL's service including CBS
Sportsline and Smartmoney.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Homestore.com's business is done via
partnerships with other businesses, the America Online deal stands
out, said Stuart Wolff, Homestore.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is about as big as you can get. They're very unique. We
don't expect to run around doing numerous deals of this
magnitude,'' Wolff said. ``When it comes to traffic, this is a very
strong deal from that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is an expansion of an earlier deal between
Homestore.com and America Online. In 1998, the two companies formed
a partnership under which Homestore.com provides some content for
AOL's properties.
</P>
<P>
   America Online chose Homestore.com to provide its real estate
content because of its leadership in the sector, Bob Pittman, AOL's
president and Chief Operating Officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having easy access to its property listings, services and
content will be a real benefit to our members and users of our
Web-based brands,'' Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Homestore.com's leadership has attracted the attention of the
U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which requested
information about the company's business practices as part of an
investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the
online real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said he does not expect the AOL deal to be affected by the
investigation. The company has done nothing wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the content Homestore.com will be providing on AOL are new
and existing home listings, apartment rentals and information about
moving, decorating and home and garden care, Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get programming for all of our different content areas,''
Wolff said. ``We'll create some unique content for them. Some of
the links will be directly to our site.''

ATLANTA ROCKS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was almost as if the Los Angeles Dodgers and
the 28,790 fans at Chavez Ravine were waiting for the same thing:
They wanted a piece of Atlanta's John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Both came close. Rocker is learning life on the road is much
different than being cheered at home.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker survived robust boos, several objects thrown his way, a
fan who ran on the field and a late rally by the Dodgers as the
Braves won a club record 14th in a row with a 2-1 victory Monday in
the opener of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the fans who booed Rocker _ some even threw
objects at the controversial reliever as he ran on the field _ was
everything baseball fears. Not only did it take away from a
brilliant game, but it put everyone on the field in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Braves third baseman Chipper Jones felt the brunt of that. He
was nearly hit by debris that was thrown on the field during a wild
scene in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not funny jeopardizing someone's health,'' Jones said.
``It startled me. It was that close. It looked like banana pudding,
or paint or something. I wouldn't expect it anywhere. It's one
thing to boo and voice your displeasure, it's another thing to
throw stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem began the instant Rocker charged in from the right
field bullpen to take the mound and protect a 2-0 lead to begin the
bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley drew a one-out walk and moved to
second with two outs. And with a 1-1 count to Kevin Elster, a fan
ran on the field, stopped between first and second base and mooned
Rocker before he was tackled by security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Elster followed with a single to center to pull the Dodgers
within 2-1. Rocker struck out Geronimo Berroa to end the game and
get his sixth save. In keeping with his tradition, Rocker elected
not to talk afterward, instead leaving his teammates to answer the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it takes a pretty big coward to throw something from
the stands,'' said Atlanta's Kevin Millwood, who allowed five hits
in seven shutout innings for his third win. ``Obviously, people
don't get many chances to stand in front of someone to tell them
what you think, but throwing things is not the right way to handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It overshadowed a well-pitched game in which Dodgers rookie Eric
Gagne allowed only a third-inning homer to Quilvio Veras in seven
innings and in which Millwood allowed five hits in seven innings
for his second consecutive win against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodgers offense that scored 25 runs in sweeping three games
from Florida over the weekend managed six singles against the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers reliever Matt Herges saw his streak of shutout ball
stopped at 15 innings when the Braves made it 2-0 in the top of the
eighth. Of course, Herges wasn't aided by the Dodgers defense.
</P>
<P>
   Veras led off the eighth with a single and should have been
erased on Andruw Jones' grounder to second. But Veras stopped
running so he wouldn't be tagged out by Mark Grudzielanek, who in
turn threw to first to get Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros' throw to second was late and Veras was safe.
Chipper Jones lined to short for the second out, but Herges looked
like he could get out of the inning when Andres Galarraga took a
close pitch with two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was called a ball and Galarraga grounded a ball that
Adrian Beltre fielded deep behind third base. Karros couldn't
handle Beltre's errant throw, which bounded behind the bag and
allowed Veras to score. Beltre's team-leading eighth error allowed
the run to score. Herges pitched a perfect ninth and is yet to
allow an earned run in 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should still be out there playing,'' Hundley said. ``That
pitch was right there. It was right over the middle. It was strike
three. God, that was a strike.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I have been with this company for two
years, and there have been several new openings that I have wanted,
but each time they have gone to someone else. My manager has told
me that I'm in line for one, but I am never picked. He keeps
repeating some old saying about how patience is a virtue. What can
you suggest? J.B.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: You need patience just to be around a manager who deals
in old sayings. And worse, many of these sayings are not even true.
After all, patience may be a virtue, but he who hesitates is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Since your manager is selecting old sayings for you while
selecting other people for new opportunities, you need to take more
direct action. In the first place, be sure that he has a clear
understanding of your objectives. Secondly, provide him with
updated information regarding your skills, training, and
experience. And be assertive and persistent the next time that he
indicates that you are under consideration for a position that you
want.
</P>
<P>
   Another step that can help in this situation is to ask him
precisely what you need to do in order to have a real chance of
being selected for a particular opportunity. Then try to follow his
advice as closely as possible, and let him know that you are doing
so. Since he established the criteria for you to meet for the
position, and since you have met the criteria, it will be more
difficult for him to give the position to someone else. If you
start to hear about the virtues of patience again, perhaps you
should put this company out of sight, out of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My boss made a condescending and patronizing statements which
escalated to yelling and screaming, which escalated to kicking
boxes out the door and punching them. The boss said that employers
can treat employees any way they want and employee relations have
nothing to do with it. I quit the next day. I don't know about you
or anybody else, but I certainly did not want to stay in that kind
of environment. F.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are seeking validation for your decision to leave a
hostile, threatening, intimidating and insulting work environment,
you came to the right place. Your boss's understanding of
management, leadership, motivation, and human relations is clearly
in negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   His comment about human relations is particularly troubling, not
only for the employees who report to him, but for the company at
large. Bosses who ignore human relations are also ignoring such
issues as employee satisfaction, commitment, and productivity. And
further, they ignore the possibility of legal action as a result of
their outrageous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One question regarding your decision to leave is whether you
made any attempt to approach your boss's boss. However, even if you
did so, it is not all that uncommon to find that abusive bosses
often report to abusive bosses, and even learn their ``skills''
from them.
</P>
<P>
   A second question is whether you left in a huff or lined up a
more attractive opportunity before exiting. Either way, it will be
very important to screen your next employer very carefully in order
to reduce the chances of hitching up with another mule.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our former supervisor gave us a lot of freedom because he
knew that when things got busy, the job always got done. We have a
new supervisor who is always walking around assigning frivolous
tasks to people who don't appear to be engrossed in some project.
Is there something we could say to him without jeopardizing our
jobs? J.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although you are concerned with your supervisor's fixation on
making your office resemble Santa's workshop, the larger issue is
that you are afraid to talk to him. There can be any number of
reasons for his busy-work approach to work, but it sounds like he
has not created a work environment that is open, communicative, and
mutually respectful, and that is a more serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for his heightened emphasis on keeping the troops
busy can be based on any number of factors. For example, perhaps
management informed him at the outset that he is replacing an
overly lax supervisor whose employees have too much freedom and
power. Or, he may simply be an over-controlling and untrusting
leader.
</P>
<P>
   You and your associates should discuss the situation with him
and present documentation proving that your department is more
energized, motivated, and productive with more flexible
supervision. Be sure to let him see the amount of time that he can
save by such an approach as well. If he truly senses that he can
win by being more flexible, there is a chance you will win too.

NEW REPORT SHOWS RACISM IN JUVENILE JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (Editor's note: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, received awards from the National
Council on Crime and Delinquency in 1998 and 1999.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across this nation, race plays a major role in who's locked up
in juvenile detention centers and for how long. If a teen-ager
belongs to a racial or ethnic minority, he has a much greater
chance of spending time in a detention center or adult prison than
his white counterpart, according to a new report released on April
25.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD), the
nation's oldest criminal justice think tank, prepared the report
for a group of organizations affiliated under the name Building
Blocks for Youth. These organizations include the Youth Law Center,
the Juvenile Law Center, the Justice Policy Institute and the
American Bar Association's Juvenile Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``And Justice for Some: Differential Treatment of
Minority Youth in the Justice System,'' presents a devastating
picture of how racial prejudice at every level of the juvenile
justice system weighs against minority youth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, when white and minority teen-agers with
no prior arrests are charged with the same offenses, blacks are six
times more likely to be incarcerated in public facilities than
whites. And although the figures are somewhat muddy because those
with Hispanic backgrounds are often not listed by ethnicity, Latino
teens are at least three times more likely to be incarcerated than
white teens.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Schindler, staff attorney for the Youth Law Center in
Washington, D.C., considers the figures regarding comparable
offenses by teens who had not been arrested before to be startling.
Those statistics had not been reported before, he said. ``And if
you look at the breakdown by offense, for instance, for drug cases
particularly, African Americans are 48 times more likely to be
incarcerated than white kids for the same offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers leave no argument that black and brown kids are
just committing more crimes and therefore more are locked up. These
disparities are so glaring that there's no way that can explain the
disparity. There's something else going on here. The obvious factor
appears to be the race impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Black teens represent the largest racial/ethnic proportion of
youth held behind locked doors. And they are confined for longer
periods of time than white teens for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   Minority youth represented only 34 percent of the total U.S.
population in 1997 _ yet they represented 62 percent of the youth
incarcerated in adult and juvenile facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Currently all 50 states and the District of Columbia allow
juveniles to be incarcerated in adult jails for some crimes. And
between 1992 and 1997, the District of Columbia and all but three
states made it easier to transfer teen-agers as young as 13 from
the juvenile justice system into the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, under the ``get tough on crime'' standard, 7,400 minors
were sent to adult prisons. Three-quarters of those young people
belonged to racial or ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler considers sending young teen-agers to adult prisons
``analogous to a death penalty for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we transfer a youngster into the adult criminal justice
system,'' Schindler said, ``and then subsequently incarcerate them
in adult prisons, we have thrown those kids away. We have ended
their lives as children, some as young as 13, 14 and 15 years old.
We are essentially saying that we, as a society, are giving up on
13- or 14-year-olds, that nothing can be done other than put them
in an adult prison. That's a terrible, terrible indictment on our
society _ to say we can't do anything about those kids. That
they're unredeemable.''
</P>
<P>
   The report points out that minority children are more likely
than their white counterparts to be involved in the juvenile
justice system and that their over representation will increase at
each stage of the process. For the same offenses, a higher
proportion of minority children will be arrested than whites; a
higher proportion of minority children will be charged with crimes
than their white counterparts and a higher proportion of minority
kids than whites will end up incarcerated in public detention
centers than private ones.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, in every category of criminal offenses
_ against a person, against property, drug dealing, and against
public order _ a substantially greater percentage of black children
were detained by police than white children.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile justice system is tilted dramatically against those
of color in our society. Not surprising, unfortunately. Now, with
this report, we cannot close our eyes to it and pretend it doesn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Congress amended the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention Act of 1974 to include a mandate for states to study and
attempt to correct the problem of disproportionate minority
confinement (DMC). These studies were used to prepare the NCCD
report. Without these state statistics, the problem of racial bias
in the treatment of juvenile offenders would have been impossible
to quantify or even define properly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last year, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Jeff Sessions,
R-Ala., introduced a juvenile crime bill that would have eliminated
the requirement that states keep records on disproportionate
minority confinement.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of the Senate, Hatch stated that racism has nothing
to do with the disproportionate arrest rates for minority teens.
Those are the kids who are selling drugs to our children, he said.
``Those'' meaning black or brown kids, ``our'' meaning white kids.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be a surprise that the NCCD report shows that in
Utah one out of 12 black children will be incarcerated by the age
of 18. That's the highest rate of confinement for a minority group
anywhere in this nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch-Session's bill did not pass last year; however, it is
still pending in a Senate-House conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the findings of the NCCD report, the Building Blocks
for Youth coalition asks Congress to strengthen the
disproportionate minority confinement mandate to address the stark
racial and ethnic disparities in confinement. The coalition also
asks that Congress appropriate at least an addition $100 million
for the Department of Justice to address this issue throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The report should be a call to action for anyone of social
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is an ugly reality anywhere it is met, but it is
especially monstrous when it parades as a system of justice.

   KENT-STATE (Undated) _ On May 4, 1970, National Guardsmen at
Kent State University shot and killed Jeffrey Glenn Miller, Allison
B. Krause, William K. Schroeder and Sandra Lee Scheuer. The
shootings marked the end of four lives, the end of an impromptu
demonstration against the Vietnam War, and the beginning, for
Professor Jerry M. Lewis, of a life wrapped around the legacy of
crazy force, a blurred picture of shouting teenagers caught on the
government's own killing ground. Lewis was 33 years old, a
sociology professor on campus. Now, he is coordinating close to 60
events marking the anniversary of the Kent State killings. By

   GAY-MURDER (Sacramento, Calif.) _ When someone called Robert
Rosenkrantz a ``faggot'' at his high school graduation party and
exposed his homosexuality to his father, the 18-year-old went into
a panic, bought an Uzi and, a week later, put 10 bullets into the
man who outed him. Now, after 15 years in prison for second-degree
murder, Rosenkrantz's case is the center of yet another political
fight between California Gov. Gray Davis and fellow Democrats in
the Legislature, many of whom believe Rosenkrantz should be set
free after becoming a model prisoner. By ROBERT SALLADAY.

   ROSIE-RIVETER (Richmond, Calif.) _ She wore a red polka-dot
bandanna, flexed her biceps and proclaimed, ``We Can Do It!'' She
inspired millions of women to work on the home front during World
War II, graced postage stamps and posed as a cover girl for the
Smithsonian magazine. Her name is Rosie the Riveter, a character
immortalized by posters supporting the war effort and a wartime
song by the same name. A new monument pays tribute to Rosie _ or
rather, to the women whose work at home was vital to the war
effort. By PETER PHOTIKOE.

JOYS OF DUCT TAPE  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being home-repair impaired, my favorite tool is, and always has
been, duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm too lazy or too stupid to fix something right, which is
most of the time, I simply cover the problem with duct tape. This
signals to my wife that the task is ``over my head'' and that it's
time, once again, to consult the yellow pages.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, by sheer accident, my duct-tape repairs work. While
hanging Christmas lights last year, I inadvertently created a
ganglion of extension cords so heavy it threatened to pull down all
the lights. By cleverly spinning a few turns of duct tape around
the cords, the gutter, the chimney and possibly the pug dog, I was
able to keep the lights aloft.
</P>
<P>
   (The problem came later when I tried to peel off the duct tape,
one of the stickiest substances known to man. I wound up having to
use scissors and cutting the wires of several expensive sets of
icicle lights. The duct tape, I'm happy to report, is still
intact.)
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of sites devoted to duct-tape use on the World
Wide Web and authors Tim Nyberg and Jim Berg have published three
books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Besides hanging Christmas lights, you can use duct tape to fix a
shoe, a raincoat, a lawn chair or a seat cushion. It's good for
hurricane protection, splinting a finger and removing hair. The
fashion set might use duct tape for a dress form, an emergency
necktie or as a particularly daring type of thong swimsuit. (Refer
to earlier section on hair removal.)
</P>
<P>
   But of the hundreds of duct-tape usages that I've seen, none
matches the creativity employed by Gemini Wink, 26, of Louisville,
KY. While visiting friends in Tampa, Wink set out into a nearby
swamp to photograph alligators. Naturally, being a guy, he brought
along a roll of duct tape that he planned to use like bread crumbs
to mark his trail.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible as it may sound, this strategy didn't work and Wink
became lost in waist-high water with night falling.
</P>
<P>
   Using the kind of ingenuity that only veteran duct-tape users
possess, Wink clambered 40 feet up a tree and taped himself to the
trunk to avoid being eaten by alligators.
</P>
<P>
   (It is a well-known fact that alligators hate the taste of duct
tape, even when it is wrapped around a succulent young tourist from
Louisville. I think the stuff gets stuck between their teeth. The
duct tape, that is.)
</P>
<P>
   But duct tape or no duct tape, sleep comes hard when you're
taped to the trunk of a tree 40-feet above swampy ground teeming
with alligators.
</P>
<P>
   Wink's yells for help were heard by someone at a nearby house
who called sheriff's deputies. Using a helicopter and police dogs,
Wink was finally located and freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll definitely visit again, but I'll probably stay out of the
swamps,'' Wink told the Tampa Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least remember to bring along a bigger roll of duct tape.

BOOK EXPLAINS COMPUTER MYSTERIES  
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're the type who does poorly with a computer, but does
well when reading a textbook, there may be hope lurking in
``Computer Friendly!''
</P>
<P>
   This 96-page book is written in easy-to-understand language. It
shuns computer terms until it can explain what they mean to the
reader.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, it has a little exercise so readers will know if
they're getting things right. One example: ``When would you use the
following options? Shut down; restart; stand by.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can correctly answer those situations, know how to remove
and copy files, and can change desktop options, you'll probably
find Computer Friendly a little too friendly for your skill level.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you'd like to make better use of the
control panel _ or understand why it's there in the first place _
Computer Friendly can provide the guidance to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course assumes the reader never had any computer
experience,'' said a publicist for the author, Raymond Steinbacher.
He's a 34-year-old Web page designer and former manager of a
software department for a retail chain. While selling software one
day, Steinbacher found himself talking to Ernest Weckesser,
president of Green Tree Press Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond combined the two elements of genuine helpfulness I'd
been seeking for years: simple explanations and plain English,''
wrote Weckesser in the forward to the book published by Green Tree.
``It was just a matter of time until I realized that here was the
one guy most qualified to write and develop a truly basic computer
course; something we'd been wanting to publish here at Green Tree
for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was published in February 1999 and has sold nearly
500,000 copies. It's available directly from the publisher for
$15.95, shipping included. For more information: Green Tree Press,
3603 W. 12th St., Erie, Pa. 16505. Tollfree: 800-834-3888.

<P>
   HOAX BUSTER
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't true that the Federal Communications Commission is
going to end religious broadcasting on radio and television. No, it
is not true that you need to forward the e-mail about Petition
Number 2493 to all the people you know.
</P>
<P>
   Any time you see the words ``to all the people you know,'' or
``to as many people as possible,'' or ``everyone in your address
book,'' think: Hoax.
</P>
<P>
   This hoax about the FCC and religious broadcasts has been going
on for nearly 25 years. And while there indeed was a petition
numbered 2493, it did not have anything to do with banning
religious broadcasts. And the petition was not filed by atheist
Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who disappeared mysteriously in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was filed by two attorneys (neither were connected
with O'Hair or any of her followers) who asked the FCC to
disqualify religiously affiliated organizations and institutions
from broadcasting on channels reserved for noncommercial education.
The petition was turned down in August 1975, with the FCC saying it
could take no position on religion.
</P>
<P>
   That was the end of it. But the FCC still receives a dozen or so
protests a day against the petition _ a number that increases
around Easter and Christmas, when the e-mail makes its rounds on
the Internet and into conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it true that the Cat4'lic church is trying to collect
signatures against the petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things take on a life of their own,'' a church spokesman
told a reporter last year. ``I'm sure anybody who passes the (FCC
rumor) on, they mean well ... It's just that they've fallen prey to
a hoax.''

 &HT;    Financial gift a wise choice for graduates
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Millions of young Americans will don their caps and
gowns in the next few weeks, graduating for high school or college
and starting the next chapters in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They will have plenty to celebrate, including the gift-giving
that their successes have earned.
</P>
<P>
   For some families, a lot of money is involved, paying for cars,
vacations, electronics or perhaps jewelry. Others will spend much
less, but they will be searching for something important enough to
be a reward for years of work and the passage through one of life's
milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea: How about giving something of lasting and even
increasing value? How about a financially oriented gift, one that
recognizes the approach of adult responsibilities and helps a
youngster start dealing with them?
</P>
<P>
   Parents or grandparents could pour some cash into a short-term
savings plan, with goals such as paying college tuition or, later
on, paying off college loans.
</P>
<P>
   Family members might also lean towards buying stocks or shares
in a stock mutual fund, perhaps in a Roth IRA. With those
longer-term arrangements, the goal is to encourage young people to
start soon on their investment plans, so they can benefit from the
power of compounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're encouraging your children to make conscious choices
about money, like all adults have to do,'' said certified financial
planner Elizabeth Jetton.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts need not be hugely expensive, like bright red cars, or
trips to the Caribbean, or giant slugs of stock in Disney or
Microsoft. There are cheaper alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The choice will vary with each family's circumstances. For a
high school graduate, for example, the financially savvy gift might
be money for a freshman college year. Call it tuition money, pizza
money or whatever seems most rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   For college graduates, the most important financial goal might
be immediate -- graduate school or setting up a new household --
rather than far-off things like retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to focus on the graduate's actual needs, rather
than the parents' yearnings for their children. ``You can't just
say, 'This is for your benefit, dear,''' Jetton observed.
``Graduates have to feel that there is some fairly immediate
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be important to build in incentives. ``We've
suggested dollar-for-dollar matching programs,'' said Lewis J.
Walker, a certified financial planner in Norcross. That would hold
for short- or long-term savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   In his own family, Walker decided not to buy his daughter a car.
Instead, he made the down payment. ``I wanted her to have car
payments, to feel that her dad helped her start it and she helped
pay for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful tactic could be splitting your gift money between
immediate gratification and future-oriented savings plans. ``One
thing we tell parents is that if you're giving money, rather than
blow it all on a car, put some into an investment,'' said Jetton.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you split your gift, putting only half into an S&AMP;P 500
index mutual fund, the growth would be impressive. After 10 years,
an investment of $10,500 could be expected to grow to $30,906.
Based on long-term trends and the power of compounding, the
investment would come to nearly $91,000 in 20 years and $267,800 in
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Results like that should make it easy to sell young people on
the rewards of achieving financial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas for financially rewarding gifts:
</P>
<P>
   --- Open a Roth IRA. If your graduate has as much as $2,000 in
earnings, you can make a gift in that amount into a retirement
plan. Left to grow without taxes, the increased value could be
huge.
</P>
<P>
   While this makes good sense financially, some planners believe
retirement is a goal too far away to hold a young person's
interest. That raises the possibility of cashing out the IRA
quickly, for whatever need comes along.
</P>
<P>
   --- Stick with basic green. That could include money for
college, for buying a first home or some other or even paying down
college loans or other debts.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with that last one. ``That's tricky,'' Jetton said.
``Until a person has reached a certain amount of maturity, having
no debt just frees them up to go into more debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Incentives may be particularly useful. You might offer to pay
down a portion of school debt when a new graduate gets his or her
first job, for example.
</P>
<P>
   --- Buy stocks or mutual funds. For long-term investments,
stocks tend to appreciate faster than bonds, certificates of
deposit or other such conservative investments. Ibbotson
Associates, which has gathered a massive database on investment
results since 1926, reports that large-company stocks held for any
15-year period have never lost money. The best annual return was
18.9 percent from 1985 through 1999. The worst was 0.6 percent,
from 1929 through 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Walker suggests buying mutual funds, especially for young people
with no experience in picking stocks. He favors stock funds, and
particularly focussed funds -- those that concentrate their
investments in a small number of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   --- Use low-cost, easily accessible investment vehicles. If you
are buying mutual funds, that means picking the ones that don't
charge more than about 1 percent sales fees and that have low
annual expenses. You might also shop for a fund that accepts
additional investments in small amounts, to encourage your graduate
to keep on putting money in.
</P>
<P>
   If you are buying stocks, lean towards discount brokers, like
Schwab. You could also look at www.netstockdirect.com or
www.buyandhold.com, which allow very small purchases for very low
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   --- Help your graduate learn. Some parents high financial
coaches to tutor young people on the basics of budgeting, saving
and financial planning. You could also buy financial planning
software, such as Quicken, to get them started.
</P>
<P>
   A number of good books are available for beginners. Among them
are ``The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance,'' by Ken
Kurson, and ``The Rookie's Guide to Money Management,'' by Carolina
Edwards and Ray Martin.

 &HT;    The high price of campaigning
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Isn't it wonderful living in a country where
anyone can grow up to be President _ as long as he or she has
access to more money than it would take to buy a small country and
feed everyone in it for a generation?
</P>
<P>
   George W. has already spent $63 million _ more than twice as
much as any previous presidential candidate, and the election is
still six months away. Gore trails with close to $34 million.
Elizabeth Dole dropped out at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   So what's all this yammer I've been hearing about campaign
finance reform? And what does that mean, anyway? I've tried to
figure it out, but it's like reading ``War and Peace'' without a
tearsheet listing the cast of characters _ impossible to tell who's
saying what. It does help to frequently remind myself that both are
fiction based only loosely on reality.
</P>
<P>
   There's also been a lot of talk about ``soft'' money
(contributions given to the party rather than the candidate) and
how it ought to be regulated. Good idea but a waste of time. Before
Congress could ever get together on a reform bill, the candidates
would have found a way around it and be back to business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The money politicians spend in their bids for election is
staggering, once it sinks in, and that takes a while. Average folks
like us don't think in esoteric terms of millions or billions.
While we can relate to mortgage payments and gasoline prices, we
cannot identify with the astronomical numbers in a candidate's war
chest _ like the almost $20 million W. has spent on the media, and
another $11 million on fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   In real life (as opposed to political life), these are absurd
numbers that call for an equally absurd solution. And that's what
I'm good at. My suggestion is to give each candidate fifty bucks
and see how much ground he can cover with it. Whoever's left come
November 7th, gets my vote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of my no-spend theory have tried to convince me that
money spent by the candidates is dumped back into the economy and
eventually comes back to me. Sure. I've heard that one before. The
only trickle down I know of is tomato soup on my chin when the
saltines get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Shmoe doesn't get a check from NBC when Gore drops some big
bucks with them. Hell, we never even got a kickback from the Brushy
Creek BBQ House when W. spent $6,438 there. The route of the
trickle is too circuitous to ever wind up back in my pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But what do we get for our money? Well, we have one candidate
who by now believes he invented the Internet, and that Erich Segal
</P>
<P>
   wrote his book ``Love Story'' about his wife and him, and
another who goes around saying stuff like: ``Laura and I really
don't realize how bright our children is sometimes until we get an
objective analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates are not the only ones blowing a bundle.
How much do you think a Senate seat might be worth? Take a guess.
</P>
<P>
   To Hillary and Rudy it's apparently worth plenty. Watchdog
groups have made an educated guesstimate that by election day these
two campaigners will have topped the $100 million mark. That's a
whole lot of desire to ``serve'' the citizens of New York _
particularly for the candidate who is still unpacking.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes November 7th. The last vote is in and the war chest
is empty. Now it's payback time. Watch for the lines of folks with
their hands extended, queing up around the winners. Trust me,
they're not there to shake; they've come to collect on their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for,'' is as true in politics as it is in
diamonds, and that's what scares me. I couldn't afford to buy a
single candidate this year.

a country where anyone can grow up to be President _ as long as he

already spent $63 million _ more than twice as much as any previous
presidential candidate, and the election is still six months away.

 &HT;    Financial gift a wise choice for graduates
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Millions of young Americans will don their caps and
gowns in the next few weeks, graduating for high school or college
and starting the next chapters in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They will have plenty to celebrate, including the gift-giving
that their successes have earned.
</P>
<P>
   For some families, a lot of money is involved, paying for cars,
vacations, electronics or perhaps jewelry. Others will spend much
less, but they will be searching for something important enough to
be a reward for years of work and the passage through one of life's
milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea: How about giving something of lasting and even
increasing value? How about a financially oriented gift, one that
recognizes the approach of adult responsibilities and helps a
youngster start dealing with them?
</P>
<P>
   Parents or grandparents could pour some cash into a short-term
savings plan, with goals such as paying college tuition or, later
on, paying off college loans.
</P>
<P>
   Family members might also lean towards buying stocks or shares
in a stock mutual fund, perhaps in a Roth IRA. With those
longer-term arrangements, the goal is to encourage young people to
start soon on their investment plans, so they can benefit from the
power of compounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're encouraging your children to make conscious choices
about money, like all adults have to do,'' said certified financial
planner Elizabeth Jetton.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts need not be hugely expensive, like bright red cars, or
trips to the Caribbean, or giant slugs of stock in Disney or
Microsoft. There are cheaper alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The choice will vary with each family's circumstances. For a
high school graduate, for example, the financially savvy gift might
be money for a freshman college year. Call it tuition money, pizza
money or whatever seems most rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   For college graduates, the most important financial goal might
be immediate -- graduate school or setting up a new household --
rather than far-off things like retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to focus on the graduate's actual needs, rather
than the parents' yearnings for their children. ``You can't just
say, 'This is for your benefit, dear,''' Jetton observed.
``Graduates have to feel that there is some fairly immediate
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be important to build in incentives. ``We've
suggested dollar-for-dollar matching programs,'' said Lewis J.
Walker, a certified financial planner in Norcross. That would hold
for short- or long-term savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   In his own family, Walker decided not to buy his daughter a car.
Instead, he made the down payment. ``I wanted her to have car
payments, to feel that her dad helped her start it and she helped
pay for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful tactic could be splitting your gift money between
immediate gratification and future-oriented savings plans. ``One
thing we tell parents is that if you're giving money, rather than
blow it all on a car, put some into an investment,'' said Jetton.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you split your gift, putting only half into an S&AMP;P 500
index mutual fund, the growth would be impressive. After 10 years,
an investment of $10,500 could be expected to grow to $30,906.
Based on long-term trends and the power of compounding, the
investment would come to nearly $91,000 in 20 years and $267,800 in
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Results like that should make it easy to sell young people on
the rewards of achieving financial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas for financially rewarding gifts:
</P>
<P>
   --- Open a Roth IRA. If your graduate has as much as $2,000 in
earnings, you can make a gift in that amount into a retirement
plan. Left to grow without taxes, the increased value could be
huge.
</P>
<P>
   While this makes good sense financially, some planners believe
retirement is a goal too far away to hold a young person's
interest. That raises the possibility of cashing out the IRA
quickly, for whatever need comes along.
</P>
<P>
   --- Stick with basic green. That could include money for
college, for buying a first home or some other or even paying down
college loans or other debts.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with that last one. ``That's tricky,'' Jetton said.
``Until a person has reached a certain amount of maturity, having
no debt just frees them up to go into more debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Incentives may be particularly useful. You might offer to pay
down a portion of school debt when a new graduate gets his or her
first job, for example.
</P>
<P>
   --- Buy stocks or mutual funds. For long-term investments,
stocks tend to appreciate faster than bonds, certificates of
deposit or other such conservative investments. Ibbotson
Associates, which has gathered a massive database on investment
results since 1926, reports that large-company stocks held for any
15-year period have never lost money. The best annual return was
18.9 percent from 1985 through 1999. The worst was 0.6 percent,
from 1929 through 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Walker suggests buying mutual funds, especially for young people
with no experience in picking stocks. He favors stock funds, and
particularly focussed funds -- those that concentrate their
investments in a small number of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   --- Use low-cost, easily accessible investment vehicles. If you
are buying mutual funds, that means picking the ones that don't
charge more than about 1 percent sales fees and that have low
annual expenses. You might also shop for a fund that accepts
additional investments in small amounts, to encourage your graduate
to keep on putting money in.
</P>
<P>
   If you are buying stocks, lean towards discount brokers, like
Schwab. You could also look at www.netstockdirect.com or
www.buyandhold.com, which allow very small purchases for very low
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   --- Help your graduate learn. Some parents high financial
coaches to tutor young people on the basics of budgeting, saving
and financial planning. You could also buy financial planning
software, such as Quicken, to get them started.
</P>
<P>
   A number of good books are available for beginners. Among them
are ``The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance,'' by Ken
Kurson, and ``The Rookie's Guide to Money Management,'' by Carolina
Edwards and Ray Martin.

 &HT;    Self-chilling beverage can sounds cool, but won't be cheap
 &HT;    By Don Fernandez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Envision a day at the beach, sun beating down mercilessly and
throat parching in the heat. You reach for a soft drink can boiling
in the sand. With a click of a button, the drink converts from
feverish to frigid.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradenton, Fla., firm wants to make that sun-drenched mirage a
reality. Tempra Technology has created a self-refrigerating
beverage can that drops a drink to 35 degrees in minutes and keeps
it there for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Cork &AMP; Seal Co., which produces more than 30 billion cans
a year, agreed to mass produce the chilling device and is trying to
entice one or more of the big beverage makers to put it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the potential to be one of the most interesting
innovations in some time,'' said Dan Abramowicz, a Crown executive.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the can is a filament coated in a water-based gel. Push a
button and a vacuum mechanism in the base of the can sucks the
moisture in the gel into the bottom. That drops the temperature of
the filament, which then acts as an ice cube of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience is costly: A self-chilling can of soda will cost
about a dollar. But experts say it could appeal to a niche market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can is interesting,'' said John Sicher, editor and
publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Crown has a lot of manufacturing
expertise and a lot of industry customer contacts.''

 &HT;    Return of the `Rattlesnake' highlight of WWF's `Backlash'
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a very strange month for the World Wrestling
Federation. It started with ````Wrestlemania'''' and concluded with
Sunday's ``Backlash'' pay-per-view, and in both cases, the draw was
not the wrestlers in the ring that day, but wrestlers of the past.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Wrestlemania'' it was seven hours of all the past
``Wrestlemania'' that helped boost buy rates to the highest of the
year. On Sunday, the WWF was banking on the draw of former champion
'Stone Cold' Steve Austin to help put over a pay-per-view that had
a repeat performance in the main event (The Rock vs. Triple H).
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Austin helped the buy rates won't be known until
next week, but his dramatic return was the highlight of an average
pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   The first match of the night was a tag team championship bout
between Degeneration X's Road Dogg and X-Pac vs. the champions,
Edge and Christian. The match included the return of Debra. The
former valet who has been out of action while attending to her man,
Austin, while he recovers from neck surgery. She was the guest ring
announcer, but her return made it certain to fans that Austin would
be in the main event later in the night. The match was nothing
special and in what became a theme for the night, the champions
left with their titles. But during the match X-Pac injured his own
valet, Tori. This could be the beginning of the end for Tori and
DX. She may return to women's competition.
</P>
<P>
   The lightweight title was on the line as Scotty Too Hotty and
champion Dean Malenko end their `three matches in three weeks.'
Malenko left with the tile and Scotty will probably go back to tag
team matches with Grandmaster Sexy now that the Grandmaster has
recovered from knee surgery. The funniest match of the night was
Kurt Angle taking on the Big Show. Big Show continued to run down a
list of different gimmicks as he came to the ring dressed like Hulk
Hogan and proclaiming himself the `Showster.' Big Show hit most of
the Hulkster's moves, including his comebacks and had the crowd
chanting 'Hogan, Hogan'. The Show got the win.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the long-running feud between The Rock and Triple H.
As expected, the McMahons (Vince and Shane) did everything to keep
the Rock from winning, but when it seemed like all was lost, Austin
turned the tide for The Rock, using a chair to dispatch of trouble.
Linda McMahon made her way to the ring with fired WWF referee Earl
Hebner in tow. The Rock pinned Triple H to become the new WWF
champion. After a stare down, Austin joined The Rock in the ring
for a celebration, but don't expect a long friendship.

   MEDIA GIANTS
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling industry is generating millions of dollars in
profits by packaging and distributing their products in many ways
</P>
<P>
   By John Allen
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn in this media-crazed world, professional
wrestling is there. And in many cases, they blazed the trail for
other non-wrestling companies to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A Saturday Night Live episode scored the show's highest ratings
of the year. Why? Because the World Wrestling Federation's The Rock
was the host with the most; the top-rated cable show of the year,
WWF's Monday night ``Raw is War;'' The top selling books on the New
York Times bestsellers list are wrestling autobiographies. Hottest

</P>
<P>
   o games, you guessed it, pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn in this media-crazed world, professional
wrestling is there. And in many cases, they blazed the trail for
other non-wrestling companies to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what they have done, what they are doing now
and what you can expect in the future:
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   The tube was the reason behind the growth of professional
wrestling in the 1980s and has become the key to wrestling's
current success. This time, though, it is carrying cable television
profits to new heights. The last Monday in April was a good
example. WWF's ``Raw is War'' show earned a 7.1 rating, it's
highest in head-to-head competition with World Championship
Wrestling's ``Nitro'' program. Meanwhile, ``Nitro,'' which had been
slumping over the past year, earned one of its highest ratings in
six months at 3.1. That mark is good enough to be one of the top 10
watched cable shows for the week. When the NFL is not in season,
``Raw is War'' is almost always the top-rated cable television
show.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF's 18-month long headlock as the top cable television
show has drawn interest from CBS. CBS is in the process of
mergering with Viacom. When that deal is complete, they are
expected to move the ``Raw is War'' show from the USA Network to
The Nashville Network (TNN) _ owned by CBS. USA network has filed a
court injunction in an attempt to stop the WWF from moving.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is expected to include a deal for the WWF's new business
venture, the spring football league XFL, as part of its package.
That would leave Extreme Championship Wrestling (the third most
popular organization) looking for a home for its program that is
the highest rated show on TNN. They could very well end up on USA.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF, WCW and ECW have also dominated the pay-per-view
market. With almost 30 events per year, the trio attract nearly 15
million additional viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestlers' appeal is not just limited to their shows. Steve
Austin, Triple H, Chyna, Tommy Dreamer, New Jack, The Big Show and
Mick Foley are just a few of the wrestlers who have made guest
appearances on shows such as ``Nash Bridges,'' ``3rd Rock from the
Sun,'' ``Boy Meets World.'' Austin, who has appeared on four
episodes of Nash Bridges, may play a recurring character.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   While Warner Brothers and WCW are trying to earn box office
dollars with the recently released ``Ready to Rumble'', movies and
pro wrestling have not worked well. Ready to Rumble grossed about
$12 million during its first month, and will be out of most
theaters soon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the documentary ``Beyond the Mat'' has received
critical acclaim, but not box office success. Despite the limited
showing in theaters, when it hits the video stores later this year,
the movie should find a very strong cult following.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, the only movie you'll see wrestlers in will
be ``The Mummy II,'' where The Rock will have a guest star role.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   While the average John Q. Public thinks wrestling fans can't
read, Mick Foley helped prove otherwise. Foley's autobiography
``Have a Nice Day'' climbed up The New York Times bestsellers list
until it reached No. 2. On the heels of that success, The Rock took
his book, ``The Rock Says,'' to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Such success has made writers out of Diamond Dallas Page
(''Positively Page'') and Bret Hart (''The Best there is, the Best
there was, the Best there ever will be'') and has made book deals
for 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, The Fabulous Moolah and Rena Mero
(a.k.a. Sable).
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, wrestling superstars such as Ric Flair, Hulk
Hogan, Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger and Triple H
could all have No. 1s in their futures.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEOS
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling has learned how to make more of their pay-per-views by
releasing videos of each event months later. Those videos along
with special compulation tapes on stars like The Rock, Mick Foley,
Hulk Hogan and Sting have allowed professional wrestling to
dominate the sports video market (they had 12 of the top 20 selling
videos for the month of March).
</P>
<P>
   According to Billboard magazine, results from this past week's
recreational video sales lists the WWF with the top 6 spots, and 7
of top 9. An ECW video is 10th. Of note, the video of Super Bowl
XXXIV is 8th.
</P>
<P>
   Videos are also the way startup groups like ECW have been able
to merchandise their product. When ECW was new, they did not have
weekly television shows, so many road shows were strung together to
form videos that are now considered classics by wrestling video
conneseurs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, the sky is the limit. Expect the past to come
alive again. ``Classic'' matches from the 1970s and early 1980s are
in demand and will continue to grow in popularity. When one website
can be devoted to strictly selling wrestling videos and have a
library of thousands, it's big.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO GAMES
</P>
<P>
   While this is an area that wrestling was slower to get involved
in that other entertainment industries, they have definitely made
up for lost time. WWF and WCW each have produce four different
games and expect to have more for 2000. ECW introduced its first
game with the help of Acclaim and it became one of the top selling
games in the video game maker's history.
</P>
<P>
   According to PCdata.com, the top selling video game for Sony's
Playstation for March was ``WWF's Smackdown 2000.'' In March, the
4th best-seller for Nintendo was WWF's ````Wrestlemania'' 2000.''
Also the 5th best-selling Nintendo game for 1998 was ``WCW/NWO
Revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, more games, more violence and more swearing.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Of all the multimedia arenas, this has been the least
successful. Grouping together a bunch of wrestling intros has not
translated into big sales and probably never will. However, the
WWF's ``The Music Vol. 4'' went platinum on Dec. 16, according to
Billboard magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A gold record is given when a CD sell 125,000 copies. Platinum
is issued when sales reach 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is wrestling hotter than on the Internet. Web sites
exist for wrestling organizations, wrestlers, news groups and fan
clubs. Yahoo current lists 646 professional wrestling Websites (218
are devoted to wrestlers), up nearly 100 from last June.
</P>
<P>
   These Websites can tell you everything you want to know about
your favorite wrestler, sell you their merchandise, tell you when
they are coming to your town, get you tickets, to when you can see
them on television, and let you in on the latest gossip and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, expect to see the number of sites dwindle,
but the ones who survive will be among the best on the Internet for
innovations.

&HT;     VERSATILE DREW CAREY CARRIES A TUNE IN ENTERTAINING
`GEPPETTO' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Drew Carey is no singer. He just plays one on television.
</P>
<P>
   But Carey _ ABC's most prominent face before Regis Philbin came
along _ proves he's still the network's most versatile performer in
a ``Wonderful World of Disney'' musical production of ``Geppetto''
(7 p.m. EDT Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Carey can in fact carry a tune. He's no Burl Ives, but
he's game, and that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   If Disney's ``Geppetto'' doesn't come close to the level of its
near-perfect TV musical ``Annie'' of last fall, this reworking of
the Pinocchio story from the toy maker's point of view is certainly
entertaining family fun.
</P>
<P>
   And that is squarely because of Carey, who before
``Millionaire'' was the one ABC talent with shows on two nights
(``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``Whose Line is it Anyway?'').
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying Carey's earnestness, an innate everyman
quality that comes from being a regular guy in real life. Here he's
a schlub playing a schlub with a Herman's Hermits haircut. You want
to root for him.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Spiner, without the pancake makeup of his years as Data on
``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' is properly manic as the evil
and borderline psychotic puppeteer Stromboli. Seth Adkins, best
remembered as the kid Leonardo DiCaprio saves in the hallway of the
sinking Titanic, is properly unruly as the wooden boy who just
wants to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays the Blue Fairy, the wish-granter who
puts the toy-to-boy transformation into motion. She's so over the
top _ like Glinda the Good Witch on hash _ that your fillings will
ache.
</P>
<P>
   She has to be putting us on; but that touch of ``Seinfeld''
irony never comes. I understand playing big for kids, but
Louis-Dreyfus is going Godzilla here.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, kids like Godzilla. They should also like
``Geppetto.''

   DELMAR, N.Y. _ Mara Ginsberg didn't waste any time wondering
``why me?'' when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and aunt both died of the disease at age 44.
</P>
<P>
   With such a family history, Ginsberg had known for years that
she was at risk. ``It made me vigilant,'' she said. ``I started
having mammograms at 23.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, getting the diagnosis sent Ginsberg, then a
37-year-old lawyer for the New York attorney general's office, into
high gear, gathering information about the disease and potential
treatments. She recalled when the radiologist called her at work to
deliver the news about her malignant lump.
</P>
<P>
   When she hung up the phone, she relayed the news to her
officemate, who promptly asked how she was feeling and whether she
shouldn't go home. ``I said, `What am I going to do at home?'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ginsberg has beat her cancer, quit her job, and
started To Life!, an advocacy group for women and their families
affected by breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group, based in a small office in suburban Albany,
will mark its second anniversary in October and shows no sign of
losing momentum as it hires its first part-time employee and plans
for its annual fund-raising gala later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the group reached hundreds of women in the area
around Albany, the state capital, with a series of educational
forums and weekly support group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg has earned national recognition for her work. In
October, she won a You Can Make a Difference Award from the Kellogg
Co. and Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, which also
presented her in July with the Local Hero Award.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, she is slated to be honored by the Albany-Colonie
Chamber of Commerce in a ceremony recognizing 100 Women of
Excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tremendously energetic person with a good idea every
30 seconds,'' said Paula Steigman, a breast cancer survivor and
close friend of Ginsberg's for the past 15 years. ``She's
developing contacts in the field all around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   To Life! wasn't a late-night brainstorm. Ginsberg, now 41, said
her decision to start the group was an evolutionary process that
began with her diagnosis. She had chosen to get her care in New
York City, in part because she already knew a doctor there.
</P>
<P>
   But she also learned that New York City was miles ahead in its
approach to breast cancer, whether it was the availability of
support groups or human hair wigs to help camouflage the effects of
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the resources available to patients there and what
wasn't available to patients here,'' she said. ``I thought there
were things missing.''
</P>
<P>
   To Life! has been an effort to fill in those gaps, with weekly,
not monthly, support group meetings, a mentoring program to pair up
newly diagnosed women with survivors, and even a special beauty
shop to help fit women with wigs and prosthetic breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lanoue, the service line manager at Northeast Women's
Health, believes such services have helped make a difference to the
women she sees. ``The patients who have gone to Mara have spoken
very highly of it,'' she said. ``From my perspective, it's another
resource I can give the patient. It's another avenue I can steer
them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg says her mission is simple: ``To help people through
the process in a positive way, no matter what the outcome.'' She
acknowledges that part of her commitment comes from having watched
her own mother, who also was a lawyer, suffer with the disease in
relative silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was completely alone,'' Ginsberg said. ``In the '60s, when
she was diagnosed, you never talked about cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   And adults certainly didn't talk to their children about the
illness. ``I learned about it when I was 13,'' she said, recalling
how a playground bully taunted her with, ``Your mommy had her
breasts cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was diagnosed,'' Ginsberg said, ``the first thing I did
was find a way to tell my children. It was important for me to tell
them because I was left in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Her two children, now 11 and 8, have grown up hearing about To
Life! a translation of the Hebrew phrase ``La chiam.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg has since written a book, and is looking for a
publisher, for ``Mommy Has Breast Cancer, Please Tell Me What That
Means.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Ginsberg's main goal is to give women as much
individual attention as possible, she acknowledges that another
part of her mission is to help raise the standard of medical care
by encouraging women to educate themselves and voice their concerns
with their physicians.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that strategy seems to be working. Over the past 16
months, To Life! has hosted more than a dozen educational programs
on topics such as innovations in breast cancer biopsies and healthy
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A well-educated patient knows what to ask and that's the most
effective weapon for dealing with and treating their disease,''
said Dr. Debbie Kennedy of Albany Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who often does reconstructive surgery on patients after
mastectomies, believes groups like To Life! not only have an impact
on the medical community but also on government, in determining how
state and federal dollars are spent on research.
</P>
<P>
   And while To Life! hasn't entered into the lobbying arena yet,
Kennedy believes Ginsberg has the potential to influence change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mara is a bundle of energy,'' she said. ``She's the kind of
person who makes things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg's motivation, however, remains very personal and very
tied to her mother. ``I'm doing this, in part, for her and all the
people who suffered silently alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering her family history, she's also acutely aware that
her own 11-year-old daughter, Barbara, is at risk of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my fervent hope that with all the changes going on, that
many of the issues will be a thing of the past,'' she said. ``I do
feel in some sense I'm completing a mission.''
</P>
<P>

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Magical times on the family farm
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Joyce B. Barnes
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   CATAWBA, Ohio _ I was not a true farm kid, but my grandparents'
farm had been our main vacation spot all during my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   At spring break, my brother Gene and I, grumbling about being
slave labor, were put to work helping with the spring cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, we'd come to the farm to celebrate the Fourth of
July, bringing a box of all kinds of fireworks to shoot off in the
meadow.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmas, a big tree would be cut from their back property,
lighted with grandma's dainty tapers and adorned with treasured
ornaments from the attic.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, too, Aunt Dorothy's delicious yuletime cookie and
candy concoctions and the family's simple gifts, often homemade, as
well as the mysterious packages our parents had packed into the
trunk of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Amiable and easygoing, my grandpa, Charlie Coe, was not one for
shiny new tractors. He let others lead the way to modern
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   He did drive a little tan Ford Model A with a rumble seat that
Gene and I enjoyed, but everything else stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa loved to work the farm with his mules and Old Billy, his
horse.
</P>
<P>
   I swear it was the world's largest horse. When I rode him, his
restless shifting had me hanging onto the saddle horn for dear
life.
</P>
<P>
   The gentle snorting of Guernsey cows were part of the farm life,
as well as the contented clucking of grandma's hens and,
occasionally, their raucous squawks when Duke the dog made
mischievous forays into their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the time came when grandpa and grandma could no
longer go it alone, and our dad moved us to the farm.
</P>
<P>
   When we protested having to leave our school and become a part
of rural life, he said: ``Would you rather be a little frog in a
big puddle or a big frog in a little puddle?''
</P>
<P>
   We accepted the inevitable, not that we really had a choice.
</P>
<P>
   And it turned out wonderfully in that beautiful little community
nestled in rolling green hills dotted with grazing horses and
cattle. All of it was like magic.
</P>
<P>
   Gene and I found our future mates in Catawba, and life was
uncomplicated and fun _ until that fateful windy March night when
our beautiful home went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   We were thankful, of course, to escape with our lives, but we
lost everything we had.
</P>
<P>
   Years later when I returned to visit the site, I realized that
even if fire had not claimed our home, the farm itself long ago
would have succumbed to the overpowering movement known as
agri-business.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Coe's acerage would have been combined with adjoining
land, and the farm I had known would have disappeared regardless.
</P>
<P>
   I know that's progress, and I remind myself how much more
efficient it is now, this strange, alien turf. But in my heart,
it's difficult to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce B. Barnes lives in Springfield, Ohio, about 25 miles from
Catawba.

LUCY PEARL IS JUST WHAT THE SOUL DOCTOR ORDERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   R &AMP; B ain't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Once there was Curtis and Chaka, Otis and the O'Jays, Lady Soul
and the Godfather of Soul. There were the Spinners, Stylistics,
Commodores, Earth Wind &AMP; Fire, and the Isley Brothers. Marvin Gaye
sang ``Got to Give It Up,'' and we happily acquiesced. Al Green
said, ``Let's Stay Together,'' and we did. Gladys Knight and the
Pips hopped that ``Midnight Train to Georgia,'' and she had us
waiting at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we have Sisqo's silly ``Thong Song,'' which is just
thong-thong-thong-thong-wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder then that there's been so much buzz surrounding
the new band Lucy Pearl, which has been touted as R &AMP; B's first
supergroup. Formed last year, Lucy Pearl is the phoenix that rose
from the ashes of three of the best R &AMP; B and hip-hop groups of the
1990s _ Raphael Saadiq of Tony Toni Tone (``Feels Good'' ``If I Had
No Loot''), Dawn Robinson of En Vogue (``Free Your Mind,''
``Something He Can Feel''), and Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe
Called Quest (``Award Tour'' ``Scenario,'' ``Bonita Applebum'').
</P>
<P>
   With such a pedigree, Lucy Pearl's eponymous CD is nearing its
May 23 release date laden with expectations that this talented trio
deliver us from R &AMP; B mediocrity and help mend the hole in R &AMP; B's
soul. But Saadiq maintains he isn't feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure I feel is the pressure I like, and the pressure I
need,'' he said in a telephone interview during a brief respite
from preparations for the band's first tour, due to kick off in New
York later this month. They'll also make their national TV debut
this week on ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   Saadiq has been friends with Robinson and Muhammad for years,
but Lucy Pearl happened almost by accident. Saadiq and Muhammad had
worked together on projects for their former bands (Saadiq was a
member of Tribe's production unit, the Ummah), and they'd always
talked about doing something more. They originally envisioned their
then-unnamed band as an all-male trio, but when Robinson's name
came up, both Saadiq and Muhammad rethought their new group.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was one of En Vogue's funky divas and the standout
voice on such songs as ``Hold On,'' ``Giving Him Something He Can
Feel,'' and ``Don't Let Go (Love).'' She left to pursue a solo
career in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was available,'' Saadiq said, ``and we thought it
would be a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Pearl arrives in the midst of the so-called ``neo-soul''
sound, which, for all intents and purposes, Tony Toni Tone helped
launch back in the late-1980s. It's a genre that, while employing
hip-hop stylings, jeep beats, and new jack swing, finds its heart
in the traditional R &AMP; B prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s. The
music features glorious vocals (yes, kids, once upon a time R &AMP; B
singers could actually sing), sultry grooves, and ace musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movement being championed by such artists as Macy Gray,
Angie Stone, Erykah Badu, Maxwell, Meshell Ndegeocello, and
D'Angelo, whose recent hit, ``Untitled (How Does It Feel),'' was
co-written and co-produced by Saadiq. Lucy Pearl is the first band
of neo-soul, although Saadiq shrugs off the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it since the Tonys back in '88, so I don't
know if there's anything new about it,'' he said. ``I don't call it
new soul. When (the Tonys) were doing it, it wasn't new. We were
just doing what people before us _ like Cameo and Midnight Star _
were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trio briefly considered the name Disciples of Soul,
until Lucy Pearl popped into Saadiq's head. ``It had that ring I
wanted,'' he said. ``It sounded unique.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lucy Pearl, Saadiq and Robinson share vocals. Saadiq plays
guitars and bass; and Muhammad, Tribe's former mixmaster, handles
the turntables, loops, drum machines, and adds his own touches on
bass. (When's the last time you saw an R &AMP; B group that played its
own instruments?) From the biting guitars of ``Hollywood,'' to the
unbelievably sultry first single, ``Dance Tonight,'' Lucy Pearl
often measures up to what Saadiq proclaims in the intro to the CD's
first song, ``Ask of You'': ``It's a new revolution.'' Much in the
way that the Tonys, Tribe, and En Vogue stood out from the pack in
their time, Lucy Pearl is unlike anything else on urban radio _
which is perfectly fine with Saadiq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely not a part of that, but we don't knock it,''
he said. ``Everybody seems to want to do the same thing. People
should go out and try to do different things, but some people don't
know how to do anything else. They're making a great living out of
it, so who's to say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there's people getting rich selling horse manure,
too. They're bagging that and selling it by the load, so I guess
they figure, why wouldn't somebody sell music like that?'' he
asked. ``But we have some pride in our product. We're doing what we
like. They have their niche, we've found our niche, and our niche
happens not to be what's on the radio.''

POLAROID PUTS FINGER ON SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Polaroid Corp. wants to make it cheaper to get to know you.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cambridge, Mass. company is primarily a camera-maker,
it is also trying to lower the cost of computer security
identification systems. At a trade show in Florida this week it
planned to announce partnerships with 11 other companies to produce
keyboards and other devices using a modest Polaroid-built
fingerprint reader that costs around $50 a copy.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big markdown from existing scanners that sell for
$1,000 or more, and Polaroid bets computer users will want to
substitute a thumb or forefinger for the multitude of passwords
they now must remember to log on to computer networks or access
their voicemail.
</P>
<P>
   Users might include banks, airlines, and other large companies
that control access to sensitive databases. Manufacturers that buy
devices from Polaroid say they are in talks to sell tens of
thousands of keyboards, with the Polaroid device installed, to
customers such as Continental Airlines, TRW, and Bausch &AMP; Lomb.
</P>
<P>
   So far, these customers have been slow to embrace fingerprint
systems, partly for fear employees would regard them as intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   But Phil Bruno, vice president at keyboard maker Key Source
International in Hayward, Calif., says many businesses are warming
to the idea, privacy concerns notwithstanding. ``We have major
corporations calling us and saying, `It's time, we're ready,' ''
Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Polaroid's devices is an optical scanner that
analyzes a half-inch section of a person's finger or thumb pressed
against a optical-glass window.
</P>
<P>
   The skin is illuminated by two small diodes, and the image
captured by a chip that functions as a digital camera. Software
then analyzes the image and places a marker at each point at which
the lines in the fingerprint stop or split.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a two-dimension map that Polaroid says is the
equivalant of a 300-digit password.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras are known as ``optical scanners.'' Some devices made
by competitors like Veridicom Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif., require
users to touch a finger directly onto a sensitive surface attached
to a semiconductor. The systems then use electrical signals to
measure the difference between the fingertip's ridges and valleys
to create a similar identifying code.
</P>
<P>
   Systems using the latter method can be smaller than the
three-inch-long box that houses Polaroid's optical scanner, and
produced at similar prices. Polaroid says its devices are simpler
to make and more durable. Vendors like Biometric Identification
Inc. of Sherman Oaks, Calif., buy both types of sensors for
different situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got an outdoor environment, where you might have
water on the screen, then you might want to use Polaroid,'' said
Biometric manager Julie Web.
</P>
<P>
   In an office, where many different people might use the same
fingerprint scanner, devices that use electrical signals sometimes
are more versatile, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the trade event, the CardTech/SecureTech show in Miami, her
company will show off software systems that can integrate both
types of sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid came to the fingerprint-scanning business through its
identification unit, which mostly produces drivers licenses and
voting and Social Security cards for 37 states and foreign
governments such as the Republic of South Africa. (Polaroid
equipment also will be used by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor
Vehicles starting in October.)
</P>
<P>
   The company began using fingerprint readers to authenticate
voters in Third World elections, but found the readers bulky and
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Philip J. Scarfo, Polaroid's vice president of biometrics,
decided the company would produce its own scanners at the start of
1999. The company has made just a few thousand test copies to date.
But by 2001, he said, it could be making a ``a few million'' at an
assembly plant in Norwood. Chips for the scanner are produced by
Atmel Corp. in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At least one gunmaker is considering buying the print-scanner as
part of a ``trigger-lock'' system, Scarfo said. But the biggest
market, he expects, will be desktop computers at companies that do
business via the Internet.

 YOUNG LAWYERS' STOCK RISES WITH INTERNET  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Kendall was 28 and just a few years out of law
school in 1997 when his firm, Boston's Goodwin Procter &AMP; Hoar,
asked him to work with a Harvard business student, Stig Leschley,
who needed help making his e-commerce idea a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall soon became the firm's main contact for the young
entrepreneur, who grew his start-up into Exchange.com, an Internet
retail site that fetched $200 million when Amazon.com bought it
last year. The young lawyer not only offered Leschley legal advice,
he talked him through setbacks and celebrated his successes with
him. They went to parties together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary thing when you think about it,'' Kendall
says now. ``It was me, a fourth-year associate, who developed that
relationship, not an established partner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old economy, the chances of junior lawyers like Kendall
having such close contact with a client were virtually nonexistent.
An associate's lot in life was to do legal research and support
senior lawyers in the hope, after seven or eight years, of becoming
a partner in a firm. But in the new economy, where 20-somethings
often head dot.com companies, law firms now see young lawyers like
Kendall as a crucial resource in attracting legal work from the
Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these companies are being run by young people, and
when they go looking for a lawyer, they want somebody with the same
energy level, the same excitement for what they're doing and
similar comfort with computers and the Internet,'' says William
Lee, managing partner at Hale and Dorr in Boston. ``It's usually
not older lawyers they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, many associates are being liberated from the staid
confines of law libraries to take on business-getting roles, in a
reversal of the traditional law-firm hierarchy in which a select
group of partners serve as rainmakers. To win their services, firms
are offering huge salaries, fast-track career paths and perks that
range from Palm Pilots to stock options in the high-tech start-ups
the young lawyers represent.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, even after an associate completed the grueling
apprenticeship to become a partner, it could take years to develop
a client roster. But more than ever before, law firms are running
on Internet time, relying on some on their youngest lawyers to woo
high-tech companies, the fastest growing sector of corporate legal
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who are six, seven, eight months out of law
school out there networking and bringing in business from emerging
companies,'' says Charles Dougherty, a senior partner at Boston's
Hill &AMP; Barlow, which is offering associates large bonuses and the
possibility of making partner in five years for wooing companies
into its ``incubator'' program for startups.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty said that the firm's associates ``are members of every
entrepreneurial group and technology-related council that exists,''
and that many have classmates who are involved in start-ups. ``We
are encouraging an entrepreneurial approach for the associates, and
it is enormously successful,'' Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Most firms where associates are taking a larger role in wooing
clients still keep a seasoned partner on those accounts to handle
tough legal issues and to help manage the work. But firms have
found that emerging high-tech companies need hand-holding as much
or more than they need experienced lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want people they know will care about what they're
doing,'' Dougherty says. ``They see these young lawyers as
co-entrepreneurs who are working with them and are there for them.
A lot of these guys are learning how to run a business as they go,
and they need people to brainstorm with and toss around ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason young lawyers have been put in charge of those
accounts is, simply, that they are often about the same age and
connect more readily with fledgling entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with all things in the lottery-like universe of the
Internet, it's the lure of sudden riches that's driving such
geologic shifts in law firm protocol. Firms want to inexpensively
establish as many relationships with infant Internet start-ups as
possible _ betting that a few will turn into giants with steady
needs for legal services and healthy budgets to spend on them.
Armies of associates can forge more of those relationships at a
lower cost than senior partners whose time is worth more money,
firms say.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an attempt to hang on to young lawyers, who recently
have fled big firms in droves to become in-house lawyers for
Internet companies _ a gamble for more exciting careers while
possibly hitting it big with portfolios of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big dream for lawyers right now,'' says Brian
Lenihan, a seventh-year associate at Hill &AMP; Barlow who has built
his own client list of some 50 high-tech and venture capital
companies under the firm's ``incubator'' program. ``Everyone talks
about that as their end-game: Go to work for a dot-com and get the
options. Everybody's thinking about the brass ring.''

   Attempting to counter the siren song of the Internet, some
Boston firms have upped starting salaries for first-year associates
to as much as $155,000, up from last year's standard of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Hill &AMP; Barlow, have launched incentive programs
that give associates bonuses of up to half their salaries for
bringing in new clients and racking up billable hours. To further
sweeten the pot, the firm has begun taking ownership interests in
start-up clients and offering a stake in the companies to
associates. In addition to money, Hill &AMP; Barlow lets the most
successful associates trim two years off the standard track to
being a partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to realize they don't have to climb some long
ladder in order to do interesting work and get somewhere in the
firm,'' Dougherty says.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it's too early to tell whether the strategy
will work for law firms or even whether it will last. With the
unnerving tumble of the Nasdaq Composite stock index in recent
weeks and the resulting shakeout of marginal Internet companies,
some now wonder whether the dot-com gold rush will soon cease,
ending law associates' moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   But most believe that whether or not the frenzied pace of the
past two years continues, the old order has been abolished by the
Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a momentum there that's not going to be thwarted,''
Dougherty says. ``The world has changed, and this is definitely the
model of the decade that law firms will have to follow.''

&HT;     PUBLISHER TESTIFIES HE OFFERED FAVORABLE EDITORIALS FOR MAYOR'S
SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The publisher of the San Francisco Examiner has
testified that he offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable newspaper
editorials in exchange for the mayor's support of the Hearst
Corp.'s plan to buy the competing San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Publisher Timothy O. White, testifying Monday in an
antitrust case that seeks to block the purchase, said the
editorials would favor some of Brown's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't affect the journalism side,'' White added. ``It
would affect the editorials.''
</P>
<P>
   White made the statements under questioning by Joseph M. Alioto,
the lawyer for Clint Reilly, who filed the antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued later Monday, the Hearst Corp. said, ``It
is not now, nor has it ever been, a policy of the San Francisco
Examiner to trade favorable editorial coverage for any gains,
including political influence. The newspaper's coverage of the
mayor, and his policies, stands on its own merit.''
</P>
<P>
   White said in the statement, ``I was tired and confused by the
question. The implication of my answer that the pages of the
Examiner can be influenced, under any circumstances, is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the trial shed light on Hearst's efforts to
acquire the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle for $660
million and sell the Examiner to the publishers of a free newspaper
will result in Hearst owning the only metropolitan daily paper in
San Francisco, allegedly an illegal monopoly that would reduce
competition for news, advertisements and subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a former candidate for mayor who has criticized the
Examiner's coverage of him and has tried to buy the paper, is
asking U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker to bar Hearst
permanently from buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to settle the lawsuit failed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied Reilly's allegations and says he lacks legal
standing to bring the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer, said the afternoon Examiner
cannot support itself outside of a joint operating agreement under
which it splits profits with the larger San Francisco Chronicle,
which publishes in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Examiner is an economically failing company, Hearst
could buy its rival Chronicle and close or sell the Examiner
without violating antitrust laws, Halling said. That has happened
in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an extensive sales effort, no one was willing to pay for
the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted to take it for free,'' Halling said in his
opening statement. ``The marketplace has spoken. This is not a
viable business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Hearst agreed to transfer the Examiner to the Fang
family and to give them a $66 million subsidy for publishing costs.
</P>
<P>
   White answered Alioto's questions about his contacts with Brown
after Walker overruled Halling's objections that they were hearsay
and irrelevant to antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning focused on several internal Hearst Corp.
communications obtained by Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has complained about critical coverage in the
Examiner, was one of several San Francisco politicians who opposed
Hearst's initial plan to buy the Chronicle and close the Examiner
if no buyer could be found, saying he wanted the city to have
competing dailies.
</P>
<P>
   White testified that he made the offer of editorial support to
Brown at a Sept. 1, 1999, lunch, at the height of the mayor's
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail written later that day, White reported on the
meeting to George B. Irish, head of Hearst's newspaper division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Willie how I was going to justify to my superiors in
New York wanting to support him and cooperate with him when he was
seeming to go out of his way to make our lives difficult,'' White's
e-mail said.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto asked White if he was trying to suggest to Brown that the
Examiner might be more supportive if the mayor backed Hearst's bid
for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that specifically,'' White replied. ``We had talked
earlier about working together on a number of priorities for the
city that we shared.''
</P>
<P>
   White said the shared priorities included reforms of the city's
public transportation system. He said the Examiner's support would
come from its editorial pages, not its news reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were doing a little horse-trading yourself,'' Alioto
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   And the trade was that the Examiner would not be so hard on the
mayor in editorials if he supported Hearst's purchase of the
Chronicle, Alioto asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the implication,'' White testified.
</P>
<P>
   According to White's Sept. 1 e-mail, Brown also told White that,
although he had written U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno expressing
concern about Hearst's acquisition of the Chronicle, he did it to
placate the city's governing Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the lunch, according to the e-mail, Brown said he had
only one complaint about his coverage in the Examiner: that he was
being judged ``guilty by association with some really bad people''
who were the focus of an FBI investigation of the city's handling
of minority contracting.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor added that he appointed an independent panel to
investigate the matter, in response to the FBI case and ``our
relentless reporting,'' White said in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hearst statement issued Monday, Examiner Executive Editor
Phil Bronstein said he was at the lunch with White and Brown, and
that there was ``no negotiation of press coverage of any kind.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White, previously the publisher of the Hearst-owned Times Union
in Albany, N.Y., also testified that he was sent to San Francisco
to rally the Examiner's smaller staff and to persuade the Chronicle
Publishing Co. to sell the Chronicle to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Chronicle and the Examiner have had a joint
operating agreement in which they share printing, advertising and
circulation. The newspapers split all revenue evenly after joint
costs, but then use their respective shares to pay for their
independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's owners refused to extend the agreement beyond
2005, so Hearst faced the daunting and expensive task of competing
directly with the Chronicle after that, competition that could have
killed the Examiner, White testified.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, he said, was that outside of the joint
operating agreement the Examiner would lose millions of dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle refused to participate in promoting Examiner
subscriptions, which Hearst believed was an effort to weaken the
Examiner further, White testified.
</P>
<P>
   White said he told Chronicle representatives that Hearst meant
to compete, although ``I didn't believe that we could go
head-to-head.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a March 13, 1999, e-mail to Irish titled ``Strategic
Initiatives,'' White outlined several strategies, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Exploring alliances with Dean Singleton's Alameda Newspaper
Group or the Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Openly analyzing'' the division of printing presses and
other physical assets shared with the Chronicle under the joint
operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   White testified that the plans were intended to make the
Chronicle owners think Hearst meant to engage them in a costly
newspaper war and that it was better for them to sell the Chronicle
to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called this the blowfish theory,'' White testified. ``It is
what it is, but it is as big as it can be made to look.''
</P>
<P>
   White said Hearst was trying to convince the remaining one-third
of the Chronicle's owners who did not want to sell the newspaper to
Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to come out of the bushes screaming, whether
we're holding spears or not,'' he said of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle Publishing Co. agreed in August 1999 to sell the
San Francisco daily to Hearst. The company also decided to sell
some other properties to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto is trying to show that the Examiner could compete as an
economically independent newspaper and that Hearst's plan to close
it or sell it to the Fangs violates antitrust laws.

BEHIND THE LINES IN TIME-WARNER VS. DISNEY WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, the acrimonious stalemate between Walt Disney
Co. and Time-Warner Inc. _ which deprived 3.5 million homes of
Regis Philbin's smiling face Monday night _ involves only the
narrow question of how much Time-Warner must pay Disney for the
right to carry its cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger battle is also taking place, one with possible
implications for the proposed megamerger of Time-Warner and AOL and
for the digital, broadband future that television is moving toward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one behemoth clashing with another for positioning,''
said Joseph Turow, a professor of communications at the Annenberg
School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. ``It's
a tango of sorts, positioning themselves for the new media
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tango'' involves two huge corporations that may be viewed
with little sympathy by the public, especially now that Time-Warner
has upped the ante by blacking out programs from Disney-owned ABC,
including Philbin's blockbuster ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire''
on cable systems in such major markets as New York City, Los
Angeles, Houston, and Raleigh-Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Iran-Iraq war: You root for them both to lose,''
said Tobe Berkovitz, a communications professor at Boston
University. Added Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co. in New York: ``Remember John Belushi in `Animal
House' yelling `Food fight!'? This is sort of the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a deeper issue percolating beneath the arguments
over how much Time-Warner should pay Disney for such channels as
Toon Disney and a soap-opera channel, and whether the Disney
Channel should be part of the basic cable package on
Time-Warner-owned systems, rather than a premium service for which
customers pay extra.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC spokeswoman, Julie Hoover, brands it an ``abuse of
power'' for Time-Warner to black out ABC programs in the middle of
a crucial ``sweeps'' month. Then she cut to the heart of the
matter: ``If this is the way Time-Warner behaves when they are a
gatekeeper of cable systems, how will they behave when they are a
gatekeeper not only of cable systems but of the Internet? People
won't even know they are losing access to alternative services;
they will be cut off at the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kane, president of WABC-TV in New York, wasted no time in
labeling the pulling of the ABC signal from Time-Warner in New York
a ``frightening foreshadowing of the implications of the
Time-Warner/AOL merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Time-Warner, for its part, says this is no more than a dispute
between two large corporations. ``They've been trying to wrap this
around the AOL merger from the beginning,'' a Time-Warner official
said. ``We felt we had a deal, and suddenly the ground rules
changed from the Disney perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, both sides have invoked the Federal Communications
Commission to bolster their positions. Time-Warner insists that
under FCC rules, it is not allowed to continue to carry a network's
signal without a transmission agreement in place. (The deal with
Disney has expired.) Disney, however, contends that FCC regulations
do not allow a cable operator to stop airing a broadcast station
during a sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculate that Disney may be playing hardball in an
effort to slow the AOL-Time Warner merger by persuading federal
regulators to look at the competitive and consumer issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be hoping someone will come in and set some rules
on how much you can own,'' said Dan Amundson, research director at
the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``Even if they don't stop
the Time-Warner/AOL merger, maybe they can tie them up for a while
by persuading the Justice Department that there's too much
concentration of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Turow added: ``Disney does not own cable systems, and that can
potentially put Disney and other companies, like News Corp., in a
difficult position when negotiating with cable firms. . . .
Time-Warner clearly has control over the exhibition arena into
people's homes. Disney wants to get its (product) into those homes,
and in order to do that, it has to have leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   That leverage may be the fact that federal regulators are
looking closely at everything Time-Warner does, especially actions
that might be seen as anticompetitive. ``Disney may be thinking
`AOL is under scrutiny in Washington, so maybe the atmosphere is
better for us,' '' Wolzien said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Disney and Time-Warner met Monday with staff
members of the Federal Communications Commission, but at day's end,
the stalemate had not been resolved.

RUMINATIONS ON WRITING, AND READING

FACE TO FACE 
A Reader in the World 
By Lynne Sharon Schwartz 
Beacon Press, 214 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lynne Sharon Schwartz is a poet and a novelist, but she may be
best known as the author of the memoir ``Ruined by Reading,'' a
passionate personal exploration of the solitary joys of reading
that has become a favorite of book lovers. As its subtitle implies,
``Face To Face: A Reader in the World'' is a collection of essays
about the author's experiences, mostly with other people and, in
the title piece, with a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, neither a cat lover nor a cat hater, is compelled to
spend four months minding an orange cat, never named. She
determines ``to make something interesting of our enforced
sojourn,'' and she does, with this essay. The cat's company
provokes her to reflect not only about the feline character (``It
had no moral nature and apparently did not learn from
experience''), but about her own life. Face to face with herself
she thinks about her preference for solitude, about the nature of
time present and time past, about the limits of love. The animal's
presence prompts the unnerving memory that she had loved her own
infants most easily when, like the cat, they ``lay docile on my
lap, showing no will and making no abrupt movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz is at home with the personal essay, a form that,
ideally, bonds writer and reader into a kind of intimate literary
friendship. In an instructive introduction to the anthology ``The
Art of the Personal Essay,'' Phillip Lopate writes, ``At the core
of the personal essay is the supposition that there is a certain
unity to human experience.'' Schwartz's work illustrates the point.
Some of these pieces are a lot more satisfying than others, but in
each she shares her humanity with her readers. These essays are
candid, refreshingly modest, self-analytical but free of what
Lopate calls ``the stench of ego.'' And they're often surprising,
as Schwartz's thoughts lead her in unexpected directions, and into
unforeseen corners of her self, for example, from considering the
cat to contemplating her own limitations as a mother.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's main subject is herself, her own reactions and
thoughts, but she writes about a variety of people and experiences.
In ``Help'' she faces up squarely to her own liberal guilt about
hiring Mattie Lou Colton, an African-American woman, to look after
her children and her house while she goes off to work.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with Colton was long and warm, but an
awkwardness remained between them, a regrettable distance of class
and race and occupation that for Schwartz has come to epitomize
``all that is wrong with our human arrangements in this place, in
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's subjects range widely. She writes about the sudden
absence of a close friend, about a brilliant student emotionally
scarred by his war experiences in Vietnam, about sitting for a
photographer ``so thoroughly at one with his craft that he can hit
the target with his eyes closed.''
</P>
<P>
   She revisits the pleasures of literature when she describes
listening to tapes of David Case reading Anthony Powell's epic
12-volume novel, ``A Dance to the Music of Time.'' Hearing actors
read fiction, Schwartz decides, is a mixed blessing. ``We're all
having a wonderful time at the expense of . . . what? The words
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of words is also the subject of ``Found in
Translation,'' perhaps the most interesting of these essays, in
which Schwartz writes about the challenge of translating Liana
Millu's ``Smoke Over Birkenau,'' a memoir of imprisonment in the
women's section of Auschwitz. Schwartz struggled with the Italian
idiom, with typos in the text, with the role of words in expressing
the inexpressible.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can words come first?'' she asks. ``What about the truth
of a piece of writing, its meaning or content?''
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that words must come first because ``a writer's
real allegiance is to language, words and their proper placement,
without which there is no truth or meaning.''

AIMING AT CARROLL, GRIER SANK HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If you bury the old coach, don't expect the
new coach to embrace you.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lesson to be learned from the firing of Patriots vice
president of personnel Bobby Grier by Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   When Pete Carroll was in his final days last season, the rats
deserted the ship. So did Grier, a normally quiet man who
apparently was overwhelmed by the possibility of facing
unemployment himself and unknowingly took steps to assure it.
</P>
<P>
   When Grier began to tell every microphone and pen he could find
that Carroll and his assistants had talent enough to win but hadn't
properly developed it, he revealed a long-running beef he'd had
with Carroll over the use of the talent Grier had imported for him.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been worse, and when Grier began to be
heavily criticized in this corner as disloyal, he tried to back
away from his own words and claim he'd never meant to criticize
anyone, just point out his faith in his draft picks and a
philosophical difference with Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the more he talked, the more Grier hanged himself. Who will
ever forget his explanation of failed No. 1 draft choice Chris
Canty? Grier could have had Sam Madison, who has become a Pro Bowl
cornerback in Miami, but opted for Canty, who was described in this
space on draft day as ``a slow dwarf,'' which turned out to be
exactly what he was.
</P>
<P>
   After Canty proved to be a bust in New England and was released
last year, Grier claimed he'd never intended for Canty to be a
starter; he merely had drafted him as a backup, he said. Who uses
No. 1 draft choices to select backups?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, if they know what they're doing, which more and more it
began to seem Grier did not. At least not as well as a man he
helped drive out of the organization: Charley Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Once Grier worked for Armey, but Bill Parcells and owner Bob
Kraft shook up the organization several years ago and jumped Grier
ahead of Armey even though it was Armey who set the draft board in
the good days when the Patriots took Curtis Martin and Ted Johnson
and Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, according to sources inside the Patriots' organization,
Grier began to undermine Armey now that he was his superior,
finally embarrassing him in his final days in New England when he
was a lame duck by sending him home when the draft meetings were
held. The implication was that the most honest man in that
organization might reveal trade secrets to his future employers,
the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what goes around comes around some day, and this was one
of those days. While Armey sits in St. Louis with a promotion to
general manger, a new multiyear contract extension, and a Super
Bowl ring partly the product of the talent he brought in the past
three years (including MVP Kurt Warner), Grier is unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   After what he did to Carroll and his staff when they were
already down, he may be in that condition considerably longer than
Armey was.
</P>
<P>
   But what really doomed Grier were two things: his disastrous
1997 draft and his near-total waste of the six high draft picks the
Patriots acquired from the New York Jets as ransom for losing
Parcells and Martin to them.
</P>
<P>
   When Belichick announced his decision to ax Grier and his
assistant Dave Uyrus, he said, ``This is an unpleasant thing for me
to do. I recognize that Bobby Grier has made significant
contributions to the New England Patriots over many years, in
various capacities, as has Dave Uyrus. I enjoyed a good working
relationship with Bobby in preparation for the recent draft, as I
did in 1996. This decision is unrelated to any specific event,
performance or personal relationship. It is more a reflection of my
general feeling to proceed in a new direction with regard to the
structure and operation of our personnel department.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was not being disingenuous. The sacking of Grier did
not relate to any specific event or performance, it related to a
string of them. Primarily, it related to the players he drafted
since taking over from Armey and Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   It also related to the hiring of longtime Belichick confidant
Scott Pioli, who came with him from the Jets as ``assistant''
personnel director. If Bobby Grier understood anything about how
the NFL works, he knew Pioli wouldn't be his ``assistant'' for
long.
</P>
<P>
   What he should have known as well was that the minute he
publicly flogged Pete Carroll, he had to hope the man who replaced
him didn't come in the way Belichick did _ with the power to fire
him.
</P>
<P>
   You don't keep Sammy ``The Bull'' Gravano around if you're John
Gotti, and you don't keep Bobby Grier around if you're Bill
Belichick.

   BOSTON _ Brushbacks. Knockdowns. Hit batsmen. Emptied benches.
Intimidation. Enforcers. Suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a day when the Patriots finally fired their de facto
general manager, Pedro Martinez's Sunday war with the Indians was
Sports Topic No. 1 around Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro lit the match when he dusted Tribe catcher Einar
``Cameron'' Diaz, and it was a raging blaze by the time the Red Sox
flew out of Ohio Sunday night. Cleveland newspapers called Pedro
``chicken'' for staying in the dugout during the nonfight, and Red
Sox general manager Dan Duquette returned fire when he said, ``The
Indians can't beat him within the rules of the game. They have to
look at alternative ways to beat Pedro Martinez. This isn't
anything new, but our guys stayed within the rules. Pedro was doing
his job in terms of pitching inside. Pedro has beaten Cleveland
consistently and they've tried different strategies _ stepping out
of the batter's box, taking a long time when they are hitting.
Those things are all designed to upset Pedro because they can't
beat him within the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, Indians general manager John Hart declined to
respond to Duquette's remarks, but he told the Cleveland
Plain-Dealer, ``You have to give Pedro his due, but the only thing
that took the edge off is that I think he threw a pitch that was
way too close to Einar's head. That was a dangerous pitch. It was
just too much of a coincidence. I just think Pedro Martinez is
better than that. He threw right at Einar's head.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like the Elian Gonzalez case and the Reggie Lewis trial.
Everyone has an opinion . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was the pitch to Diaz an effective ``purpose pitch'' or designed
to maim? . . . Should Jose Offerman have charged the mound when he
was hit by Charles Nagy? . . . Will there be any suspensions handed
down by Frank Robinson? . . . Was Pedro chicken for staying in the
dugout when the benches emptied? . . . Was it poor judgment to risk
blowing a game by retaliating or did Pedro's plunking of Roberto
Alomar serve to further galvanize the Boston clubhouse? . . . What
happens next time the Sox meet the Tribe (June 8)?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: The Sox have come a long way since the
days of ``25 players, 25 cabs'' and Joe Price's solo charge up San
Juan Hill when none of the other Sox came out of the dugout for a
would-be fight in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said the Sox had been in communication with Robinson's
office (one of the great plate-crowders, Frank is now in charge of
doling out the suspensions). The Duke said he expected no
suspensions. Pedro said he warned Offerman that he would be hit,
and told his countryman/teammate not to charge the mound. Cleveland
manager Charlie Manuel said Pedro started the whole thing.
Shortstop Omar Vizquel said Pedro should be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette is right about one thing: Pedro is 7-0 lifetime against
Cleveland and has hurled 20 consecutive scoreless innings against
the Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not a big secret he can beat us,'' said Vizquel.
``I know for sure he can beat us, but I think it's pretty
(expletive) that a guy who is dominating the game the way he is,
and the guy who got two hits off him, he's got to go up and in on
him at his chin. I don't know for what. He should be suspended just
for what he did. Just like any other player.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel added, ``He deliberately hit the guy (Alomar). Not only
that, watch the game, somebody must have a film, but if you watch
Diaz get two hits off him and after he got the second double he
turns around on the mound and stands there and stares at him, kind
of mockery at him. Then when he comes up again, he throws two balls
at him right at his face. To me, without a doubt he's throwing at
him. I mean, he started it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro was still claiming to be little more than an innocent
bystander, just doing his job with no emotions attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should get suspended for that,'' he said.
``I'm not worried, either, but I don't think I should. (Throwing
inside) has been going on for as long as the game has been going
on. Suspend me? Why? I didn't fight. I just do what I have to do
for my team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the ace of this staff I'm out to say that I'm going to
protect my hitters. I understood what I have to do and I told Offy
not to come out if he gets hit. And if they hit him, what am I
supposed to do? I'm not going to change a thing. There's no
discipline to be issued. There was no fight. This is all part of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diaz is a catcher. He knows that pitching inside is part of
the game. He is just a rookie. He should take his place and
understand that after he gets two knocks on changes away, he has to
expect something in to try to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a ton said and written about this when the Sox and
Indians play again next month and especially when they host the
baseball-palooza (five games in three days) at Fenway in September.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the playoffs, folks? How great will this be
when/if Pedro toes the rubber at the Jake again in October? Pedro
has infuriated Cleveland. The Duke has said they can't beat him
without cheating. The Indians say he's gutless. Red Sox-Indians
could be as good as Sox-Yankees. Maybe better.

WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE TO SEE OR DO, NEW ENGLAND'S GOT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grass may seem greener elsewhere, but there's nothing wrong
with discovering your own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders have so much to enjoy, especially in summer, that
it almost makes no sense to travel afar. Within a couple of hours
of Boston, one can be in the mountains or wilderness, vacation at
the ocean or a lake, stay on a farm, a luxurious resort, or an
island, live it up in a world-class city, savor great dining and
great art, relax, or enjoy an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Few other areas in the country offer as much diversity of
vacation options _ especially ones packed with fun, history, and
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Just scanning the list of happenings throughout New England
proves there's too much to do in one season. So plan on ``doing''
New England again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Even the experts at Yankee Magazine agree. Carol Connare,
associate editor of this year's Travel Guide to New England, notes:
``When I was younger, I traveled to every corner of North America,
including living for a time in Alaska. I had a notion that to `see
the world' I had to go far away, but I was always drawn back to New
England. I've learned that some of the greatest treasures are in
your own backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Need proof? Then just hit the road; you'll find treasures in
every part of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my best vacation experiences were on an island off the
coast of Maine. It was a seven-hour drive to get there, but worth
every minute. It was Maine living at its best. Fresh lobsters right
off the boat, great island life, a wonderful hidden sandy beach on
the ocean (sure, the water was freezing, but it'd do for a dip once
a year; otherwise we'd head for the old quarry where the water was
perfect). It was a wonderful change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   Then we started moving. First to Orange, Mass., just a 1
1/2-hour drive from Boston but a world away. This was Hidden
Massachusetts, the state's most rural county, where I realized that
one didn't have to drive seven hours to escape city life _ it was
within commuting distance. Laurie Bongiormo, innkeeper of
Kennybunkport, Maine's, wonderful White Barn Inn, would tease me by
noting he could reach Boston in less time than it took me to drive
from Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I live in the Blackstone Valley area that encompasses
parts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, I'm making new discoveries
even closer to Boston. Providence, for example, is a delight. Get
off Interstate 95 and within a few blocks on College Hill are
beautiful homes dating to the early 1800s, and on the other side of
95 is Federal Hill, filled with taste-tempting Italian restaurants.
Why, the actual city is even more interesting that the TV series
``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island may be small but it has a lot to offer. Newport,
already known for its grand ``cottages'' _ those palatial former
summer homes of some of the then richest people in America, will
soon have another grand mansion to tour.
</P>
<P>
   Rough Point, the home of Doris Duke, a woman of mystery and
great wealth, will open for limited tours in May. What makes this
105-room mansion along the Cliff Walk special is Duke herself. The
home, which has been closed since her death in 1993, will appear
just as she left it after living there for 70 years. While Duke was
a very private person, she is responsible for maintaining Newport's
Colonial era. She founded The Newport Restoration Foundation and
paid millions to buy and restore some 84 Colonial-era houses in the
city. The foundation now owns and rents the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, though, is still my town. And, what a summer it is
planning. The John F. Kennedy Museum offers ``Jacqueline Kennedy:
Travels Abroad'' beginning May 27, highlighting her travels as the
first lady to Paris, India, Pakistan, Rome, and London. Then on
June 2 the museum opens an exhibit on JFK's love of the sea and
sailing.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Museum of Science has two blockbusters. ``Secrets of
Aging,'' now on view, is the first comprehensve exhibit on the
topic of aging. More than 500,000 people are expected to view it.
Opening June 22 is the ``T Rex Sue Exhibition'' featuring a cast of
the largest and most complete T Rex specimens ever found.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts will serve up a stunningly beautiful
show, ``Van Gogh: Face to Face,'' begins July 2 through Sept. 24.
It showcases more than 70 of the artist's finest portraits.
</P>
<P>
   And, for a real spectacular, see Tall Ships 2000. The July 10-21
festival will feature 70 ships from 30 countries. There will be a
grand parade, public boarding of ships, and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   This is but a small sample of what New England has to offer.
Other activities include white-water rafting, hiking, sailing on a
windjammer, going on a whale watch, and lots more.

NEWPORT: A CITY OF FIRSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newport, R.I., is filled with ``firsts.'' Among other things,
this historic and colorful city was:
</P>
<P>
   --The first to have a ferry service (1657).
</P>
<P>
   --The first to pass a traffic ordinance (1687).
</P>
<P>
   --The first to host a circus in this country (1774).
</P>
<P>
   --The first of the 13 colonies to declare independence from
England (May 4, 1776).
</P>
<P>
   --The first to have gas-illuminated streetlights (1803).
</P>
<P>
   --The first to host the International Polo Match (1886), Open
Golf Tournament (1895), and National Lawn Tennis Championships
(1899).
</P>
<P>
   --And the first place in the United States where an arrest was
made for an auto violation (1904). The driver was charged with
going an astonishing 15 miles an hour!
</P>
<P>
   (For more information on this city of firsts, call the Newport
County Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau at 401-849-8048, write to the
bureau at 23 America's Cup Ave., Newport, RI 02840, or visit
www.gonewport.com.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Which New England state was once an independent
republic? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
And the winner is . . . Congratulations to Ellen Sahl of Sharon,
winner of the Wacky Shorts Contest. She and her husband, Scott,
will get a free Boston-Bermuda cruise aboard the Norwegian Majesty
for submitting a photo of the wackiest pair of Bermuda shorts,
chosen from more than 125 entries. And those shorts, designed by
Sahl and her 11-year-old daughter, Vicki, are wacky indeed, with
foil accents and bananas, too. For a photo, see Page XXX. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``A friend told me she visited a little shop in Maine and
asked the saleslady if she carried a certain commodity. `We used to
stock them,' she replied in a perfectly rational tone, `but we
always sold out right away, so we stopped ordering them.' '' _
Joseph Gallagher. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: You may know or surmise that Boston's Beacon Street was
named for a beacon once located there. But did you know that the
beacon was actually a bucket of tar? The bucket was mounted atop a
65-foot pole and was to be lighted to warn of any enemy approach.
But it was never lighted, and today a 60-foot column topped with an
eagle to commemorate the War of Independence is in its place.
What's more, in the 17th century the street was called Poor House
Lane because it was near an almshouse. Nobody would use the word
``poor'' in connection with Beacon Hill today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: New Hampshire forbids selling the clothes you
are wearing to pay a gambling debt. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Old friend: All states have official flowers or birds, but
Connecticut has a state fossil, too. It's called eubrontes
giganteus, a large, three-toed impression in the Connecticut Valley
that dates to early Jurassic days, some 200 million years ago. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel bookshelf: Boston's North Shore is really a special place
(and not just because I live there). Just how special becomes
readily apparent when reading ``Hidden Treasures on Boston's North
Shore'' by Harriet Webster (Commonwealth Editions, $12.95). In
addition to describing the many attractions and events in
communities from Lynn to Newburyport, the book offers clues to a
literal treasure worth $3,000 _ a limited-edition Millennium Clock,
provided by Descenza Diamonds in Peabody. Following those clues
will lead you to a document that proclaims you the winner. Monthly
hints to interpret the clues will be given at the Descenza store
and on the publisher's Web site, www.commonwealtheditions.com.
Happy hunting. &QL;

IF THE MIGHTY CAN LOSE THEIR SHIRTS, SO CAN YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his new book about day trading, ``Dumb Money,'' Joey Anuff
recounts the moment when he realized he had to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to day trading looking for a way out of the choas of
blind betting, of surprise swings that could make or break me,'' he
says. ``But when the crucial moment comes _ and it comes every day
_ the sheer unknowability of the future gets in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   George Soros can probably sympathize with Anuff. So can Julian
Robertson. The two, among the most legendary hedge fund investors
of our time, have been humbled of late by the ``unknowability'' of
the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson shut down his hedge fund in March after heavy losses
and investor withdrawals. Soros isn't quitting, but he said Friday
that he is scaling back his operation and reducing risk after a
string of disappointments. Two of his top deputies quit altogether.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the news might cheer average investors the way
average golfers are heartened when they watch Tiger Woods flub a
shot. ``See, even the best of the best screw up.'' But upon closer
examination, investors probably ought to take a different lesson
away from the troubles of Mssrs. Soros and Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   The duo's woes suggest that investing is hard and humbling and
risky _ words that generally have not been associated with the
stock market in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Soros' Quantum fund racked up incredible gains over the past 30
years, making big bets on interest rates and currencies. In 1992 he
earned a profit of $1 billion by betting successfully against the
British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, however, Soros' luck has soured. In 1998
he lost big when the Russian economy collapsed. More recently he
bet wrong on the euro. He thought it would strengthen against the
dollar; instead it has plunged to new lows.
</P>
<P>
   Soros' chief lieutenant, Stanley Druckenmiller, invested heavily
in biotech and tech stocks last year. The strategy worked until
April, when both groups lost ground in a huge sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up,'' Druckenmiller told The New York Times. ``I
overplayed my hand. I should have sold in February.'' As day trader
Joey Anuff writes in ``Dumb Money,'' ``To be a day trader is to
make regret into a lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's Tiger Management funds had a great run for 18 years,
turning in annual gains of 30 percent. But in the last 18 months,
Robertson has stumbled badly. He lost money betting on the Japanese
yen and on Russian bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Druckenmiller, he avoided technology stocks, preferring
to stick with old economy names like General Motors and US Airways.
When those stocks lost value in 1999 and early this year, investors
headed for the exits and Robertson had to sell to meet redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   It should be pointed out that another legendary investor, Warren
Buffett, has taken his lumps sticking with old economy names like
Gillette and Coke. Shares in Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway,
are trading below where they were two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: there are lots of ways to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Both Soros and Robertson have suggested they are victims of a
changing market. With so many investors and so much information, it
is hard today, they argue, to find the inefficiences they once
exploited. Robertson also blamed the herd mentality behind the
runup in technology stocks. ``We are in a market where reason does
not prevail,'' he groused.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is true. But maybe it is just sour grapes. The
history of Wall Street is the history of booms and busts, euphoria
and gloom. The time between the ups and downs may have shrunk, but
otherwise it is hard to see that things have changed very much.
</P>
<P>
   What tripped up Soros and Robertson was the ``unknowability of
the future.'' How could they know the Russian economy would tank?
Or that tech stocks would go straight up for months only to go
straight down again? Or that the euro would be worth 92 cents, not
$1.10?
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't. And neither can the rest of us. That doesn't mean
we need to drain our stock funds and keep all our savings in
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   It does mean, however, we should be mindful of the risks
inherent in investing. It means we should make small bets, not big
ones, diversify our holdings, maintain a long-term perspective and
always have some cash around for a rainy day. It is boring advice
to be sure, but advice worth keeping in mind.
</P>
<P>
   If the giants can lose their shirts, so can we little guys.

THE NEXT HOT SECTOR: CONVERGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Looking for a sector that still excites venture capitalists?
Here's one: It's a foggy place full of entertainment and
possibility _ somewhere between cyberspace and your living room
couch _ where TV and the Web mingle.
</P>
<P>
   They call it ``convergence'' (because all things Web-related
must have strange monikers) and it's the catch-all term for a
burgeoning industry looking to squeeze more profits out of tube
watchers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, advertisers already spend $45 billion a year peddling
their brands and products on television. But as the TV moguls and
Web gurus see it, there's a whole new world in linking the data
flow of the Web and the television set.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers want to better target their audiences, the players
in this business say. They want to lead ready buyers to the Web to
spend money. As for TV viewers, they may want to sort through
programming options more efficiently, and even be able to pause a
show midstream to grab a beer. Some may want to communicate with
other fans of their favorite shows.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean people are going to be sitting around watching TV
on a computer screen? Well, some might. But that's not the main
point of the convergence game. Larry Namer, founder of E!, the
television show and online entertainment news site, says: ``You're
going to give me something in a postage stamp-sized box, and expect
me to get excited about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Namer's Steeplechase Media Inc. in Los Angeles is a partner with
Boston's MarkeTVision in a venture called Television.com. They're
approaching the convergence arena from the standpoint of giving TV
watchers a reason to love TV more, and to log onto related Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company produces, for example, 30-minute programs aimed at
specific groups of people. They market the program intensely, on
the Web and elsewhere, and then try to lure viewers to make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   MarkeTVision chief executive Andrew Miller gives the example of
a half-hour Grateful Dead video for VH1. Fans of the band watched
the show, then jumped on the Web. The show spurred the sale of
15,000 CDs in one week, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The key to success, Miller argues, is not only the product but
being able to market the concept itself. Thus the name
Television.com. ``With all the dot-com clutter that's out there,''
he says, ``we decided brand had to come first.'' His company is
also helping back sites such as Telephone.com and Sportsfan.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other players are working on ``video streaming,'' to improve the
look of video on the Web. Still others are making digital tuner
cards for computers, so they can work like TVs. Cable companies are
building boxes to put on your TV that will be much smarter than the
old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of activity around convergence is based on the idea
that all those TVs and computers in 100 million households each
around the country have got to be more useful together than apart.
The tube is turned on seven hours a day in the average home,
according to Nielsen Media Research. People are on the Internet an
average of just 30 minutes a day, Nielsen says.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet use is climbing, and some of that could be driven
by TV watchers. Steeplechase's Namer says his own kids, young
teens, come home from school and watch MTV; then they go to an AOL
chat room to chat with friends about what they're watching. It's
possible to do all that on one screen, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 million people currently have the technology set up
at home to interact with their TVs, Namer says. But industry
followers predict that could rise to 40 million within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   There's already interactive Judge Judy on the Web. There are
sites like TVparty.com and jumptheshark.com, which are online
communities for television trivia aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   And even if you're not the type to go online to yak about
``Seinfeld'' reruns, you might like your TV to alert you to any
Bogart films or sports shows running this week. Namer also foresees
your own stocks strolling across the screen when you watch the
business news, instead of random Dow or Nasdaq stocks. Even the
weather or news reports could be tailored to individual interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about making your TV work harder for you, Namer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the weather in Paris this weekend. I'm not
going there.''

BEAUTIFUL PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't add Chris Ambler's voice to the chorus of
bricks-and-mortar merchants complaining about the online
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic twist, Internet retailers are sending business to
his store, Frame Smart in Chestnut Hill. More than a year ago, the
store manager began noticing that customers in this highly wired
locality were bringing in more prints and posters purchased from
Internet sites such as eBay.com.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to be framed was a print of a colorful Keith
Haring painting. Since then, FrameSmart has welcomed a steady
stream of prints, paintings, and even cereal boxes into its store.
And it's more than eBay. Sellers now include art.com, iwant.com,
and antiques sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ambler estimates that FrameSmart has picked up an extra $500 in
sales each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has definitely helped us,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Losing weight on the Web &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea of managing weight loss while blobbed out in front of a
computer may elicit a few giggles. But Web firms like Inner Workout
Inc. of Boston say they're serious about helping consumers slim
down.
</P>
<P>
   Like a fitness center, innerworkout.com charges consumers an
annual membership fee of $100. The only problem is that the package
doesn't include a Stairmaster or weights. (And forget about squash
courts.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Web site offers ``learning themes'' and personal
storytelling with tips from experts in nutrition, exercise
physiolog,y and women's psychology. Women are given tools to learn
``InnerSkills'' to help them identify and change behavior ``from
the inside out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible to see the difference when you address a
weight problem at the root-cause level,'' gushes Michelle Toth,
chief executive of Inner Workout.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to critics, the company attached a Brown University
study that shows Internet weight loss programs may help reduce the
public health burden on obesity.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't it be more effective to tell consumers to log off
and take a walk? That's not likely to happen. Weight management
sites are no different than any other Web businesses: They want to
keep consumers from clicking off. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Divided by sound systems &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a vice president at Hifi.com and HerHifi.com, a sister
consumer electronics store that targets women, Roger Sullivan
should have known better than to buy a stereo system without
consulting his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was last fall, merrily hauling the boxes into their
new Marblehead home, only to be greeted by his wife's stony stare.
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer electronics business, a gaping gender divide
exists. Research shows men view sound systems as a purchase of the
heart, and they want all the bells and whistles, including extra
power. Women tend to be more practical, aiming for visually
appealing equipment that doesn't take up too much space.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need jets roaring overhead,'' joked Laurie Nova,
HerHifi.com's program manager.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan now agrees. His wife, Ada, told him that the stereo did
not fit into the home decor, so the couple decided on a more
compact model.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does make a difference,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Loyalty only goes so far &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new research report questions whether e-commerce companies'
loyalty programs create loyal shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 percent of online consumers said they take part in
loyalty programs that give incentives to frequent buyers, according
to a survey of 1,200 Internet shoppers by Jupiter Communications
and NFO Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Few shoppers, however, said incentive programs were important in
motivating them to step up their purchases, the survey showed.
Instead, online consumers placed higher values on easy returns,
customer service and product selection.
</P>
<P>
   Even travel e-commerce sites, early innovators in developing
aggressive incentive programs, ``have yet to extend their retention
and loyalty efforts to the Web effectively,'' Jupiter analysts
wrote.

MIT GRADS HAVE MADE A PLACE FOR THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ATHERTON, Calif. _ Snickering about snow in Boston, more than
200 graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gathered
beneath a balmy California sunset last week to reflect on their
good fortunes _ and not just in regard to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   There was Bill Porter, MIT class of '67 and founder of ETrade,
who is about to launch an online securities exchange for stock
options. Steve Kirsch, class of '78, was also there, still glowing
from the sale of Infoseek Corp., a search engine he founded and
sold to Walt Disney Co. last year for more than $1.7 billion.
Nearby was Kevin J. Kinsella, who busied himself after graduating
from MIT's Sloan School of Management in 1967 by starting 53
software and biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   These are the ``nerdtrepreneurs'' that have made MIT famous in
Silicon Valley as the school that keeps pumping out technologically
astute eager beavers with a penchant for starting their own
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with William R. Hewlett, MIT class of '36, who
cofounded Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto in 1939, the list of
Silicon Valley companies founded by MIT graduates has grown to
include Intel Corp., National Semiconductor, Genentech, and Cirrus
Logic, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 survey by BankBoston counted 287 companies in Northern
California founded by MIT graduates. These companies had sales of
$66 billion and worldwide employment of 287,000. They accounted for
one-quarter of the manufacturing jobs in Silicon Valley, and 29
percent of the area's electronics jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the MIT family of companies has further swelled with
the addition of the ``dot com'' babies. Some have become familiar
names, like Webvan Group Inc., started by Louis Borders, a one-time
MIT graduate student and founder of Borders Books. But many others
are just arriving on the scene, hoping to become the next ETrade.
These include Portfolio Corner Inc., Smartbasket.com, Xporta,
Quova, and Embark.com.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies' founders were at the MIT reception last
week at the Menlo Circus Club, noshing on caviar, smoked duck and
truffled mousse pate. All were instructed by their invitations to
dress in ``uptight East Coast business attire,'' and most complied,
looking slightly awkward in their navy blue suits, many of which
haven't been worn in years.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts of the event were Richard Schmalensee, dean of the MIT
Sloan School of Management and a member of the MIT class of '65,
and Kenneth P. Morse, a '68 graduate and managing director of the
school's Entrepreneurship Center. Both wore chunky school rings
featuring the MIT beaver _ nature's star engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Morse, who helped found 3COM, also sported a tie with beavers
busily chopping down trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Stanford tree,'' joked Morse in reference to a
decades-old friendly rivalry between MIT and Stanford University,
whose official seal features a tall tree.
</P>
<P>
   There are 7,000 MIT alumni in Northern California, most of them
in Silicon Valley, said Schmalensee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley has the third-largest concentration of MIT
alumni after Boston and New York,'' he said. Asked why MIT grads
are drawn to the Valley, he replied: ``MIT is about innovation, and
so is Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception, meant to recognize distinguished alumni, is also
a vehicle for the school to cultivate potential donors. Porter of
ETrade has donated $25 million to the Sloan School, while Kirsch's
$2.5 million donation has resulted in an auditorium at the school
named after him.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella, who founded 53 companies and has promised $1 million
to MIT in his will, reflected on the effect the school has had in
his endeavors and how it distinguishes him from the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for the underpinnings in science and
technology that the school gives you,'' said Kinsella. ``Without
that, you'd be easily bamboozled by technology. We know how to ask
the right questions.''
</P>
<P>
   David Weitz, a partner with Silicon Valley law firm Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati who graduated from MIT in 1987 with a
bachelor's degree in chemistry, summed it up this way: ``What's our
legacy here? We're the underrecognized builders of Silicon
Valley.''

&HT;     BUSH FIRES BACK WITH A WEAPON NAMED RICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What presidential race?
</P>
<P>
   Like most Americans, for weeks I've been avoiding thinking about
Al Gore and George W. Bush. On the whole, I'd rather think about
Cream of Wheat or rice pudding.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, out of the mushiness of the two presumptive
nominees' presumptive campaigns appears an intelligent,
strong-willed, articulate woman.
</P>
<P>
   Is it relevant to add that she's black and beautiful, as well as
an expert on Russia?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is relevant, because Condoleezza Rice is working as a
top adviser for Bush, who needs the votes of women and minorities.
When she rebuts a speech by Gore, as she did the other day, voters
wake up, take a look and do some listening.
</P>
<P>
   You can disagree with Rice on matters of foreign policy, or
whether America should invest billions in questionable technology
to counter a missile threat that doesn't exist. But you have to
agree she's livened things up.
</P>
<P>
   Rice attacked Gore on behalf of Bush on Sunday, but she's also
Bush's anti-Quayle device, a counterweight to Bush's lack of
weightiness.
</P>
<P>
   Gore once said Bush is ``noticeably blank'' on foreign policy.
Bush filled in the blank with Rice, a former Stanford University
provost and political science professor, and a member of the
National Security Council under Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bush the Younger called her a ``brilliant
person (who) can explain to me foreign policy matters in a way I
can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, W, it's like a football rivalry. China, Russia and
the United States are like Yale, Princeton and Harvard. They'll
always be rivals, no matter what their standings or academic
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we always have to be ready to counter threats from small
rogue powers like Iraq and North Korea _ in Ivy League football
terms, the equivalents of Columbia and Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice is a big football fan and served on the search committees
for two Stanford coaches, so I'm sure she could come up with even
better football analogies for international affairs, ones that W
could understand, of course.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine asked, ``If Condoleezza Rice is so smart, why
is she working for George W. Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   I think the question should be reversed. If George W. Bush is so
dumb, why does he have Condoleezza Rice working for him?
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. When Rice cut loose against Gore, there were a
couple of messages.
</P>
<P>
   She accused Gore of misrepresenting Bush as an out-of-touch cold
warrior when it comes to Russia and China, and it was pretty
effective. Where Gore had linked Bush to an extremist like Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Bush was fighting back with an
expert of the stature of Rice.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite an implicit message: Bush trusts an intellectual
black woman to go out front for him, and she believes in him enough
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If I were Al Gore, I'd be getting nervous. In fact, to judge by
Gore's idiotic pandering on the matter of Elian Gonzalez, I think
he is getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a reasonably smart guy (or so we are told) who is
impossible to listen to. Bush is a regular guy (or so we are told)
who also is impossible to listen to. But he may be smart enough to
pick good people to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   Where Clinton stole all but a few planks of the Republican
platform, Bush is sneaking in and capturing some core Democratic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls show that the new environmentally friendly,
educationally cuddly Bush has pulled ahead of Gore, particularly in
education policy, where he has made a ringing call to wipe out
illiteracy. The Los Angeles Times even reported Bush has pulled
ahead of Gore among women.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Texas has a terrible record on health care and
the environment, and that Gov. Bush of Texas is an executioner, fan
of concealed weapons and opponent of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Image is everything, I guess. Gore persists in having an
irritatingly blank image, and when he tries to shed that image he
tends to shout, exaggerate or pander. Meanwhile, Bush is playing
nice guy, shedding the ghost of Bob Jones, and taking advice from
people like Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Her image is everything, too. When she speaks of the 1972
Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty as a ``historical artifact'' that
stands in the way of deploying a nuclear missile defense system,
she sounds more credible than Bush would.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful he knows what ``ABM'' stands for, or could
reliably pronounce the word ``artifact.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's all very expensive baloney. Tests of anti-missile
missiles all have failed miserably. Hitting a warhead in space, one
that can come from points as distant as North Korea or Iraq, is
like trying to hit a needle in midair with a rock.
</P>
<P>
   The mythical missile defense system is an expensive boondoggle,
one that still threatens the Russians because it is, in fact, an
offensive weapon in terms of nuclear game theory _ if it were
possible to build such a weapon, that is.
</P>
<P>
   It's really just an offensive weapon for Republicans and
Condoleezza Rice to use against Al Gore, and he's on the defensive.
</P>

CORRECTS NAME OF WRITER TO REED JOHNSON 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Douglas Sills was hired to rescue people from the
guillotine, he didn't realize that the neck he was saving might one
day be his own.
</P>
<P>
   His mission? To star on Broadway in ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' a
splashy, big-budget musical based on Baroness Orczy's 1905 novel
about a mysterious do-gooder who spares innocent victims from
France's Reign of Terror.
</P>
<P>
   The risks? The musical's composer was Frank Wildhorn, a Broadway
outsider who'd already scored a monster hit with the pop-flavored
``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' making him something of a marked man in the
byzantine New York theater world.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel's'' $10 million budget put
it in a league of messianic expectation usually reserved for
blockbusters like ``Ragtime'' ($12 million) and ``The Lion King''
($15 million).
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sills, a strapping, multitalented Michigander with more
top-flight California theater credits to his name (South Coast
Repertory, Mark Taper Forum) than Marie Antoinette had corsets.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Pimpernel's'' producers initially had hoped to land a
big-name Hollywood or Broadway star for the challenging lead role,
Sills' versatility, charisma and technical finesse won them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always call him Danny Kaye, because he reminds me of that
kind of a talent who can also sing,'' says Wildhorn, comparing
Sills to the late great comic actor.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the New York critics skewered ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' when it opened at the Minskoff Theater in the fall of
1997. Yet Sills emerged unscathed. He was praised for his
dual-edged portrayal of the title character, who masquerades by day
as the English fop Percy Blakeney but changes at night into the
dashing, elusive Scarlet Pimpernel, whose true identity is hidden
even from his wife, Marguerite. (A pimpernel, as if you didn't
know, is a type of primrose whose star-shaped flowers close up in
bad weather, suggesting its secretive nature.)
</P>
<P>
   When the ailing show was stripped down and remounted the
following November _ this time to generally rousing reviews _ Sills
was the only principal actor to return. Revised once more by
Wildhorn and bookwriter-lyricist Nan Knighton, and transferred to
the smaller Neil Simon Theatre, it ran for a total of 363
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In praising the downsized, revivified musical, The New York
Times' Vincent Canby described Sills as ``a true singer'' who ``has
great fun with the role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sills continues to dominate the show,'' Canby wrote,
``though now the show is working with him, instead of ignoring
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills' efforts in helping ``Pimpernel'' gain a second life were
rewarded with Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle award
nominations for best actor in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Sills will reprise his star-making performance when
``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' opens an eight-week run at the Ahmanson
Theatre in his hometown of Los Angeles. In November, he'll be back
in L.A. playing the silent film comedy king Mack Sennett in the
Reprise! Broadway's Best in Concert production of the legendary
1974 musical ``Mack &AMP; Mabel'' at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   If Sills' turn in ``Pimpernel'' has suddenly put him on the
musical theater fast track, you wouldn't guess it from his
self-effacing attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never call myself deserving, because I've known so
many far more talented actors,'' he says, speaking by phone from
San Francisco, where the show was recently parked during its
current national tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be surprising to me if I were back waiting tables
some day. The younger people in the cast hear that and they say,
`Are you kidding?' They think it's false modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Show biz's legendary fickleness aside, it seems unlikely Sills
will be sponging countertops anytime soon. Having just passed the
big 4-0 mark, he's enjoying the type of ``overnight success'' that
sometimes happens to people who've been toiling for years in the
regional theater trenches.
</P>
<P>
   For roughly the past decade, Sills has been seen regularly at
many of Southern California's top professional stages. He performed
in the Los Angeles premiere of ``Chess,'' is a two-time Drama-Logue
winner and was a charter member of the Antaeus Theatre Company, the
acclaimed North Hollywood-based ensemble that specializes in
classic plays.
</P>
<P>
   He also has appeared in recurring TV roles in shows like
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Coach'' and ``Party of Five,'' and was the
original Los Angeles producer of the hit bio-musical ``Dinah Was,''
starring Yvette Freeman as blues legend Dinah Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of such dues-paying persistence, it wasn't until
age 35 that Sills made his Broadway debut in ``Pimpernel.'' Kevin
Kline was among those originally considered for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled that Kevin Kline had other engagements,'' Sills
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had to audition six times, Sills has outlasted his
original ``Pimpernel'' co-stars Christine Andreas (Marguerite) and
Terrence Mann (as the Pimpernel's arch-rival Chauvelin), as well as
their replacements, Rachel York and Rex Smith. The touring
production, once again directed and choreographed by Robert
Longbottom (``Side Show''), co-stars Amy Bodnar and William Paul
Michals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success alighted on my tree, and I'm just glad that my bough
was sturdy enough to support it,'' Sills says with an agreeable
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sills' theatrical roots reach all the way back to his Ann Arbor,
Mich., childhood, where he grew up in a tightly woven Jewish clan.
</P>
<P>
   His adolescent idols weren't brawny American Method actors in
torn T-shirts, but silver-tongued classicists like Laurence
Olivier, Ralph Richardson, Richard Burton and John Gielgud. He
remembers that after telling his mother he wanted to be an actor,
she made him watch the 1935 film version of ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel,'' starring that most urbane of Anglo leading men, Leslie
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   As a student at Detroit's artsy Cranbrook Academy prep school,
Sills gained further high-culture exposure. Even though ``everyone
in my family got law degrees,'' Sills' father took him aside one
day and encouraged him to try the stage. He made his debut as Matt
in a suburban dinner theater production of ``The Fantasticks,'' and
moved to San Francisco to pursue acting after graduating from the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Pimpernel eight times a week is highly demanding,
requiring Sills not only to sing and dance but also parry, thrust
and otherwise make like Errol Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, he follows a strict regimen of workouts, weight
training, protein shakes, voice lessons and plenty of sleep. After
nearly two years of playing the show in New York, he had to take
several weeks off to recharge before starting the current national
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not brain surgery,'' he says, ``but it is an exact
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills credits his classical training at San Francisco's vaunted
American Conservatory Theater (ACT) with helping him balance the
two halves of his Pimpernel persona: the prissy Percy and the
suave, butt-kicking Pimpernel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more fun playing Percy,'' he acknowledges. ``To hear the
sound of laughter roll through an audience and know you had a part
in building that is the greatest feeling you can have. It just
fills your chest to bursting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills also has proven adept at handling Wildhorn's voluble,
r&AMP;b-influenced show numbers. In his other life as a pop-rock
composer, Wildhorn has written songs recorded and performed by
Whitney Houston, Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish, Liza Minnelli and Trisha
Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're songs that drift in your mind, not songs you take
apart with tweezers,'' Sills says in praising Wildhorn's
commercially oriented, accessible tunes, which have propelled shows
like ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' (now in its fifth year on Broadway) and
``The Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sills has proven he can buckle his swashes with the
best of 'em, he has plenty of offers coming his way. He'll be
starring opposite Vanessa Williams in an upcoming period musical
set in New Orleans' red-light district. And he's mulling over a
possible Shakespearean double bill: the title role in ``Hamlet''
and perhaps ``Much Ado About Nothing'' with Southern California
director Mark Rucker.
</P>
<P>
   Sills' professional fortunes appear to be peaking at an
opportune time. For many years, the actor says, a family tragedy
had cast a long shadow over his life and those of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed while
taking off from Detroit Metro Airport en route to John Wayne
Airport in Orange County. Of the 153 people on board, only a
4-year-old girl survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers that evening was Sills' older brother. He
was heading to Arizona and was planning to visit Sills and watch
him perform in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is one of those things where everything in your life
divides into before and after,'' Sills says. ``When I look back at
that period of my life, there are some really dark colors in my
palette.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many months in New York, Sills says, having the chance
to perform ``Pimpernel'' in Los Angeles was a big factor in his
signing up for the national tour.
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn applauds that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you want to lead with your best, and Doug is our
best,'' Wildhorn says. ``But also, Sammy Davis Jr. once had a
conversation about roles, and those roles that come once in a
lifetime, and you have to be careful because you may never get
another one. Yul Brynner never got another `King and I,' and Rex
Harrison never got another `My Fair Lady.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if I may say so, I think it was very smart of Doug to
continue the journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he now keeps a second home in New York _ ``The house that
`Pimpernel' bought,'' he calls it _ Sills considers L.A.'s Fairfax
District his true nesting place..
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a longtime partner and various beasts of the animal
kind,'' he says in a gently amused tone.
</P>
<P>
   So what's his next derring-do mission?
</P>
<P>

&HT;     SAN ANTONIO, RIO DE JANEIRO EARLY COMPETITORS FOR PAN AM
GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JERRY BRIGGS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, known for
its seaside beauty, romance and party spirit, will compete against
San Antonio for the right to host the 2007 Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Krier, president of the Greater San Antonio Chamber of
Commerce, said Rio de Janeiro will provide stiff competition. The
Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) is expected to announce the
2007 host city in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a strong candidate,'' Krier said, ``and they will
have the strong backing of the national government. But, they do
not have a local organizing committee yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rio de Janeiro's candidacy had been rumored since February after
Brazil dropped out of contention for the 2008 Summer Olympics. That
bid became official on April 27 when Rio made its plans known on
the first day of the PASO meetings in San Jose, Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Also at that meeting, U.S. Olympic Committee President Bill Hybl
formally announced San Antonio's 2007 candidacy for the Pan
American Games. No other city made an official statement, though
Guadalajara, Mexico, appears to be interested, Krier said.
</P>
<P>
   Rio, stretched across a coastal plain and on slopes of coastal
mountains at Guanabara Bay on the Atlantic Ocean, is legendary for
its picturesque location.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Frost Jr., the chairman of the San Antonio Sports
Foundation, said it's important to be in the same race with Rio. He
is not intimidated by the battle for the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it means we're an international city like
Rio,'' Frost said, ``but we do feel we can host the games as well
or better than Rio. It's exciting to be in a competition with them.
It's important for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Krier said he was one of nearly 20 people from San Antonio in
Costa Rica. The city sent five delegates to the PASO meetings. The
rest were members of the San Antonio Free Trade Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we walked into the reception with 18 or 19 people, that
was impressive,'' Krier said. ``I think we're off to a pretty good
start.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the PASO meeting, Krier said it appears certain
that the Dominican Republic will be able to host the 2003 Games, as
planned. It had been rumored that the Dominican Republic might not
be able to stage the event because of economic concerns stemming
from damages caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, all doubts have been erased,'' Krier
said. ``They made a big presentation and the gist of it is, 'We are
looking forward to having you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Pan American Games are held every four years in the year
preceding the Summer Olympics. Athletes from nations in the Western
Hemisphere will participate.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee considers it the third biggest event
on its calendar behind the Summer and Winter Olympics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jason and the Argonauts'' plays into the worst impulses of the
Robert Halmi _ Sr. and Jr. _ aesthetic. It has a sort of ``we're
fooling nobody'' pretension, suggesting that there's something
remotely valuable about the proceedings because, after all, it has
stilted dialogue and is based on Greek mythology (not even that,
the press notes virtually shriek _ this is based !ital!on a true
story!). It's simply a happy coincidence, the Halmis would wink,
that as an added bonus, we get to wallow in special-effects
monsters and exotic beauties naked from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Jason London, who convincingly played way-wasted dudes in
``Dazed and Confused'' and ``Broken Vessels,'' proves here why he's
never been cast in a period epic before. He stars as Jason, the guy
favored by the goddess Hera, who leads the proverbial ragtag army
on a journey to many Islands of Polysyllabic Names, which results
in the death of a lot of supporting players and lizardy beasties
and somehow ultimately leads to the overthrow of the corrupt reign
of his evil uncle, Pelias (Dennis Hopper _ who knows why).
</P>
<P>
   London's manner is way too contemporary for this, and the gobs
of bluster contributed by his supporting cast make him seem
spectacularly wooden. He doesn't so much detachedly deliver lines
like ``I have greater things to ponder than games'' or ``(They)
only hide their fear and cowardice'' than sidestep them completely,
as if he's a bit dismayed to be spouting such nonsense decked out
in hair extensions, sandals and leather breastplates.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, none of his co-stars have to put in as much screen
time. Hopper bares his teeth a lot, but doesn't even bother to
overact, which somehow amounts to an even sorrier spectacle. Angus
McFadyen (``Cradle Will Rock'') and Olivia Williams (``Rushmore'')
engage in some risibly rancorous repartee as Zeus and Hera
bickering over Jason's fate _ they don't so much comment on the
action as bring it to a dead halt.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Henstridge shows up briefly as the queen of an island of
evil babes with designs on Jason and his crewmen. (Here's how bad
it gets for London _ he looks like he's suffering a hernia in his
love scene with Henstridge.) Derek Jacobi sports goofy eye makeup
as a blind soothsayer, and Frank Langella sleepwalks through a turn
as the king who protects the Golden Fleece, this saga's Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are what sell this thing, although they
won't likely convert anyone with fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's
1963 ``Jason'' (which also had the virtue of being much, much
shorter). There's an island that's really a sleeping giant (so-so
effects), some ghastly looking harpies (pretty cool), a mechanical
bull (shrug), sword-fighting skeletons (no real improvement on
Harryhausen's) and a dragon protecting the fleece (not bad).
</P>
<P>
   Too bad you have to sit through so much humdrum blather to get
to the good parts. Jason may end up with the gold, but it's the
audience that gets fleeced.!end! &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Jason and the Argonauts.'' &QL; 
What: Special-effects-laden miniseries based on the Greek myth. &QL; 
The stars: Jason London, Dennis Hopper, Angus McFadyen, Olivia
Williams, Jolene Blalock, Frank Langella, Brian Thompson, Derek
Jacobi, Natasha Henstridge. &QL;

commission headed by former Sen. Bill Brock is recommending an

SAN FRANCISCO _  WINECHEF  _ Winemakers spend most of their working
day thinking about taste, aroma, balance and texture. Many are also
renowned amateur cooks _ among them Marco Cappelli of Swanson
Vineyards and Art Finkelstein of Judd's Hill. &HT;    On separate nights, they each prepared a dinner-party menu of
their own invention while sharing some thoughts on the pleasures of
the table. Although their cooking styles could hardly be more

 wine combine to make a refreshing drink  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Charanga is the type of Pan-Latin restaurant that
wants to make you reach for a glass of sangria. It's little wonder,
then, that this Mission District hot spot serves the best in the
city.
<P>
   Most versions are watered down or lightened up, but chef
Gabriela Salas, who hails from Costa Rica, uses only fruit and
sugar to flavor the red wine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the blend is a simple mix of Taylor Hearty Burgundy, a
Valencia orange, Granny Smith apple, lemon and sugar. It's potent
stuff and goes well with the food at this innovative restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The name Charanga comes from a Cuban style of music and dance.
Partner Rita Abraldes is Cuban-American, and both women bring their
heritage to the restaurant. Much of the food has a little kick,
making the sangria all the more popular. While the interior is bare
bones and noisy, the food is excellent and prices are under $10.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the sangria is ideal for outdoor barbecues or any
robust dish with a dash of spice. For a real splash, try it with a
curry dish.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Charanga, 2351 Mission St. (between 19th and 20th streets),
San &LR;   &LR; Francisco; (415) 282-1813. Dinner Tuesday-Saturday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Taylor Hearty Burgundy. &LR;  It's true. Of all the inexpensive
box wines on the market this has the most character. It's smooth
and not too tannic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The citrus fruit. &LR;  The whole diced fruit, pith and peel
included, intensifies the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; RUBY RED SANGRIA
</P>
<P>
   This sangria will keep in the refrigerator for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 Valencia orange, unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 Granny Smith apple, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch dice

   3 bottles (750 ml each) California Burgundy wine, preferably
Taylor Hearty Burgundy
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:

 BEST WAY: Storing Lettuce   By Noel Advincula 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; There is nothing more frustrating than getting
ready to fix a wonderful salad, only to find out that the lettuce
and greens in the refrigerator have wilted and turned brown.
<P>
   To find out how to prevent that from happening, The Chronicle
Food department tested five ways of storing iceberg lettuce and
mesclun greens mix in the refrigerator. We used the refrigerator's
crisper drawer because it has higher humidity intended to help keep
greens fresh. As a control, we left a head of lettuce and some
unwashed mixed greens out on a shelf in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The three storage mediums used were self-sealing plastic bags,
self-sealing plastic bags perforated with holes for air circulation
(We imitated the perforated vegetable bags that are no longer
available in grocery stores by poking holes in self-sealing plastic
bags), and moist paper towels that were changed daily. We also put
a head of lettuce and some mixed greens directly into the crisper,
without any wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   We also cored, washed, drained and placed one head of iceberg
lettuce in a self-sealing plastic bag while keeping the other heads
intact.
</P>
<P>
   We checked the produce after one, two, three and five days.
After day one, there was no appreciable difference between the
condition of the head lettuce and the mixed greens in any of the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   After the second day, all the produce stored in the crisper
drawer looked fresh and had a crisp texture and mild, sweet taste.
The head of lettuce stored on the shelf had started to wilt and the
leaves showed signs of frostbite. The mixed greens on the shelf,
which were put in an open plastic container, had wilted
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, the lettuce and greens on the refrigerator
shelf were ready to be thrown out. The head of lettuce and mixed
greens left unwrapped in the crisper were also showing signs of
decline. The rest of the samples still looked good _ especially the
head of lettuce and mixed greens wrapped in moist paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth day, the mesclun mix had started to taste bitter.
The cored and washed lettuce was still crisp, but the part where
the core was removed was brown and unappetizing. The lettuce and
greens in the perforated plastic bags had brown edges.
</P>
<P>
   After the fifth day, the only lettuce that wasn't wilted,
bruised or discolored was the head that was stored in an airtight
self-sealing plastic bag. The best mixed greens were those wrapped
in moist paper towels and those stored in self-sealing plastic
bags.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Best Way &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To get the best results, store the head of lettuce in a
self-sealing non-perforated plastic bag in the crisper drawer. Do
not core or wash it if you intend to keep it for more than two
days. Remember to wash the lettuce before using it.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed greens should be rinsed and either wrapped in moist
paper towels or placed in a self-sealing non-perforated plastic
bag. It is key to handle the mixed greens as little as possible
before storing to prevent bruising.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Pasta and Chiles Trigger a Fusion   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; In the last few years a new word has been added to
our California cuisine, ``fusion food.'' This usually describes a
hybrid Asian/Western dish, but my experience has been that most
attempts at fusing don't fuse. You may have had better luck than I.
<P>
   This intriguing idea has prompted me to attempt fusing, but with
Italian and Mexican ingredients. You might well ask why, but I can
only suggest you try the following recipe for Spaghetti with Green
Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The spaghetti, of course, is Italian; the Green Sauce, most
definitely, is not. The sauce is a spirited blend of garlic,
cilantro leaves, a touch of hot or mild chile, some onion and those
marvelous lemony-tasting tomatillos that are so common in Mexican
salsas, sauces, stews and braises.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't fuse for you, you can always use the Green Sauce
on beans, fish or on an avocado salad.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SPAGHETTI WITH GREEN SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   21/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   Green Sauce
</P>
<P>
   4 large garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 mild Anaheim pepper or 1 jalapeno pepper (found in produce
section of the market)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium-size yellow onion, peeled
</P>
<P>
   8 tomatillos (miniature-sized green tomatoes covered with a
green or brownish paperlike husk. Also found in produce section of
markets)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Parmesan cheese (don't buy grated cheese; it loses
flavor)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Cooking the Spaghetti:  &LR; Put the water in a large pot, add
the salt and stir. Put the pot on high heat until the water begins
to boil. Put the spaghetti in the boiling water, stir for a good
minute so the strands don't stick together.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the heat down, but keep the water boiling; set the timer
for 12 minutes. When the timer rings, fish a strand of spaghetti
out with a fork, run it under cold water and if it is tender and
not firm or hard, it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't finished preparing the sauce, just turn off the
heat under the pot of spaghetti and let it stay hot until you
finish the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Green Sauce:  &LR; Remove the papery outer skin from
the garlic cloves; set the cloves aside. Remove the cilantro leaves
from the stems, measure 1/3 cup; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever pepper you decide to use, cut off the stem and split
the pepper lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds and veins and discard.
Cut the pepper into 1/4-inch strips. Holding the strips in a
bunched up pile, cut into 1/8-inch pieces crosswise. Set aside.
( &UR; Note: &LR;  You may want to wear rubber gloves to do this if you are
using a jalapeno pepper. The oils can burn your skin.)
</P>
<P>
   Place the onion half flat-side down on a cutting board. Holding
the half firmly with one hand, make about seven vertical slices
into the onion, from stem end to root end; don't slice completely
through the root end. Next, slice crosswise. Repeat with the
remaining onion half.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the papery outer skin of the tomatillos. Cut off the stem
tops and discard. Cut each tomatillo into 1/4-inch slices from the
stem end down. Holding each sliced tomatillo together, slice into
small pieces crosswise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing the Green Sauce:  &LR; Put the chopped garlic, cilantro
leaves, pepper, onion and tomatillos in a small saucepan; set
aside. Just before you drain the spaghetti, warm the green sauce.
This isn't to be cooked, just barely warmed so the spaghetti stays
hot.
</P>
<P>
   Grate about 3/4 cup cheese so it is ready to sprinkle over the
spaghetti and green sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the drained spaghetti with the warmed green sauce. Top with
the Parmesan. You may serve this family-style in one large bowl and
pass to each person, or portion onto individual plates.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 3.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Frozen North Produces Gold-Medal Ice Wines  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; In the world of rare wines, the sweet nectar known
as eiswein stands out. Months after the end of the regular harvest
in Germany and Austria, some intrepid vintners gamble with nature.
Winter comes early in Northern Europe and by late December/early
January, a hard freeze has turned the grapes to frozen green
marbles. When the conditions are just right _ and it doesn't happen
every year _ the frozen grapes are rushed to the winery and pressed
while still solid, thus concentrating the sweetness of the juice.
<P>
   Eisweins always have been a rarity in Europe. In recent years,
Canadian wineries, mainly in Ontario and the Okanagan Valley of
British Columbia, have moved to the head of the list of quality ice
wine producers because conditions there are right just about every
year for ice wine.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian ice wines scored big in recent U.S. wine competitions.
Jackson-Triggs, Okanagan Valley, won four gold medals at the
Pacific Rim International Wine Competition, three for ice wines.
Earlier, Jackson-Triggs ice wines won two gold medals at the Grand
Harvest Awards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key developers of Canadian ice wines is Inniskillin,
located in Canada's Niagara Peninsula wine region, about an hour's
drive from Toronto. Inniskillin was founded in 1975 by Donald
Ziraldo and Karl Kaiser. Ziraldo is the son of Italian immigrants,
and Kaiser, an Austrian winemaker, is regarded as an expert in
cool-climate grape growing. Kaiser and Ziraldo started making ice
wines from Riesling and Vidal, a French-American hybrid grape,
releasing the first commercial ice wine in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the grapes in other North American wine regions were
crushed, Inniskillin's Riesling and Vidal grapes are still hanging
on the vines, protected from birds with a sweet tooth by heavy
netting. When the temperature drops to 7 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the natural sugar is between 38 and 46 percent by volume, the
grapes are frozen and ready to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Inniskillin produces a range of ice wines, including one that is
oak-aged and one that is sparkling. These are relatively
low-alcohol wines, 9.5 to 10.5 percent is common, with residual
sweetness levels of about 200 to 240 grams per liter, or 20 to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The following wines were tasted recently and still are available
in select stores and through  &LR; WineShopper.com &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Inniskillin 1998 Niagara Peninsula Riesling Ice Wine, ($65 for a
375 ml bottle), a bright silky blend of apricots and nectarines,
with a touch of honey balanced by good acidity; Inniskillin 1997
Niagara Peninsula Oak Aged Vidal Ice Wine, ($80 for a 375 ml
bottle), an intriguing blend of toasted oak, vanilla and ripe
apricots that lingers in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Serve these wines as dessert or with fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ice Wine or Late Harvest? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the key differences between ice wine and late-harvest
wines is the absence of botrytis, a beneficent mold at harvest in
most botrytized or late-harvest wines. Ice wine derives its
sweetness from long grape-hang time, concentrating the grape
sugars. Many late-harvest wines also benefit from long hang time,
but much of their distinctive character and complexity is the
benefit of botrytis, or noble rot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Changes Afoot &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Niebaum-Coppola Estate, producers of Rubicon, a Napa Valley
Bordeaux red blend has announced that it will not produce a 1998
Rubicon. The reason given by Francis Coppola and winemaker Scott
McLeod is that 1998 was a difficult vintage and grape quality did
not come up to their standards for Rubicon.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma's Lou Preston, a master vintner and bread baker, is
adding to the Preston Vineyards line, with Preston of Dry Creek.
The new line, anchored on Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc, is made
from estate grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Far Niente partners Gil Nickel, Dirk Hampson and Larry Maguire
announce the formation of a new winery, named Nickel &AMP; Nickel, in
the Napa Valley. Located on a 40-acre site across from the Robert
Mondavi Winery, Nickel &AMP; Nickel will specialize in small lots of
vineyard-designated wines.

<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Interest is mounting for value-related Spanish red wines,
especially those from La Rioja and Ribera del Duero. As with other
imported wines, Americans often don't understand the label language
on Spanish wines.
</P>
<P>
   Although various Denominacion de Origen (Denomination of Origin)
in Spain have different requirements for wine aging terms, the
following basics are the same for all Spanish red wines:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ciranza: &LR;  This term is reserved for wines aged in wood and
bottle for at least two years, six months of which must be in oak
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Reserva: &LR;  Red wines must be aged a minimum of 36 months in
wood and bottle, at least 12 months in oak casks. For white and
ros &LR; e &LR;  wines, the minimum period is 24 months, six of them in oak
casks.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Gran Reserva: &LR;  Used for red wines that have been aged for at
least 24 months in oak casks, followed by 36 months in bottle prior
to release. For white and ros &LR; e &LR;  wines, the minimum period is four
years; six months must be in wood.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Thin and Crispy Wins in Potato Chip Picks   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  It's been more than 10 years since The Chronicle's
panel sampled full-fat, full-salt potato chips. Since then, many
new chips have come out. Today's panel sampled 12 brands, not
including any that specified ``dark cooked,'' low-salt or low-fat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One brand ranked significantly higher than the others, but was
not a unanimous favorite. Panelists agreed that personal
preferences are strong _ some like thick, substantial chips while
others prefer them thin and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lay's &LR;  (7.5 ounces, $2.89-$2.99 at many supermarkets) placed
first. Four panelists picked it as their favorite for its light
texture and ``classic'' flavor. The dissenter thought it was too
flimsy. Four would buy it, and one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ruffles &LR;  (13.25 ounces, $3.19 at Safeway) came in second, with
one panelist picking it number one _ ``a good basic chip.'' Another
thought it was a good ``middle-ground'' chip, although it looked
overly processed. Three would buy it, one might buy it and one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Idaho &LR;  (6 ounces, $1.99 at Safeway) came in third. Several
panelists noted a greasiness, but two liked the texture. One
thought it would be good for dipping. Two would buy it, one might
buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were decidedly divided over  &UR; Barbara's &LR;  (5 ounces,
$1.85 at Rainbow). One described the flavor as artificial, but
another thought it had great potato flavor. One panelist thought
the chip wasn't ``snappy enough,'' but two others particularly
liked the thin crispiness. One would buy it, two might buy it, and
two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Boulder &LR;  (5 ounces, $2.29 at Whole Foods
and Andronico's). Two panelists thought the chip was too thick and
tough, but liked the potato flavor. Another thought it was too
greasy and lacked salt. Two would buy it, one might buy it, and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kettle Chips &LR;  (5 ounces, $1.69 at Whole Foods) came in sixth.
Most tasters liked the dark brown color, but one thought they were
too dry. All decried the lack of salt. Two would buy it, one might
buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Trader Joe's, Hawaiian, Granny Goose,
Tim's Cascade-Style, Cape Cod and Pringles Original, but they
scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Shelley Handler, consultant and food writer;
Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Julia
McClaskey, chef, Dine in San Francisco; Kim Severson, Chronicle
staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San
Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jason and the Argonauts'' plays into the worst impulses of the
Robert Halmi _ Sr. and Jr. _ aesthetic. It has a sort of ``we're
fooling nobody'' pretension, suggesting that there's something
remotely valuable about the proceedings because, after all, it has
stilted dialogue and is based on Greek mythology (not even that,
the press notes virtually shriek _ this is based !ital!on a true
story!). It's simply a happy coincidence, the Halmis would wink,
that as an added bonus, we get to wallow in special-effects
monsters and exotic beauties naked from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Jason London, who convincingly played way-wasted dudes in
``Dazed and Confused'' and ``Broken Vessels,'' proves here why he's
never been cast in a period epic before. He stars as Jason, the guy
favored by the goddess Hera, who leads the proverbial ragtag army
on a journey to many Islands of Polysyllabic Names, which results
in the death of a lot of supporting players and lizardy beasties
and somehow ultimately leads to the overthrow of the corrupt reign
of his evil uncle, Pelias (Dennis Hopper _ who knows why).
</P>
<P>
   London's manner is way too contemporary for this, and the gobs
of bluster contributed by his supporting cast make him seem
spectacularly wooden. He doesn't so much detachedly deliver lines
like ``I have greater things to ponder than games'' or ``(They)
only hide their fear and cowardice'' than sidestep them completely,
as if he's a bit dismayed to be spouting such nonsense decked out
in hair extensions, sandals and leather breastplates.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, none of his co-stars have to put in as much screen
time. Hopper bares his teeth a lot, but doesn't even bother to
overact, which somehow amounts to an even sorrier spectacle. Angus
MacFadyen (``Cradle Will Rock'') and Olivia Williams (``Rushmore'')
engage in some risibly rancorous repartee as Zeus and Hera
bickering over Jason's fate _ they don't so much comment on the
action as bring it to a dead halt.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Henstridge shows up briefly as the queen of an island of
evil babes with designs on Jason and his crewmen. (Here's how bad
it gets for London _ he looks like he's suffering a hernia in his
love scene with Henstridge.) Derek Jacobi sports goofy eye makeup
as a blind soothsayer, and Frank Langella sleepwalks through a turn
as the king who protects the Golden Fleece, this saga's Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are what sell this thing, although they
won't likely convert anyone with fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's
1963 ``Jason'' (which also had the virtue of being much, much
shorter). There's an island that's really a sleeping giant (so-so
effects), some ghastly looking harpies (pretty cool), a mechanical
bull (shrug), sword-fighting skeletons (no real improvement on
Harryhausen's) and a dragon protecting the fleece (not bad).
</P>
<P>
   Too bad you have to sit through so much humdrum blather to get
to the good parts. Jason may end up with the gold, but it's the
audience that gets fleeced.!end! &QL;

 CHRON  
 Winemakers in the Kitchen: Tradition view with eclecticism as
two  master blenders don their aprons to prepare dinner. 
 &HT;     By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; They spend most of their working day thinking
about taste, aroma, balance and texture. They obsess about
ingredients and tinker with technique. Their practiced palates can
tell a mountain Cabernet from a valley-grown version. But can
winemakers cook?
<P>
   Many Napa Valley winemakers have reputations as amateur cooks _
among them Marco Cappelli of Swanson Vineyards and Art Finkelstein
of Judd's Hill. On separate nights, they each prepared a
dinner-party menu of their own invention while sharing some
thoughts on the pleasures of the table. Although their cooking
styles could hardly be more different, the two men hold remarkably
similar views about the ingredients for an enjoyable evening.
</P>
<P>
   In chef terms, Cappelli is the Paul Bertolli of the kitchen,
Finkelstein the Wolfgang Puck. Like Bertolli, chef at Oakland's
Oliveto, Cappelli reveres tradition, simplicity and the dishes his
Italian mother and grandmother made. Like Puck of San Francisco's
Postrio, Finkelstein's multicultural kitchen embraces the whole
California experience, from barbecued ribs to pasta to sushi.
Sesame oil, saffron and Thai chile sauce _ telltale signs of a
culinary adventurer _ all share space in his pantry.
</P>
<P>
   Authenticity, not adventure, was on Cappelli's mind when the
39-year-old consulted his mother about his menu. She agreed to
bring him baby artichokes from her home in Carmel and told him
that, no, he couldn't serve veal after pasta with tuna sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians have these traditions,'' says Cappelli, shrugging.
Pasta with fish sauce should be followed by fish. He had forgotten
this unwritten rule, but it's ingrained in him now.
</P>
<P>
   In his modest U-shaped kitchen in Rutherford _ he lives next to
the winery _ Cappelli expertly trims the artichokes as he relates
experiences that have shaped his food views. A slim man with a
youthful face, a lush mane of jet-black hair and graceful manners,
Cappelli was raised in Carmel after his Italian-born father retired
from the U.S. Army. His mother was a good cook, but family life
didn't center around food. She prepared the simple dishes of her
region, the Marches, and mealtimes unfolded in the Italian order:
soup or pasta, followed by a meat course with salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were not teetotalers, but close,'' recalls
Cappelli. They didn't serve wine, but they didn't forbid it, and he
grew up with no interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   But as a freshman at University of California at Davis, where he
enrolled because a friend did, Cappelli met an enology student who
introduced him to dorm-room mead. Fascinated by fermentation, he
took a quarter off to work at Louis Martini Winery, then returned
to Davis to earn a degree in enology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with the whole business,'' he says, ``with
being able to see that grape-y character in your wine. It's like
making jam. Winemaking is preserving.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Cappelli headed for Italy with assurances of a
three-week job in Chianti Classico. Before long, one of Tuscany's
top winemaking consultants took the young Italian-American under
his wing, arranging stints for him at such prestigious wine
properties as Castello di Volpaia and Badia a Coltibuono.
</P>
<P>
   Like others pilgrims that have preceded and followed him,
Cappelli returned home with a profound respect for how Italians
live, work and eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bit of land is producing for them in some way,''
Cappelli says. An Italian doesn't plant a lawn if he can grow a
crop instead. In some regions, even the highway medians were
planted with wheat, he recalls. ``My friends couldn't believe that
there were fruit trees among the grape vines, and wheat between the
rows.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cappelli returns to Italy each year to visit family and
friends and to strengthen ties to a culture he loves. These annual
trips have shaped his thoughts about food and the place of wine on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women on my mother's side are extremely good cooks,'' says
the winemaker. ``Their food isn't fancy at all; they rely on the
ingredients being good _ good pasta, good Parmesan, good olive
oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Great oil is fundamental, he says. The better the oil _ he
trades Swanson wine for McEvoy Ranch extra virgin olive oil _ the
more simply you can cook.
</P>
<P>
   His pasta sauce _ a quick simmering of chopped fresh tomato,
anchovy and olive oil _ proves his point. He doesn't peel the
tomato; he adds no garlic, no cheese, no herb except parsley. Yet
this straightforward pasta dish is hard to stop eating, the sauce a
melding of compatible flavors with no extraneous note.
</P>
<P>
   When guests come for dinner, this bachelor's menu is likely to
be equally unfussy: pasta with a tomato-based sauce, roast chicken
with rosemary and garlic, roast potatoes, a sauteed green vegetable
like broccoli or chard and perhaps a green salad. For dessert?
Grappa, perhaps, or another high-proof fruit brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Cappelli dismisses the notion that a dinner party needs to be an
orchestrated wine-and-food dance. ``Wine is almost an afterthought,
to tell the truth,'' says Cappelli about his own entertaining.
Guests usually bring bottles they want to share; he rarely serves
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Italy, wine is like the bread,'' says the winemaker. ``It's
always on the table, but it's not something you focus on. The
reason we're not a wine-drinking nation is because we worry too
much about what it tastes like.''
</P>
<P>
   Cappelli's simple tastes are evident in the rest of his menu, a
classic preparation of veal scaloppine bathed in a lightly
thickened Marsala sauce. He painstakingly trims the thin-sliced
meat of every scrap of connective tissue and fat, then pounds the
slices even thinner, flours them lightly and sautees them quickly
in butter and oil. A splash of Marsala goes into the pan and is
quickly reduced to make the aromatic sauce.
</P>
<P>
   To accompany the veal, Cappelli trims and quarters his
hand-delivered artichokes, then braises them with white wine, olive
oil and crushed garlic. Dessert, which he rarely serves, is
refreshing and different, a mixed-fruit salad macerated in anise
liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the lessons he learned in Italy is that ``cooking is
nothing to be afraid of. I have friends who can't do anything
without a recipe.'' Buy good ingredients, he might advise them;
then keep it simple.
</P>
<P>
   Art Finkelstein, like Cappelli, is unintimidated in the kitchen
and equally untethered to recipes. A fearless cook who once invited
Madeleine Kamman to dinner (she came), he also regularly mans the
grills at his Napa synagogue's fund-raisers and estimates that
1,000 people have eaten his barbecued salmon. A year-round charcoal
griller, he owns three Webers for those occasions when he and his
wife, Bunnie, invite the whole staff of Tra Vigne to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Cappelli, the 58-year-old Finkelstein is a much more
adventurous cook, with eclectic tastes that span the globe and no
fear of fusion. ``I like to wing it,'' he says, ``and I don't feel
bound to make authentic dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly. His menu for the evening includes barbecued baby back
ribs in an Asian marinade, followed by a grilled quail salad with a
curry dressing and a fish soup that suggests bouillabaisse by way
of Tokyo. He cooks with a vast supporting cast of Eastern and
Western oils, vinegars, sauces, spices and condiments _ the palette
that fuels his culinary imagination.
</P>
<P>
   A former architect, Finkelstein considers cooking another outlet
for his long-standing impulse to build. He has cooked since college
days, when he left his strictly kosher Illinois home for the
University of Southern California. There, his older brother
introduced him to Los Angeles' ethnic restaurants; together they
explored an unimagined world of Greek, Indian, Thai and Chinese
establishments. When Finkelstein liked a dish, he wanted to make
it, and he developed a cooking-class habit that continues today.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he and Bunnie moved to Napa Valley, where
Finkelstein and his surgeon brother opened Whitehall Lane Winery.
They later sold it, but in 1989, Art and Bunnie launched their own
label _ Judd's Hill, named for their son. The following year they
designed and built a home over their small Conn Valley winery; from
the glass-walled dining room, guests can look directly into the
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Given the drama of their high-ceilinged great room, the kitchen
is surprisingly humble, a small square room with a butcher-block
work table in the center. Finkelstein has no fancy cookware, no
professional-quality stove. ``I don't like `things,' '' he says.
``I don't need cars, jewelry, fancy dogs. I like to celebrate life
with friends, to eat and drink and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   For this evening, he has invited Hiro Sone and Lissa Doumani,
the owners of Terra restaurant in St. Helena, and their two
visiting Japanese guests. Art Finkelstein, Doumani says, is just
about the only person in the valley who will cook for her and her
chef husband.
</P>
<P>
   Before his guests arrive, Finkelstein pre-cooks the ribs,
marinates the quail, makes his barbecue basting sauce and whisks up
a salad dressing. He chops vegetables for his fish soup and starts
to soften them in olive oil. When it is time to light the coals in
the first of two grills he will use this evening, he grabs the
bottle of extra virgin olive oil and heads outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate liquid fire starter,'' he says, drizzling olive oil
over the coals, which are piled on newspaper. A match starts the
pile smoking immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The ribs, first baked in a slow oven to release their fat and
tenderize them, go on the grill with hickory chips and a basting of
sauce. Forty-five minutes later they are crusty, dark and
smoky-finger food to serve with cocktails and sparkling wine.
Bottles of Judd's Hill Merlot and Mason Sauvignon Blanc appear on
the table with the first course, grilled quail salad with mango and
citrus curry dressing. The meal proceeds, the bottles keep coming:
Pinot Noir with the fennel and saffron-scented seafood broth and
glazed sea bass; two Cabernet Sauvignons and Lustau sherry with the
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what one might expect, the conversation barely
touches on wine all evening, and the many bottles are poured and
passed without ceremony. As at Cappelli's table, the focus is on
conviviality, not on the intricate interplay of wine and food.
Nobody asks for or offers an opinion about which wine goes best
with the quail. If anyone is analyzing the wine and food pairings,
they don't do so out loud.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to imagine why Cappelli and Finkelstein find
satisfaction in cooking. The gratification is almost immediate; you
don't have to wait months or years to know if the ``recipe''
worked. You can throw out the mistakes and start over. And you have
an almost limitless world of ingredients to play with, not just
grapes and oak.
</P>
<P>
   But the kitchen's main appeal for these two winemakers may be
less tangible. Good food brings people around a table and provides
a context for sharing wine, which is reason enough for them to keep
on cooking.

VEAL SCALOPPINE WITH MARSALA
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound very thinly sliced veal scaloppine
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   All-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup dry Marsala
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Trim the veal rigorously, removing any membranes or external
fat. It is OK to cut a slice in two if necessary to trim away
internal membrane. Using a rolling pin or wine bottle, pound the
veal gently until it is 1/16-inch thick. Season with salt and
pepper. Just before cooking, lightly flour both sides of each
slice, shaking off excess.
</P>
<P>
   Heat two large skillets over moderately high heat, or work in
batches if necessary. Divide the butter and oil between the two
skillets. When the fat is hot, add the veal. Sear on one side, then
turn with tongs and cook on the other side until the veal is
lightly colored, about 2 minutes total. Transfer the veal to a
large warm platter and pour off the fat in the skillets. Return the
veal to the skillets along with the Marsala, dividing it evenly.
Cook until the Marsala reduces to a lightly thickened sauce that
just bathes the veal. Transfer the veal to warm platter and serve.

   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Trim the artichokes:  &LR; Remove the tough outer leaves until
you reach the pale yellow-green heart. Cut about 1/2-inch off the
tip of the artichoke and trim the base of any dark green parts.
Quarter artichoke hearts and trim away prickly leaves in the
center, if any. Drop the artichokes into a bowl of water acidulated
with the wine vinegar to prevent browning.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the artichokes. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over
moderate heat. Add the garlic and saute briefly to release its
fragrance. Add the artichokes and season with salt. Add 3
tablespoons wine. Cover and cook until the artichokes are tender,
adding a little more wine if the skillet threatens to cook dry. At
the end, there should be no liquid in the skillet and the
artichokes should be slightly browned in parts. Transfer to a bowl
and serve hot or at room temperature.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 racks baby back ribs, halved lengthwise by the butcher
</P>
<P>
   Garlic salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 large handfuls hickory chips
</P>
<P>
   Sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup hoisin sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plum sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Thai chile sauce, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Season the ribs with garlic salt. Wrap them loosely in
heavy-duty aluminum foil and place in a baking dish. Bake until
very tender, about 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Soak hickory chips in water to cover for 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sauce, whisk together all ingredients. Taste and add
more chile sauce if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a moderate charcoal fire. When the coals are ready,
divide them into two piles on either side of the grill. Put 3
handfuls of chips on each pile. Top with the grate.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the ribs on the grate, not directly over the coals; they
should cook by indirect heat. Brush with sauce, cover and cook
until the ribs are crusty and browned, about 45 minutes, brushing
again with sauce halfway through. Add another handful of chips to
each pile if necessary to keep the coals smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let rest a few minutes
before cutting between the ribs.
</P>

<P>
   1 celery rib, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 leek (white and light-green part only), well rinsed and
chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup coarsely chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   4 cups fish stock or best-quality bottled clam juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon powdered saffron
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons ground fennel
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   8 Chilean sea bass fillets, about 6 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Seasoning salt, such as Lawry's
</P>
<P>
   8 teaspoons kabayaki sauce (available at Japanese markets)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds sea scallops
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds shrimp, peeled and butterflied
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Make broth:  &LR; Heat the olive oil in a large pot over
moderate heat. Add the carrots, celery, leek, parsley, garlic and
oregano and saute until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add the
fish stock, wine, saffron, fennel and sugar. Bring to a simmer,
adjust heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook about 10 minutes
to boil off the alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the sea bass lightly with sesame oil, then season with
seasoning salt. Put the fish on a rack in a baking dish and broil
until almost done. Brush each fillet with 1 teaspoon kabayaki sauce
and return to the broiler until the fish just flakes.
</P>
<P>
   While the fish cooks, add the scallops to the simmering broth.
Cover and simmer until they are about half-done, about 1 minute,
then add the shrimp. Cover and simmer briefly, just until the
shrimp and scallops are done. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon some of the broth, shrimp and scallops into warmed serving
bowls. Using a spatula, transfer a sea bass fillet to each bowl.

<P>
   ``Jason and the Argonauts'' plays into the worst impulses of the
Robert Halmi _ Sr. and Jr. _ aesthetic. It has a sort of ``we're
fooling nobody'' pretension, suggesting that there's something
remotely valuable about the proceedings because, after all, it has
stilted dialogue and is based on Greek mythology (not even that,
the press notes virtually shriek _ this is based !ital!on a true
story!). It's simply a happy coincidence, the Halmis would wink,
that as an added bonus, we get to wallow in special-effects
monsters and exotic beauties naked from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Jason London, who convincingly played way-wasted dudes in
``Dazed and Confused'' and ``Broken Vessels,'' proves here why he's
never been cast in a period epic before. He stars as Jason, the guy
favored by the goddess Hera, who leads the proverbial ragtag army
on a journey to many Islands of Polysyllabic Names, which results
in the death of a lot of supporting players and lizardy beasties
and somehow ultimately leads to the overthrow of the corrupt reign
of his evil uncle, Pelias (Dennis Hopper _ who knows why).
</P>
<P>
   London's manner is way too contemporary for this, and the gobs
of bluster contributed by his supporting cast make him seem
spectacularly wooden. He doesn't so much detachedly deliver lines
like ``I have greater things to ponder than games'' or ``(They)
only hide their fear and cowardice'' than sidestep them completely,
as if he's a bit dismayed to be spouting such nonsense decked out
in hair extensions, sandals and leather breastplates.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, none of his co-stars have to put in as much screen
time. Hopper bares his teeth a lot, but doesn't even bother to
overact, which somehow amounts to an even sorrier spectacle. Angus
MacFadyen (``Cradle Will Rock'') and Olivia Williams (``Rushmore'')
engage in some risibly rancorous repartee as Zeus and Hera
bickering over Jason's fate _ they don't so much comment on the
action as bring it to a dead halt.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Henstridge shows up briefly as the queen of an island of
evil babes with designs on Jason and his crewmen. (Here's how bad
it gets for London _ he looks like he's suffering a hernia in his
love scene with Henstridge.) Derek Jacobi sports goofy eye makeup
as a blind soothsayer, and Frank Langella sleepwalks through a turn
as the king who protects the Golden Fleece, this saga's Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are what sell this thing, although they
won't likely convert anyone with fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's
1963 ``Jason'' (which also had the virtue of being much, much
shorter). There's an island that's really a sleeping giant (so-so
effects), some ghastly looking harpies (pretty cool), a mechanical
bull (shrug), sword-fighting skeletons (no real improvement on
Harryhausen's) and a dragon protecting the fleece (not bad).
</P>

   Too bad you have to sit through so much humdrum blather to get
to the good parts. Jason may end up with the gold, but it's the
audience that gets fleeced.!end! &QL;

&HT;     PROFESSOR CAN'T ESCAPE MEMORIES OF KENT STATE'S FATEFUL DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 4, 1970, Ohio National Guardsmen at Kent State University
shot and killed Jeffrey Glenn Miller, Allison B. Krause, William K.
Schroeder and Sandra Lee Scheuer.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings marked the end of four lives, the end of an
impromptu demonstration against the Vietnam War, and the beginning,
for Professor Jerry M. Lewis, of a life wrapped around the legacy
of crazy force, a blurred picture of shouting teen-agers caught on
the government's own killing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was a young sociology professor the day the soldiers went
into a momentary, three-stage shooting spasm, killing the four and
wounding nine others.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Lewis, the last professor left on campus willing to
talk about what happened 30 years ago, worked to coordinate close
to 60 events marking the anniversary of the Kent State killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very beautiful that day, just the way it
was,'' Lewis said by telephone. ``Except for the wind, it looks
exactly the same. So gorgeous. Bright sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 63, sighed. ``What happened here that day, it's my hair
shirt,'' he said. ``Every time I walk out there ... not so much
around the pagoda, but that hill's getting higher and higher ...
and to see those markers in the parking lot, where they died ...as
I'm talking now I can look at three memories, three different
positions I took up that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my colleagues noted I'm recently getting more and more
emotional in my presentation at the memorials. It's true. I
remember a lot. It's painful.''
</P>
<P>
   A round, clean hole made by an M-1 bullet fired by some
gas-masked Guardsman is still there, sliced through the left-side
heart of the steel pagoda at one corner of Taylor Hall on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory that is most with me,'' Lewis said, ``the one that
never goes away, is watching Allison Krause coming down the hill
... on that gurney. I was pretty sure she was dead, dying, and I
grabbed two young women standing there and pulled them to my chest
and said, `You don't want to see this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time after that I dreamed about the shooting, about
once a week ... always the Guard turning and firing. At least once
a week. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly retracing his steps 30 years later, Lewis said, ``Right
before noon I was walking through the rally, went up on the
sidewalk there and a friend joined me just as the guards started
coming across. We were all going past Taylor Hall, a marshal kept
shouting, `Don't go on the practice football field, it's closed!'
and I went out to give some first aid to a student who'd been hit
by tear gas.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the parking lot, Lewis said. ``And as I stood
there looking up the hill, I saw the guard walking rapidly to the
pagoda, saw the right rear echelon of eight to 10 guys turn, knew
something was going to happen, and I just dove to my right, jumped
about 10 steps behind a bush. ... It's what I learned in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then came the shots and I said to myself, `What should I do?'
and a student came over and asked me, `Dr. Lewis, those were
blanks, weren't they?' and I pointed to Sandy Scheuer's body ...
about 15 yards away from me ... and I said, `You must leave. Those
are real bullets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, Lewis said, he has made it a personal crusade to
underline the uncompromising use of force at Kent State. While
others may see the 30th anniversary as another self-serving media
opera, Lewis said, ``I take a different position. I don't think
it's heavy-handed at all. I think Kent State is about the use of
force, and every chance I get I'm going to spread that word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Elian custody situation _ the feds haven't learned
a damned thing. Force. Tear gas. Guns. For what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent State is the federal government firing into a crowd, with
the government never apologizing,'' he said. ``That's one reason I
continue to talk. That's just wrong, period. I'm a patriot, I
believe in the American dream, I vote every year, but I have a
profound distrust in my federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It did end the war,'' Lewis said of Kent State. ``Many
historians are saying it speeded up the withdrawal of troops. The
ones who say it was the end of the anti-war movement, well, that's
just empirically wrong. I went to an awful lot of rallies after
that. The huge, mass rallies died after Washington, D.C., that's
true, but the activism didn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   And the most important legacy, Lewis said, may be the public's
insistence since Kent State ``on having a check on social-control
forces. Look at the outcry that took place after Elian. That was a
good show of what's changed.''

A KING'S RANSOM FOR THE LION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Lion King,'' Disney's blockbuster musical of majestic
felines and wise-cracking wart hogs, will preen and strut across
metro Los Angeles today in a promotional style befitting the king
of beasts.
</P>
<P>
   With the mouse's corporate muscle behind it, the $15 million
show is hoping to ensure a warm hometown reception when it
officially opens at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood on October
19.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question may be whether, several months from now, ``The
Lion King'' will exit Los Angeles with a roar or a whimper. With
``Lion King'' productions currently running or soon to open in New
York, London, Toronto and Japan, Disney may be facing its stiffest
challenge in its very own corporate backyard, where L.A.'s
nerve-wracking commutes, seasonal competition from theme parks and
beaches, and tickets costing a hefty $75 apiece may limit the
production's longevity.
</P>
<P>
   As the Disney p.r. machine heaves into high gear this week,
company officials seem to be balancing a hard-sell marketing
strategy with a low-key, wait-and-see approach to how the Broadway
smash hit will actually fare in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've announced eight months, and if it (``Lion King'') runs a
little longer than eight months we'll be extremely happy,'' says
Peter Schneider, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, who also
heads the company's Buena Vista Theatrical Group with Disney
animation chief Thomas Schumacher. ``I've always felt that Los
Angeles is a great town in terms of entertainment, and it's been a
very tricky town in terms of theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Disney is taking a laissez-faire attitude toward its
Tony Award-winning theatrical property, which is presently
scheduled to run here through June 30, 2001 before probably
embarking on a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   When tickets go on sale this morning at the Pantages box office,
there'll be a circus-like atmosphere comparable to the buzz
surrounding last summer's ``Star Wars'' prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members from the New York and London productions of ``The
Lion King'' are being flown in to sing musical excerpts. A stretch
of Hollywood Boulevard is being closed to auto traffic to make room
for a temporary stage, where a chorus of 50 will perform ``Circle
of Life,'' the musical's signature Elton John tune. Free ``Lion
King'' watches will be handed out to anyone buying a ticket today
(while supplies last).
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon there'll be more song and dance at downtown's
California Plaza, and later at Orange County's South Coast Plaza _
supplying just the kind of uptempo video bytes that TV newscasters
love to stick between weather and sports reports.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 2,700-seat Pantages is undergoing a cosmetic
touchup reportedly costing between $5 and $10 million, including
new seats and carpeting, to make ready for ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the Nederlanders, stepping up and deciding
to renovate the Pantages,'' says Schneider, referring to the
dynastic clan that owns and operates live theaters from New York to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney brand of marketing helped turn ``The Lion King'' into
a cultural event many months before it opened in Nov. 1997 at
Broadway's restored landmark New Amsterdam Theatre, where it's
still playing to sellout crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Disney is characterizing the L.A. production of ``The
Lion King'' (the first in the United States outside Manhattan) as a
``limited engagement,'' some observers are offering bolder
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a gigantic commercial success,'' says Jed
Bernstein, president of The League of American Theatres and
Producers, Inc., the national trade organization for the U.S.
commercial theater industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein calls ``The Lion King'' a ``destination attraction''
that will draw customers ``because of the cachet of the show'' and
the unique ``experience'' it offers.
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, however, that it will have to capture suburban
middle- class theater-goers who may be wary of Hollywood's recent
reputation for crime and blight, are reluctant to navigate
rush-hour traffic, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to feel safe, you have to feel comfortable, and you
have to feel that it's not going to take you an hour to drive from
Brentwood to Hollywood and Vine,'' Bernstein says.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's promotional push for ``The Lion King'' actually started
last fall shortly after the company announced plans for the L.A.
engagement. It has been courting potential group-sale ticket
buyers, such as subscribers to the Ahmanson Theatre and the
Broadway/L.A. series.
</P>
<P>
   On February 11, Disney invited 1,800 members of Theatre L.A., a
non-profit association of 162 theaters and producers that promotes
the greater Los Angeles theater community, to attend a special
one-hour ``Lion King'' ``preview presentation'' at the Pantages.
Gift bags were distributed to the natives, a couple of show numbers
were sung, and the crowd greeted slides of Julie Taymor's
anthropomorphic masks and costumes with whoops and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Theatre L.A. president Lars Hansen thinks Disney so far has done
``everything exactly right'' in wooing L.A.'s numerous small and
midsize theaters to support ``The Lion King,'' and in negating the
impression of a corporate Godzilla big-footing down Hollywood
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very gracious and they wanted to find out how to
connect with the theater community,'' Hansen says. ``They didn't
want to be perceived as just the giant Disney company coming to
town without getting to know its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of Hollywood's small theaters say they welcome
Disney putting its stamp of approval on the slowly reviving stretch
of Hollywood Boulevard between Highland and Gower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually incredibly supportive of the arrival of Disney,''
says Jeff Murray, artistic director of 18-year-old Theater/Theatre,
which occupies part of the Pacific Theatres building at 6425
Hollywood Blvd., west of the Pantages. ``I really wish that other
corporations like The Gap would realize the potential of the
Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hollywood is still finding its feet as an entertainment
center. Last fall, the gender-bending off-Broadway hit rock musical
``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' closed at the Henry Fonda Theater, a
few blocks from the Pantages, after a disappointing three-month
run, at a reported loss of $600,000. Privately, some Disney
officials have expressed concern about what ``Hedwig's'' failure
might augur for ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   While a number of L.A. theater producers and promoters think
Disney is privately hoping for a two-year run for ``Lion King,''
the odds may be against it. ``Beauty and the Beast,'' Disney's 1994
debut in the world of live theater production, lasted 17 months at
the Shubert Theatre in Century City, following a summer of sagging
box office receipts. ``Ragtime,'' the $12 million musical produced
by Canada's now financially ailing Livent, Inc., closed at the
Shubert after 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark for L.A. theater remains Andrew Lloyd Webber's
``The Phantom of the Opera,'' which, beginning in 1989, lasted 4
years and 1,772 performances at the Ahmanson.
</P>
<P>
   But with the recently announced Broadway closings of such mega-
musicals as ``Cats'' and ``Miss Saigon,'' the blockbuster era may
be drawing to a close. ``Phantom's'' marathon L.A. run increasingly
looks like an aberration never to be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers predict that ``The Lion King'' will open strong
in Los Angeles. The real test will come at the start of summer,
2001, when sun and surf beckon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney never recognizes the fact that they are competing with
themselves in this market,'' says a local theatrical impresario who
requested anonymity because ``I have to work in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people going to take their kids to `The Lion King' at the
Pantages at $80 a shot? Or are they going to take their kids to
Disneyland? Something that's big, big, big in New York is not
necessarily going to have the same reception in L.A. They will have
a big opening, but the same kind of excitement won't sustain
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Theatre L.A.'s Hansen agrees that ``we don't react the same as a
New York audience, where you get a good review and, Boom!, there's,
lines around the block.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not necessarily a bad thing, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that `Lion King' will sit down for four years
like 'Phantom' did, but maybe it shouldn't,'' Hansen says. ``Maybe
in L.A. we need to have short visits and not open-ended runs,
because of our lifestyle and choices.''

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jason and the Argonauts'' plays into the worst impulses of the
Robert Halmi _ Sr. and Jr. _ aesthetic. It has a sort of ``we're
fooling nobody'' pretension, suggesting that there's something
remotely valuable about the proceedings because, after all, it has
stilted dialogue and is based on Greek mythology (not even that,
the press notes virtually shriek _ this is based !ital!on a true
story!). It's simply a happy coincidence, the Halmis would wink,
that as an added bonus, we get to wallow in special-effects
monsters and exotic beauties naked from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Jason London, who convincingly played way-wasted dudes in
``Dazed and Confused'' and ``Broken Vessels,'' proves here why he's
never been cast in a period epic before. He stars as Jason, the guy
favored by the goddess Hera, who leads the proverbial ragtag army
on a journey to many Islands of Polysyllabic Names, which results
in the death of a lot of supporting players and lizardy beasties
and somehow ultimately leads to the overthrow of the corrupt reign
of his evil uncle, Pelias (Dennis Hopper _ who knows why).
</P>
<P>
   London's manner is way too contemporary for this, and the gobs
of bluster contributed by his supporting cast make him seem
spectacularly wooden. He doesn't so much detachedly deliver lines
like ``I have greater things to ponder than games'' or ``(They)
only hide their fear and cowardice'' than sidestep them completely,
as if he's a bit dismayed to be spouting such nonsense decked out
in hair extensions, sandals and leather breastplates.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, none of his co-stars have to put in as much screen
time. Hopper bares his teeth a lot, but doesn't even bother to
overact, which somehow amounts to an even sorrier spectacle. Angus
MacFadyen (``Cradle Will Rock'') and Olivia Williams (``Rushmore'')
engage in some risibly rancorous repartee as Zeus and Hera
bickering over Jason's fate _ they don't so much comment on the
action as bring it to a dead halt.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Henstridge shows up briefly as the queen of an island of
evil babes with designs on Jason and his crewmen. (Here's how bad
it gets for London _ he looks like he's suffering a hernia in his
love scene with Henstridge.) Derek Jacobi sports goofy eye makeup
as a blind soothsayer, and Frank Langella sleepwalks through a turn
as the king who protects the Golden Fleece, this saga's Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are what sell this thing, although they
won't likely convert anyone with fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's
1963 ``Jason'' (which also had the virtue of being much, much
shorter). There's an island that's really a sleeping giant (so-so
effects), some ghastly looking harpies (pretty cool), a mechanical
bull (shrug), sword-fighting skeletons (no real improvement on
Harryhausen's) and a dragon protecting the fleece (not bad).
</P>
<P>
   Too bad you have to sit through so much humdrum blather to get
to the good parts. Jason may end up with the gold, but it's the
audience that gets fleeced.!end! &QL;

The show: ``Jason and the Argonauts.'' &QL;

<P>
   JACOBS-MANAGEMENT (Evanston, Ill.) _ No one has had a greater
effect on management education in the United States than Dr. Donald
P. Jacobs, dean of the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at
Northwestern University, say his peers at schools around the
country. In 25 years at the helm, he created the prototype of the
modern business school, management experts say, fostering a boom in
M.B.A.'s. And Jacobs has become something of a model manager
himself. Unlike many academic institutions, Kellogg acts quickly,
putting in place pilot programs and taking time later to decide
whether they deserve a permanent place in the curriculum. ``He
pushes constant change,'' a colleague says. By David Leonhardt.

</P>
<P>
   KOREA-DMZ (Panmunjon) _ For American and South Korean soldiers
stationed in the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas,
days begin with a blast of martial music and Communist propaganda
blaring from gigantic loudspeakers that North Korea has erected
just across the heavily fortified border. Despite all the talk of
movement between North and South, nothing has changed here. By
Calvin Sims.

<P>
   ISRAEL-HOLOCAUST (Jerusalem) _ At 10 a.m., the siren goes off to
announce Holocaust Remembrance Day. All of Israel freezes, gets out
of their cars and pauses for a moment, except the ultra-Orthodox.
The reasons are complicated, not surprisingly, and have to do not
just with how one should remember the Holocaust, but also what

4,500 hotel rooms in the past four years to build itself into a
first-line hospitality city. An old Democratic bastion with a fresh
gleam has won the Republicans' favor, thanks to the vision of Ed

   REPUBS-PRIMARIES (Washington) _ A Republican group has proposed

went wrong. Unknown is whether the commission will place blame on
the students who build the huge bonfire structure, or if they will

Lyme disease. Aides to lawmakers from Connecticut, Pennsylvania and
New Jersey _ three states that are among those with the highest
incidence of the disease in the nation _ say they will ask for a
probe of charges that federal agencies misallocated research funds
that were to have been devoted to a better understanding of the

say has left them with serious neurological problems that can only

 PERSONALS: Advice From the Man Who Knows How  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wit and wisdom of San Francisco Mayor  &UR; Willie Brown &LR;  _ in
pronouncements made at DreamWorks' post-Oscar party, is shared in
George magazine, which was standing by while Brown ``was holding
court at the bar'':
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were  &UR; Al Gore &LR; ,'' said the mayor, ``I'd have been sitting
next to  &UR; Annette &LR;  and  &UR; Warren &LR;  tonight. A billion people watching!
No one would have a problem except  &UR; Bob Jones &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Brown had some ideas for award-winner Beatty, too, who he said
``would love to do something political. It's in his system. It's
too bad he doesn't live in my town. I'd use him, hell, yeah. Chair
the police commission.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor fit right in with the entertainment crowd. ``As a
politician, you're only as good as your last win,'' he said. ``As
an actor you're only as good as your last movie. You're toast if
you're not relevant, interesting and timely.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Steve Talbot &LR; , who's making a ``Frontline'' documentary on
``The Battle Over School Choice'' (to be broadcast May 23 by PBS),
watched Gore deliver a speech on education last week to the
National Conference of Black Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor  &UR; Ron Kirk &LR;  gave the candidate a rousing
introduction, and  &UR; Stevie Wonder &LR;  music was struck up as Gore
entered, ``looking good, stage left. He's smiling, he's
confident,'' he's getting lots of hugs. And then he begins to
speak, says Talbot, ``and proceeds to suck every ounce of life out
of that energized room. ... By the end of Gore's speech, several of
his staunchest supporters had dozed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, the mayors, their wives and aides crowded around
Gore. The vice president seemed particularly impressed by Willie
Brown's pinstriped suit, checking the designer label on the inside
coat pocket, as our mayor laughed.''
</P>

<P>
   _ Personals has received word of the San Francisco Bay Area
Conference on Customer Service, which includes seminars on all
sorts of things that will strike familiar notes with consumers who
have treasured the hours they've spent waiting on hold or tripping
along the merry byways of voice mail:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidden gold: How to turn complaints into profits''; ``How to
deal with demanding, angry or unreasonably customers _ and still
feel good!''; and ``The difference between the hard `no' and the
customer-friendly `no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Director  &UR; Guy Ritchie &LR; , father of  &UR; Madonna &LR; 's forthcoming
baby, likes to tell people he's always been poor, says the Sunday
Telegraph of London, but his father was an advertising executive
and he grew up in a 17th century house owned by his stepfather.
``In art, as in life,'' said the Telegraph, ``Ritchie's real talent
lies in myth-making. But who cares? His Mockney act keeps Madonna
happy.''
</P>

   &QL; 
THE KOSHER NATURAL? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hebrew National has asked the Los Angeles Dodgers' newest star,
Jewish right fielder  &UR; Shawn Green &LR; , to endorse its line of all-beef
hot dogs, reports Los Angeles magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Green told the magazine that when he came to bat one Sunday in
Milwaukee last season, when he was playing for Toronto,  &UR; Jesse &LR; 
 &UR; Levis &LR; , who was playing for Milwaukee, was catching, and the umpire
was  &UR; Al Clark &LR; . All are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right after Rosh Hashanah,'' he said, ``and, after
greeting each other with a laughing round of `Hey, Yids,' we wished
each other a happy New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Muscle &AMP; Fitness magazine editor &UR; Jim Rosenthal &LR;  says that
former Giant  &UR; Rod Beck &LR; , who's now pitching for the Boston Red Sox,
has the flabbiest physique in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S.  &UR; Wilson Lewis &LR;  calls the flotilla outside the new
ballpark's McCovey Cove ``McCovey's Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHO SAID WHAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Caps and bridges and Lee Press-On teeth would appear to have
made dentures a thing of the past. Quel drag! Dentures were one of
the main sources of entertainment available to me as a youngster.
... If (my Dad) sneezed, his gnashers would hit the floor before
you could say Gesundheit. He once sneezed them across the front
yard, where they landed under his oily motorbike. My sister and I
consider this to be one of our most treasured childhood memories.
What are the dentures of today? Botox, breast implants? Will kids
scream with laughter when mummy's collagen slips or if her
acid-peel turns nasty? Which minor afflictions will provide the
happy memories of tomorrow?''

   JACOBS-MANAGEMENT (Evanston, Ill.) _ No one has had a greater
effect on management education in the United States than Dr. Donald
P. Jacobs, dean of the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at
Northwestern University, say his peers at schools around the
country. In 25 years at the helm, he created the prototype of the
modern business school, management experts say, fostering a boom in
M.B.A.'s. And Jacobs has become something of a model manager
himself. Unlike many academic institutions, Kellogg acts quickly,
putting in place pilot programs and taking time later to decide
whether they deserve a permanent place in the curriculum. ``He
pushes constant change,'' a colleague says. By David Leonhardt.

New Jersey _ three states that are among those with the highest
incidence of the disease in the nation _ say they will ask for a

that were to have been devoted to a better understanding of the
long-term effects of the still baffling disease that many patients
say has left them with serious neurological problems that can only
be treated with long-term antibiotics. By Holcomb B. Noble. (2000

   Entertainment and culture stories from The N.Y. Times News
Service for Wednesday, May 3.
</P>
<P>
   TV-TEENS (Hollywood) _ For decades on television shows about
teen-agers, sex was unmentioned, divorced parents were out of the
question and families lived in an all-white suburban world that
seemed frozen in time. The biggest issues facing television
teenagers of the '50s, '60s and '70s seemed to be borrowing the
family car or finding a date for the prom. And then came the Fox
shows ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which is making its television
finale on May 17 after 10 years, and ``Party of Five,'' whose last
episode will be seen Wednesday night. Though the characters on
these two shows could not be more dissimilar, the two programs have
transformed the way teen-agers are depicted on television,
presenting them as far more complicated, thoughtful and sexy than
the innocent, perky and sometimes goofy young people on earlier
series. By Bernard Weinraub. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-AUCTION (Beijing) _ The confrontation between Chinese
authorities and Hong Kong's premier auction houses over the sale of
looted imperial treasures has been defused, for now at least, by an
unlikely source: a giant Chinese state-owned corporation that
became the winning bidder on three of the four contested objects.
The company, the China Poly Group Corp., which until last year was
owned by the People's Liberation Army and is best known for its
global weapons sales, recently established a small antiquities
museum here with an emphasis on ancient bronzes. By Erik Eckholm

VETERAN OF LABOR'S OLDER WARS, DEFYING BLAIR, MAY WIN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ If the bookies are right, and they usually are, Ken
Livingstone, a maverick left-wing member of Parliament, will become
London's first elected mayor on Thursday, and Tony Blair's worst
nightmare will have been realized.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, the immensely popular prime minister, has mostly had his
way since he led his Labor Party to a landslide general election
victory in May 1997. Blair enjoys the biggest majority in
Parliament in nearly two centuries, allowing him to push through
virtually any legislation he wants. He has re-branded stodgy old
Britain as Cool Britannia and has positioned himself and Britain as
the bridge between the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservatives are at an all-time low in the
polls, posing no threat to Blair's popularity. He has gotten rid of
the rare check on his power, the conservative peers who inherited
their titles in the House of Lords. And, at 46, Blair is a few
weeks away from becoming a father for the fourth time, the first
prime minister to have a child born at 10 Downing St. in 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's ``Red Ken.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone, a dyed-in-the-wool left-winger, is everything that
Blair and the new Labor Party leadership deplore. Blairites thunder
that it was Livingstone and other ideologically rigid left-wingers
who were so beholden to unions and extremist causes that they made
the Labor Party unelectable for 18 years and allowed Margaret
Thatcher and her reactionary Tories to run roughshod over Britain
for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his top aides, who undid the Tory lock on power by
moving Labor toward the center and making it more
business-friendly, were determined not to let Livingstone be
Labor's candidate in the mayoral election. But their heavyhanded
tactics backfired, offending Londoners' sense of fair play and
fueling Livingstone's improbable campaign as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   He was expelled from the Labor Party but is heavily favored to
win. The most recent poll has him with 51 percent of the vote, 34
percent ahead of his closest rival.
</P>
<P>
   A maverick and something of a loner, Livingstone is a darling of
the left-wing press but is derided as loony by the right, which
consider him a communist-loving, self-loathing Englishman and an
IRA apologist. Conservatives say Livingstone is a self-aggrandizing
publicity hound, an ideologue incapable of making the compromises
and pragmatic decisions required of a mayor of a city of more than
7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   London has been run by the national government for 14 years.
Livingstone headed the Greater London Council, the city's last
local government, when Thatcher abolished it in 1986 after its
liberal leaders attacked her conservative policies. The council was
something like the Cambridge City Council in Massachusetts, where
no cause was too far to the left to merit a fawning resolution. In
the London council, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, was treated fondly even while the IRA was bombing
London.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who deplored the Labor Party's efforts to
keep Livingstone out of the mayor's race are wary of him regaining
the power he once wielded. Simon Jenkins, a columnist for the
Evening Standard, argued passionately that Livingstone deserved a
chance to run, but he is appalled at the prospect of him winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``His proposed four-year freeze on train and bus fares is
financial madness,'' Jenkins said. ``His vulnerability to any lobby
that can gain his ear promises a return to the old mayhem.
Interesting he may be, incompetent most certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Londoners, especially minorities who feel cut off from
the establishment, seem to love him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken's a Londoner,'' said Fiona Shaw, 30, an Irish-born hotel
receptionist, bestowing what is apparently the highest praise one
can lavish. ``He cares about ordinary people, people who ride The
Tube.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tube is London's creaky, crumbling subway system, also known
as The Underground. It's overcrowded, it often breaks down, and its
escalators in many of its cavernous stations are broken.
Livingstone wants to freeze fares and float bonds to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Blair who made Livingstone's return to power
possible, pushing for London's first elected mayor as part of his
push to decentralize power and to bolster local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contest has done exactly what the prime minister
intended. It has rekindled interest in local government,'' said
Patrick J. Dunleavy, a professor of government at the London School
of Economics. ``But Livingstone winning will present Blair with all
sorts of headaches and challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   While turnout in local elections in Britain is typically about
25 percent, Dunleavy predicts that the mayoral race could bring out
50 percent of the 5 million voters, handing whoever wins the
biggest single mandate in Europe, where parliamentary systems mean
that individuals, even prime ministers, are elected by relatively
small constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy said the London mayor will have limited powers, and
will be unable to raise taxes or dictate spending, but will have
authority to levy fees on those driving into London. The mayor will
have influence over the two institutions that matter most to
Londoners: public transportation and the Metropolitan Police.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, Dunleavy said, the mayor, overnight, will
become a celebrity and a national and international figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wins will be the leader of one of the three or four
truly international cities in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone's opponents have had trouble matching his ability to
generate publicity, especially Frank Dobson, Blair's handpicked
candidate. In the most recent polls, Dobson is struggling to hold
onto third place.
</P>
<P>
   Bearded, paunchy, and described as reserved by friends and as
downright dull by critics, Dobson is by most accounts a competent
administrator. He served as health minister before being drafted,
some would say forced, by the party leadership to challenge
Livingstone. Dobson has failed to stir passions.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative candidate, Steve Norris, who is running a
distant second in the polls, has stirred passions, but in a James
Brown sort of way. When questioned about his repeated infidelities,
Brown, the Godfather of Soul, once said, ``I simply have got to
have lots of ladies.'' Norris made virtually the same admission
after his myriad affairs were gleefully catalogued by the British
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Put off by his philandering, Conservatives chose Jeffrey Archer,
a roguish novelist, as their candidate. But he was forced to quit
the race in November after it emerged that Archer had lied in a
libel case in which he successfully sued two newspapers that had
said he had spent a night with a prostitute in a seedy hotel.
Norris became the candidate by default.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it made little difference. Most everybody agrees
that come Thursday, Ken Livingstone, flashing his trademark
Cheshire cat grin, will be mayor.

 YOUNG LAWYERS' STOCK RISES WITH INTERNET  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Kendall was 28 and just a few years out of law
school in 1997 when his firm, Boston's Goodwin Procter &AMP; Hoar,
asked him to work with a Harvard business student, Stig Leschley,
who needed help making his e-commerce idea a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall soon became the firm's main contact for the young
entrepreneur, who grew his start-up into Exchange.com, an Internet
retail site that fetched $200 million when Amazon.com bought it
last year. The young lawyer not only offered Leschley legal advice,
he talked him through setbacks and celebrated his successes with
him. They went to parties together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary thing when you think about it,'' Kendall
says now. ``It was me, a fourth-year associate, who developed that
relationship, not an established partner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old economy, the chances of junior lawyers like Kendall
having such close contact with a client were virtually nonexistent.
An associate's lot in life was to do legal research and support
senior lawyers in the hope, after seven or eight years, of becoming
a partner in a firm. But in the new economy, where 20-somethings
often head dot.com companies, law firms now see young lawyers like
Kendall as a crucial resource in attracting legal work from the
Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these companies are being run by young people, and
when they go looking for a lawyer, they want somebody with the same
energy level, the same excitement for what they're doing and
similar comfort with computers and the Internet,'' says William
Lee, managing partner at Hale and Dorr in Boston. ``It's usually
not older lawyers they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, many associates are being liberated from the staid
confines of law libraries to take on business-getting roles, in a
reversal of the traditional law-firm hierarchy in which a select
group of partners serve as rainmakers. To win their services, firms
are offering huge salaries, fast-track career paths and perks that
range from Palm Pilots to stock options in the high-tech start-ups
the young lawyers represent.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, even after an associate completed the grueling
apprenticeship to become a partner, it could take years to develop
a client roster. But more than ever before, law firms are running
on Internet time, relying on some on their youngest lawyers to woo
high-tech companies, the fastest growing sector of corporate legal
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who are six, seven, eight months out of law
school out there networking and bringing in business from emerging
companies,'' says Charles Dougherty, a senior partner at Boston's
Hill &AMP; Barlow, which is offering associates large bonuses and the
possibility of making partner in five years for wooing companies
into its ``incubator'' program for startups.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty said that the firm's associates ``are members of every
entrepreneurial group and technology-related council that exists,''
and that many have classmates who are involved in start-ups. ``We
are encouraging an entrepreneurial approach for the associates, and
it is enormously successful,'' Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Most firms where associates are taking a larger role in wooing
clients still keep a seasoned partner on those accounts to handle
tough legal issues and to help manage the work. But firms have
found that emerging high-tech companies need hand-holding as much
or more than they need experienced lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want people they know will care about what they're
doing,'' Dougherty says. ``They see these young lawyers as
co-entrepreneurs who are working with them and are there for them.
A lot of these guys are learning how to run a business as they go,
and they need people to brainstorm with and toss around ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason young lawyers have been put in charge of those
accounts is, simply, that they are often about the same age and
connect more readily with fledgling entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with all things in the lottery-like universe of the
Internet, it's the lure of sudden riches that's driving such
geologic shifts in law firm protocol. Firms want to inexpensively
establish as many relationships with infant Internet start-ups as
possible _ betting that a few will turn into giants with steady
needs for legal services and healthy budgets to spend on them.
Armies of associates can forge more of those relationships at a
lower cost than senior partners whose time is worth more money,
firms say.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an attempt to hang on to young lawyers, who recently
have fled big firms in droves to become in-house lawyers for
Internet companies _ a gamble for more exciting careers while
possibly hitting it big with portfolios of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big dream for lawyers right now,'' says Brian
Lenihan, a seventh-year associate at Hill &AMP; Barlow who has built
his own client list of some 50 high-tech and venture capital
companies under the firm's ``incubator'' program. ``Everyone talks
about that as their end-game: Go to work for a dot-com and get the
options. Everybody's thinking about the brass ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to counter the siren song of the Internet, some
Boston firms have upped starting salaries for first-year associates
to as much as $155,000, up from last year's standard of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Hill &AMP; Barlow, have launched incentive programs
that give associates bonuses of up to half their salaries for
bringing in new clients and racking up billable hours. To further
sweeten the pot, the firm has begun taking ownership interests in
start-up clients and offering a stake in the companies to
associates. In addition to money, Hill &AMP; Barlow lets the most
successful associates trim two years off the standard track to
being a partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to realize they don't have to climb some long
ladder in order to do interesting work and get somewhere in the
firm,'' Dougherty says.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it's too early to tell whether the strategy
will work for law firms or even whether it will last. With the
unnerving tumble of the Nasdaq Composite stock index in recent
weeks and the resulting shakeout of marginal Internet companies,
some now wonder whether the dot-com gold rush will soon cease,
ending law associates' moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   But most believe that whether or not the frenzied pace of the
past two years continues, the old order has been abolished by the
Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a momentum there that's not going to be thwarted,''
Dougherty says. ``The world has changed, and this is definitely the
model of the decade that law firms will have to follow.''

RUSSIA'S REFORMS SLOW FLOW OF US ADOPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All over the country, people like Alison Doane are growing more
nervous by the day. Some have waited weeks, others months for the
Russian child whose picture they gaze at incessantly, and who they
have been promised will soon become their own. Now, suddenly,
adoption agencies are telling them that they can't be sure when
they'll get their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that we, as a group, are scared,'' Doane, a
musician from Malden, Mass., says. ``We're optimistic the adoptions
will eventually go through ... but the uncertainty makes people
agitated, and the ones in line the longest are up in arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety among prospective parents -- and among adoption
practitioners throughout the United States -- stems from a series
of new laws in Russia that promise to radically alter adoption
practices within that country and, as a result, possibly change the
face of international adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Russia's actions is potentially huge because it
provides more children for adoption abroad than any other country,
and the vast majority of those adoptees go to the United States.
Significantly, at a time when most children adopted abroad by white
Americans are of a different race, Russia also is the largest
foreign source of Caucasian children.
</P>
<P>
   Russian's new laws were signed last week as decrees by
President-elect Vladimir Putin, but they were barely reported by
the world's media. The statutes appear designed, in part, to show
the incoming leader's nationalistic stripes, but they are
principally intended to halt bribery, child-selling, and other
illegal activities allegedly occurring during the course of placing
Russian orphans in US adoptive homes.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, bribes of thousands of dollars are regularly
doled out to judges, orphanage officials and, most frequently and
generously, to bilingual intermediaries who guide would-be parents
through often-confusing bureaucratic and judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the intermediaries are Russian nationals who work
simultaneously for several agencies, attorneys, and adoption
facilitators in the United States -- making the operatives'
loyalties suspect and their operations difficult to monitor. And
some officials in Washington and Moscow believe members of the
Russian Mafia are involved in adoption procedures there.
</P>
<P>
   Putin aims to clean up the process by imposing numerous reforms,
effective immediately. The most important are banning
intermediaries; allowing only nonprofit, accredited adoption
agencies with a minimum of five years' experience to function;
ordering each agency to open its own office with separate, salaried
employees; and mandating that all involved report on their
activities and pay taxes on income received.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, all of the estimated 160 to 180 US agencies
conducting business in Russia employ intermediaries, and none are
accredited because it has never been a requirement before. So none
can initiate new adoptions until specific operating guidelines are
established, primarily by the Ministry of Education but with input
from five additional government departments as well.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptions already in the pipeline are being allowed to proceed,
but at the discretion of individual judges in local jurisdictions
around Russia. It also is legal for prospective parents to navigate
that nation's legal and governmental adoption bureaucracies without
the assistance of an agency or intermediary, although generally
with the help of a Russian lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell applicants to stand by, because it's not possible to
know how long all of this will take to resolve,'' said Filis Casey,
executive director of the Alliance for Children in Wellesley, one
of the largest adoption agencies in New England. ``We don't think
Russian adoptions will stop, but when something like this happens,
it sends shivers through the adoption community, because you can't
know for sure what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the adoption professionals interviewed thius week,
Casey said she didn't expect the delays in Russia to last more than
a few months. But other practitioners predicted that, given
Moscow's notoriously slow bureaucracies and some of the entrenched
problems in the adoption system, it could take a year or more for
the new procedures to be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   All those involved said they were worried about the children who
will remain longer in orphanages while the new laws are being put
in place. However much good the changes might eventually do, many
of those facilities are badly run, lack funds, and are staffed by
personnel who mistreat the boys and girls living within them;
experts agree that the longer children remain in such institutions,
the greater the emotional and developmental damage they incur.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed, however, pointed out that every nation that
allows its children to be adopted abroad has periodically revised
its rules, especially during changes in government. Most notably,
that happened several times during the 1990s in China, which ranked
at the top of ``sending'' adoption nations until Russia assumed
that standing a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest State Department tally, Americans
adopted 4,348 children from Russia in 1999, compared to 4,101 from
China. The reforms instituted by Beijing over the years have made
that country's adoption process perhaps the least-corrupt in the
world; the third-highest source nation, South Korea (with 2,008
adoptees leaving last year), also runs operations that
professionals believe is very clean.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Russia is able to follow through on its promises, it
would mean the lopsided majority of adoptions in the world will be
done ethically and with a minimum of shady activity. Almost 16,400
children from all nations, including some where such crimes as
bribery, coercion, and baby theft are frequently reported, were
adopted into the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has the potential to slow down the process, but
we believe that will be temporary. And in the long run we're hoping
it's a beneficial change because it makes the process more credible
and provides assurances to prospective parents about the people
they're working with, as well as to the Russian federation,'' said
Mike Walsh, a vice president for Lutheran Social Services of New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Goodbody, head of the Russian adoption section of
Spence-Chapin in New York -- one of the nation's largest adoption
agencies -- said Putin's changes could have ripple effects. As
would-be parents look elsewhere, for instance, she said it is
likely other nations will be swamped with applications that could
also slow down their processes.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Hogan, president of Adopt America Advocates and studies
adoption in Eastern Europe, said the Russian reforms also will have
another certain effect: persuading other nations to follow suit.
Hogan, who returned from a fact-finding tour of Romania last week,
said that country already is studing Moscow's actions and is likely
to institute similar reforms soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries are saying, `We know there's a pressing need
to find homes for all these children,' '' said Hogan, a vocal
proponent of squeezing financial corruption out of the adoption
process. ``But they're not willing to sacrifice these kids on the
alter of commercialism.''

&HT;     PAROLE CASE PITS GOVERNOR AGAINST FELLOW DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ When someone called Robert Rosenkrantz a
``faggot'' at his high school graduation party and exposed his
homosexuality to his father, the 18-year-old went into a panic,
bought an Uzi and, a week later, put 10 bullets into the man who
insulted him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 15 years in prison for second-degree murder, the
Rosenkrantz case is at the center of a political fight between Gov.
Gray Davis and fellow Democrats in the Legislature, many of whom
believe Rosenkrantz should be set free because he has been a model
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The case is jeopardizing a Davis appointment to the state Board
of Prison Terms, which has refused to find Rosenkrantz suitable for
parole, despite an unprecedented court order requiring them to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 2,100 inmates reviewed for parole since Davis became
governor in 1999, the prison board has recommended parole only 18
times, and the governor has rejected every one, including
Rosenkrantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought not to have a system that runs on automatic pilot in
these kinds of cases,'' said state Sen. Richard Polanco, a Los
Angeles Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosenkrantz case is widening a political split between Davis
and Senate President pro tem John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat
who is the state's most powerful lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Against the governor's wishes, Burton has blocked the
appointment of the parole board's former chairman, James W.
Nielsen, after allegations that disabled prisoners were being
ignored at hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenkrantz, now 34, was convicted of second-degree murder and
sentenced to 17 years to life after the June 1985 killing in the
Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Then 18, he was headed to college and was host for a graduation
party at his parent's beach house when his brother and one of the
brother's friends, Steven Redman, burst into the party screaming
``faggots'' and attacked the party-goers. Rosenkrantz's nose was
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Redman later told Rosenkrantz's father that his son was gay,
prompting Rosenkrantz to be disowned. (The father has since
embraced his son.)
</P>
<P>
   Rosenkrantz bought an Uzi submachine gun, went to a firing range
to practice and confronted Redman a week after the party. When
Redman refused to recant his statement, and called him a ``faggot''
again, Rosenkrantz shot him 10 times and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Since his conviction, Rosenkrantz has earned a college degree
and started tutoring other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say he is a model inmate who has not received a
single citation for discipline problems.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous psychologists say he is fit to be released. Prosecutors
in his case, the trial judge and detective who worked on the case
say he should be released. Redman's grandmother, the victim's last
surviving relative, thinks Rosenkrantz should be paroled.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court ruled on April 27 that the parole board had
abused its discretion when it found Rosenkrantz unsuitable for
parole.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered a new parole hearing within 30 days. The
appeals panel was supporting a Superior Court judge who last year
ordered a release date for Rosenkrantz, saying he no longer
remained a danger to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never happened before. There has never been a court
order that the board must find someone suitable for release,'' said
Rowan L. Klein, Rosenkrantz's Los Angeles-based attorney. ``The
parole board can't have an across-the-board policy. That just makes
all cases automatically the maximum sentence. ... They're supposed
to be given due consideration.''

HEALTH OFFICIALS BATTLE A RISING TIDE OF DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston is 190 miles from New York City as the crow flies _ and
that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Crows are a favorite target of the West Nile virus, the latest
``new'' human disease organism to appear in North America. The
viral import, which most closely resembles a strain found in the
Middle East but might have come from Africa, Europe or Asia, killed
seven people last summer in the New York metropolitan area. It
caused serious but nonfatal brain infections in 62 older
individuals, and infected perhaps 2,000 others who didn't fall ill.
</P>
<P>
   Now health officials fear West Nile encephalitis may soon hitch
a ride to southern New England in the blood of a crow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a flock of crows to seed virus into an area,''
said Ralph Timperi, director of the Massachusetts Health
Department's State Laboratory Institute. ``One infected bird could
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of crows died of West Nile virus disease last summer
and fall in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and, in one known
case, Baltimore. The crows picked up the virus from a mosquito
species called Culex that especially likes to breed and bite in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists don't know why crows are exquisitely sensitive to the
West Nile virus strain that popped up last season. But they do know
that infected crows develop remarkably high blood levels of the
virus before they sicken and die, providing opportunity for
mosquitoes to amplify the virus across the landscape. And while
crows don't migrate, they do range 200 miles or so from their home
territory.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't have to be a crow, either. Federal health officials
have tracked West Nile virus in 18 bird species so far.
Massachusetts health officials and their counterparts along the
Eastern seaboard are worried that robins and starlings, two common
species that roost like crows, could also spread the virus in the
coming months. Hawks and chickens are also susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal health officials acknowledge that they
have no idea whether West Nile virus will cause significant human
disease this season, or where. ``We're looking at the whole state
as potentially at risk,'' said Dr. Bela Matyas, medical director of
the state health department's epidemiology program.
</P>
<P>
   The unfolding West Nile encephalitis story is yet another
illustration of the entire globe's rising vulnerability to emerging
infections. It's an alarming trend, health researchers say, that
offers fresh examples almost every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``After almost a decade of battling emerging infections, it
seems that the factors supporting their occurrence have only become
more common and complicated,'' infectious disease expert Michael T.
Osterholm notes in the current New England Journal of Medicine.
``Our task is a lot like trying to swim against the current of a
raging river.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in highly developed nations with the world's best public
health infrastructure, microbes old and new are often winning
battles in a war that not long ago society seemingly had almost
won. Infectious-disease mortality in this country has increased
during the last two decades after 80 years of dramatic and steady
decline, according to Dr. Steven Ostroff of the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   If AIDS deaths are counted, Ostroff said, the US
infectious-disease mortality rate increased 58 percent since 1980.
Even removing AIDS from the tally, the nation has experienced a 22
percent rise in infectious disease deaths during that period.
</P>
<P>
   A common denominator of many emerging diseases, health
authorities say, is the vast and rapid traffic of people, food
products, and animals across increasingly permeable international
boundaries. ``Infectious diseases can move rapidly and cause
enormous health problems these days,'' Timperi said. ``If something
is happening anywhere, it's a concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus, for instance, is thought by many scientists to
have arrived on these shores in the blood of a bird, or perhaps an
infected mosquito, most likely from the Middle East. Genetic
analysis of the virus showed it most closely resembled a strain
that killed a goose in Israel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That means, the CDC's Ostroff said, that humans inadvertently
enabled the virus to leap to New York City, either in an airplane
or a ship's cargo hold. He noted that the sentinel cases in last
year's West Nile encephalitis outbreak arose within a few miles of
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its predilection for crows, robins, chickens, hawks and
other common bird species, West Nile virus has another feature that
worries public health authorities. The ``vector'' that carries it
between birds and humans is the Culex mosquito species that thrives
in urban areas and feeds all night. By contrast, the Aedes mosquito
species that carries deadly Eastern equine encephalitis prefers
swampy areas and feeds only at dusk and dawn, limiting human
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culex comes out at dusk but it stays out all night seeking
blood meals,'' said Timperi, the Massachusetts health official.
``Also, Culex will go into homes; not all mosquitos will. It's
probably the one that's buzzing in your ear at night.''
</P>
<P>
   In public health terms, however, West Nile virus's dependence on
Culex is also an opportunity. Mosquito abatement is a strategy
about which health officials know a thing or two. The task is vast:
Think about all those stagnant pools, ditches, clogged gutters,
backyard wading pools and bird baths where Culex larvae lurk. But
it is straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all proactively and aggressively eliminate breeding
opportunities for these mosquitos, we can make a real difference in
our exposure to them,'' Matyas said. ``Change the water in your
birdbath regularly. Make sure your gutters aren't clogged. If you
have a swimming pool, you can get little briquettes called Mosquito
Dunks that contain a nonchemical pesticide that kills the larvae
with no effect on any animal. Don't let water stand in old tires or
garbage cans.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Massachusetts, with a $2.7 million grant from the
CDC, is hiring more personnel to track bird die-offs and trap
mosquitos, especially as Culex populations build in late June and
July. If West Nile virus begins to show up, officials will move
into higher gear, sowing bacterial larvicide in catch basins and
stepping up public education.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, however, that nothing may happen this season,
either because of public health efforts or because the Old World
virus may behave unpredictably in its New World setting. ``West
Nile may not necessarily cause a flare-up over the next several
months,'' said the CDC's Ostroff, ``because we know it's there,
we're doing very intensive monitoring to determine where and when
it emerges, and there will be aggressive efforts to reduce mosquito
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' he added, ``is that, if not much happens, people
will rapidly lose interest, not do the same thing next year, and
then we'll see the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOUR CASES SHOW A WIDESPREAD, DIVERSE PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The New England Journal of Medicine offers four detailed case
studies of emerging infections that illustrate both the global
sweep and the biological diversity of the phenomenon: &QL; 
 &QL; 
Case one &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Malaysian pig farmers and others who had close
contact with the animals fell ill last year with encephalitis in an
outbreak that killed one-third of the cases and left another 15
percent with long-lasting brain damage. That epidemic was caused by
the recently discovered Nipah virus.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm, a former Minnesota health official who now runs an
Internet company that purveys infectious disease information, noted
that the outbreak resulted from ``the unprecedentedly large
populations of closely confined animals, particularly pigs and
chickens'' that characterize ``our new global food supply.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Case two &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old Nebraska farm boy recently suffered an intestinal
infection that turned out to have been caused by a strain of
salmonella bacteria resistant to 13 different antibiotics,
including ceftriaxone, a mainstay for treating salmonella
infections.
</P>
<P>
   The boy apparently acquired the infection _ the first such
highly resistant salmonella strain that has arisen in this country
_ through his contact with antibiotic-fed cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest ``that the use of antimicrobial agents in
livestock is the dominant source of resistance'' in salmonella, the
Nebraska researchers said. They warned that dangerously resistant
salmonella infections ``could become more common in the United
States.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Case three &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bowel infection nearly killed a diabetic 12-year-old Atlanta
boy who had eaten chitterlings, or pig intestines, contaminated
with a bacterium that normally does not cause disease in developed
countries. The boy required extensive surgery to remove damaged
portions of his intestine.
</P>
<P>
   Because the boy's poorly controlled diabetes predisposed him to
the unusual infection, Osterholm warned that the case ``reminds us
of the increased potential for infectious diseases'' among the
growing number of people with chronic diseases and poor immune
function. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Case four &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 outbreak of intestinal illness among 1,566 students and
teachers at two primary schools in northern Italy was caused by a
bacterium called Listeria, which only recently has been known to
cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Nearly 300 victims required
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Italian researchers traced the Listeria outbreak to contaminated
canned corn. ``With a global food supply, we worry less about the
possibility that Grandmother's potato salad will affect 80 percent
of the people attending a church picnic than about the prospect
that hundreds of thousands of people in many countries will be
exposed to a single contaminated product,'' Osterholm commented.

SENATOR KENNEDY'S CHINA CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Dick Gephardt was a given _ and in more ways than
simply the House Democratic leader's opposition to normal trading
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   So large a shadow does Massachusetts's senior senator cast _ he
is one of the key figures in the last 30 years of slowly expanding
US-Chinese ties _ that what he doesn't do and doesn't say is as
important as what he does.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, as the clock starts ticking toward a pivotal vote
in the House of Representatives later this month, it is what
Kennedy isn't doing and saying that is central.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton would dearly love for Kennedy not just to
support his agreement with China, which will slash tariffs and
remove other barriers to US-made products in the world's biggest
market, not just to support the establishment of permanent trade
relations, thus ending the yearly votes on the issue in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   What the president is most anxious for is Kennedy's advocacy not
as a senator but as a national leader.
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, it appears that Clinton is not going to get
it.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's inclination is not to make his position on trade
relations known until after the House has acted. What concerns the
president is that the impending vote in the House is close enough
that a really big shot like Kennedy could help enough wavering
Democrats to make a difference in the House outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking Kennedy's support, Clinton administration officials
make two points.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that those leading figures who state their
positions early will have a chance to be heard on the substantive
merits of the issue. The flip side is that the longer a politician
waits, the more his position is likely to be viewed as political
positioning pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   The second point is that US-Chinese relations is a Kennedy issue
with a lot of history.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon had barely settled in the White House for his
first term in 1969 when Kennedy issued a dramatic call for a fresh
look at the obviously failed policy of isolation toward China that
had prevailed since Mao Zedong's takeover 20 years before.
</P>
<P>
   As recounted by journalist Patrick Tyler in his recently
published examination (``A Great Wall'') of six US presidents'
handling of China, from Nixon through Clinton, Kennedy's speech to
China experts in New York in March of that year was followed almost
immediately by the hints of a Nixon reassessment that eventually
led to his historic breathrough two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Nixon reassessment and Henry Kissinger's secret
diplomacy acquired a life of their own, but through this period an
awareness that Kennedy and other leading Democrats were pushing
hard for change (Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield of Montana
actually applied for a visa to visit Beijing in 1970) helped propel
the Nixon initiative forward.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was also a critical figure in the first year of Jimmy
Carter's presidency. In a period of foreign policy drift and
rivalry between Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and national
security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, Kennedy once again jumped in
with a major speech. He called on the president to breathe life
into the relationship and move to cut off relations with Taiwan as
a prelude to joining what by then were more than 60 nations
(including all of America's allies) in establishing formal ties
with China. Kennedy then made a journey to China himself, giving
the process another powerful jolt.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, I remember being with Kennedy in California when
he got word from Vice President Walter Mondale that relations were
about to be established. Kennedy immediately took a few hours away
from a tour promoting national health insurance (the issue that put
him on a collision course with Carter in 1980) to make calls and
statements of praise and support.
</P>
<P>
   Those Kennedy initiatives involved a China much different from
the country today. In 1969, the Vietnam War was still going full
blast and China was just three years into its ruinous Cultural
Revolution. In 1977, Deng Xiaoping had yet to take power and begin
the process of economic modernization. To advocate American
isolation from the China of today ignores the great distance that
has been traveled, in large part because the United States was
engaged; is also ignores the potential of a huge economic market.
</P>
<P>
   No one can question Kennedy's commitment to human rights or to
the interests of America's working families. Nor can anyone ignore
his consistent refusal to play protectionist politics as the
world's economic interdependence has become more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   There are political, but not substantive, reasons for his
silence now. The fact is that China is a Kennedy issue, and the
future of US-Chinese relations is on the line.

BANK SCANDAL GETS A DOSE OF TITILLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ References to the Bank of New York have been popping up
in strange places in Moscow. In the city's chatty tabloid press,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the scandal-sheet Versiya reported that it knows of a
videotape showing a Bank of New York executive frolicking with
Moscow prostitutes. The paper reported that it was trying to obtain
a copy of the tape to check its validity and promised readers it
would stay on top of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? What's that all about? Stories like this usually don't
appear in the Russian press by accident _ and they usually have
goals other than amusing voyeuristic readers. When something like
this pops up, it is often some sort of veiled threat.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Bank of New York's recent history with Russia
hasn't been a happy one. Last fall, US and British law-enforcement
officials said they were investigating allegations that as much as
$7 billion in Russian cash was illegally laundered through the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal broke, the news media here were full of stories
saying the allegations were fabricated by political forces in the
United States to discredit Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York has since fired two Russian-born
executives, Lucy Edwards and Natalya Kagalovskaya. Edwards pleaded
guilty to arranging illegal transfer of billions of dollars through
the bank. Kagalovskaya, who has not been charged, is suing the bank
for damaging her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Iowa Republican James Leach, who chairs the House
Banking Committee, was in Moscow to confer with Russian legislators
on how the countries can cooperate to tighten controls on money
laundering. A Russian journalist asked Leach about the Versiya
article and its allegations of sexual debauchery. While listening
to the translation, Leach's face seemed to betray a mixture of
confusion, amusement, and dread _ but he recovered well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know anything about sexual scandals in the United
States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in the room burst out in laughter. The Russian
media, with barely concealed delight, had reported extensively on
the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid press isn't the only place the Bank of New York has
fallen under attack here. Recently, billboards have appeared along
some of Moscow's most heavily traveled streets with the following
message: ``Gentlemen from the Bank of New York, we are warning you.
Manipulating stocks in Russia is impermissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can say who was behind the billboards, but the Bank of
New York is a major player with Russian stocks. The bank holds a
virtual monopoly on American Depository Receipts, or ADRs, proxy
stocks for Russian corporations that are traded on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ADR system, the Bank of New York buys shares in
Russian companies and then sells proxy stocks on the US exchange.
The bank, not the foreign ADR holder, is allowed to vote at
shareholder meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians here have criticized the ADR system, saying
Russian corporate executives use it to manipulate shareholder
votes. In exchange for a company's ADR business, the politicians
allege, the Bank of New York agrees to vote according to
management's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York's ADR business is also threatened by
Kagalovskaya's $270 million lawsuit. If she wins, her lawyers
suspect that the Bank of New York will not pay out. If this
happens, the lawyers have hinted that they will go after the assets
the Bank of New York owns in several Russian companies through
ADRs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Moscow can probably look forward to more tantalizing
tabloid stories, and strange billboards.

LOOKING UP THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EARTH AND THE PLANETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is there a formula or chart to determine how far away all the
planets are in relation to the Earth at any given time?
</P>
<P>
   R.S., N. Quincy, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer really depends on how well you want to know the
distances. Lots of astronomy books will give you average distances,
which may be good enough for many applications. Relatively easy
formulas also are possible and can be worked out from the
information in many texts, if you know a bit of physics and math
and are willing to approximate the orbits of the planets about the
sun as circles or ellipses all lying in a plane. If you want lots
of detail, you can look in the Astronomical Almanac published by
the US Naval Observatory each year. It takes a bit of work to get
the numbers you want out of it, and you'll need to know what a
vector is, but it's all there for you.
</P>
<P>
   You might be better off getting some software that runs on a PC
instead of a book. It's more efficient to do things that way, just
as it's more efficient to have a calculator work out trig functions
and logs than it is to keep huge tables.
</P>
<P>
   The MICA, or Multiyear Interactive Computer Almanac, also from
the US Naval Observatory, will give you lots of information about
where interesting things in the sky are at any time from 1990 to
2005. You can find out more about how to get this program from the
Web at http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/software/mica/micainfo.html.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful book is ``Planetary Programs and Tables -4000 to
+2800'' from Willmann-Bell Inc. The website is at
http://www.willbell.com/math/mc11.htm.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a book and a collection of programs there.
</P>
<P>
   There's quite a lot of software out there, and Dr. Knowledge
would be happy to hear from any of you who have any favorites.
</P>

GETTING TO P'TOWN, SPEEDILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Provincetown is moving closer to Boston. No, the tip of Cape Cod
is not physically moving, but a new ferry service will cut the time
getting there almost in half.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Harbor Cruises will begin a ``fast'' ferry service
between Boston's Rowes Wharf and Provincetown's MacMillan Wharf
begins Saturday with daily service beginning May 12. The new
service will take 90 minutes, using a high-speed catamaran that can
travel at up to 40 miles an hour with up to 350 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   At present the fastest service to Provincetown takes two hours
on Bay State Cruises. The company has another vessel that takes
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Harbor Cruises vessel will offer a full snack bar,
cocktail service, and a state-of-the-art sound system. The one-way
service will cost $25 for adults, $22 for students and seniors, and
$20 for children. Round-trip fares are $39 adult, $35 students and
seniors, and $30 children. Included in the price is admission to
The Whydah Museum on MacMillan Wharf. The museum contains a
collection of pirate artifacts and offers a look into the history
of buccaneers. The line is also offering bike rentals in
Provincetown.
</P>
<P>
   The new service should prove a boon to tourism in Provincetown,
and to marine life. The catamarans are said to reduce the potential
of underwater strikes at marine life because they use no underwater
shafts or propellers, just water jets for power.

Kruger reopens &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kruger National Park in South Africa is again fully operational
following the floods that struck in February. South African Tourism
reports that damage to the park's infrastructure has been repaired,
and while the floods were destructive, the rains have had a
positive effect on the park's natural environment. The floods
cleared waterways of years of silt buildup and dense vegetation
along riverbanks. The soft, muddy ground left in the wake of the
floods has created a boon for wildlife viewing as lions, giraffes,
and bull elephants are seen congregating on the roads. Rangers
believe this is due to the tar roads being firmer and offering more
support, making them preferable for the animals. For information
write to South African Tourism, 500 Fifth Ave., Suite 2049, New
York, NY 10110; telephone 800-822-5368 or visit www.satour.org. &QL;

SWITCH PULLED WITH `EXCHANGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas was determined to go into the Kentucky
Derby holding three cards. So with True Confidence out, thrown into
the pile of slow horses, Lukas picked up Exchange Rate and tucked
him into his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has saddled the most Derby starters (35, including a
record five in 1996), has High Yield, who is legitimate, and
Commendable, who is highly questionable, ready to go. He was trying
to work True Confidence, who has only a maiden victory in nine
starts, into the mix. But True Confidence, who gave way badly to
finish 13th in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn April 15, was too
dismal, even for Lukas. The trainer gave him one more chance, but
after he finished eighth and last in the Derby Trial at Churchill
Downs last Saturday, Lukas pulled the plug.
</P>
<P>
   However, up popped Exchange Rate, who had finished ninth in the
Wood Memorial at Aqueduct April 15. Lukas sent him out for a gate
work at Churchill Sunday, and _ voila! _ Exchange Rate was headed
for the Derby. It is no coincidence that True Confidence and
Exchange Rate are both owned by Padua Stable, a key Lukas outfit
that wants to be represented in the Rose Run. At least Exchange
Rate has won three races (7-3-2-0), including a stake, the Risen
Star at Fair Grounds Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has competed in the last 19 runnings of the Derby, but
this marked the first time he had worked a horse from the gate in
preparation for the race. Exchange Rate, a son of Danzig, went 5
furlongs in 1:00 flat under jockey Calvin Borel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had to do a little more with him because I don't
think he got anything out of the Louisiana Derby (finished fourth)
and Wood Memorial. If he's doing as well as I think he is doing, we
will go in, and Calvin will ride him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, True Confidence, a son of Storm Cat, will go to
either the Illinois Derby, the Preakness, or the Riva Ridge (on the
Belmont Stakes undercard).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of options,'' said Lukas. ``True Confidence
caught a quarter (kicked his front foot with his back foot) in the
Trial, but he's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Commendable is another who has won only a maiden race (6-1-0),
but the son of Gone West is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, who won
last year's Derby with the Lukas-trained long shot Charismatic. The
Lewises own a piece of High Yield, but Commendable is all theirs.
Commendable has run fourth three straight times, in the San Rafael
and San Felipe at Santa Anita in March, and in the Lexington at
Keeneland April 21. He worked 6 furlongs Sunday at Churchill in
1:12 3/5 with exercise rider Stacey Maker aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has won the Derby four times (Winning Colors, 1988;
Thunder Gulch, '95; Grindstone, '96; and Charismatic), is eager for
Derby Day to arrive. He knows he has one true threat, High Yield,
the winner of the Blue Grass at Keeneland April 15, who will be
ridden by the King of Churchill, Pat Day. Another son of Storm Cat,
High Yield has an excellent career record of 12-4-4-3, and has
captured three Grade I races while earning nearly $1.2 million. He
drilled six panels in 1:13 3/5 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to run this thing now,'' said Lukas. ``We're ready.
We have been able to do everything we wanted to do since we got
here. I think all you can do is get your horses as good as you can
possibly get them, and then see what happens. The last piece of the
puzzle was Exchange Rate working well. We are at the point with
High Yield and Commendable that they had very good weeks. I've
looked around (at the opposition), and I feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Yield has been very durable, very tough. He probably has
more bottom in him than most of them at the track that a lot of the
media are mentioning. He has endured the two-turn races, the Grade
I competition, and moved forward off every one of them, in my
opinion. I had him out on the lawn, and I couldn't beleive the
muscle tone and the weight he is carrying. I'm pleased with his
overall condition. Whether he is good enough to win the Kentucky
Derby, nobody knows. But I wouldn't want to change anything.''

   Presumptive favorite Fusaichi Pegasus had his final Derby
workout at Churchill Sunday and it was uneventful. When he worked
last Wednesday, Fusaichi Pegasus suddenly reared, threw exercise
rider Nuno Santos to the ground, and fell himself, landing on his
right hip. Fortunately, both horse and rider were unscathed. This
time, he just cruised around, going 6 furlongs in 1:14 3/5 before
galloping out 7 in 1:27 under Andy Durnin. ``He wasn't given his
head until 100 yards from the finish,'' said trainer Neil Drysdale.
``His last quarter was :23 and change, and he galloped out another
eighth in :12 and change. I'm very satisfied. He went well. It was
exactly what we asked for, a standard work. He behaved well. He
played around a little bit, with a few bucks. This horse looks good
going over the ground, and I'm happy to see him doing so well.''
From now untillthe race, Fusaichi Pegasus will gallop only to keep
fit . . . Suffolk will host a 14-race doubleheader Saturday. Gates
will open at 10:30 a.m., with first post at noon. Full-card
simulcating will be offered from Churchill Downs, where post time
will be 11:30 a.m. Suffolk will offer ``price shopping,'' meaning
bettors can wager on the Derby through the New England pool at
Suffolk, or through the national pool at Churchill. Advance
wagering on the Derby will be offered, through the Suffolk pool
only, beginning at noon Friday. A Derby cocktail glass, always a
popular item, will be given away with each paid admission, while
supplies last.

STUDENT ENCOUNTERS THE DARK SIDE OF E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Paul Denning, a sophomore at New York
University, was in an unusually cheerful mood as he strolled to
class one bright morning last fall. Just back from a road trip to
visit his girlfriend at Smith College, he was looking forward to
hunkering down to his studies and getting together with some new
friends later on.
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, this: He was surrounded by police officers,
who put him in an ambulance, which drove him to Bellevue Hospital,
where the doctors took away his shoelaces as a precaution against
suicide and committed him to the ward for the mentally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ambulance, confused, Denning had asked what was going
on. A paramedic showed him printouts of some e-mail, with certain
passages highlighted:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go out and shoot as many people as I can and then
shoot myself to even the number. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Most things these days make me want to slit my own throat and
count the number of people I can bleed on before I die. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should stop showing people my new gun, but I'm so
proud of it. Makes me feel like a real New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Denning recognized these words. He had written them. But he
hadn't meant them. They were bits of dark humor, addressed to a
friend back home in Iowa City who would understand their intent.
How did this paramedic get hold of them? Were they the reason he
was being hauled away?
</P>
<P>
   It took him days to realize it, but this 19-year-old had become
yet another character in a murky tale about the perils of privacy
and the wispy line dividing prudence from paranoia in the
post-Columbine era.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent landmarks on that line: Just last week, a student
was suspended from Boston Latin Academy for writing a story about
taking a chainsaw to his English teacher. Earlier this year, in
Denton, Texas, a 13-year-old boy was jailed for a week for writing
a Halloween story in which he imagined shooting his teacher. The
teacher gave it an A-plus, but the principal, who also read it,
phoned the police in alarm. And a couple of months ago, as the
result of a task force report on the lessons of Columbine, the
governor of North Carolina set up a Web site urging schoolchildren
to turn in seemingly dangerous classmates by calling a toll-free
number.
</P>
<P>
   Denning spent three days at Bellevue before a doctor finally
talked with him at length and let him go.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release, Denning discovered that he had been suspended
from class and banned from campus for violating Policy (NU)4 of the
Housing and Residence Life Handbook, which prohibits ``Violence,
actual or threatened, against another person or oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   It all ended well enough. A university board of inquiry cleared
his name, if somewhat warily, and readmitted him to the school. But
it was quite a way to begin his first year in the big city, after
transferring from the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to New York for a drastic change of pace,'' Denning
said over lunch months later, with an ironic smile. ``I figured I'd
have an amazing amount of interesting experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   NYU officials would not comment on the story, citing federal
privacy laws. But some acknowledged its outlines, and Denning
provided dozens of documents, whose authenticity has been
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins with something as common to campus life as
tension among roommates. Denning shared a two-bedroom suite with
three other students, and didn't get along well with any of them.
He stayed up till the wee hours and slept till noon. He didn't go
out much. He confessed to bouts of depression.
</P>
<P>
   When he left on the road trip to Smith, his roommates discussed
his quirks at great length. One of the them _ according to a
handwritten statement that another wrote for the board of inquiry _
``became increasingly worried about John and kept referring to
Columbine High School and that if someone had checked their e-mail
. . . the killings would never have happened. Talk like this began
to worry (us) more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Denning had told his roommates they could use his computer. So
they turned it on, and hunted around for his e-mail file.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found,'' the statement went on, ``blew our minds. He
talked about killing himself and shooting other people and how sad
and angry he was all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   They printed out the most horrific letters and gave them to the
dorm manager, who took them to the housing director, who passed
them on to campus security, who called the New York Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   One of the roommates (who, out of concern for privacy, asked
that his name not be used), said in a recent interview that they
never figured their action would put Denning in Bellevue _ but
added they have no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``From his point of view, we were blowing things out of
proportion, he was just joking, but we didn't know that,'' he said.
``We didn't know this kid. We'd been living with him for only a
couple of months. From where we stood, we had every right to take
his e-mail at its word.''
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at several Boston-area universities, the
massacre at Columbine High School has heightened sensitivities to
the slightest warning signs of a dangerous person in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   However, when told of the Denning story, they say _ cautiously
and not for-the-record _ that NYU might have overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   One official at Harvard said, ``We generally don't bring in the
Boston Police unless there's criminal activity.'' An official at
Boston University said, ``I think we would have had the dorm's R.A.
talk with him first.'' A Boston physician who has investigated
campus suicides said, ``Breaking into someone's e-mail sounds like
a thin reed on which to build a commitment'' to Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Katz, the author of ``Geeks'' and the forthcoming ``Voices
from the Hell Mouth,'' compares agitation over e-mail to the Salem
Witch Trials. ``Despite the impression of Columbine,'' he said,
``violence among young people has been dropping over the past
decade. It's now at its lowest point since the 1920s.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz added, ``People have the right to express violent
fantasies. They have the right to be depressed. They don't have to
be civil or positive or constructive in their private e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Beckman, NYU's spokesman, has a different view. He
would not comment on Denning's case specifically, but said,
``Generally, if we were confronted with a particular claim of
possession of a firearm, combined with evidence of an intent to do
harm, what choices would we have?
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has a very elaborate support system and
well-trained but unarmed security officers,'' he noted. ``But we
don't consider ourselves expert at dealing with emotionally
disturbed and armed people. In New York City, the group that does
have that expertise is the NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   As for taking action on the basis of stolen e-mail, Beckman
said, ``Again, in general, it is fair to say that information that
comes from intrusion into another person's privacy makes everybody
uncomfortable. But it doesn't change what you learn. You can't
un-know a piece of information that you see as a threat to your
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Denning realizes things must have looked bad at first
glance. ``I can see how some of that e-mail, taken out of context,
might make people worried,'' he said. But, he added, the darkest
letters were written in a 24-hour period, ``when I was having a bad
weekend'' _ and to the same person, a friend back home named
Justin.
</P>
<P>
   When the doctor at Bellevue finally talked with him, Denning
recalled, ``He asked me about the e-mail, and I explained Justin
has a vulgar sense of humor, so that's how I wrote to him. I gave
him Justin's phone number. He called. There was an answering
machine that made a joke out of `Army of Darkness' _ a pulp horror
movie _ and had all kinds of chain-saw noises in the background.
From that, the doctor believed my story and said they'd release me
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon release, Denning and his parents, who flew in from Iowa,
were told by university officials that he had two choices. He could
leave school, get the full year's tuition refunded, and have his
record at NYU expunged as if he had never been there. Or he could
request a hearing to consider whether he should be expelled, which
could taint his record for life.

   Denning chose the hearing. ``I wanted to vindicate myself,'' he
said. In the end, the panel _ a dean, a professor, and a student _
accepted his claim that the letters had been a joke and that he
posed no danger.
</P>
<P>
   However, the panel added, ``Given the nature and content of the
threats, it was reasonable'' for NYU administrators ``to consider
the threats as being legitimate and to take all appropriate
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Denning was let back in school if he promised to stay away from
his old dorm _ he was assigned new roommates in a different hall,
more than a mile away _ and to meet with a counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The old roommates were sent a note through the campus mail,
telling them never to peek at other students' e-mail again.

CAMPUS FAITH GROUPS FACE A REBUKE ON GAY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In flareups forcing colleges to choose between religious freedom
and gay rights, Tufts University and Middlebury College are
embroiled in debates over whether to punish evangelical Christian
student groups that refuse to allow gay students to hold leadership
posts.
</P>
<P>
   An arm of the Tufts student government has already sharply
limited the rights of the Tufts Christian Fellowship, banning the
group from using the school's name, meeting in its classrooms,
spending its student activity fees, or promoting its events through
the university's listing services.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, students, faculty, and administrators are debating
whether to require the Middlebury Christian Fellowship to allow
gays to hold leadership posts, a step the evangelical group says
would force them off campus.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Iowa, evangelical students at Grinnell College are
hoping to regain recognition after they were stripped of their
status as an official student group for insisting that student
leaders agree that sex should be engaged in only by heterosexual
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians are irate at what they describe as an
increasing willingness at private colleges to discriminate against
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Tufts and Middlebury are really saying is that the view
that the Bible takes is an illegitimate view, and you can get
thrown off campus for it,'' said Elliott Abrams, a former assistant
secretary of state for human rights. He is now president of the
Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington. ``That's bigotry.
The message being sent by these schools to evangelicals is, `If
you're really serious about your beliefs, why don't you go to Bob
Jones University and not here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A similar point was made by Harvey A. Silverglate, a Boston
civil rights lawyer who helped establish the Foundation for
Individual Rights in Education, a Philadelphia-based organization
assisting the Tufts evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orthodox Christians and Catholics have a really hard time on
liberal arts campuses today, and the reason for that is that so
many of their views conflict with the prevailing notion that there
should be equality for gays and equality for women,'' Silverglate
said.
</P>
<P>
   But gay rights advocates say college groups should not be able
to use student fees to discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should abide by the non-discrimination policies of the
universities,'' said David Smith, communications director for the
Human Rights Campaign, a Washington-based gay rights group. ``It's
our belief that religion should never be used to justify
discrimination against gay people in public settings.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute at Tufts, located just outside Boston, began when
Julie Catalano, a junior psychology major who had been active in
the Tufts Christian Fellowship since her freshman year, told
leaders of the evangelical group that she wanted to be one of
several student senior leaders next year. But one group leader made
it clear to Catalano that she would be ineligible for a leadership
post because of her belief that homosexual activity is not wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Catalano, a member of the United Church of Christ who hopes to
attend divinity school, said that after praying unsuccessfully to
Jesus to make her heterosexual, and after contemplating suicide,
she decided that her homosexuality could not be changed, nor was it
sinful.
</P>
<P>
   Catalano quit the evangelical group and challenged its right to
use student fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Tufts student government, declaring that the Tufts Christian
Fellowship was violating a university policy barring discrimination
on the basis of sexual orientation, declared the group
``derecognized.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the group is not supposed to use the word Tufts in
its name, can no longer hold its prayer meetings or Bible
discussions in classrooms, cannot use its $6,000 annual stipend
from student government, and cannot publicize its activities
through the listing services available to recognized student
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not challenging their right to hold their beliefs, nor am
I challenging their freedom of association, but I don't think
pulling their recognition or funding violates either of those two
constitutional rights,'' Catalano said. ``They can still hold their
beliefs and hold their meetings, but Tufts has a right to say, `No,
we will not fund you because you're in violation of university
policy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the evangelical students, who are appealing the student
government decision to a student-faculty committee, say they should
not be forced to promote to leadership someone who doesn't share
their religious beliefs. They warn that the decision sets a
dangerous precedent because Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox Jews
all have views on gender and sexual orientation that could be
viewed as discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome members of any sexual orientation to be members of
our group, but don't take a sledgehammer to our religious
principles,'' said Curtis Chang, an affiliate chaplain at Tufts and
the Boston-area director of InterVarsity, an umbrella organization
of college evangelical groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts University officials are distancing themselves from the
dispute, saying it is a student matter. Bruce Reitman, an acting
dean, has been quoted in The Tufts Daily newspaper speaking
supportively of the gay student, but a spokeswoman said his
comments did not necessarily reflect the university
administration's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have filed their appeal, and while the matter is
proceeding through the student judicial system, it is not
appropriate to comment,'' said university spokeswoman Christen
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Tufts Transgender, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
Collective did not return a call or e-mail seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A lecturer at Cornell University Law School, David A. French,
has agreed to represent the evangelical students on a pro bono
basis. French argues that the university is trying to impose a
``Tufts-approved theology'' on campus religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a situation where an individual is asking
a religious group not to consider her religious beliefs when
considering her for leadership,'' French said. ``Religions have a
right to define their own practices or beliefs, as opposed to
having a secular university define them.'''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute at Middlebury has not gone quite as far as at Tufts,
although the group says its funds have already been frozen by the
school. College officials are weighing how to respond to the
evangelical student group's refusal to allow a gay male student to
run for a leadership post, but a school spokesman, Phil Benoit,
said officials are ``leaning toward'' a policy that would require
all student groups, including the evangelical group, to allow gays
to run for leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
   The chaplain at Middlebury, Rev. Laurel M. Jordan, says the
issue at risk is nothing less than diversity on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been fairly loud voices among the students saying
they (the Christian Fellowship) shouldn't be getting student
activity fees, shouldn't meet in college rooms, and we should get
them out of here, and there have been some points at which it has
seemed as though the administration was saying the same things,''
said Jordan, who is a United Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what we're aiming at is respecting and understanding people
who are different, that has got to include evangelical Christians,
who also feel that they're aliens at times on this campus,'' she
said. ``We can't say we want this grand diversity and then say that
everybody has to think the same way.''

&HT;     WARTIME ICON OF WORKING WOMEN HONORED IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER PHOTIKOE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Calif. _ She wore a red polka-dot bandanna, flexed her
biceps and proclaimed, ``We Can Do It!'' She inspired millions of
women to work on the home front during World War II, graced postage
stamps and posed as a cover girl for the Smithsonian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a familiar face for more than 50 years, most
recently appearing in an advertising campaign for Tampax.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Rosie the Riveter, a character immortalized by
posters supporting the war effort and a wartime song by the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   A new monument pays tribute to Rosie _ or rather, to the women
whose work at home was vital to the war effort _ along the
waterfront at Marina Park in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   What started in 1997 as a local project honoring women who
worked in shipyards during World War II has received congressional
attention. There has been one setback, as the monument was to have
been completed on Labor Day 1999 but rising construction costs
postponed the project.
</P>
<P>
   Still, plans are under way to create a national park in
recognition of women workers and the entire U.S. home-front effort.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from a former Richmond city councilwoman, Donna
Powers, whose aunt and mother-in-law had talked with her about
their own work during the war, said project manager Donna Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an important moment in American history that was
relatively overlooked,'' Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   Then several California lawmakers and the National Park Service
got involved, creating the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home
Front National Historic Park in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond shipyards produced 747 ships, said Kathleen Rupley,
curator for the Richmond Museum of History.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came from all different parts of the country'' to work
at the shipyards, Rupley said. ``People who had never built a ship,
who had never worked in industry, all of a sudden learned to work
as a team and build a ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The shipyards at Richmond were collectively known as the Kaiser
shipyards, named after industrialist Henry Kaiser, who pioneered
social programs for workers, Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He addressed how people balance their home lives and
careers,'' Graves said. ``He started things like 24-hour day care
and hot meals at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond was not ready for the population boom, going from
20,000 residents before World War II to 100,000 by war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was ready. The streets weren't ready, the sewers
weren't ready, the schools weren't ready,'' Rupley said. ``And
still people came.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people to migrate to Richmond was Matilda Foster,
then 27 years old. Now in her 80s, she still calls Richmond home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Richmond to help win the war and to make money,''
Foster said. ``They were paying good money. This yard that I worked
at paid $1.05 an hour, eight hours a day, and you get a two-week
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Cortes, 83, was also attracted to the well-paying job as a
ship welder. She liked it so much that she kept her job for 25
years, long after most women had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked everything about welding, but after the war,
there was nothing for ladies to weld,'' Cortes said. ``I stayed on
to do repairs and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from that Richmond shipyard experience, Cortes offers
this advice for staying happy at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the people and I like the work, that's the main thing
at a job,'' Cortes said. ``You like everybody around you, everybody
treat each other the same, and then you're all right. If you're
not, there's no reason to stay there and work.''

LET'S HEAR IT FOR TAKE YOUR SPOUSE TO WORK DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday was Take Your Daughter to Work Day, which has evolved
into Take Your Child to Work Day. I like the idea that my children
can see me at work doing what I do everyday. I think it adds value
to my labor just like a father watching his wife deliver their
child adds value to the birthing process.
</P>
<P>
   However, I have a suggestion. Why don't we have Take Your Spouse
to Work Day?
</P>
<P>
   Now, now, I know you're thinking, ``He/she gets on my nerves
during those five hours we spend together each week night, why on
earth would I want to take him/her to work with me?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't you see that the reason we annoy each other in the
evenings is that most of us have no idea how truly stressful and
complex our spouse's duties are each day?
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine the possibilities. A hard-working woman in
corporate America takes her equally hard-working husband to work
with her one morning. With indulgent smiles, they climb into her
SUV and the drama unfolds:
</P>
<P>
   She says: Don't change the radio station, I like that morning
team.
</P>
<P>
   He says: They talk too much. Let's listen to sports radio.
</P>
<P>
   She bites her tongue and continues applying lipstick in the
rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Him: Keep your eyes on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Her: I do manage to make it to work every morning without
instructions from you.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive at the giant tower that contains layer upon layer of
cubicles enclosed in glass and take the elevator to her floor. She
greets a young man who hands her a cup of coffee and several
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Him: Who's that guy?
</P>
<P>
   Her: That's my new administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Him: That guy who looks like Denzel Washington is your
secretary? You never mentioned him to me.
</P>
<P>
   Her: Yes, I did. That's Gene. Does he look like Denzel? Hmmm, I
hadn't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Him: Look at him, he's typing with two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Her: He probably hurt his hands lifting weights at the gym. He's
a body builder, and I'm pretty sure he can type, too. Anyway, he
makes great coffee.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. they go to a meeting in the boardroom. Two and a half
hours later, the meeting finally ends.
</P>
<P>
   Him: I thought I was going to die in there. That guy went on and
on about nothing, and you guys all sat there like he was reciting
the secret to life.
</P>
<P>
   Her: It's his company, I just work here.
</P>
<P>
   Him: Yeah, but you worked on that presentation all weekend, and
he shot down all of your ideas like they were ducks in the sky. Who
in their right mind would put up with that? Doesn't that make you
angry?
</P>
<P>
   Her (smiling): Yes, as a matter of fact it does, honey. There's
nothing I like better than smiling and being pleasant while someone
essentially calls me a moron.
</P>
<P>
   Back at her office, she grabs her organizer and laptop and they
hit the road. They spend the afternoon meeting with potential
clients. She's standing most of the time, giving PowerPoint
presentations. She smiles a lot and patiently answers the same
questions over and over. She never eats anything. Two of the three
presentations end with the phrase, ``I'll think about it.'' The one
firm commitment leaves her needing three more to reach her quota
before the month ends. That's two days away.
</P>
<P>
   Him: It's 5 o'clock and you haven't eaten a thing. Tell me you
don't do this everyday. All the meetings and rushing from one place
to the next. I'm tired and all I did was watch you.
</P>
<P>
   Her: Actually, it was a typical day for me but I usually manage
to grab a sandwich at some point. Sorry, I didn't even think about
food. If I don't make my quota, I'll have plenty of free time to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   The next year she goes to work with him.
</P>
<P>
   A gorgeous woman smiles as they enter. The woman hands him a
doughnut and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Him: I know. She looks like Cindy Crawford, right?
</P>
<P>
   Her: Actually, she looks just like the woman I saw on America's
Most Wanted. They said she gets in good with her bosses and then
she poisons them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can't you see the value in Take Your Spouse to Work Day?

   The kitchen in my restaurant is so small that conventional
risotto simply isn't practical. All that last-minute work doesn't
make sense when three cooks are standing in a space smaller than a
Ford Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Parcooking the rice, the strategy most restaurants use, wasn't
the answer. Risotto prepared this way still needs at least 10
minutes of attention. In the end, I modified a classic technique
for cooking leftover risotto. Thrifty Italian cooks refrigerate
extra risotto until it becomes a solid mass, which can be shaped
into patties and sauteed in olive oil. These sauteed rice cakes are
usually served as a light meal, perhaps with a little salad.
</P>
<P>
   I started playing with the idea of risotto cakes and realized I
could use them as the starch base on my main course plates. Just
like mashed potatoes or polenta, risotto cakes work with countless
main courses: grilled shrimp, seared scallops, sliced steak,
chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   I pack as much flavor into the risotto as possible by seasoning
the rice with black olives, shallots and Parmesan. These
Mediterranean flavors work year round and match up well with
scallops. I also drizzle a little basil-infused olive oil on
plates. (I make my own, but you can buy basil oil in the
supermarket.)
</P>
<P>
   At other times, I've stirred pureed peas into my risotto cakes.
The flavor is remarkable, and so is the color. This summer, I'll
add caramelized corn kernels, scallions, bacon and maybe even
lobster. As long as the rice firms up when it's chilled, you can
add almost anything you like.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really thinks about the consistency of risotto; it's
always creamy. But cooked in a hot pan, risotto cakes develop a
thick, golden-brown crust that's downright crunchy, with an
exterior as crisp as a lace cookie. The contrast with the creamy
interior is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Two tips: Risotto cakes hold together best if the rice is
overcooked a bit to release as much starch as possible. Because
starchiness is desirable, there's no need to stir. Once the stock
boils, simply throw the cover on the pot and walk away. Exactly 17
minutes later, the rice will be done. And although you can make the
risotto and brown the cakes on the same day, I get better results
when the rice has chilled overnight.

TOFU TAKES TO CURRY AS ONIONS TAKE TO BROWNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One process that can never be rushed is browning onions. Slow
cooking caramelizes their natural sugars, building a complex base
for hundreds of dishes. This browning is especially important for
curries: their flavor comes from the onions almost as much as from
the spice mix, even in a dish with many other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Many curries are made the same way, although the meat or other
protein may differ. After the onions are browned, the spice mix, or
just curry powder, is toasted in the same skillet. A flavorful
liquid is then added. And after that, just about any meat, poultry
or other protein can be cooked in the sauce to give the dish heft.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional Western stews, curries are built on their
sauces. The protein is almost interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   And so, while chicken, shrimp and pork are some of the usual
choices for curry, I had another idea. Over the years, almost
despite myself, I have become increasingly fond of tofu. The flavor
is so subtle as to be almost nonexistent, especially in a
full-flavored dish like this one. But the texture is incomparable:
silken and creamy. Tofu also needs no real cooking, which makes it
even more appealing for a fast curry.
</P>
<P>
   Tofu is light, so I wanted to make the sauce as substantial as
possible. I used canned coconut milk with my caramelized onions.
Like heavy cream, coconut milk will thicken a sauce, making it
luxurious in almost no time. Then, to add contrasting texture, I
decided to use nuts as well. Both walnuts and cashews do splendidly
here.
</P>
<P>
   Because tofu really needs only to be heated through, all the
time and work in this dish are in the making of the sauce, starting
with those onions. (If you decide to use chicken, shrimp or pork
instead, cut half-inch cubes and cook them in the sauce for about
five minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is the onions: they really must be browned
carefully and thoroughly, without burning. The trick is to use oil
(not butter) and have the heat high enough that the onions brown in
about 10 minutes, and no more than 15. I use medium-high heat, but
all stoves are different, so you may have to adjust yours. The oil
should be bubbling but not smoking, and you must stir the onions
every minute or so. After three or four minutes, they should begin
to brown; they are done when their edges are quite dark and their
interiors somewhat darkened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CURRIED TOFU WITH SOY SAUCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 30 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peanut, canola or grape seed oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon curry powder, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup roughly chopped walnuts or unsalted cashews
</P>
<P>
   1 can (12 to 14 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1 block (about 1 pound) tofu, cut into roughly }-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt and cayenne pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Put oil in a 10- or 12-inch nonstick skillet and turn heat to
medium-high. A minute later, add onion and cook, stirring
occasionally, until edges of onion pieces are well-browned, about
10 minutes (for best flavor, onions must brown but not burn). Add
curry powder and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or so; add nuts and
cook, stirring occasionally, for about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add coconut milk. Stir, bring to a boil and reduce heat to
medium. Add tofu, stir and let tofu heat through for about 3
minutes. Stir in soy, then taste and adjust seasoning with soy,
salt and/or cayenne as necessary. Serve over white rice.
</P>

   Yield: 4 servings.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In her black Gap leather jacket, black Prada skirt,
beige Prada sandals, fashionably bare legs and surprisingly bare
toenails, Elaina Richardson, in her next life as the president of
the country's most famous arts colony, still looks the part of her
old life.
</P>
<P>
   She is a fashion editor in chief, the kind who makes being a
slave to style (bare legs all winter!) look like a fun option. She
looks as if she has never had a bad hair day, looks as if she
discovered her cascade of ethnic jewelry (she favors ``glorious
fakes'') somewhere exotic, say, Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, her jewels were a shopping find in Turkey, but looks, as
they say, can be deceiving. Better to scotch the temptation to
stereotype this self-possessed Glasgow export who has hovered atop
Elle magazine's masthead for four years as just another smug
fashion plate in a city brimming with well-dressed platters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been just as happy if it had been Scientific
American _ it didn't have to be fashion,'' she recalls of her segue
into American publishing, made 12 years ago when she landed her
first editorial spot (at In Woman, now defunct) as a matter of
fiscal survival.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is not certain whether to attribute it to millennial
wanderlust or fear of typecasting _ the Oxford-educated Richardson
never planned to turn into a trend-setter/spotter at an industry
glossy _ but in a career about-face that seems heretical in a
for-profit dot-com decade, she has resigned her top spot at Elle to
do a highbrow disappearing act. She is going upstate (no more bare
legs in winter) to run the iconic Yaddo, a nonprofit artists colony
founded in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as I wandered my way into publishing, that was never
about money, either,'' says Richardson, a printer's daughter who
grew up in a council flat in Glasgow and snagged her first
journalism job at The Evening Standard there when she was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me that being a writer was a way to make
money. It felt like a way to have a kind of life that I was curious
about, and this felt like the same thing,'' she said. ``I don't
have those fears about money that some women talk about, their
bag-lady fears, that they'll end up with nothing. Because I grew up
in sort of a striving but working-class environment, I've always
thought that, well, you work, that's what you do. I've worked since
I was 13.''
</P>
<P>
   She suspects this new job ``will change the quality'' of her
life, and took it for the same reason she veered away after college
at Edinburgh and Oxford from what she feared might become a static
life of letters in academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to feel as if I'm on autopilot,'' she said. ``In
terms of what I wanted to achieve at Elle, I felt I'd done it. I
thought that no woman now would only talk about her appearance, I
mean, only an idiotic woman. Magazines that cover the fashion part
of your life, if they don't also get into culture and current
events, it's like sitting next to a dinner partner who's a dud.''
</P>
<P>
   With Elle safely delivered from dud-dom, what now? ``I was
definitely thinking, `Is there a next chapter?''' Richardson
admits.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, in a jolting genre jump, she handed in her
fashionista badge (and that prime perk, a generous clothing
allowance) to assume the reins of Yaddo, the retreat that sprawls
across 400 acres of Gothic glory in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. From now
on, instead of free Prada, Richardson will have to content herself
with free poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off does not seem to scare her: a scholar who
specialized in 18th-century dissident writers and poets, she has
been known to write a poem or two. Not that she is at Yaddo to
reawaken the artist slumbering within: ``The search committee was
very careful, and I was very careful, not to romanticize this move:
you absolutely do have a connection to the artists, but the job is
administrative. I think I would define it as taking care of all the
details, everything from if the roof's solid to if the endowment's
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38 she is the youngest and, with a resume jammed with
short-lived jobs at pop culture publications, perhaps most
surprising applicant to win the Yaddo presidency, traditionally a
post for tweedy arts aficionados plucked from the ivory tower, not
the 44th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper. Richardson is also the
first president to bring a child to Yaddo: she and her husband,
Kevin, a political writer working on a memoir of his Louisiana
boyhood, and their 9-year-old daughter, Caitlin, will move into the
president's residence, a secluded colonial called Southwoods, in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, whose entourage includes a black Labrador retriever
and a pony, warned Yaddo's executive board that her child is not
the type to tiptoe around the hallowed grounds where Edgar Allan
Poe (he frequented an on-site tavern some 50 years before the Trask
family created the arts colony), and later John Cheever, James
Baldwin, Aaron Copland and countless others craved and found
artistic isolation. She recalls her family's first visit, when a
subtle ``Beware of the Bats'' sign elicited yips of delight from
her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yaddo search committee was smitten by Richardson's
``intelligent, lively seriousness and real love of the arts'' said
Linda Collins, the committee chairwoman. And they do not hold her
fashion savvy against her. After all, Yaddo's president will be
spending 10 days each month in Manhattan, attending cocktail
parties, openings and fund-raising events. Nice to know she already
dresses the part.

<P>
   Q: Who is the teen-age girl who sings on Ford commercials? I
think she's from Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   _ D.W., Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   A: Welsh soprano Charlotte Church sings on the Ford ``Global
Anthem'' commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old singer recorded ``Just Wave Hello'' specifically
for the commercial, and it is included on her 1999 album,
``Charlotte Church.''
</P>
<P>
   After singing ``Pie Jesu'' on a television show at age 11,
Church was signed by Sony Music UK. Her debut album, ``Voice of an
Angel,'' sold more than 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom and
was a top-30 album in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Church has an official fan club at Box 153, Stanmore, Middlesex
HA7 2HF, England, and a Web site at www.charlottechurch.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who plays Judge Zoey Hiller on ABC's ``The Practice''?
</P>
<P>
   _ P.B., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The judge is played by Linda Hunt, 55, who received a Viewers
for Quality Television award nomination in 1998 for the role.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt is best known for winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar
playing Billy Kwan, a male character in 1982's ``The Year of Living
Dangerously.'' She's the only performer to win an Academy Award by
playing a character of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, who grew up in Westport, Conn., works most often as
a narrator or voice artist. She portrays Grandmother Willow in the
Disney films ``Pocahantas'' and ``Pocahantas II'' and narrated the
documentary ``Paul Monette: The Brink of Summer's End'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Write to Hunt in care of William Morris Agency, 151 El Camino
Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Charlton Heston?
</P>
<P>
   _ N.P.H., Bedford, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Send your letter to him in care of International Creative
Management, 8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, 75, was elected president of the National Rifle
Association in 1998 and speaks frequently about gun-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Though he continues to act, appearing in the movies ``Any Given
Sunday'' and ``Gideon'' in 1999, Heston makes news most often
because of his NRA affiliation. ``That's what happens when you
exchange a set of stone tablets for a shotgun,'' he told an
audience in March.

YOU CAN FIND SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR EATING PLACES INSIDE
CHURCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the church bulletin calls for a ``covered-dish'' or
``potluck'' supper, the food is going to be good. The stakes are
too high to take anything but the most proven and popular family
dish to a church function.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't be surprising to find a couple of the state's
most popular eating sites inside the stained-glass windows of local
sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and easily the best known, is the Church of the Holy
Barbecue in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's a little irreverent. The church is the New Zion
Missionary Baptist Church in Huntsville. Annie Mae Ward, a
parishioner there, started cooking barbecue almost 20 years ago
when her late husband painted the church buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ward cooked over an outdoor pit and people just started stopping
by and asking to purchase the delicious ribs and brisket. The
health department asked her to move out from under a tree and
indoors, and church members helped her move into a home adjacent to
the sanctuary. She, and the restaurant, have gained statewide
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   New Zion gets a percentage of the profit. Ward and her crew of
six get the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a second church-cafe making a reputation for
itself. Mirinda Jacko and the Christian Faith Soul Food Kitchen in
Port Arthur are the new names being scribbled on bulletins and
tithe envelopes statewide. Newspapers in Port Arthur and Houston
have featured Jacko. Members of the Christian Faith Church are
spreading the word.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-seat soul food cafe started about six months ago. Sister
Jacko, as she is known to her congregation, was forced to retire at
49 when she had a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Out of work for the first time in her life, she found that doing
nothing was something she was not good at. Her health improved and
she became antsy. She turned to her pastor for help.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor J. Barrington Minix decided that opening the cafe would
not only give Sister Jacko something to do with her time, but it
would also provide a new source of badly needed income to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Jacko bought an entire commercial kitchen _ pots and pans, stove
and all _ from a closed smokehouse restaurant and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   The daily specials vary, but generally they include ribs,
meatloaf and the almost always present stuffed bell peppers. Side
orders include black-eyed peas, red beans, pinto beans, cole slaw
and macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Two items that appear daily _ pig's feet and oxtail soup.
</P>
<P>
   The two dishes are Southern staples, she said. You might not
find them in every restaurant, but, in every Southern town, pig's
feet and oxtail soup are being made in someone's home.
</P>
<P>
   Jacko explained the dishes in one of her newspaper articles. She
said she starts out with a roux, similar to one used to make gumbo,
and boils the oxtails for a long time to make them tender. Pig's
feet start out with a roux, too, ``but it's a lighter roux, and I
put vinegar in it. Those people, they just like to suck on those
pig's feet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacko said she learned much of her cooking skills at the side of
her grandmother and a great-aunt who lived in Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   Religion aside, the Christian Faith Church hasn't reached the
level of New Zion Missionary Baptist. The Christian Faith Soul Food
Kitchen hasn't been extremely profitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacko isn't worried. With a portable tape player ringing
gospel music in the background, she said the restaurant is God's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wanting to do this all my life,'' she said. ``I've
been wanting to open a kitchen, a small restaurant. I never thought
of doing it in a church, but that's were the Lord led me.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Live girls! Live girls! Live girls are back at Show
World!
</P>
<P>
   The barker got right to the point, and, as he tells it, he made
sure that his siren song was heard through the red and black,
low-ceilinged rooms of the Times Square sex emporium.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran employees stuck their heads in the Go-Go Bar, grinning
hopefully. Curious video booth customers left ``A Week in the Life
of Kristi Myst'' and ``The Best of Raylene'' to investigate. Live
girls. Live girls? Live girls!
</P>
<P>
   But then, in the interest of full disclosure, someone would have
to explain: these girls were members of a theater company. They
were going to perform Shakespeare. With their clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where enforced morality and rents are both on the
rise, it amounts to a meeting of endangered minds: sex
entertainment and fringe theater.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to dodge the city's efforts to rid Times Square of
sex entertainment establishments, Show World Center, which
burlesque historians say was once a widely imitated model for the
industry, has undergone a gradual but thorough transformation,
giving over a vast tract of mirror-tiled, runway-lighted acreage to
theater productions that are Off Off, but not so far from,
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   While Show World, which opened on Eighth Avenue in 1975, still
has banks of video peep show booths and an adults-only sex shop
that is as brightly lighted as a surgery room, more than 80 percent
of the floor space in the multilevel complex has been de-porned.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Big Top Lounge, which once housed carousel horses
ridden by topless dancers, two downtown theater companies are
running an ``Urban Fairytale Festival'' of short plays. In the
Go-Go Bar, on a stage still graced by a golden pole, one can now
see Chekhov's ``Vaudevilles.''
</P>
<P>
   Show World first dipped a toe into the theater business as a
landlord. In 1997, it leased the former Triple Treat Theater to
three actors who started Pantheon Productions.
</P>
<P>
   But Show World's current theatrical enterprise has its roots in
zoning regulations for sex shops and strip clubs that took effect
in 1998. The regulations, which would have forced Show World to
close, apply to any business that devotes more than 40 percent of
its space to sexual entertainment or merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   To comply, Show World got rid of its live topless dancers and
peep show ``booth babies'' and began looking for alternative uses
for its space. Soon, independent filmmakers were showing short
films every weekend, and an Off Off Broadway theater company,
Collapsible Giraffe, was presenting a play called ``Three
Virgins.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Aaron Beall, the artistic director of Todo Con
Nada, a Lower East Side theater company and presenting
organization, came looking for a venue for a theater festival. Show
World asked him to become artistic director of a joint venture now
called Nada Show World. The theater companies do not pay rent, but
Show World shares in proceeds from ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   He could do anything he wanted, Beall said he was told by Show
World's management. Only, please: no nudity. The risk for a
business still fighting in court to stay open was too great. That
meant that what Beall might be able to pull off downtown would not
fly here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show World,'' Beall said, ``is our chaste space.''
</P>
<P>
   For Beall, the promise of an affordable space was enough to lure
him almost anywhere. In its two other spaces on Ludlow Street, Todo
Con Nada, like many performing troupes, struggles to pay rent. But,
Show World was more than a cheap option of last resort. There was
also the sleaze factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great environment for the creation of art,'' Beall
said. Instead of trying to steer clear of pornographic taint, the
companies that perform at Nada Show World revel in the atmosphere
of the demimonde, using it as a draw for curious audience members.
</P>
<P>
   It has even been an artistic inspiration: the schedule has
included ``God of Vengeance,'' a play about a Jewish brothel whose
owner tries to keep his daughter pure; ``Perviverse,'' a
``sweet-tempered comedy,'' according to Beall, about the London
fetish subculture; and perhaps most significant, ``The Show World
Reunion Show,'' a takeoff on Shakespeare's ``Measure for Measure''
performed as if by Show World's disc jockeys, dancers and customers
of yore.
</P>
<P>
   The show was performed in a workshop in mid-March, and will
reopen for a full run this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Its creators, Diane Paulus and Randy Weiner of Project 400, a
theater company best known for its disco-era spin on ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' saw ``The Show World Reunion Show'' as a chance to
expand their audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, God, if we can just get the people that want to
see live girls, and then get the Shakespeare buffs, we can have a
huge sampling of the market for popular entertainment,'' Weiner
said. So Weiner, who played the barker, said he gave it all he had
when he shouted, ``Live Girls!''
</P>
<P>
   But more important than the chance to draw in new patrons, the
company saw itself in league with Show World against what both
artists and sex-industry leaders often complain is the
Disneyfication of New York. Project 400 had long been considering a
production of ``Measure for Measure,'' whose plot involves an
attempt to rid Vienna of its prostitutes and immoral citizens.
</P>
<P>
   When the co-directors heard that Show World was housing plays,
they thought the location would be a perfect way to draw a parallel
between Shakespeare's plot and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's cleanup of
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales for Nada Show World's three performance spaces
vary, but ``The Show World Reunion Show,'' at $12 a ticket, brought
in about 75 people each night, Paulus said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday, billed as ``An Evening of Short and Nasty
Theater,'' Viveca Gruen, a market researcher, was among the crowd
of about 20. ``It was a little scary coming in,'' she said.
``Someone hit on me. But once I found it, it was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulus sees a fine line between theater and sex entertainment.
``The question became, when do we acknowledge these things as part
of our human nature, and when do we say this is immoral and should
be shut down?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the show, the actors performed lap dances (without
nudity, Paulus said) and accepted tips. A ``flyer guy,'' modeled
after the ones who solicit customers for sex shops, passed out
leaflets advertising ``live girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was conceived with one particular audience member in
mind.``Our fantasy would be that Giuliani would show up,'' Paulus
said. ``He couldn't shut it down, because it would be this
Shakespeare play.''
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, Show World's lawyer, said he liked the
idea of Show World's being used as a platform to criticize the
mayor. ``You have a great deal of freedom criticizing the
administration,'' Fahringer said. ``The greatness of this city has
been due to a high level of tolerance for all forms of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do anything, you can see anything, and that gives
people a high sense of self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   To those familiar with the sex industry, the irony is not so
much that Show World is showcasing theater, it is that Show World,
known for its broad appeal and once called ``the McDonald's of the
sex industry'' by William Daly, the director of the mayor's Office
of Midtown Enforcement, has chosen alternative theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more like a Broadway house, in a way,'' said
Rachel Shteir, a theater historian whose book on the history of
striptease is forthcoming from Oxford University Press. ``It was
trying to mass produce sex shows.''

NAZI IMAGES: EVEN THE MAYOR CAN'T RESIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Say what you will about the Nazis _ and no doubt a
lot will be said Tuesday, a day set aside by Jews to recall the
Holocaust _ they managed to perform one useful service. They
provided some of the most enduring metaphors for evil we are ever
likely to see.
</P>
<P>
   You can try calling someone you hate a Bolshevik, but the word
doesn't pack quite the wallop that it used to. Labeling your enemy
a fascist carries a punch, but you probably ought to check his
ethnicity first to stay out of trouble. Remember Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato's lachrymal performance eight years ago, when he turned
``fascist'' into an anti-Italian slur? (By the same token, you may
want to avoid shouting ``quisling'' at a Norwegian.)
</P>
<P>
   Uber alles _ sorry, over all _ invoking Hitler and his crew is
hard to beat for getting really nasty about an opponent. Maybe
that's why so many people seem unable to resist the temptation,
including politicians who claim to know better and find Nazi
imagery to be deplorable when it is aimed at them. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor went to town last week with the phrase ``storm
troopers.'' That is what he repeatedly called the federal agents
who had grabbed Elian Gonzalez in Miami and returned him to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   When objections were raised _ by the Federal Law Enforcement
Officers Association, the Anti-Defamation League and members of the
New York congressional delegation, among others _ Giuliani stood
his ground.
</P>
<P>
   It may be useful to note that the real storm troopers _
Sturmabteilung, in German _ were the muscle behind Hitler's ``beer
hall putsch'' of 1923 and his rise to power 10 years later. Details
can be found in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, compiled by Yad
Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Sturmabteilung members, the encyclopedia says, ``were drafted
into the auxiliary police, and as such they arrested, tortured and
terrorized political, ideological and personal enemies in abandoned
barracks or factory yards that became known as concentration
camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound to you like an apt description of the men and
women who reunited a little Cuban boy and his papa?
</P>
<P>
   As protests over his remarks continued, Giuliani allowed that he
did not mean to attack the agents themselves, but rather President
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno. That, by extension, would
seem to make Clinton and Reno equivalent to Hitler and Hermann
Goering. True, the president once had a cabinet secretary named
Reich. But does that put him in the Nazis' class?
</P>
<P>
   An interesting twist to this political spat is that it is
usually the mayor who ends up on the receiving end of over-the-top
Nazi imagery. Understandably, he has not liked it one bit.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have carried placards caricaturing him with a
Hitlerian mustache. His emergency crisis center downtown has been
derided as his bunker. Comparisons between him and the Third Reich
are amply suggested in an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of
American Art.
</P>
<P>
   A show like the Whitney's, Giuliani complained, cheapens the
Holocaust and its meaning. Last year, when he was likened to Hitler
during protests over the police killing of Amadou Diallo, he had
this to say: ``Invocations of Adolf Hitler are despicable no matter
who it is. Nobody should participate in it, and nobody should do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the appeal of this imagery remains strong, going well beyond
the mayor and his critics.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Mike Jarvis, the basketball coach at St. John's
University, recently compared the National Collegiate Athletic
Association to the Gestapo. Ted Turner has likened Rupert Murdoch
to ``the late Fuehrer.'' You no doubt remember Jerry Seinfeld's
Soup Nazi, as though the problem with the Nazis was that they could
be grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, this imagery can be inadvertent, as it was in 1998
when Commissioner Jason Turner of the city's Human Resources
Administration defended his welfare-to-work program by saying,
``Work makes you free.'' It seems to have eluded Turner that those
very words _ ``Arbeit macht frei,'' in German _ appeared on the
gates of Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Nazi imagery can be as dopey as it is offensive. We
have in mind a West Side woman who was so enraged by a Parks
Department crackdown on lawbreaking dog owners that she said with
trembling hands, ``I'm beginning to understand how Jews felt in
Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we need some new adult education courses, to explain the
world of difference between a pooch and a putsch.

THE BEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Poundcake is like brownies: a baker's challenge that
sounds like child's play. The name itself is traditionally half the
recipe _ a pound each of butter, eggs, sugar and flour _ but the
technique is critical to producing a cake that is so tender it can
stand alone but still sturdy enough to hold up under a fruit
compote, ice cream or sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs around New York all have their own secrets to perfecting
poundcake, which is turning up on menus with all manner of fruit.
Because traditional poundcakes have no leavening like baking powder
or baking soda, their lightness comes from beating air into the
batter. Classic recipes call for beating together butter and sugar
until they are fluffy, but the trick is not to overbeat, which
heats the butter and makes the cake greasy.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Haimowitz at Morrell's Wine Bar and Cafe uses half
shortening, which makes the batter easier to whip so that it
reaches a perfect consistency before the butter has a chance to
break down. It also creates a lighter poundcake as moist as chiffon
cake, which is made with oil. It works well as a base for a compote
of dried mixed fruit, like apricots, figs, cherries, cranberries
and currants, marinated in muscat.
</P>
<P>
   Using less butter, though, means less buttery flavor. Steven
Picker, the chef at Good in Greenwich Village, uses all butter in
his coconut poundcake (served with caramel ice cream and
caramelized bananas) but takes extra care with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After making hundreds of poundcakes, I guess I discovered what
everyone ends up discovering,'' he said. ``The two most important
things seem to be the temperature of the ingredients, which should
be at room temperature, and the amount of time you beat the butter
and sugar.'' If the butter is at the right temperature, it usually
takes three to four minutes of beating with the sugar in an
electric mixer to get it airy and creamy enough to leaven the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Murphy, pastry chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, uses another
technique, similar to the preparation of a genoise, for the almond
poundcake he serves with strawberry-rhubarb compote, roasted
strawberries and sour cream ice cream. He melts the butter first,
beats eggs and sugar together until they are very thick, then
whisks in cake flour, almond flour and the butter. Although the
proportions are the same as for any other poundcake, the result is
almost spongy, with a fine crumb.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's variation might be too weightless for poundcake
enthusiasts who like the traditional chewiness. They might prefer
Sarabeth Levine's cakes at Sarabeth's in the Chelsea Market, in
chocolate, lemon, poppy seed and other flavors. ``A good poundcake
can be dense and light at the same time,'' she said. And so for
many of her cakes she uses a high-fat cultured dairy product, like
sour cream or cream cheese, which adds even more butterfat to the
recipe. More butter, she explained, ``would just make it feel
greasy.'' She also prefers superfine sugar, which dissolves faster
than granulated sugar and adds to the moistness of the cake.
</P>
<P>
   As light as they are, the results bear out her warning: ``You
never want to use the word fluffy with a poundcake.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Vermont affirms gay family values
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Wednesday's Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not hard to imagine why a same-sex couple from,
say, Georgia might take the trouble to travel to Vermont to
register their relationship as a civil union. Even though that bond
has legal standing only within the confines of the Green Mountain
State, it has powerful symbolic significance beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than just a formal commitment between two
individuals. Vermont's innovative statute, signed into law last
month by Gov. Howard Dean, will create pioneers in a legal and
societal sense _ the first homosexual Americans to be joined in a
state-sanctioned union crafted especially for them, with its
attendant responsibilities and rights.
</P>
<P>
   Set to go into effect on July 1, Vermont's civil union law
provides a good model for legislators in other states to follow.
The Vermont law recognizes that committed life-partners of the same
sex ought to be able to _ as married couples do _ get joint health
coverage, make medical decisions for each other when one is
incapacitated, be treated as the next of kin in crisis situations,
inherit property without complicated legal preparations, etc. This
isn't ``special'' treatment; it's simply fair.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans will say they disapprove of Vermont's unique
statute on moral grounds, but they ought to ask themselves this:
</P>
<P>
   Is making life and the law difficult for homosexuals the decent
thing to do or, for that matter, an effective way to keep their
numbers at a minimum?
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if Americans truly embrace family values, what is

   On the surface, the acrimonious stalemate between Walt Disney
Co. and Time-Warner Inc. _ which deprived 3.5 million homes of
Regis Philbin's smiling face Monday night _ involves only the
narrow question of how much Time-Warner must pay Disney for the
right to carry its cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger battle is also taking place, one with possible
implications for the proposed megamerger of Time-Warner and AOL and
for the digital, broadband future that television is moving toward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one behemoth clashing with another for positioning,''
said Joseph Turow, a professor of communications at the Annenberg
School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. ``It's
a tango of sorts, positioning themselves for the new media
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tango'' involves two huge corporations that may be viewed
with little sympathy by the public, especially now that Time-Warner
has upped the ante by blacking out programs from Disney-owned ABC,
including Philbin's blockbuster ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire''
on cable systems in such major markets as New York City, Los
Angeles, Houston, and Raleigh-Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Iran-Iraq war: You root for them both to lose,''
said Tobe Berkovitz, a communications professor at Boston
University. Added Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co. in New York: ``Remember John Belushi in `Animal
House' yelling `Food fight!'? This is sort of the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a deeper issue percolating beneath the arguments
over how much Time-Warner should pay Disney for such channels as
Toon Disney and a soap-opera channel, and whether the Disney
Channel should be part of the basic cable package on
Time-Warner-owned systems, rather than a premium service for which
customers pay extra.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC spokeswoman, Julie Hoover, brands it an ``abuse of
power'' for Time-Warner to black out ABC programs in the middle of
a crucial ``sweeps'' month. Then she cut to the heart of the
matter: ``If this is the way Time-Warner behaves when they are a
gatekeeper of cable systems, how will they behave when they are a
gatekeeper not only of cable systems but of the Internet? People
won't even know they are losing access to alternative services;
they will be cut off at the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kane, president of WABC-TV in New York, wasted no time in
labeling the pulling of the ABC signal from Time-Warner in New York
a ``frightening foreshadowing of the implications of the
Time-Warner/AOL merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Time-Warner, for its part, says this is no more than a dispute
between two large corporations. ``They've been trying to wrap this
around the AOL merger from the beginning,'' a Time-Warner official
said. ``We felt we had a deal, and suddenly the ground rules
changed from the Disney perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, both sides have invoked the Federal Communications
Commission to bolster their positions. Time-Warner insists that
under FCC rules, it is not allowed to continue to carry a network's
signal without a transmission agreement in place. (The deal with
Disney has expired.) Disney, however, contends that FCC regulations
do not allow a cable operator to stop airing a broadcast station
during a sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculate that Disney may be playing hardball in an
effort to slow the AOL-Time Warner merger by persuading federal
regulators to look at the competitive and consumer issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be hoping someone will come in and set some rules
on how much you can own,'' said Dan Amundson, research director at
the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``Even if they don't stop
the Time-Warner/AOL merger, maybe they can tie them up for a while
by persuading the Justice Department that there's too much
concentration of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Turow added: ``Disney does not own cable systems, and that can
potentially put Disney and other companies, like News Corp., in a
difficult position when negotiating with cable firms. . . .
Time-Warner clearly has control over the exhibition arena into
people's homes. Disney wants to get its (product) into those homes,
and in order to do that, it has to have leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   That leverage may be the fact that federal regulators are
looking closely at everything Time-Warner does, especially actions
that might be seen as anticompetitive. ``Disney may be thinking
`AOL is under scrutiny in Washington, so maybe the atmosphere is
better for us,' '' Wolzien said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Disney and Time-Warner met Monday with staff
members of the Federal Communications Commission, but at day's end,
the stalemate had not been resolved.

 YOUNG LAWYERS' STOCK RISES WITH INTERNET  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Kendall was 28 and just a few years out of law
school in 1997 when his firm, Boston's Goodwin Procter &AMP; Hoar,
asked him to work with a Harvard business student, Stig Leschley,
who needed help making his e-commerce idea a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall soon became the firm's main contact for the young
entrepreneur, who grew his start-up into Exchange.com, an Internet
retail site that fetched $200 million when Amazon.com bought it
last year. The young lawyer not only offered Leschley legal advice,
he talked him through setbacks and celebrated his successes with
him. They went to parties together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary thing when you think about it,'' Kendall
says now. ``It was me, a fourth-year associate, who developed that
relationship, not an established partner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old economy, the chances of junior lawyers like Kendall
having such close contact with a client were virtually nonexistent.
An associate's lot in life was to do legal research and support
senior lawyers in the hope, after seven or eight years, of becoming
a partner in a firm. But in the new economy, where 20-somethings
often head dot.com companies, law firms now see young lawyers like
Kendall as a crucial resource in attracting legal work from the
Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these companies are being run by young people, and
when they go looking for a lawyer, they want somebody with the same
energy level, the same excitement for what they're doing and
similar comfort with computers and the Internet,'' says William
Lee, managing partner at Hale and Dorr in Boston. ``It's usually
not older lawyers they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, many associates are being liberated from the staid
confines of law libraries to take on business-getting roles, in a
reversal of the traditional law-firm hierarchy in which a select
group of partners serve as rainmakers. To win their services, firms
are offering huge salaries, fast-track career paths and perks that
range from Palm Pilots to stock options in the high-tech start-ups
the young lawyers represent.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, even after an associate completed the grueling
apprenticeship to become a partner, it could take years to develop
a client roster. But more than ever before, law firms are running
on Internet time, relying on some on their youngest lawyers to woo
high-tech companies, the fastest growing sector of corporate legal
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who are six, seven, eight months out of law
school out there networking and bringing in business from emerging
companies,'' says Charles Dougherty, a senior partner at Boston's
Hill &AMP; Barlow, which is offering associates large bonuses and the
possibility of making partner in five years for wooing companies
into its ``incubator'' program for startups.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty said that the firm's associates ``are members of every
entrepreneurial group and technology-related council that exists,''
and that many have classmates who are involved in start-ups. ``We
are encouraging an entrepreneurial approach for the associates, and
it is enormously successful,'' Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Most firms where associates are taking a larger role in wooing
clients still keep a seasoned partner on those accounts to handle
tough legal issues and to help manage the work. But firms have
found that emerging high-tech companies need hand-holding as much
or more than they need experienced lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want people they know will care about what they're
doing,'' Dougherty says. ``They see these young lawyers as
co-entrepreneurs who are working with them and are there for them.
A lot of these guys are learning how to run a business as they go,
and they need people to brainstorm with and toss around ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason young lawyers have been put in charge of those
accounts is, simply, that they are often about the same age and
connect more readily with fledgling entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with all things in the lottery-like universe of the
Internet, it's the lure of sudden riches that's driving such
geologic shifts in law firm protocol. Firms want to inexpensively
establish as many relationships with infant Internet start-ups as
possible _ betting that a few will turn into giants with steady
needs for legal services and healthy budgets to spend on them.
Armies of associates can forge more of those relationships at a
lower cost than senior partners whose time is worth more money,
firms say.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an attempt to hang on to young lawyers, who recently
have fled big firms in droves to become in-house lawyers for
Internet companies _ a gamble for more exciting careers while
possibly hitting it big with portfolios of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big dream for lawyers right now,'' says Brian
Lenihan, a seventh-year associate at Hill &AMP; Barlow who has built
his own client list of some 50 high-tech and venture capital
companies under the firm's ``incubator'' program. ``Everyone talks
about that as their end-game: Go to work for a dot-com and get the
options. Everybody's thinking about the brass ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to counter the siren song of the Internet, some
Boston firms have upped starting salaries for first-year associates
to as much as $155,000, up from last year's standard of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Hill &AMP; Barlow, have launched incentive programs
that give associates bonuses of up to half their salaries for
bringing in new clients and racking up billable hours. To further
sweeten the pot, the firm has begun taking ownership interests in
start-up clients and offering a stake in the companies to
associates. In addition to money, Hill &AMP; Barlow lets the most
successful associates trim two years off the standard track to
being a partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to realize they don't have to climb some long
ladder in order to do interesting work and get somewhere in the
firm,'' Dougherty says.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it's too early to tell whether the strategy
will work for law firms or even whether it will last. With the
unnerving tumble of the Nasdaq Composite stock index in recent
weeks and the resulting shakeout of marginal Internet companies,
some now wonder whether the dot-com gold rush will soon cease,
ending law associates' moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   But most believe that whether or not the frenzied pace of the
past two years continues, the old order has been abolished by the
Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a momentum there that's not going to be thwarted,''
Dougherty says. ``The world has changed, and this is definitely the
model of the decade that law firms will have to follow.''

RUSSIA'S REFORMS SLOW FLOW OF US ADOPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All over the country, people like Alison Doane are growing more
nervous by the day. Some have waited weeks, others months for the
Russian child whose picture they gaze at incessantly, and who they
have been promised will soon become their own. Now, suddenly,
adoption agencies are telling them that they can't be sure when
they'll get their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that we, as a group, are scared,'' Doane, a
musician from Malden, Mass., says. ``We're optimistic the adoptions
will eventually go through ... but the uncertainty makes people
agitated, and the ones in line the longest are up in arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety among prospective parents -- and among adoption
practitioners throughout the United States -- stems from a series
of new laws in Russia that promise to radically alter adoption
practices within that country and, as a result, possibly change the
face of international adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Russia's actions is potentially huge because it
provides more children for adoption abroad than any other country,
and the vast majority of those adoptees go to the United States.
Significantly, at a time when most children adopted abroad by white
Americans are of a different race, Russia also is the largest
foreign source of Caucasian children.
</P>
<P>
   Russian's new laws were signed last week as decrees by
President-elect Vladimir Putin, but they were barely reported by
the world's media. The statutes appear designed, in part, to show
the incoming leader's nationalistic stripes, but they are
principally intended to halt bribery, child-selling, and other
illegal activities allegedly occurring during the course of placing
Russian orphans in US adoptive homes.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, bribes of thousands of dollars are regularly
doled out to judges, orphanage officials and, most frequently and
generously, to bilingual intermediaries who guide would-be parents
through often-confusing bureaucratic and judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the intermediaries are Russian nationals who work
simultaneously for several agencies, attorneys, and adoption
facilitators in the United States -- making the operatives'
loyalties suspect and their operations difficult to monitor. And
some officials in Washington and Moscow believe members of the
Russian Mafia are involved in adoption procedures there.
</P>
<P>
   Putin aims to clean up the process by imposing numerous reforms,
effective immediately. The most important are banning
intermediaries; allowing only nonprofit, accredited adoption
agencies with a minimum of five years' experience to function;
ordering each agency to open its own office with separate, salaried
employees; and mandating that all involved report on their
activities and pay taxes on income received.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, all of the estimated 160 to 180 US agencies
conducting business in Russia employ intermediaries, and none are
accredited because it has never been a requirement before. So none
can initiate new adoptions until specific operating guidelines are
established, primarily by the Ministry of Education but with input
from five additional government departments as well.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptions already in the pipeline are being allowed to proceed,
but at the discretion of individual judges in local jurisdictions
around Russia. It also is legal for prospective parents to navigate
that nation's legal and governmental adoption bureaucracies without
the assistance of an agency or intermediary, although generally
with the help of a Russian lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell applicants to stand by, because it's not possible to
know how long all of this will take to resolve,'' said Filis Casey,
executive director of the Alliance for Children in Wellesley, one
of the largest adoption agencies in New England. ``We don't think
Russian adoptions will stop, but when something like this happens,
it sends shivers through the adoption community, because you can't
know for sure what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the adoption professionals interviewed thius week,
Casey said she didn't expect the delays in Russia to last more than
a few months. But other practitioners predicted that, given
Moscow's notoriously slow bureaucracies and some of the entrenched
problems in the adoption system, it could take a year or more for
the new procedures to be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   All those involved said they were worried about the children who
will remain longer in orphanages while the new laws are being put
in place. However much good the changes might eventually do, many
of those facilities are badly run, lack funds, and are staffed by
personnel who mistreat the boys and girls living within them;
experts agree that the longer children remain in such institutions,
the greater the emotional and developmental damage they incur.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed, however, pointed out that every nation that
allows its children to be adopted abroad has periodically revised
its rules, especially during changes in government. Most notably,
that happened several times during the 1990s in China, which ranked
at the top of ``sending'' adoption nations until Russia assumed
that standing a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest State Department tally, Americans
adopted 4,348 children from Russia in 1999, compared to 4,101 from
China. The reforms instituted by Beijing over the years have made
that country's adoption process perhaps the least-corrupt in the
world; the third-highest source nation, South Korea (with 2,008
adoptees leaving last year), also runs operations that
professionals believe is very clean.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Russia is able to follow through on its promises, it
would mean the lopsided majority of adoptions in the world will be
done ethically and with a minimum of shady activity. Almost 16,400
children from all nations, including some where such crimes as
bribery, coercion, and baby theft are frequently reported, were
adopted into the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has the potential to slow down the process, but
we believe that will be temporary. And in the long run we're hoping
it's a beneficial change because it makes the process more credible
and provides assurances to prospective parents about the people
they're working with, as well as to the Russian federation,'' said
Mike Walsh, a vice president for Lutheran Social Services of New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Goodbody, head of the Russian adoption section of
Spence-Chapin in New York -- one of the nation's largest adoption
agencies -- said Putin's changes could have ripple effects. As
would-be parents look elsewhere, for instance, she said it is
likely other nations will be swamped with applications that could
also slow down their processes.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Hogan, president of Adopt America Advocates and studies
adoption in Eastern Europe, said the Russian reforms also will have
another certain effect: persuading other nations to follow suit.
Hogan, who returned from a fact-finding tour of Romania last week,
said that country already is studing Moscow's actions and is likely
to institute similar reforms soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries are saying, `We know there's a pressing need
to find homes for all these children,' '' said Hogan, a vocal
proponent of squeezing financial corruption out of the adoption
process. ``But they're not willing to sacrifice these kids on the
alter of commercialism.''

&HT;     PLAY TAKES A DELIGHTFUL LOOK AT MAE WEST, SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT HURWITT  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``It isn't what I do, but how I do it,'' Mae West
used to say. ``It isn't what I say, but how I say it, and how I
look when I do it and say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Shear doesn't follow that dictum very well in ``Dirty
Blonde,'' her popular new play about the bawdiest of American stage
and screen legends. Which is all to the good. How she looks when
she does it and says it is pretty fantastic. But what she says and
does is every bit as important.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Mae West so famously said: ``When I'm good I'm very, very
good, but when I'm bad, I'm better.'' In fitting tribute to her
subject, Shear's at her best when she's baddest, pushing the sexual
propriety envelope and transgressing restrictive norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blonde,'' an Off Broadway hit since it opened in January at
New York Theatre Workshop (the original home of ``Rent''), has
moved on up to the Great White Way where West broke into the big
time in 1927 with her first play, ``Sex'' (the title, as much as
the content, landed her in jail for indecency, which she adroitly
exploited to boost her career). The NYTW production of ``Blonde''
opened Monday _ ``Mae Day,'' as it were _ at Broadway's Helen Hayes
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, Shear fans should be advised, a one-woman show. Nor
is it autobiographical, as was Shear's widely popular 1993 solo
``Blown Sideways Through Life'' (which also originated at NYTW), a
comic and affecting tour through her 64-job search for happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Developed over the course of three years with director and
frequent Sondheim collaborator (``Passion,'' ``Into the Woods,''
``Sunday in the Park with George'') James Lapine (who suggested the
idea to Shear and edited and helped shape the result), ``Blonde''
is a multicharacter, three-actor, 100-minute play.
</P>
<P>
   It's about Mae West, to be sure. But it's also about obsession.
It's about women's roles and sexuality in a society that places
strict, hypocritical limits on both. It's about the abyss between
the public persona and the private self. It's about cross-dressing
and just plain dressing up. And it's a love story about a gal and a
guy who are both obsessed with Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   Shear, who also plays West at various stages of her life, is Jo,
an aspiring actress who has developed a mania for the original
blonde bombshell. Big, portly Kevin Chamberlin, who also plays some
of the (many, many) men in West's life, principally appears as
Charlie, a film librarian who has idolized West since his student
days _ to the point that he actually made a pilgrimage to meet her
in Beverly Hills, and became an annual visitor until her death,
receiving one of her gowns for his devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, lean Bob Stillman, who doubles as the show's musical
director and very capable piano accompanist, plays some of the
other important men in West's life: Her early vaudeville partner
and hapless husband, Frank Wallace; Ed Hearn, her effete longtime
dresser who helps create her famous look and develop the
groundbreaking gay characters for her second play, ``Drag''; Joe
Frisco, the sardonic, wise-cracking companion of her later years.
</P>
<P>
   The two stories run on parallel tracks, enlivened by plentiful,
well-chosen quips from West's sketches, plays and films. We follow
West's career from the lower echelons of vaudeville _ developing
her shimmy, testing the limits of what she could get away with - on
to Broadway and the creation of the corseted, ``dangerous curves''
persona immortalized in life vests and crullers as well as on film
(a successfully brazen response to the slim, flat flapper look then
in vogue).
</P>
<P>
   The story is told chronologically, but also not. Through
Charlie's pilgrimage, we meet the elderly West _ a remarkable
combination of doddering conceit and ingrained dignity in Shear's
performance _ long before she moves on to Hollywood. Meanwhile, Jo
and Charlie meet cute at West's tomb in her (and Shear's) native
Brooklyn. The progress of their romance is tantalizingly awkward,
impeded by mutual shyness and Jo's doubts about his sexual
orientation, especially when she discovers his habit of dressing up
as West.
</P>
<P>
   Shear's script and Lapine's seamless direction make the
transitions not only easy to follow but a large part of the joy of
the piece. It all takes place within the storybook confines of
Douglas Stein's hot-pink, forced-perspective box of a set, the rear
wall opening to reveal film library or apartment windows, as David
Lander's lights cast cell-block or palm tree shadows to suggest
changes of scene.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hilferty's deftly suggested quick-change costumes help
keep the story lines straight and take on a central role, first as
we watch West transform herself into her indelible image, then as
Jo and Charlie follow suit. Above all, it's the lightly but sharply
etched portraits created by the actors that keep ``Blonde'' on its
delightful track.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman inhabits his various characters with a vaudevillian's
soft-shoe flair. Chamberlin, so affectingly guarded and vulnerable
as Charlie, deftly takes on a variety of other roles, wonderfully
impersonating an embittered W.C. Fields for a blistering exchange
of savagely comic put-downs with West on the set of ``My Little
Chickadee.''
</P>
<P>
   Shear so carefully defines Jo, and so brightly portrays West's
stance, manner and throaty Brooklyn-accented sensuality, that
there's never the slightest doubt which character she is at the
moment _ even as both grow and develop; even when Jo adopts full
West drag. West _ as she often said, and as Shear sings _ was
certainly ``no angel.'' But she proves a very good muse.

`FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS': THE STORY OF IWO JIMA, THE ICON AND THE
BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wis., Ariz., Japan)  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Bradley, whose image is enshrined on a bronze megalith at
the Arlington National Cemetery, spent most of his life as a
funeral director in the small town of Antigo, Wis., but everybody
there knew that he was one of the six men who raised the famously
photographed flag on Iwo Jima during World War II. He almost never
talked about that exploit. Until he died, his large family in
Antigo never even knew that he had won the Navy Cross. His silence
created a sense that there were secrets about him to be discovered,
and it led one of his sons, James, to unearth the untold story of
his father and the stories of the other five men who were captured
in that famous image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flags of Our Fathers'' is the product of these investigations,
which James Bradley wrote in collaboration with the journalist Ron
Powers.
</P>
<P>
   We can all be happy that Bradley, who lives in Rye, N.Y.,
undertook this endeavor. ``Flags of Our Fathers'' is one of the
most instructive and moving books on war and its aftermath that we
are likely to see, in part because it is instructive and moving in
unexpected ways. On one level, Bradley has composed a touching
eulogy to his father, one that honors him precisely for those
qualities that did not earn him fame and recognition on Iwo Jima.
He has also forged an unforgettable tableau of one of the most
savage battlefields in history, a battlefield of wholesale death,
mutilation and waste. Beyond that he has produced an arresting
meditation on the nature of heroism, the public perception of it,
and the unbridgeable chasm between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flags of Our Fathers'' is most affecting not because of its
graphic portrayal of men at war, although its portrayal rivals
``Saving Private Ryan'' in its shocking, unvarnished immediacy.
Bradley's evocations of six very different young men and the forces
that led them to Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima are flavorful and
differentiated. But what gives this book its special power is his
bittersweet understanding of the torment suffered by the surviving
flag-raisers, who knew that the very act that gave them a kind of
lifetime celebrity was one of the few acts carried out on Iwo Jima
that was not especially noteworthy. As Bradley makes clear in a
perceptive piece of historical re-examination, the incident that
gave them heroic stature was insignificant, an accident, a
meaningless conjunction of time and place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew real heroism,'' Bradley writes of his father, one of
whose rare comments about the war was that the real heroes of Iwo
Jima were those who never came back. ``He could separate the real
thing from the image, the fluff. And no matter how many millions of
people thought otherwise, he understood that this image of heroism
was not the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of Edmund Wilson's book on Civil War writings,
``Patriotic Gore,'' is an apt phrase for Bradley's work. As a
reconstruction of one of the bloodiest battles of World War II,
``Flags of Our Fathers'' is straightforwardly patriotic. There is
no historical revisionism here; in Bradley's vision, the Americans
are the good guys, and the Japanese enemy, while brave, is ruthless
and unspeakably cruel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a powerful sense of ironic juxtaposition
simmers beneath his narrative: between the reality experienced by
the Marines caught in the battle, who saw their buddies literally
sliced into pieces, and the media-induced image of a flag spread
out grandly in a stiff breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Iwo Jima, an island that lay athwart the main air route to
Japan, was defended by 22,000 dug-in Japanese soldiers whose orders
were to kill 10 Americans each and then to die. On the morning of
Feb. 19, 1945, it was invaded by 70,000 American marines, of whom
26,000 were to be killed or wounded as they carried out the grim
task of rooting out the defenders, 21,000 of whom died by the time
it was over. ``Death became demystified, an occupational hazard,''
Bradley writes.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day, according to Bradley's careful reconstruction
of the battle, six men put up a flag on the island's highest point.
They were merely replacing a smaller flag that had been raised
earlier by a different group of men. Almost by accident, an
Associated Press photographer, Joe Rosenthal, snapped a picture of
the second flag-raising. He did not, contrary to what is commonly
said about this historic moment, pose the photograph beforehand.
The picture was authentic, but the sentiment that it aroused was
not. The second flag was basically unnoticed by the Marines on Iwo
Jima, who had cheered when the first flag went up. Still, the
picture _ The Photograph, as Bradley aptly calls it _ became an
icon of American patriotism, and the act of raising it was
surrounded by a fabricated epic of battlefield heroics.
</P>
<P>
   John Bradley, who as a medical corpsman repeatedly risked his
life to bring help to the wounded, was acutely aware of the
fabricated nature of the flag-raising heroism, and the sharpest
passages in his son's book involve a penetrating exploration of
that awareness. But the junior Bradley examines the effects of The
Photograph on others in this story who felt its effects. For the
three men in the picture who came home, and for the families of the
three men who didn't, The Photograph became mostly an affliction, a
light that blinded, or a source of a perverse humiliation. Among
those men was Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian from Arizona who descended
into fatal alcoholism after the war and in whom the fuss about the
picture aroused a kind of fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroes?'' Bradley writes, putting himself into the
psychological frame of reference of Hayes and the others. ``They
had just returned from the protracted horrors of one of the
deadliest and most intense battles in history, where heroes around
them had acted with unimaginable bravery, suffered, and died almost
by the minute. And here was an American populace driving itself
into a frenzy over ... what? Over an accidental photograph of a
forgotten moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's book is about what might be seen as the hubris of the
media and the pictorial image in American life. Like the best
books, Bradley's goes beyond its narrow subject to invite
reflection on deeper patterns of human behavior: in this instance,
our ability to create a transcendent lie and promote it avidly
despite the small voices of those few who know it to be false.

U.N. STUDIES FORESEE STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A U.N. survey predicts that the average economic growth
for Western Europe will exceed an annual pace of 3 percent if
current economic conditions hold. Western Europe has not had such
growth on average since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Improvement in East European and the Baltic countries is also
foreseen by the 2000 Economic Survey of Europe, which is prepared
annually by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe. Eastern Europe
is expected to grow an average 4 percent, while the Baltic states
are expected to have 3 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by rapid expansion of exports in Western Europe, the
Continent is forecast to fare better than it did in 1999. Paul
Rayment, director of the body's economic analysis division,
however, warned that uncertainties over oil prices and European
monetary policy as well as ``the possibility of a crash in
overvalued equity prices in the United States is a serious risk to
the current outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   In Western Europe, Italy and Germany could experience a stronger
rate of growth than predicted. The business climates in the two
countries improved markedly in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Western Europe growth is expected to increase to a
3.2 percent pace this year, up from 2 percent in 1999. Of its
largest countries, France is forecast to rise to 3.5 percent from
2.7 percent last year. Germany's growth is predicted to reach 2.8
percent, up from 1.5 percent last year. Britain is expected to
reach 3 percent, up 1 percentage point from 1999. Italy is forecast
to grow at a 2.5 percent pace, up from 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the smaller countries, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and
Turkey are anticipated to have the greatest economic expansion in
2000, according to the report, which is based on data from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as
national statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Many economies in Eastern Europe are more uncertain, Rayment
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term recovery in Russia is also uncertain, especially
because of its vulnerability to external factors, like a fall in
oil prices.

FOOD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA CLARK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When to Use Grape Seed Oil
</P>
<P>
   Q. I can't find grape seed oil. Is there a substitute?
</P>
<P>
   A. Grape seed oil, a light-bodied flavorless oil pressed from
the pits of wine grapes, can generally be replaced by other neutral
oils, like safflower, canola or vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Since grape seed oil is extracted via the cold press method (as
are top quality olive oils) it has a clean flavor without any of
the undesirable ``processed'' notes in some other oils. While these
notes are undetectable in robust dishes, they might show up in
subtly seasoned preparations, like mild vinaigrettes, dressings and
mayonnaise, so it is better to use grape seed oil for these.
</P>
<P>
   Grape seed oil is also preferable sometimes because it has a
high smoking point. At the smoking point, oils break down, giving
foods an ``off'' flavor, or even burning them. This makes grape
seed oil especially good for deep fat frying.
</P>
<P>
   Grape seed oil is available in some supermarkets and at most
specialty shops. Prices vary, from $8 to $12 for 26 to 32 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Bowls That Don't Interact
</P>
<P>
   Q. When a recipe tells you to mix something in a nonreactive
bowl, what does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. A nonreactive bowl is made from glass, ceramics, plastic or
stainless steel, which are inert materials. A reactive bowl is one
made from unlined copper or unlined aluminum. Cast-iron cookware is
also reactive.
</P>
<P>
   Reactive materials can interact with the liquid in a recipe,
especially acidic liquids like tomato juice, lemon juice or
buttermilk, which can negatively affect the flavor and color of the
mixture. Most bowls sold today are nonreactive.
</P>
<P>
   There is one instance in which a cook might prefer a reactive
bowl. When egg whites are beaten in an unlined copper bowl, the
eggs' proteins bond with acids in the copper, creating a stronger,
more stable egg-white foam than can be achieved in a nonreactive
bowl. (A similar reaction can be produced in any bowl, however, by
adding a pinch of cream of tartar to whites as you beat them.)
</P>
<P>
   A Primer on Creme Fraiche
</P>
<P>
   Q. What, exactly, is creme fraiche?
</P>
<P>
   A. Creme fraiche is a cultured dairy product made from heavy
cream. In France, it is typically made by letting unpasteurized
cream slowly ferment and thicken at room temperature until it
acquires a complex, buttery flavor with a characteristic sour tang.
In the United States, creme fraiche is made by introducing
bacteria, like that in yogurt, into pasteurized cream.
</P>
<P>
   Creme fraiche has several uses in cooking. When whipped until it
holds peaks, it makes a lush topping for desserts, fruit or blini.
It can be added to sauces and soups to thicken and enrich them, and
unlike sour cream, will not curdle when heated. It can also be used
as an ingredient in baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   Creme fraiche can be found in most specialty food shops and many
large supermarkets. But you can also easily make it at home. Simply
mix one cup heavy cream (preferably not ultra-pasteurized) with two
tablespoons buttermilk, which contains the required bacteria, and
let the mixture sit, loosely covered, at room temperature until it
thickens. This can take anywhere from 12 to 36 hours. Homemade
creme fraiche will keep for about 10 days in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Low-Fat Cream Sauces
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am always looking for ways to make low-fat, low-cholesterol
versions of recipes, and I'm having a problem with cream sauces. In
place of cream I've been substituting evaporated skim milk.
Although the taste is fine, the sauces seem to separate or curdle.
What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. You are probably overheating your sauces. Bringing the sauce
to a simmer, which is commonly called for in recipes using heavy
cream, won't work with lower-fat dairy products like milk or
yogurt. This is because heat encourages the proteins in all dairy
products to clump together and curdle, forming solid little
nuggets. Heavy cream has enough fat to coat the proteins, keeping
them separate and flowing in a smooth, creamy liquid, but skim milk
does not. Therefore, only recipes using heavy cream can safely be
brought to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is a simple way to substitute low-fat milk for
cream: add starch. Starch will both thicken the sauce and keep it
from curdling. A good rule of thumb is to blend two to four
teaspoons of cornstarch, arrowroot powder or potato starch with one
cup evaporated skim milk (or regular skim milk), then add it to the
saucepan. Bring the sauce to a simmer, and cook for a minute or
two, until it thickens.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to salvage an already curdled sauce, try whirling it
in the blender to recombine it. This will work with most separated
sauces, as long as you serve it quickly so that it doesn't have a
chance to separate again.

 &HT;    Creative role model: Designer blazing a trail for others
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Her clients include New York music mogul/Atlanta
restaurant owner Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, entertainer and neighbor
Queen Latifah, Disney, BET, Sony.
</P>
<P>
   But equally high on Courtney Sloane's list of people to take
care of are young black designers in search of role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had one and suffered such a learning curve without
one. But I've been blessed with good luck and have worked hard, so
I've been able to accomplish a great deal in a short period of
time,'' the New York designer said from her studio, Alternative
Design.
</P>
<P>
   Since forming the company eight years ago, the 36-year-old has
been on the fast track in a white-male dominated industry in which
fewer than 3 percent of designers are minorities. Her success,
designing mostly offices and homes for music industry leaders and
professional athletes, surprises even Sloane.
</P>
<P>
   For Sloane, the key has been a multidisciplinary approach to
design, taking on everything from interiors to products with a
racially and ethnically diverse staff of 10. That mix, she said,
breeds a healthy exchange of ideas that knows no barriers.
</P>
<P>
   But outside her office, the lack of diversity concerns her.
``Across the country, the number of blacks enrolling in design
school is declining,'' Sloane said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unknown how many minorities are practicing design. The
industry's largest national organization, the 30,000-member
American Society of Interior Designers, doesn't track them. But the
national Organization of Black Designers, which includes 5,100
interior, fashion and graphics designers, estimates all minorities
make up less than 3 percent, said David Rice, the group's founder.
About 1,500 members are interior designers, including about 200 in
the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta clothing and interior designer Knox Clayton, who is
black, said it was ``unheard of'' 27 years ago when he opened his
clothing store, F'Alonso, in a white upper-class area of Atlanta.
``But then, I've always kind of stood alone and did whatever I
wanted to do, without any real influences in my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, opportunities in Atlanta have never been greater for
black interior designers because of the influx of wealthy athletes
and recording artists, Clayton said, yet few are taking advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sloane explained why.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why aren't more blacks entering the design profession?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I think they get discouraged because they want to be in
career paths where they can see people like them, and there's just
not a lot of us that are visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How were you able to accomplish so much without a black role
model?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I really, really wanted design as a career. In college, I
majored in marketing before studying interior design at the Fashion
Institute of Technology so I learned how to sell myself, which in
this industry is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's being done to encourage young designers?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A lot of the old guard here in New York who have been
practicing 30 years are winding down their careers, so
opportunities are coming along for a new generation. I'm on the
advisory board for the interior design department at the Pratt
Institute and get a lot of calls from design students, wanting to
know how to get started, how to get into the magazines. I'm also
helping to establish the African-American Archives at the Hewitt
Institute here in New York, a place where we can submit photos
about our work and champion our accomplishments. Our hope is that
other people will in some way draw inspiration from it.''

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (New York) _ President Clinton and his national
security adviser warned Tuesday that failure to extend new trading
rights to China would be a self-inflicted wound, compromising
America's global leadership as it undermined Chinese reformers. In
sometimes dire language that seemed to reflect the administration's
nervousness about prospects for congressional approval of the China
trade measure, Clinton said that even beyond economic benefits, the
legislation is important to American national security. By Joseph

of their eighth-grade friends by cell phone, the two boys stole
Michael's father's Ford Bronco and drove it into a large Norwegian
spruce a mile south of their school. The spruce, which grew in
front of the First Church of Christ here, was also the scene of a
deadly car accident in November that killed Michael's 17-year-old

WORLD MARATHON RECORD HOLDER GAINS U.S. CITIZENSHIP AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Ill., Pa., Mass.)   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Khalid Khannouchi, who holds the world record in the marathon,
became a U.S. citizen on Tuesday, making him eligible to compete
for a slot on the U.S. team going to the Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia, in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroccan-born runner, who now lives in Ossining, N.Y., took
his citizenship oath in Houston after being interviewed by an
official of the Naturalization and Immigration Service and passing
a test on American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy that my quest for U.S. citizenship has
been successful,'' Khannouchi said, according to The Associated
Press. ``I look forward to competing in national and international
championship events as an American citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi came to the United States in 1993 to run in the World
University Games. He settled in New York, believing that the
Moroccan athletic federation was not supporting him sufficiently,
and later married another marathon runner, Sandra Natal, who is a
naturalized U.S. citizen. He applied for permanent residency status
more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Khannouchi's application was delayed after the immigration
official who interviewed him was accused of taking bribes in other
cases and quit, leaving no paper record of the interview. The
runner's file was frozen and he had to start the application
process all over again.
</P>
<P>
   After his wife took a job last month with an American firm in
Madrid, Khannouchi became eligible for citizenship under a law that
allows spouses of Americans working overseas to become citizens
without having to meet a three-year residency requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, 28, broke the world record at a marathon in Chicago
last October when he covered the 26-mile-385-yard course in 2
hours, 5 minutes and 42 seconds. On April 16, he ran the London
Marathon in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 36 seconds, finishing in third
place with hamstring and ankle pain.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi is considering whether to run in Pittsburgh's hilly
marathon on Sunday, only three weeks after the London race that
left him hobbling, or to bide his time until the 10,000 meter
trials for the U.S. Olympic team in Sacramento, Calif., in July. He
is expected to discuss his plans at a news conference in New York
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for elite runners to do more than two marathons a
year, which Khannouchi has already done.
</P>
<P>
   The runner must also secure Morocco's permission to compete for
the United States under an Olympic rule that requires an athlete to
wait three years to represent a new country unless his former
country agrees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Khannouchi's bid for citizenship was supported by two members of
Congress: Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Sue Kelley,
R-N.Y., who represents the Westchester County district where the
runner now lives.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi was also backed by New Balance, the Boston-based
footwear company whose running shoes Khannouchi has endorsed.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bodies have been removed, replaced by yellow cards
indicating the names of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   A textbook is open on a desk, forever frozen. Walls and windows
are strafed with bullet holes. Computers have been shot to
smithereens, their electronic guts spilling out. The trophy case is
a poignant mess. Abandoned bookbags and knapsacks are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Robotically unaware of what has transpired, an electronic sign
in the cafeteria continues to flash messages such as, ``Good Luck
Spring Sports Teams...''
</P>
<P>
   Blood congeals in dark patterns on the carpet in the library.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're seeing this, we're hearing pop tunes. First
``Columbine, Friend Of Mine,'' then Cheryl Wheeler's ``If It Were
Up to Me,'' then Sarah McLachlan's ``I Will Remember You.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Columbine High School, as you've never seen it before.
</P>
<P>
   It's perhaps the most bizarre medley of raw footage I've ever
seen. If ever there's a show called ``World's Most Macabre Home
Videos,'' this could be the showcase segment.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by a judge's order, authorities in Jefferson County,
Colo., released the Littleton Fire Department so-called training
video that includes 3 1/2 hours of overhead footage taken by
KCNC-TV's news helicopter, unedited footage taken by news crews on
the ground and a 25-minute segment that shows the interior of the
high school in the immediate aftermath of the shootings that left
15 dead and several others seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   County officials were selling copies of the tape for $25 _ but
their initial 80-copy supply has already run out, and copyright
challenges may prevent further distribution of the tape. The music
companies representing Wheeler and McLachlan have strenuously
objected to the unauthorized use of their songs.
</P>
<P>
   And well they should. Since when does a training video look like
an audition tape for MTV?
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen the entire video, but the segments I watched had
absolutely nothing to contribute in the way of lessons learned or
safety guidelines to follow should a similar flash of chaos occur
someday.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw was irrelevant, tasteless and strange, and would
undoubtedly be deeply upsetting to anyone with a personal
connection to the Columbine tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the music, we get all sorts of home video auteur
stuff: Dramatic zooms so we can focus on the blood, dissolves from
the ravaged cafeteria to the funereal library, pans across
particularly dramatic bullet holes in windows. It's creepy and
ghoulishly voyeuristic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing are the pictures of victims loaded into
ambulances. Some are gesturing; others' faces have already been
covered. We hear random, unidentified voices, including a woman who
says, ``Are you all parents? We're trying to get parents to go to
(the) elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Nimmo had two children who attended Columbine. Son Craig
Scott, now 17, somehow survived the shootings. Daughter Rachel
Scott did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (my son) was in the library, he didn't hear music playing
in the background,'' Nimmo said Wednesday after viewing the tape.
``For the first time today, I saw my daughter being dragged over to
the fire engine. I don't need to see that and nobody else needs to
see that.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to ask the ``author'' of this videotape a simple
question: What were you thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I already know the answer. The answer is,
``Nothing.''

A WINE TASTING VS. A WINE DRINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drinking wine is fun. Tasting wine is work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for some reason, Americans love to talk about wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting will be followed by a wine tasting.'' ``After the
candidate speaks, there will be a wine tasting in the library.''
``Join us for a wine and cheese tasting.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine broker in Bordeaux, who prowls the cold damp cellars
trying to guess what the raw young wines will be like in another 10
years, is a true taster. The importer confronted with, and probably
confounded by, an array of seemingly identical bottles is a taster.
So is the judge at a wine competition, facing 100 cabernets. So is
the winery owner, making the final crucial blend of the vintage.
</P>
<P>
   These people are professionals who spend years developing their
skills. They taste often and they taste seriously, because many
thousands of dollars ride on their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Wine-tasting classes abound, particularly in the big cities, and
they are serious enough _ but mostly about meeting other tasters.
As for all those other so-called tastings, they are mostly, to use
the diplomat's term, drinkings. In other words, parties at which
wine is served.
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell a real tasting from a fashionable one? Simple:
at a professional tasting, nobody _ at least nobody with any sense
_ drinks anything. Since the nose is a far better judge of wine
than the mouth, the pros spend as much time smelling wine as they
do tasting it. What they do taste, they spit out. Spitting is no
fun. It's awkward, it's messy and it's frustrating. After all,
one's instinct is to swallow, particularly if the wine is any good.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing a wine and cheese party as a tasting is harmless
enough, except for the fact that it conveys the idea of something
educational, of a learning process. It implies that wine is
something for the initiated; that to drink and enjoy it, you have
to go through tastings.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to have a bottle of good Burgundy for every time
someone has said to me, ``I like wine, but I don't know anything
about it.'' Why is it that no one ever says, ``I like rye bread,
but I don't know anything about it''? Why are so many so
intimidated? Who do people think they have to take a course to be
able to enjoy a glass of wine?
</P>
<P>
   The industry bears much of the responsibility. How many kinds of
rye bread confront the consumer every day? A dozen, if that? How
many zinfandels? A couple of hundred. How many chardonnays?
Probably close to a thousand. For all their vaunted marketing
skills, the people who sell wine can not seem to do much about this
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``tastings'' appears to be that you will learn
to distinguish among various wines. But who can make a choice among
1,000 chardonnays? The wine publications are not much help. ``We
tasted 350 chardonnays for you,'' they trumpet, ``and picked the 30
best.'' Thanks a lot.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague came to me 20 years or so ago and asked: ``Is
Chateau X supposed to be a good wine?'' He had had a bottle the
night before and liked it. I do not remember the chateau name, but
it was a good wine and at a good price. Years later, he said it was
the only wine he ever drank. ``I still like it,'' he said. ``Why
change? ``
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed?
</P>
<P>
   If everyone had half a dozen wines he or she knew and enjoyed,
much of the insecurity that accompanies wine drinking and wine
buying would disappear, along with the lucrative ``wine education''
business that profits from it. Rare and expensive wines would
continue to attract the relatively small market of collectors and
connoisseurs, but a vast new market would open up for all the
people who would like to drink wine but are put off by the
confusion and elitism that plague the wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the approach to wine as something exotic is the
idea of wine as food. The typical wine advertisement shows a
handsome couple relaxing by the fire, sipping wine. To me, there is
no greater waste of a good red wine than drinking it like a
cocktail, either at home or at a bar. In traditional wine drinking
countries, wine is almost never served as an aperitif or an after
dinner drink unless it is fortified. If you're just having a drink,
have a martini or a beer or a sherry. Or _ the one exception _ an
oaky, sweetish California chardonnay. But save the red wine, or the
dry white wine, for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Wine is meant to go with food. When Baron Eric de Rothschild
took over Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in 1977, he invited a few
people to come to the chateau for a long weekend to sample every
vintage produced since the Rothschilds bought Lafite in the 19th
century. As many of the wines as possible were tasted at the table,
with meals.
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice a year, Bipin Desai, a California collector, puts
on extensive tastings of famous wines _ every vintage of Ridge
Vineyards' Monte Bello cabernet, for example _ for other
collectors. Desai's tastings, usually spaced over three or four
days, are always done in restaurant settings. Like Rothschild's
weekend, they are not really tastings but a succession of
resplendent meals.

`HEMINGWAY ADVENTURE' : A TRAVELOGUE FROM BIRTHPLACE TO GRAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla., Idaho, Cuba, Kenya, Spain, Uganda)  (Eds: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are

 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure'' is an engrossing
travelogue. But there are two things it is not. Even though Palin,
the program's host and writer, is an alumnus of the Monty Python
comedy troupe, this is no manic Pythonian romp. Nor is it a
colloquy on the life and work of Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of Palin's two earlier globe-trotting series, this
four-hour ``Adventure'' _ which PBS is showing in two chunks,
Wednesday night and next Wednesday _ gives Palin wide latitude (not
to mention longitude) for his wry observations. They are often
delightful. That's lucky because while the series visits
Hemingway's birthplace, grave and many of the places that were most
significant in between, he remains a shadowy presence along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear some memorable factoids about the great man: he
once shot himself while fishing; he loved cats; he hated underwear;
he ate Spam; he and Orson Welles once bashed each other with
chairs. But to seek his essence as a man or a writer, you'll have
to book another kind of passage. Or pass time with a book.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, you can enjoy the trip that Palin is
conducting. He is an imaginative tour guide, both knowledgeable and
curious about the places through which he leads you. He has a knack
for creating the illusion of intimacy as he speaks wittily to you
and to the people he meets along the way, rarely acknowledging the
film crew that is shadowing him and capturing dozens of memorable
images, from the snows of Kilimanjaro to Palin's own farewell to
arms after he tries firing a pistol and shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, after recalling his delight in discovering
Hemingway's books as a teen-ager, Palin is off to Spain: to
Pamplona, where Hemingway described the annual running of the
bulls, and to Valencia, where he started his first novel, ``The Sun
Also Rises.'' At a bullring, Palin makes the first of many
discoveries of his own distaste for things Hemingway loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know better what drew Hemingway to the bullfight,''
he says. ``For him, to confront death was to experience life at its
most intense. For me, well, it's a Spanish thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's other stops include Kenya, where, instead of
hunting, Palin views animals with rangers who protect them, and to
Hemingway's birthplace in Oak Park, Ill., where Palin learns that
he shares a hometown _ Sheffield, England _ with Hemingway's
maternal grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's jaunt includes stops in Key West, Fla., for the
annual Hemingway look-alike contest; Uganda, where he survived two
plane crashes within 48 hours; and Venice, where he gleefully read
in The Daily Mirror of New York that he had died in the second
crash. Before reaching Ketchum, Idaho, site of Hemingway's suicide
in 1961, Palin stops in Cuba for the series' best sequence.
</P>
<P>
   He visits Hemingway's favorite hotel room in Havana and his
house outside the city, both lovingly maintained as shrines. At the
house, ``every object is cleaned religiously,'' including
Hemingway's record collection, ``which can never be played, as
they've run out of needles.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, when he concludes that Hemingway has been a good
traveling companion, you will think the same of Palin. He has
gamely failed in his attempts at Hemingway-style fishing, shooting
and drinking. But except for a moment's jotting in a notebook, he
is never shown trying that most Hemingwayesque pursuit, writing.
Maybe that's why Papa never quite comes into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his scripts, Palin has written several books, including
a novel called ``Hemingway's Chair,'' which he never mentions.
Still, he was probably wise to keep such efforts off screen. If you
have ever seen someone actually writing, you will know: It is not a
pretty sight.

THE `PARTY'S' OVER, BUT SKIP THE TEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the last Salinger to leave San Francisco please turn out
the light?
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's series finale of ``Party of Five,'' it seems the
worst fate that could befall any member of the Salinger clan is to
be ``stuck'' in dreary San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Damned ingrates.
</P>
<P>
   After six seasons on Fox, ``Party of Five'' closes shop with a
syrupy two-hour finale in which almost everyone wants to get out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the old Hewitt maneuver. Jennifer Love Hewitt left the show
a year ago to live in New York, and what good came of that?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, her former boyfriend Bailey Salinger (Scott Wolf) now
wants to earn a business degree from the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's sister Julia (Neve Campbell) has been offered an
internship by the National Organization for Women in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Their sister Claudia (Lacey Chaubert) has been accepted at
Stanford University, but the heck with that. She wants to go to
Juilliard in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe, and completely doable,'' she says of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   That part I like. In fact, I believe that's the Stanford school
motto: ``Safe, and completely doable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to stay with me and Charlie if you all go?''
wonders little Owen (Jacob Smith), the youngest member of the
orphaned Salinger family.
</P>
<P>
   Eldest sibling Charlie (Matthew Fox) seems to be wondering the
same thing. ``Now I'm the only one who's left,'' he grouses. ``I
don't know what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, thinking of his deceased parents, Charlie delivers
another love letter to San Francisco. ``If they were alive,'' he
says, ``we all would have left years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Good grief, one bad 49ers season and you'd think the whole burg
was Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the episode, the fleeing family members have
second thoughts. Not that they really want to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always the one that backs down,'' Bailey complains. ``I'm
always the one that gets (set ital)stuck(end ital) here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of the Salinger shack. Actually, their
mansion at Broadway and Fillmore, with a bay view. Charlie doesn't
want it; too many stairs.
</P>
<P>
   So the house is at risk, too. In the final episode's single
startling moment of realism, Charlie figures the real estate market
is hot and the place would fetch a fair sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party of Five'' dies as it lived, in a pool of sentiment deep
enough to drown a giraffe.
</P>
<P>
   There are half a dozen or so flashback scenes, with the
Salingers pulling at heartstrings. Most of it is accompanied by
maudlin piano music.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard viewers, those who stayed with ``Party of Five'' to the
end, probably wouldn't want it any other way. Their favorite
fictional family bucked the odds, kept together, grew, laughed,
cried.
</P>
<P>
   OK, mostly cried.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, the ``Party's'' been over for a long time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chelsea Clinton was away at Stanford University on
Tuesday, finishing up her junior year, but her ears must have been
burning from a conversation that was occurring back at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, her mother was using her as Exhibit A in the
first-ever White House Conference on Teen-agers, a day-long session
that brought together academic experts, activists, parents and
young people to discuss the challenges of growing up in this age of
school shootings, body piercings and Internet pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I speak, of course, with great authority _
having just graduated from being the parents of a teen-ager to
being the parents of a 20-year-old and having survived it,'' said
Hillary Rodham Clinton as she began the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton called the event ``more than a trip down
memory lane or an exercise in nostalgia for us,'' she spoke from
personal experience as she talked about the challenges of balancing
work and family, and of the disconcerting feeling that parents face
when their teen-agers would rather spend time with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to hang around just in case they'll deign to say
something to you,'' said Mrs. Clinton, prompting the president,
whom she called the ``co-parent'' of the household, to roar in
laughter. The Clintons have been extremely protective of their only
child, who was 11 when they moved into the White House. But they
appear quite proud that she has emerged from an unusual childhood
into an accomplished young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said it was in the small kitchen in the White House
residence where familial bonding occurred in the Clinton household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our daughter left for college, the three of us made it
a priority to share at least one meal together a day,'' said Mrs.
Clinton. ``With our hectic schedules, it wasn't always easy and,
occasionally, wasn't possible. But we sure tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton called those half-hour or hour-long meals ``my
favorite part of the day,'' and one of the most important, too. To
spread the word about the importance of sharing meals, or any time
at all, with teen-agers, she announced a new public education
campaign on the issue by the National Partnership for Women and
Families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and I were very convinced that we wanted to convey to our
daughter a simple message, one that we hoped she would carry away
to college: that whenever she does need someone to talk to or ask
for advice, or just wants to say hello, we will be available and
eager to listen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said what she knows as a parent is right in line
with new research from the National Institute of Mental Health that
shows teen-agers' brains go through a second wave of development,
not unlike the quick growth of the brains of toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the very wise advice I got from a friend of mine,
when my daughter was very small, and she was raising three
teen-agers,'' said Mrs. Clinton. ``And she said, you know, the two
times in a child's life that seem most similar to me are those
toddler years and the teen-age years. It's when we need to give so
much more attention to our children.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These days, giving that attention is tougher than ever for the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is busy campaigning in New York for a Senate seat.
President Clinton has a vigorous travel schedule of his own. For
her part, Chelsea, who has a boyfriend and a full load of classes,
is not exactly sitting by the phone waiting for a call from Mom and
Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with 3,000 miles between us, the three of us try to talk
on the phone as often as possible,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in a column
on being a parent in Newsweek magazine. ``Of course, it isn't quite
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their official travel schedules over the years, the
first couple effectively worked at home as they were raising
Chelsea, increasing the opportunity for interaction. And Bill
Clinton was the top boss, meaning if he decided to attend one of
her high school ballet recitals, the rest of the federal government
obliged.
</P>
<P>
   But the president, acknowledging that other federal workers face
tougher times, signed an executive order Tuesday barring
discrimination against parents in the federal workforce. ``The goal
of this order simply says, `no glass ceiling for parents,''' he
said. ``The job they're doing at home is more important, anyway.''

JUST A GOOD OL' BOY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most rising country music stars, hopping a customized bus
with a major headliner and hitting the road is probably the
quickest route to commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Paisley, a 27-year-old singer and guitar picker, has taken
plenty of those gigs, opening for Alan Jackson, Vince Gill, Buck
Owens and others; in fact, he arrived in Los Angeles this week
fresh from a United Kingdom tour with Reba McEntire, Ricky Skaggs
and Jo Dee Messina.
</P>
<P>
   But on any weekend he finds himself at home in Nashville,
Paisley is likely to be playing the Grand Ole Opry, the beloved old
homestead of country music. In fact, since his debut there last
May, he has done more than 25 shows, which could be some kind of
record for a newcomer, if the Opry kept track of such things. And
that's a much smaller paycheck than the tours bring in.
</P>
<P>
   It's that strong sense of tradition that has endeared Paisley to
his colleagues as much as his handiwork on his Telecaster and
Larrivee guitars, and his gift for telling good stories with his
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   He has reaped the rewards with four nominations for tonight's
Academy of Country Music Awards, including the rare combination of
best new artist and songwriter of the year for his touching ballad
``He Didn't Have to Be.'' He plans to perform it as an acoustic
solo during the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think beyond the audience, who always enjoy his sincerity,
his great songwriting and guitar ability, our membership has really
taken a liking to him,'' said Pete Fisher, the Opry's general
manager. ``They really appreciate his genuineness and his
supporting something that's bigger than his own career.''
</P>
<P>
   Paisley, a native of West Virginia, maintains an ``aw shucks''
attitude about his fame and all the critical accolades, especially
the flattering words from his own idols. A year after hitting
celebrity status, he admitted he's still overwhelmed by it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea,'' Paisley said during a phone interview from
the road. ``It's a good kind of feeling, but it's also a whirlwind
to some extent, but it's fun. It beats working, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   All this success at such a tender age (he's young enough to pass
for a Backstreet Boy, after all) begs the question: Is he concerned
that his career might peak too early?
</P>
<P>
   As he does in many of his songs, he found humor in the
suggestion. ``Thanks a lot. I'm going to hang up and have
nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he mulled it over and gave the straight answer. ``I believe
everything happens for a reason. I've had so many things in my life
go unexplainably the right way,'' he said. ``We need to be in
charge and take control and try to do things the right way, but I
believe there's a higher power guiding a lot of things that have
happened to me, and there's just too many weird things to mention.
So I don't worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, as busy as this has made me and as much stress as
it can put on you and demands on your time, peaking too early may
not be a bad thing, looking at the free time you'd get once it was
over.'' There was that tongue back in the cheek again.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a good indication of the impact Paisley has had already:
He used a passport for the first time ever on his recent Britain
tour, and while he was there he accepted the International Rising
Star award at the annual HMV British Country Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   His debut album, ``Who Needs Pictures,'' recently went gold
about nine months after its release. Arista Records released the
title cut and two other tracks as singles, and more will come from
that CD, even as he is in the studio on his next record.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley is a whiz on the guitar, and a largely self-taught one
at that. His instrumental ``The Nervous Breakdown'' lives up to its
title for its frenzied tempo. But a big part of his appeal is his
knack for capturing the essence of common experiences in his
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   There is the hit-and-miss maneuverings of a single man in a bar
(``Me Neither''), the Sunday service that just won't end (``Long
Sermon''), the chance meeting that blossoms into romance (``We
Danced'') and a few variations on the ever-popular lost-love theme
(which Paisley says are based on his own experiences as a jiltee).
</P>
<P>
   ``He Didn't Have to Be'' is the one that seems to have had the
greatest impact. The ballad is a thank you from a stepson to the
man who married his mother (``I hope I'm at least half the dad/He
didn't have to be''). It was co-written with Paisley's best friend,
Kelley Lovelace, himself a stepfather, as a gift for Lovelace's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of wanted to make her cry _ that was our big
goal,'' Paisley said. ``It worked, and then we made a lot of other
folks cry, too, which has been great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that something I learned was being truthful and
looking around your life at the things that are going on and
putting yourself into a song in one way or another is the way to do
this, especially country music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about commerce. It should be about art, coming from
the heart and being honest. Real life, you know?''

   Shannon Leavey's to-do list during the past three months has
included tanning, working out and scheduling precisely
choreographed hair and nail salon appointments. All this for
Saturday _ the night of her junior prom.
</P>
<P>
   Plus there was the added challenge of finding the perfect dress
amid the fashion industry's unletting ``skin-is-in'' mantra droning
from every pop culture outlet this spring. Leavey and her friends
experienced several hectic shopping trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all just saying the other night, this all seems so
much more stress than what it's worth to be in a dress for only a
few hours,'' mused Leavey, a Saugus High student. ``But then you
get to that day of the prom _ which is so much fun _ and you say,
`Oh, well, I guess it was worth it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-prom frenzy has evolved over generations into an unofficial
coming-of-age ritual, experts say, made even more challenging this
year by racks full of gowns that flaunt skin around the shoulders,
back and midriff, such as popular two-piece dresses. They warn that
high expectations and self-imposed pressures can lead to
unnecessary risks _ emotionally, physically and even financially,
when costs outweigh means.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big crisis for young women,'' said Dr. Dee
Shepherd- Look, a professor of psychology at Cal State Northridge
who studies how teen apparel reflects personality. ``A lot of
teens, especially seniors, look at the prom as the last time to be
together, to look their best and go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavey has already learned one lesson the hard way. She replaced
some meals with water and exercised to the point she felt ill
before her winter formal. Her goal was to fit into a tight formal
dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid thing to do. I know that now,'' said Leavey, a
Santa Clarita resident. ``That's not something I would do again.
This is me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd-Look says the obsession with looking ``perfect'' can
compound other prom pressures, such as finding dates, figuring out
seating plans, deciding whether to use illegal drugs and alcohol or
engage in risky sexual behavior after the prom.
</P>
<P>
   Irregular crash dieting and extreme exercise is common though
not sensible, she says, as many teen girls want to make sure the
perfect dress is a perfect fit on a perfect night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will buy a dress one size too small and pour themselves
into it,'' said Shepherd-Look. ``And when you see what's out there
to wear, they're seeing that thin _ and skin _ is in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Smith, a 15-year-old Chatsworth High School student, knew of
a student who became ill after using illegal drugs to lose weight.
She speculates many young girls go to extremes to look like teen
pop music icons like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's sad,'' said Smith, who won't wear revealing
shirts because she's not comfortable baring her midriff. She added,
``I think (teens) should just try to find something that fits
themselves.'' Other teens insist clothing pressures come from peers
more than pop culture icons from fashion magazines, music videos,
movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Agius, also a Chatsworth High student, admits she
sometimes reconsiders fashions she once disliked after classmates
wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see it in the store and not think it's really that great,
but then I see it on someone else and think it's actually really
cute,'' said Agius.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we compare the way we look more to our friends than
anything,'' Leavey says frankly. ``These are the people you're
going to be standing right next to and people see you next to them
_ not someone on television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clothes play such an important part in (teens') lives, so when
it comes to prom, it's no wonder they put such an emphasis on that
one night,'' said Laurel Bear, an Alhambra school administrator,
youth counselor and author of ``Straight Answers to Tough
Questions,'' a parenting guide distributed free to Santa Clarita
residents.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``There's pressures to get that date; there's
pressures to look good at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going all out because this is my last year,'' said
Danielle Blackman, a senior at Reseda High who rented a stretch
Navigator _ the $200 per hour sport-utility equivalent of a
limousine _ for the occasion. ``This is it. After this, you're all
leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Sanchez, a Winnetka resident and senior at Taft High
School in Woodland Hills, understands how students _ particularly
seniors _ get carried away with prom details.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get pressured by the moment,'' said Sanchez, who vows to
never crash-diet again after having ``bad headaches'' after once
eating only salad for three consecutive days. She added, ``It comes
to pictures. Everyone wants to look their best for pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, some teens have freed themselves from some pre-prom
hoopla by outright rejecting all fashions in stores this spring and
having dresses tailor-made to fit their figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything (in stores) that's different. I want
something that stands out,'' said Jessica Chacon, a junior at
Canoga Park High. She envisions something elegant with an open
back.
</P>
<P>
   Saugus junior Cassie Carr is having a ``Cinderella''
floor-length dress made, she says, because she's more comfortable
not revealing her legs.
</P>
<P>
   And classmate Jessica Hott has designed her own light-pink,
floor- length fitted gown with spaghetti straps and thigh-high leg
slits, by pulling together elements from several dresses she saw in
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   There's no plunging back or necklines, Hott explains with the
disclaimer, ``Mine's a good-girl dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, many teens say they must buy less revealing prom
dresses that meet parents' approval, so squeezing into those
less-is-more dresses is not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bear and Shepherd-Look say parents can help alleviate more
pre- prom pressures by setting ``healthy boundaries'' in other
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bear recommends parents place reasonable restrictions on prom
night attire and spending budgets, establish curfews, and know
exactly how teens are being transported to and from their proms and
where they will be after the prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, parents have to help put this event in a realistic
perspective,'' explained Bear. ``It's not a wedding. They shouldn't
contribute to the notion that this will be the biggest event of
their child's life. It might seem like it at the time (to the
teen), but a month later it won't seem like as big of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd-Look agreed, adding, ``My advice to teens is, `Don't
sweat it. It's one night.'''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT MOUNTS ANTITRUST COUNTERATTACK
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. mounted a broadly based campaign
Tuesday to derail the government's effort to break up the company.
</P>
<P>
   On the legal front, Microsoft's next move will be to seek more
time to show the judge who tried the case that the desired
punishment does not fit the purported antitrust failings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a company spokesman, said Microsoft would seek to
subpoena the government's economic consultants to find out how the
Justice Department came up with its ``Draconian and overbearing''
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In political arena, Microsoft sought to persuade opinion makers
that the plan to divide the software giant into two companies, one
selling Windows and the other applications such as Office, would be
unpopular with consumers and economically unsound.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's two top leaders, chairman Bill Gates and chief
executive Steve Ballmer, railed against the breakup proposal filed
last Friday by the Justice Department and 17 states with U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to key customers, business partners and
shareholders, they said: ``We believe the government's extreme
regulations would be a major setback for consumers, the
high-technology industry and the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the lawsuit against Microsoft justifies the harsh
restrictions that the government is now seeking to place on
Microsoft's innovation and product design,'' they added.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer also appears in a 30-second TV commercial implicitly
criticizing the proposed corporate divorce and promising that, for
Microsoft, ``the best is yet to come.'' The ad is being widely
aired in the nation's top 50 media markets, mainly during
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's top lawyer, William Neukom, previewed the
counter-brief that Jackson will get on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson ruled April 3 that Microsoft maintained an
illegal monopoly that harmed consumers and competitors, Neukom
noted that ``the court did not find that Windows and Office became
popular because of any wrongful conduct by Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a court-ordered breakup of a unitary
operating company,'' he said. ``The evidence and law applicable to
this case fell far short of providing the basis for such a drastic
and unprecedented remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does not plan, at least at this stage, to offer a
counter-proposals of its own. There is no need to do so, the
company believes, since it expects Jackson's guilty verdict to be
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of factual and legal assertions in the
material ... that is going to require a good deal more thought,''
said C. Boyden Gray, counsel to the Association for Competitive
Technology, a Washington-based trade group that plans to file its
own pro-Microsoft brief with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that I find utterly mystifying,'' Gray
added, ``is what's happening in the browser market,'' which the
government once placed at the center of its antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gray noted that America Online Inc. recently announced plans to
drop Microsoft's Internet Explorer for its own 22 million customers
and substitute the Navigator browser, a product built by Netscape
Communications, which it acquired last year for $10 billion.
Jackson found that Netscape was a victim of Microsoft's illegal
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, in releasing a new trial version of its Windows Media
Player, Microsoft sent a signal that it does not intend to be cowed
by its legal woes.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fester, a Microsoft marketing executive, said the software,
which plugs directly into the operating system, offers enhanced
audio and video quality and customization features that ``open the
door to digital media for millions of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock, which had rebounded Monday after having
plummeted to a 17-month low, lost ground again on Tuesday. It
closed at $69.88, down $3.56, or 4.85 percent, on volume of
48,233,000 shares. The drop came after a Microsoft analyst at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said she thought the stock would trade
in the $60 range for the foreseeable future.

<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ The U.S. Marines have been storming
ashore this tranquil island for decades, hitting the beaches for
live-fire war games, with aircraft roaring overhead and huge ships
with massive guns looming just offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Marines may be coming again, but this time their
operation won't be make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   Their job will be to secure a perimeter around a U.S. Navy
bombing range located on the far eastern tip of this tiny island
just off Puerto Rico's east coast. Protestors have occupied the
range for the past year in an effort to end 60 years of U.S.
military presence on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The job of rounding up and arresting the demonstrators will fall
to U.S. Marshals, FBI agents and possibly other federal law
enforcement officers, according to press reports. Coast Guard and
Navy ships and the Marines will try to keep more protestors from
taking the place of those already arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday passed with no word of when the operation would take
place, although protesters braced for a showdown after press
reports indicated the action might come this week.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders warn that the operation could trigger
demonstrations on the main island of Puerto Rico, where most of the
political leadership and public sentiment are firmly in support of
the Vieques protestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any action to remove us will be the beginning, not the end of
the protests,'' said Ruben Berrios, head of the Puerto Rican
Independence Party, who has illegally camped on the bombing range
for the past year. ``If they arrest us, they can expect a million
people to protest because this issue has united Puerto Ricans of
all political persuasions as never before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders predict there will also be protests in New York and
New Jersey, where hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans live.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques seems an unlikely spot for a high-profile showdown. A
sleepy island about 20 miles long and 5 miles wide, it lies about 7
miles off the Puerto Rican coast. It is only about 15 miles from
Roosevelt Roads, a large U.S. Navy base where any eviction
operation might be based.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the island has enjoyed a tourism boom, with
several small guesthouses and hotels opening. The snorkeling and
diving are excellent, and there are miles of deserted beaches.
Narrow roads criss-cross the island's center, with cows and horses
grazing on the shoulders. There are no high-rise condominiums or
casinos, and most of the hotels lack televisions or telephones in
the rooms, catering to visitors seeking to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing range dates back to World War II, when the military
condemned two-thirds of the island's 33,000 acres. Farm workers and
landowners were moved off their plots on the east and west ends of
Vieques to the island's center, concentrated in the small villages
of Esperanza and Isabel Segunda. Today, about 9,000 people live on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy property on the two ends of the island is cut off from
the island's populated center by high metal fences that stretch
from the south coast to the north coast.
</P>
<P>
   There is little activity at the western tip of Vieques, which is
home to a naval munitions detachment. The larger, eastern end is
called ``Camp Garcia,'' and it takes up nearly half of Vieques, but
has only a small permanent contingent of Navy personnel and
civilian workers.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial bombing range is on the far eastern tip, about
9 miles from the nearest civilian home. The range is about two
square miles of rough hills, covered with thorn bushes and small
trees. It is dotted with old warplanes, tanks and military vehicles
used as targets by Navy pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The range is also dotted by the protest camps, with several
separate encampments run by a wide range of Puerto Rican groups _
teachers, ministers, labor unions, students and Berrios' political
party.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt roads wind through Camp Garcia to the bombing range, but
drivers must first pass through a gate protected by security
guards. The protestors reach the range by boat, hitching rides with
fishermen who support their cause and ferry out supplies on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the protest camps on the range, other protestors
have set up a permanent site directly in front of the main gate.
Any law enforcement action would have to clear both sites.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders at the main gate believe Puerto Rican police may
try to block the roads leading to the gate to stop more
demonstrators from coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that people might come to the roadblocks and
there might be some sort of confrontation,'' said Roberto Rabin,
one of the leaders of a coalition of protest groups. ``So we've
asked people to go the main plaza in Isabel Segunda if that happens
so they will have a place to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders have been preaching non-violent civil
disobedience for months, telling people that active resistance
would be futile and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But if the arrests happen, some believe other protestors will
rush to the range by boat, or try to cut the fence and reach the
bombing zone by land. The boats would presumably be turned back by
the Coast Guard and Navy vessels, while the fence might be
patrolled by Marines.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all the protestors are swiftly rounded up, leaders
say they won't suffer a complete defeat. They believe any
law-enforcement action will trigger new protests in San Juan and in
American cities with large Puerto Rican populations, and they hope
political pressure will keep away the Navy bombs as successfully as
the protest camps have done for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the protestors ``will be a great shock to the Puerto
Rican people,'' said Rev. Juan Franco, a United Church of Christ
minister who has protested on the range. ``This is happening in a
moment when there is a fast-growing sense of national identity in
Puerto Rico. The people feel very strongly about this, and this
would only make them feel that much stronger.''

all political persuasions as never before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders predict there will also be protests in New York and
New Jersey, where hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans live.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques seems an unlikely spot for a high-profile showdown. A
sleepy island about 20 miles long and 5 miles wide, it lies about 7
miles off the Puerto Rican coast. It is only about 15 miles from
Roosevelt Roads, a large U.S. Navy base where any eviction
operation might be based.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the island has enjoyed a tourism boom, with
several small guesthouses and hotels opening. The snorkeling and
diving are excellent, and there are miles of deserted beaches.
Narrow roads criss-cross the island's center, with cows and horses
grazing on the shoulders. There are no high-rise condominiums or
casinos, and most of the hotels lack televisions or telephones in
the rooms, catering to visitors seeking to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing range dates back to World War II, when the military
condemned two-thirds of the island's 33,000 acres. Farm workers and
landowners were moved off their plots on the east and west ends of
Vieques to the island's center, concentrated in the small villages
of Esperanza and Isabel Segunda. Today, about 9,000 people live on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy property on the two ends of the island is cut off from
the island's populated center by high metal fences that stretch
from the south coast to the north coast.
</P>
<P>
   There is little activity at the western tip of Vieques, which is
home to a naval munitions detachment. The larger, eastern end is
called ``Camp Garcia,'' and it takes up nearly half of Vieques, but
has only a small permanent contingent of Navy personnel and
civilian workers.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial bombing range is on the far eastern tip, about
9 miles from the nearest civilian home. The range is about two
square miles of rough hills, covered with thorn bushes and small
trees. It is dotted with old warplanes, tanks and military vehicles
used as targets by Navy pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The range is also dotted by the protest camps, with several
separate encampments run by a wide range of Puerto Rican groups _
teachers, ministers, labor unions, students and Berrios' political
party.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt roads wind through Camp Garcia to the bombing range, but
drivers must first pass through a gate protected by security
guards. The protestors reach the range by boat, hitching rides with
fishermen who support their cause and ferry out supplies on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the protest camps on the range, other protestors
have set up a permanent site directly in front of the main gate.
Any law enforcement action would have to clear both sites.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders at the main gate believe Puerto Rican police may
try to block the roads leading to the gate to stop more
demonstrators from coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that people might come to the roadblocks and
there might be some sort of confrontation,'' said Roberto Rabin,
one of the leaders of a coalition of protest groups. ``So we've
asked people to go the main plaza in Isabel Segunda if that happens
so they will have a place to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders have been preaching non-violent civil
disobedience for months, telling people that active resistance
would be futile and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But if the arrests happen, some believe other protestors will
rush to the range by boat, or try to cut the fence and reach the
bombing zone by land. The boats would presumably be turned back by
the Coast Guard and Navy vessels, while the fence might be
patrolled by Marines.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all the protestors are swiftly rounded up, leaders
say they won't suffer a complete defeat. They believe any
law-enforcement action will trigger new protests in San Juan and in
American cities with large Puerto Rican populations, and they hope
political pressure will keep away the Navy bombs as successfully as
the protest camps have done for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the protestors ``will be a great shock to the Puerto
Rican people,'' said Rev. Juan Franco, a United Church of Christ
minister who has protested on the range. ``This is happening in a
moment when there is a fast-growing sense of national identity in
Puerto Rico. The people feel very strongly about this, and this
would only make them feel that much stronger.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Crime fighting at the ywca
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore unveiled a comprehensive anti-crime package at a YWCA in
Atlanta today that includes $1.3 billion in spending for new police
officers and crime-fighting technologies. He proposed the federal
government provide funds to help local communities hire 50,000 new
police officers, a constitutional amendment guaranteeing victims'
rights in the criminal justice system, new anti-gang laws, and a
requirement that prisoners be free of drugs before being released
from prison. From Atlanta, Gore heads to Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   GUBERNATORIAL SHOOTOUT IN CAROLINA . . .
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen candidates vied in North Carolina today for the chance
to succeed retiring Gov. Jim Hunt, with Democrats sparring over
education programs and Republicans challenging each other's
conservative credentials. Hunt is barred by state law from seeking
another term. The two leading Democrats seeking his seat, Lt. Gov.
Dennis Wicker and state Attorney General Mike Easley, argued over
how best to strengthen education programs with money from a
not-yet-approved state lottery. The leading Republicans fought over
who was more conservative. Ex-Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot and
state Rep. Leo Daughtry criticized each other's conservative record
on spending and abortion, while debating whether to use attack ads.
Former state Rep. Chuck Neely avoided most of that fight.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND ANOTHER BACK HOME IN INDIANA
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh and a lawyer touring Indiana in a red school
bus battled for the nomination to challenge first-term Democratic
Gov. Frank O'Bannon, who has no opposition. Indianapolis attorney
John Price, who promised to visit all 92 counties in his red bus,
trailed McIntosh in recent polling. Conservative three-termer
McIntosh's decision to run for governor set off a scramble to
represent his east-central Indiana district, which includes Muncie.
Among the 11 candidates were former radio talk show host Mike Pence
and Republican state Rep. Jeff Linder.
</P>
<P>
   START WITH THE LITTLE GUYS, WORK UP
</P>
<P>
   Smaller states would vote first and others would follow
according to their size in a primary-election plan proposed today
by a Republican advisory group chaired by ex-Sen. Bill Brock of
Tennessee. The plan is aiming for more voter participation in
different states. Brock said a primary process that lengthens the
decision period while reducing the influence of money would be
healthy. The current system is driving the nominating process
toward a national primary day somewhat like Super Tuesday this year
when all states crowd up to a deadline. Under the plan unveiled
today, smallest states would vote on the first Tuesday in March,
with three more groups voting on the first Tuesdays of subsequent
months, ending in June.
</P>
<P>
   PLATFORM PROTECTION FROM THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush put a staunch abortion foe, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, in charge of the platform committee for the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia. The appointment suggests the
party is unlikely to step away from its blanket opposition to
abortion, a stance that prompted dissension from GOP moderates
before the 1996 convention in San Diego. Bush opposes abortion
except for in cases of rape, incest or when the life of a mother is
endangered. The platform has no such exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   THREAT COMING FROM THE RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   A day after a former congressman from Westchester County, Joseph
DioGuardi, announced he would seek the Conservative Party
endorsement to run for the Senate in New York, Rudy Giuliani
declared that he, too, wanted the party's endorsement. So
Giuliani's aides sought for the first time to set up a meeting. The
prospect of a credible conservative candidate in the race is a
matter of clear concern to Giuliani's aides, since DioGuardi,
running on the right, presumably would draw votes away from
Giuliani to the advantage of Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE HORSERACE _ WITH BUSH BY A NOSE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore are locked in a close race for
president: 49 percent for Bush, 44 percent for Gore, in a new
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. The five-point difference is within the
poll's 5 percentage point margin of error for the 499 likely voters
surveyed. Among registered voters, Bush led 46-45 percent. In this
same poll three weeks ago, Bush led 50-41 percent among likely
voters. In a four-way matchup with third-party candidates Pat
Buchanan and Ralph Nader, Bush had 47 percent and Gore 41 percent
among likely voters. Buchanan and Nader split the remainder about
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKY FOOTING IN SOME KEY STATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is performing worse than expected in some states carried
by Democrats since 1988, a sign that his political base needs
shoring up in the race for the 270 electoral votes required to win
the White House. In Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and
Wisconsin _ all carried by Democratic presidential candidates in
the last three elections _ the most recent polling showed Gore
trailing or tied with George W. Bush. ``This is obviously troubling
for Gore. Those are states he should have in his pocket right
now,'' said Democratic consultant Dane Strother.
</P>
<P>
   LOG CABIN TO HEAR FROM THEIR CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will address leaders and top donors of the Log Cabin
Republicans, the leading gay Republican organization, at the
group's annual meeting May 17-20 in Washington. ABC reports that
the group expects 50 of the Log Cabin's leaders and top donors, to
attend. Several GOP members of Congress, including backers of
George W. Bush, also will address the gathering. Bush met recently
with a group of gay Republicans, but froze out Log Cabin leaders,
who supported McCain in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN THAT REALLY COUNTS
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his campaign plane touched down at Laredo
International Airport in Texas last week, George W. Bush waved
grandly to his left and his right as he walked down the steps to
the tarmac. No one waved back. The only people watching were
campaign staffers, a handful of television camera operators and
security officers. Most of the people Bush waved to _ including the
TV crews _ had been with him on the plane from Austin. The Dallas
Morning News noted that similar scenes have played out several
times lately. Bush has been chatty with reporters, but he met few
everyday people during his last campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   OPEN LETTER INSTEAD OF PLATFORM FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Forgoing a platform fight, Pat Buchanan has agreed to make his
case against abortion through an ``open letter'' should he become
the Reform Party presidential nominee, said party chairman Pat
Choate. The letter would affirm Buchanan's positions on such social
issues as abortion and gay rights while leaving untouched the
paty's platform, which concentrates on trade, immigration and
foreign policy. The party, in turn, acted to quell a rebellion in
some state affiliates that have been hostile to Buchanan's
candidacy by threatening to withhold their credentials at the
national convention. ``We're just telling people that if they play
games, their delegations will not be recognized,'' Choate said.
</P>
<P>
   HIM? OH, JUST AN OLD FRIEND
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush can only hope his meeting next week with John
McCain goes as well as McCain's meeting with Al Gore. McCain met
Sunday for 20 minutes with Gore at the Naval Observatory in
Washington, the vice president's official residence. Both were
appearing on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' being filmed there. When Gore
learned that McCain would be under his roof the next day, he called
him and invited him to come over early for a private chat. ``We're
friends,'' Gore told reporters later, noting that the two had
served in the House and Senate together. ``It's not that
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   PROBABLY DIDN'T DISCUSS THE CORVAIR, EITHER
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader
discussed an endorsement with leaders of the United Auto Workers
union, which broke with the AFL-CIO last October. Nader said he
didn't directly ask for the union's backing, and added that it will
not endorse a candidate until after a congressional vote expected
this month on providing permanent normal trade relations with China
_ which Nader, the UAW and other major labor unions oppose. Instead
of asking for endorsements, Nader said: ``I just tell people what
we're doing.'' Union officials were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVE COALITION THROWING WEIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six national conservative organizations have formed a
coalition to lobby at the national party conventions for the
adoption of conservative platform planks. The group is led by the
American Conservative Union Foundation and includes Americans for
Tax Reform, Christian Coalition, Citizens Against Government Waste,
Competitive Enterprise Institute, Independent Women's Forum,
National Rifle Association, National Right to Life PAC, National
Taxpayers Union and the Southeastern Legal Foundation. ``We have
been quite successful in the past,'' said Donald Devine, chairman
of the Committee for a Conservative Platform, ``primarily at
Republican conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   SOMETIMES, YOU JUST GET TIRED OF GIVING
</P>
<P>
   Soft-money donations to the political parties are on a pace to
set a record this year, but more and more large corporations have
quietly stopped giving them. In some cases, senior executives say
they want to distance themselves from what they describe as the
capital's unseemly culture of cash and influence, while others
acknowledge that their companies are simply not getting a bang for
the buck. Thirty-one corporations that in each previous election
cycle since 1993-94 contributed at least $100,000 in soft money
have not donated any soft money this time around, according to a
computerized study of Federal Election Commission records by the
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAY'S NOT THE THING THIS TIME
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning her husband by name, Donna Hanover, actress
wife of Rudy Giuliani, said she's postponing her performance in the
sexually suggestive off-Broadway play ``The Vagina Monologues'' due
to family circumstances. Giuliani, who is running for the Senate
against Hillary Clinton, has early-stage prostate cancer. Hanover
was scheduled to appear May 30 through June 11 with Kirstie Alley
and Hazelle Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN AIN'T REALLY TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Austin, the Texas capital, hasn't exactly rolled out the welcome
mat for George W. Bush and his presidential campaign, favorite son
or not. The Washington Post reports there's a cultural divide there
between the city's bohemians and new residents from the Bush team.
And the Bush people themselves don't dispute their
fish-out-of-water status. ``I can't say (Bush) is a favorite son of
Austin,'' campaign aide Joe Allbaugh admits. Says state Rep. Glen
Maxey, a Democrat: ``He's sort of like a temporary resident in this
government-funded house. I think by and large most of the people
who think of Austin wouldn't say this is a George Bush kind of
town.''
</P>
<P>
   PRIME TIME FOR TV AD BUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Television stations are scarfing up money under the deluge of
election-year advertising. Between candidates and lobbying groups,
political spots have become a $600 million windfall for TV, edging
out fast food as the third-highest sector in airtime consumption,
according to the Washington Post. Consequently, broadcasters aren't
leading the charge for campaign finance reform and the free TV air
time it could bring. ``The industry has a sweetheart deal and is
not interested in making any moves to open the door to make it work
better,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
nonprofit group working for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   WE'D RATHER SEE DAVE THOMAS FOR WENDY'S
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has a well-deserved reputation for particularly
nasty political campaigns. But that could change. A newly passed
state law aimed at reducing negative campaigning stipulates that
any candidate who mentions an opponent in a radio or television
spot must personally appear in the ad. Advocates of the law say
it'll force politicians to tone down their attacks and help restore
a more polite political atmosphere. North Carolina is the first
state to enact such a measure, according to National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   NOT IN SHAPE TO RUN
</P>
<P>
   Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin seemed to reject the idea
of being a possible running mate for Al Gore, calling it ``a
curious notion.'' Rubin said that while he has been around politics
for many years, including a stint as a Democratic fund-raiser, he
viewed running for and serving in office as a special field,
``something unto itself.'' Rubin suggested that it was unwise to
choose a nominee who has not been tested by other campaigns. ``You
don't want somebody in a presidential campaign, which is the
ultimate of political experience in this country, who hasn't been
tested by running before.''
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH'S ENOUGH FOR BABBIT
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable speculation in Arizona that once
Bruce Babbit finished his tour as secretary of the interior, he
would return to the state to run for governor, a job he held from
1978 to 1986. But Babbitt says he has other plans. He told the
Arizona Republic that he would return to Arizona, but not to run
for governor. He didn't say what he planned to do, but he made it
clear that he was tired of Washington's ``witch-hunting
mentality,'' referring to the 19- month investigation into his
handling of permits for Indian reservation casinos.
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE GUY EYES BIG RUN
</P>
<P>
   Former child actor Gary Coleman is entering politics, saying he
intends to seek a California Senate seat. The 4-ft.-8 ex-star of
television's ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' now 32, told the Fox News
Channel that he has yet to decide upon his party affiliation, but
``I'm such a radical . . . I might have to run independent.'' He
said he selected California over New York to run because ``New York
is just too far'' and he didn't wish to be compared to Hillary
Clinton, ``representing a state I don't know anything about.''
Coleman has worked most recently as a security agent.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The warmest spell in the Northern states so far this year will
spread from the northern Plains into most of the East in the next
few days. Meanwhile, a slow-moving disturbance will produce
recurrent heavy rain as it drifts into the lower Mississippi
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A persistent flow of moisture from the western Gulf of Mexico
will set the stage for local flooding over parts of eastern Texas
and western Louisiana. Rainfalls up to 3 inches in a few hours will
occur in areas where weak winds aloft favor sluggish thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air will spread north into the Ohio Valley. Thundershowers
will move east across the region Wednesday night. After a chilly
dawn, ample sun will promote mild conditions over most of the
Northeast. Onshore breezes will keep the coast cool. In the West, a
cool front with showers will reach the northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DECEIVING AVERAGES
</P>
<P>
   While monthly averages are an important tool for climatological
comparisons, they can mask significant weather variations. The
average temperature last month in North Platte, Neb., was only 0.2
degree below normal. But, most days were unusually warm and most
nights were uncommonly chilly. Daytime highs averaged 3.2 degrees
above normal while nights were 3.7 degrees cooler than average.
Frequent sunny days and clear nights led to many instances with
exceptionally large diurnal temperature ranges.

<P>
   &QL; 
When he was 4, Russell Malone received a plastic four-string
guitar. It was a gift that put him on a career path.
</P>
<P>
   Now a well-known jazz guitarist with an elegant, blues-tinged
tone, Malone played for several years with jazz singer/pianist
Diana Krall before leaving to promote his solo albums.
</P>
<P>
   Malone recalls the years spent with the Grammy Award-winning
Krall as slightly frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to feel like I was being typecast,'' he said.
``There's more to my playing than what was heard in that setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's just-issued fifth and latest album, ``Look Who's Here''
(Verve), includes three originals along with interpretations of
tunes by Burt Bacharach/Hal David (``Alfie''), Cole Porter (``Get
Out of Town''), Stevie Wonder (``You Will Know'') and Neal Hefti's
theme from ``The Odd Couple.'' The disc was produced by Verve Music
Group Chairman Tommy LiPuma, who also oversaw Malone's
well-received previous effort, 1998's ``Sweet Georgia Peach''
(Impulse!).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other instruments such as piano and saxophone, the
guitar's role in jazz has yet to be fully defined. While legends
like Wes Montgomery and Charlie Christian laid the ground rules,
much of the guitar's potential is still evolving in the hands of
modern-day six-string explorers like Malone, Bill Frisell and Pat
Metheny.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's straight-ahead style is steeped in jazz tradition but
also infused with a soulfulness that hints at his background in
r&AMP;b, country and pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love jazz, but I'm not narrow,'' Malone, 36, said from his
home in New York. ``I like many different styles of music. I'm not
worried about living up to someone else's idea of the perfect jazz
guitarist or what's considered to be cutting-edge. I'm committed to
being the best musician I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone started studying the guitar after seeing B.B. King
perform ``How Blue Can You Get'' on TV as he was growing up in
Georgia. That led him to discover George Benson, Montgomery and
country players like Chet Atkins and Johnny Cash, who were
influences along with the church spirituals he heard in his
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking into live performance with soul-jazz organist Jimmy
Smith in 1988, Malone joined up with Harry Connick Jr., playing
with the singer's orchestra from 1990 to 1994. Recording sessions
with Branford Marsalis, Benny Green and Roy Hargrove followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Jimmy (Smith) was a great experience,'' Malone
recalled. ``That's a guy who doesn't tell you what to do on stage.
He just leaves room for you to solo. That's how I approach my own
band members.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's new disc is his first to feature his touring band of
the past two years _ Anthony Wonsey (piano), Richie Goods (bass)
and Byron Landham (drums).
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy playing with those guys,'' Malone said. ``It
makes a big difference recording with the guys you've been touring
with. You play music together, you eat together, you hang out. It
makes for a very comfortable recording experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone cut his self-titled debut album in 1992 for Columbia
while playing with Connick. His second effort, ``Black Butterfly,''
came the following year. Two years later, he released ``Wholly
Cats'' on Japan's Venus label.
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing his solo career, Malone hit the road with Krall,
playing in both duet and band settings with the popular
singer-pianist. Malone ended that gig last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Diana was good for me, but I also contributed a
lot to her music,'' the guitarist said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's ``Look Who's Here'' opens with two upbeat originals:
the funky ``The Angle'' and the swinging title track which he
describes as ``a fun tune for the whole band to blow on.'' Then,
the album settles in for a gorgeous reading of ``Alfie.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone says he's loved the famous Bacharach/David movie theme
``ever since I was a kid. I love the melody and the changes are
great to play on. The song itself is so well-constructed that you
don't even need to solo on it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Hefti's ``Odd Couple,'' Malone unleashes melodic as well as
angular lines. The album's third original is ``Soulful Kisses,'' a
catchy tune that melds classic soul sensibilities with gutbucket
blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play this in a live setting, we get a great
response,'' Malone says, describing the tune as ``downhome and
funky.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his personal favorite, Malone chooses Porter's ``Get Out
of Town,'' which starts with a groove that wouldn't be out of place
in a spaghetti western.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took chances with this song,'' he explained. ``We threw
caution to the wind. I stretched out and showed another side to my
playing that hasn't been heard on my own recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone also covers the Wonder standard ``You Will Know'' and
ends the album with a rare vocal performance on Irving Berlin's
``Be Careful, It's My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he heard Frank Sinatra do the tune, but it wasn't
until Lorraine Gordon, owner of New York's Village Vanguard, gave
him a tape of a Cuban vocalist singing it that he considered coming
up with his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like going to the Vanguard and talking about tunes with
Lorraine because we both love good songs,'' Malone said. ``So I
called her one day and sang my version to her. She said, `You've
got to record that.' Now, I don't think of myself as a singer, but
I respect singers and I love lyrics and melody.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's current disc was cut in just two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so easy to make,'' he said. ``I like being prepared
before going into the studio. Because as a band we were so
well-oiled, we just went in and hit.'' &QL;

TREASURIES MIXED AS INVESTORS FAVOR SHORTER-TERM MATURITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of U.S. Treasury securities were mixed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries with shorter maturities were higher as investors
moved money out of stocks, which were declining, for the favorable
return on interest-bearing instruments. The price of longer-term
Treasuries was lower, however, amid concern that the Federal
Reserve would move to raise interest rates, driving bond prices
lower.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 15/32,
to a price of 103 6/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, increased to 6.02 percent from 5.99
percent on Monday, exceeding 6 percent for the first time in six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed feelings about the Fed's next move have created some
consternation in the bond markets, said Michael P. Maurer, a
fixed-income strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ``Strong economic
data forced the reassessment of conventional market wisdom last
week as the consensus for the fed funds target rate became less
certain.'' He said market participants were divided between
expectations of a quarter-percentage-point increase and a steeper
rise of half a percent. Until recently, it had seemed fairly
certain that the central bank would continue its pattern of gradual
rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
is among those who say that many market participants expect a
half-point tightening at the May 16 meeting of the Federal
Reserve's policy-setting committee, as economic growth led by
strong consumer spending continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed seems poised to move aggressively in its pre-emptive
strikes against inflationary forces,'' he said. ``Simply put, the
risk of economic momentum being sharply curtailed by an aggressive
move to a less accommodative posture is considerably less at this
juncture than the risk of having an undesirable inflationary bulge
result from a somewhat sluggish monetary policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer of A.G. Edwards said, ``There are several major
announcements due this week, which could shake up the markets.''
The data include the Treasury's quarterly refunding on Wednesday,
first-quarter productivity and cost figures on Thursday, and April
employment figures on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payrolls
to rise 350,000 and for the unemployment rate to drop to 4 percent.

 &HT;    Decorator house mirrors Atlanta's changing tastes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, May 4.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you think a decorator show house is simply a place
for the have-nots to drool _ or in some cases, gasp _ take a closer
look at the Atlanta Symphony Associates' 30th rendition.
</P>
<P>
   This show house is a study in old and new: A 1930s house
updated, then expanded with 21st-century amenities. A woody estate
enhanced by outdoor rooms and young gardens. A blue-blooded
neighborhood integrated with young nouveaux riches. A designer cast
of 32 veterans mixed with rising new talent.
</P>
<P>
   The metro area's most popular show house, open now through May
21 in Buckhead's prestigious Tuxedo Park, is unique in that it
features an addition that more than doubles the home's size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real unusual for us to do this much of a renovation,''
said Liz Troy, event chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you won't find the dramatic color palette of past show
houses but an emphasis on warm neutrals, even monochromatic in some
rooms. The surprise is that the 24 rooms flow together as if
organizers planned it.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps reflecting Atlanta's changing tastes, there's a
greater mix of traditional and contemporary furnishings _ fine
antiques paired with funky artwork, rustic natural materials
complemented by sleek metal and glass.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the event, which last year raised $300,000 for the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, is chock-full of design ideas, and many
of the furnishings and accessories are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But as you meander through the house, don't become so consumed
by the details that you miss the Woodlands, as the owners have
named the setting. The event offers a rare opportunity to take in
one of development-crazed Buckhead's rapidly disappearing spots.
Its tranquil spring and pond nestled in a wooded valley will make
you think you're in the Georgia mountains, not in north Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy it while it's there.
</P>
<P>
   The history
</P>
<P>
   Woodlands was built in 1932 as a brick and shingle-sided New
England Colonial-style house. It was designed by Atlanta architects
Charles Frazier and Daniel Bodin for Robert Pegram, vice president
of Southern Railway System, and his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   The house was later sold to Charles and Helen Jagels and finally
to Ray and Sara Moore, who developed its extensive gardens while
maintaining the pristine surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents cherished the property so much that three
years ago when it was sold to a developer and divided into three
lots, they raised the money to purchase the corner parcel. The lot
was placed in a public trust, which protects it from development.
Peter Lloyd and Gene Lashley bought the lot with the house and
began renovations. The third parcel behind it remains for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The owners
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as the Symphony Associates scouted sites for this
year's show house, Woodlands was back on the market. ``We were
looking at the house as is,'' event co-chairwoman Suzy Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nashville transplants Robert and Jill Crowder have
agreed to buy the house but delayed moving in to allow the show to
go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unusual for us to work with two sets of owners on
a show house,'' Smith said _ let alone one undergoing such
extensive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Design Associates designed and built a new kitchen and
master suite, expanding the house from 3,500 to 8,000 square feet.
Robert Crowder, an apartment developer, and his wife, Jill, have
had input in the additions through Atlanta interior designers
Essary &AMP; Murphy, which will redecorate the house for the owners
after the event.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation
</P>
<P>
   Bill Harrison, whose Atlanta architectural firm designed the
1998 Neiman Marcus/Southern Accents Holiday House, has taken the
house from casual Cape Cod to a more formal English manor style.
Oversize handmade brown brick, a slate roof and a limestone portico
give the structure a new facade. On one side is the new master
suite; on the other is a two-story kitchen and media room.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison shifted the entrance to the right to make the design
more symmetrical. A new entry and library took the place of the old
dining room, and a stair hall and powder room now stand in the old
foyer. Though the changes allow visitors to see from one end of the
house to the other, the large number of both old and new rooms
almost creates a mazelike flow.
</P>
<P>
   Small windows were replaced with French doors, which help
brighten the dark house and blend it with the new expansive
additions and beyond. New outdoor spaces include a motor court
garden, a stacked-stone cabana and a cantilevered terrace with a
pool featuring a vanishing-edge waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   The designers
</P>
<P>
   The 32 interior and landscape designers were selected by
inviting both previous participants and new referrals to an open
house. Designers then applied to decorate a room. A review
committee looked at portfolios, and those with show house
experience were given priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want high-profile designers involved because they produce
the things people talk about,'' Smith said, citing Dilger Gibson's
moss-covered bed in 1998 as an example.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new talent is sought to keep the event fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The only room not assigned is the kitchen, which because of the
expense of outfitting, is handled through bids between owner and
designer.
</P>
<P>
   The designers, who must submit plans to the committee for
approval, can do nothing to the walls or ceilings that can't be
undone. Floors cannot be changed or painted.
</P>
<P>
   And while participants sometimes know a little about what their
neighbor is planning, there's no coordination among the spaces.
``That's why it's really interesting how well the colors seem to
flow together from room to room this year,'' said Vicki Gillis of
Diane Johnson &AMP; Associates Interior Design, which designed the
foyer and entry hall.
</P>
<P>
   The decor
</P>
<P>
   There are two stories here _ neutral tones and a mix of
traditional and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Warm earth colors extend from the limestone kitchen to the
creamy master suite. Look for an emphasis on off-white, tan, taupe
and sage throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   The master bedroom features cream-on-cream tones and softly
patterned fabrics that complement the focal point _ a wide view of
the woodlands valley. ``The owner loves creams and taupes and
neutrals, and we wanted to create a really sexy, seductive look,''
said Bill Murphy, who designed the space with Jim Essary.
</P>
<P>
   Interiors also are more eclectic than in the past. The house is
still traditional, reflecting Atlanta tastes, but furnishings and
artwork are more contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of money in Atlanta being young, I think you'll see
a lot of the designs aimed at young professionals,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In the guest suite, done in soft monochromatic taupes and golds,
Pineapple House Interior Design plays classic European antiques
against pieces with glass and steel. A contemporary painting hangs
above a 19th-century French commode. ``I think that's what makes
things interesting,'' designer Michelle Doughtie said, ``a touch of
the old with the new.''
</P>
<P>
   ENCORES
</P>
<P>
   Scenes that leave you wanting more
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Guests will never leave: The guest suite, with its sitting
area, should please any weekend company. Pineapple House Interior
Design uses a pedimented, hand-rubbed Grecian relief, salvaged from
a New Hampshire opera house, to create a dramatic bed headboard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Can't beat clean livin': Tranquillity reigns in the sun room,
where Guyton Design Group, displaying amazing restraint, makes the
garden view the focal point. A pair of Louis XV lounge chairs, an
ottoman and a library table are the main furnishings in this
inviting space, done in tones of white with black accents. Don't
miss the ceiling, washed in a brushed sage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Why leave your room? Designers Stanley Ellis and David Erhardt
of ellis/erhardt have combined so many warm, inviting textures in
the master sitting room you want to curl up by a fire with a good
book. The eclectic room includes an acrylic tea table as well as
polished Biedermeier pieces and velvet upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A real closet case: Imagine having a convenient place to store
your luggage, let alone open a suitcase. Closets &AMP; More and Expo
Design Center give the gentleman of the house just that in the
master closet, which contains dresser and countertops wide enough
to pack for the next business trip.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At your (bare) feet: The things they do with tile these days
never seem to end. Check out the mosaic tile ``rug'' in the
poolside cabana, by Kelly Sparra Interior Design.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Party of Five' ends six-year run on Fox
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Party's'' over.
</P>
<P>
   After tonight, the Salingers of ``Party of Five'' will never
again take arms against another crisis, furrow another brow, fall
in love or bed or both. Fox sends them off after six years in a
two-hour finale that has more thorough closure than a chastity
belt.
</P>
<P>
   Who killed ``Party of Five''? It was more or less mutual between
Fox and the fans. Ratings had evaporated this season, down a
whopping 40 percent from last. Neve Campbell was eyeing her movie
career, and Jennifer Love Hewitt, who joined in Season 2 and became
the biggest name in the cast, was spun off to her own series,
``Time of Your Life.'' (It tanked earlier this season, but will be
back in the summer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Party'' had won its awards (Golden Globe, Humanitas), built
(and lost most of) its buzz, and it was time to move on. So move on
the Salingers do tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The show combines lots of clips from past seasons (the only time
Hewitt appears) and a regular episode. Claudia (Lacey Chabert) is
itching to go off to Juilliard. Bailey (Scott Wolf) wants to head
to business school in Pennsylvania. Julia (Campbell) has an
internship waiting with the National Organization for Women. That
leaves Charlie (Matthew Fox) stuck with raising little Owen, and
none too tickled about it.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Salingers rise above their tensions and do what's right
for the family one last time? What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   When ``Party of Five'' debuted in 1994, it attracted a small,
loyal audience that grew. Although its core was mostly young
females, some middle-aged moms found it a safe haven to watch with
their daughters, as the five Salinger kids, orphaned when their
parents were killed in a wreck, negotiated a world that teetered
between reality and ``it's only television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Party'' probably peaked in popularity sometime in Season 3.
That was when Bailey's alcoholism became a long-running story line.
In Season 4, Charlie was diagnosed with cancer, and Internet fans
began complaining that the series had gotten too dark. Then in
Season 5, Julia not only got an abusive boyfriend, Ned, but stayed
with him far too long for some viewers' tastes. Rosie O'Donnell
took to ranting about Julia getting away from this guy, and while
there's the theory that there's no such thing as bad publicity,
there was also a feeling that ``Party of Five'' was trying the
patience of many of its fans.
</P>
<P>
   If you are, or were, a fan, don't worry about going back to
those dark places tonight. The finale doesn't throw any nasty
curves, just piles on the bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party of Five''
</P>
<P>
   8 tonight on Fox.

appliance and electronics retailer, said Tuesday it has ceased
operations and closed all stores and distribution centers in Ohio
and Georgia. ``The inability to reach credit terms with our major
vendors resulted in our inability to provide merchandise for our
customers,'' said CEO Melvin Baskin. The move puts 1,300 employees
in Ohio and Georgia out of work and puts a serious dent in local
newspaper and television advertising budgets and tax receipts.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ At precisely 10 a.m. on Tuesday, air-raid sirens
sounded throughout Israel and the country froze in its tracks for
two minutes to remember the victims of the Holocaust. Drivers stood
at attention beside their cars, shopkeepers stepped onto the
sidewalk and pedestrians halted in mid-stride, their heads bowed or
defiantly upright.
</P>
<P>
   But this did not happen in Mea Shearim or other strictly
Orthodox neighborhoods. In Mea Shearim, as if the call of the siren
were a car alarm, religious Jews in black frock coats and black
felt hats did not pause, or interrupt conversations, or stop their
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does this thing of the siren come from?'' said Shai, a
young Hasidic Jew with long strawberry-blond side curls, who would
not give his last name. ``It's someone else's custom _ the English,
the goyim,'' or non-Jews. ``What we as Jews do is recite religious
texts. And not just today, but every day. To stand silent, like
goyim, is to insult the name of those burned to death for their
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman out shopping, dressed in a long skirt, her head covered
with a tight scarf, agreed. ``God thinks it's a goyish holiday,''
she said of Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is a somber national
holiday in Israel, when restaurants, theaters and nightclubs shut
down and schools, radio and television stations devote themselves
to Holocaust education. ``They have their customs,'' she said,
nodding toward secular Israel in general. ``We have God.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Israelis, the shunning of Holocaust Day by
ultra-Orthodox Jews rubs extra salt in the wounds of a divided
society. The haredim _ the word means those who tremble before God
_ also do not observe Israel's Independence Day or its Memorial
Day. But many Israelis consider the Day of the Shoah, as it is
known here, to be the one time when the Jews of Israel should stand
_ literally _ together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The haredim have set up parallel institutions for
everything,'' said Efraim Zuroff, a Holocaust historian, a modern
Orthodox Jew and the local director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
``But one would have hoped that the Holocaust would be the one
exception. What did the Holocaust teach us, if not that Jewish
unity was essential?''
</P>
<P>
   The matter is actually a complex internal Jewish dispute, not
only about the way that the Holocaust should be remembered but
about Holocaust history itself. In the haredi world, a string of
new books, films and museum projects are sketching out an
alternative to the official account of the Holocaust that is taught
in Israeli schools and featured at Yad Vashem, the national
Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   That mainstream account, by their reckoning, over-emphasizes the
physical heroism and martyrdom of nonreligious Jews who resisted
the Nazis. It glorifies the fighters, they say, just as Zionists in
Israel exalt the soldiers of the national army in which most
haredim, who believe they serve the country by keeping strictly
observed Jewish traditions alive, do not serve.
</P>
<P>
   The date for Holocaust Remembrance Day, in fact, was fixed by
Israel to commemorate the Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943, in which
the underground Jewish Combat Organization led Polish Jews in a
four-week revolt against their deportation to Nazi concentration
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we give more importance to the physical fighters?''
said Rabbi Menachem Mendel Taub, a Holocaust survivor who is known
as the rebbe of Kaliv, for the Hungarian city whose Hasidic Jewish
community he and five generations of ancestors led. ``What about
the rabbis and yeshiva students who clung to the religious
commandments until the end? Did they not defend the soul of the
Jewish people? Are they not as important to Israel today as F-16s
and A-bombs?''
</P>
<P>
   More pointedly, in a haredi weekly, Moshe Gorelick, an article
called ``Even in Israel They Deny the Holocaust'' said that the
official Holocaust Day explicitly disdains those who ``kept their
godly souls until the last minute'' as ``going like lambs to the
slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is well known here that many haredim avoid Yad Vashem, which
almost every other Israeli visits regularly as schoolchild and
soldier. Most often, they cite religious objections to the nude
photographs of skeletal Holocaust victims. A deputy mayor of
Jerusalem, an ultra-Orthodox Jew, created a stir several years ago
when he threatened to cut off funds to Yad Vashem if the
``immodest'' pictures were not taken down.
</P>
<P>
   But ultra-Orthodox rabbis say that the real problem is
ideological. The museum, they say, does not sufficiently pay
tribute to ``religious martyrs,'' among them rabbis who had visas
that would have allowed them to emigrate but stayed in Europe to
lead _ and die with _ their followers.
</P>
<P>
   Taub is one who is working to append the official history. He
has published two volumes of a Holocaust encyclopedia filled with
the stories of Jews who observed Jewish law against all odds in the
ghettos and the concentration camps. And he is raising money to
build an alternative Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, for which the
cornerstone has already been laid. Another museum project, by a
separate organization, is also under way in Bnei Brak.
</P>
<P>
   After the Holocaust Remembrance ceremonies began on Monday
night, the rabbi was interviewed in Bnei Brak, a religious
community near Tel Aviv, through his personal secretary. Taub, who
is the seventh-generation rabbinical leader of Kaliv, does not take
questions from women; his secretary posed the questions. His
assistants placed a large picture frame between the rabbi and a
female reporter so that his view would be blocked. He talked to the
ceiling, alternating English from his 17 years in the United States
with Hebrew and Yiddish. At the end, he offered a blessing, both
verbally and in the form of a small plastic pouch containing a
10-agorot coin, worth a few pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody is in jail for dozens of years, he promises to
himself that when he is released, he will do good things,'' the
rabbi said. ``Usually his good intentions fade. I promised myself
the day that I survived the Shoah, that I would think about this
day and night. What does a single day, Holocaust Day, mean?''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   To Holocaust survivors and to many of the participants in the
official ceremonies, it means a great deal. About 230,000 Israelis
once lived under Nazi rule, according to Israeli statistics
released on Tuesday, and the population of survivors is dwindling.
Some 20,000 have died since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak and other government officials took
part in an annual tradition on Tuesday, reading, with breaking
voices, the names of Jews killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, a haredi newspaper, Hamodia, said
``God-fearing'' Jews still use ``these same names, in the same
books, in the same customs, and in the same tradition that the
opinion-makers in Israel would wish to put in a museum.'' Some
religious Jews believe that they themselves are recreating the
European Jewish village life that was wiped out during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Zuroff, author of a new book, ``The Response of Orthodox Jewry
in the United States to the Holocaust'' (Yeshiva University Press),
said he thinks that the haredim have a hard time dealing with
Holocaust history.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that the Holocaust happened is difficult for them,
he said, as are some of the mistakes made by their leaders. Some
Hasidic rabbis, for instance, ordered their followers to stay in
Europe and not to flee, he said. And while some rabbis perished
with their communities, others fled themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But ultra-Orthodox leaders disagree, and, in the streets of Mea
Shearim Tuesday morning, it came down to something more basic:
Holocaust Day is a secular event, dictated by the secular
authorities of Israel. And the haredim obey what they consider to
be the higher authority of the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust Day falls during the Hebrew month of Nissan, a month
of celebration, when strictly Orthodox Jews are barred from public
expressions of mourning. Modern Orthodox Jews believe that it is
literal-minded to think the ban should apply to Holocaust Day.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly observant Jews, however, say that Judaism marks tragic
events in the life of Jewish people on Tisha B'Av, a day of fasting
and mourning that commemorates the destruction of the First Temple
in 586 B.C. and the Second Temple in the year 70. Other Jews, they
say, have allowed the Holocaust to dominate their worldview.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Jewish history does not begin and end with the
Holocaust,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, a haredi spokesman.

&HT;     GOP PRIMARY PROPOSAL WOULD PUT SMALLER STATES AHEAD OF
CALIFORNIA, N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican task force on Tuesday recommended a
four-tiered primary balloting schedule that would put small states
first, and push giants such as California and New York to the back
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP commission headed by former Sen. William Brock of
Tennessee was assembled by Republican National Committee Chairman
Jim Nicholson last July to figure what to do about
``front-loading,'' the process in which states clamor for attention
from presidential candidates by scheduling their primaries earlier
and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This year, California and New York moved their primaries from
their historic positions late in the political calendar to March 7
_ Super Tuesday _ in an effort to get more attention from
candidates. The two states send a total of 263 delegates to the GOP
convention, nearly a quarter of the delegates needed to win the
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in favoring smaller states accelerated this year when
both parties' winners emerged by early March, before half the
states had held primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   To address this perceived imbalance, Brock unveiled the Delaware
Plan, named for its originator, Delaware GOP Chairman Basil
Battaglia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, states would be grouped in four tiers
according to population. The most populous _ California, New York
and Texas among them _ would go into the fourth tier of states that
are barred from holding their primaries any earlier than the first
week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller states such as Delaware, New Hampshire and North Dakota
would have the first crack, holding their primaries the first week
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The next tier would go no sooner than the first week of April.
This bloc would include states such as Arkansas, Iowa, South
Carolina and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The third tier would hold primaries no sooner than the first
week of May. This group includes Arizona, Missouri, Washington and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The final tier of large states also includes Florida, Michigan,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats last week considered a similar plan and rejected
it, according to a statement from the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats had serious reservations about the lack of diversity
in the small states that would go first'' in the Delaware Plan, DNC
Rules and Bylaws co-chairman Jim Roosevelt said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   New York and California were reliable supporters of President
Clinton in the last two presidential elections and Democrats are
not anxious to anger the party faithful in those states.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Plan is to be reviewed by the GOP's rules committee
in Indianapolis next week. If approved, the entire Republican
National Committee would vote on the plan at the party's convention
in Philadelphia in August.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, Brock told a news conference here, is to restore
smaller states and their Main Street politics to their leading role
in the nominating process. Front-loading the primary schedule with
larger states turns the race into a chase for money and soundbites,
with little real debate, he added.
</P>
<P>
   This year, six GOP contenders dropped out of the race before the
first ballots were cast in Iowa and New Hampshire because of
because they could not raise enough money to compete in the big
states, where candidates must spend more on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there's value in retail politics,'' Brock told
reporters. Concentrating on small states early would give
candidates a chance to ``wrestle through'' the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a lot of money to run in Wyoming,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brock plan groups Iowa and New Hampshire into their
appropriate population categories, it does not close the door to
their traditional standing as the first states to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The plan immediately drew fire from Republicans in larger states
such as New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For parochial reasons, we don't like the Delaware Plan,'' said
Jeffrey Buley, general counsel to the New York Republican Party.
The primary schedule should produce ``the best possible nominee
with the best chance of winning in November,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Plan, he added, ``will produce a protracted battle
(and) a broke and bloodied nominee at the convention.''

EVEN ON TV, PUBERTY CAN'T LAST FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For decades on television shows about teen-agers,
sex was unmentioned, divorced parents were out of the question, and
families lived in an all-white suburban world that seemed frozen in
time. The biggest issues facing television teen-agers of the '50s,
'60s and '70s seemed to be borrowing the family car or finding a
date for the prom.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Fox shows ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which is
reaching its television finale on May 17 after 10 years, and
``Party of Five,'' whose last episode will be seen Wednesday night
at 8.
</P>
<P>
   Though the characters on these two series could not be more
dissimilar, ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Party of Five'' have
transformed the way teen-agers are depicted on television,
presenting them as far more complicated, thoughtful and sexy than
the innocent, perky and sometimes goofy young people on earlier
series like ``The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,'' ``The Patty Duke
Show,'' ``My Three Sons'' and ``The Adventures of Ozzie and
Harriet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' the longest-running drama series on
American television and nothing less than a cultural phenomenon
abroad, enjoyed far greater success than ``Party of Five.''
``90210'' was initially about a Minnesota family, Jim and Cindy
Walsh and their twin teen-agers, Brenda (Shannon Doherty) and
Brandon (Jason Priestley), who move to opulent Beverly Hills. At
fictional West Beverly Hills High (patterned after Beverly Hills
High School and some private schools in Los Angeles) the twins
encounter a sun-bleached world of money, glamour and, even by
Southern California standards, unreasonably perfect looks and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The show itself was never taken seriously by critics or even
rival television executives; in fact it was scorned as shallow. In
his review of the ``90210'' premiere in The Washington Post, Tom
Shales wrote of the show's makers: ``They've created a vacuum, a
perfect void, a black hole in the already vast and empty TV
schedule. Not so much a black hole actually as a beige one.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the obvious fantasy elements of the high school, the
series dealt, in its own glossy way, with subjects as serious as
date rape, alcoholism, suicide, AIDS and drug abuse. Thus the
series stood out from contemporaries like ``Ferris Bueller'' and
``Parker Lewis Can't Lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Party of Five,'' which made its debut in 1994, was about five
siblings raising themselves after the deaths of their parents at
the hands of a drunken driver.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Simon, the curator at the Museum of Television and Radio in
Manhattan, said that what was especially novel about ``90210'' and
``Party of Five'' was their focus on the teen-agers outside the
standard family context. Previous shows were characterized by major
story lines involving parents because networks and advertisers
wanted to draw on as large a demographic group as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the splintering of the television audience, the growth of
cable and the end of the dominance of the once-powerful three major
networks led advertisers and networks to target a specific segment
of the audience: in this case, teen-agers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past the comic struggles of the teen-agers on
television were always in the context of the family,'' said Simon.
``They didn't reflect the hidden truths and confusions of what it
meant to be a teen-ager. These shows tried to reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   The striking success of ``90210'' fostered the creation of the
WB network, which was marketed specifically for the kinds of
teen-age audiences generated by ``90210'' and ``Party of Five.''
(Movies, on the other hand, have often dealt with teen-agers in a
more straightforward way; 45 years ago the Nicholas Ray film
``Rebel With a Cause,'' which made James Dean a star, served as one
of the earliest and most serious depictions of alienated
teen-agers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our show opened the way on television,'' said Chris Keyser,
who created ``Party of Five'' with his partner Amy Lippman. ``It
was really the first of its kind to specifically deal with serious
relationships among teen-agers and those in their early 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Party of Five' said to network executives and advertisers
that there's an important demographic in teen-agers, and shows
about them can be successful,'' Keyser said. ``It's fair to say
that the show, as well as a show like `My So-Called Life,' treated
teen-agers and those in their early 20s as something beyond just
soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling, one of the executive producers of '`90210,''
whose extraordinarily successful career has been stamped by shows
like ``Charlie's Angels'' and ``Dynasty,'' said that for all the
critical abuse the show took, its success was based on several
factors: as the cast grew older and went on to college, the
audience grew older, too, and kept returning; the show never
preached or seemed strident as it dealt with serious issues in a
setting that seemed quite unserious; and it was dreamlike in its
lush surroundings and gorgeous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent changed,'' said Spelling. ``In the beginning it was
just to have fun with kids in high school. You know, cheerleaders
and football games and pom-poms and all that. We hung on by our
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But then Fox, in an unusual move in the summer of 1991, decided
to broadcast new episodes instead of reruns. They dealt with summer
vacations and playing at the beach, which gave the young cast
members the chance to take off their clothes and stroll around in
bathing suits. The episodes turned Priestley and Luke Perry into
television stars and lured a large audience of young women to the
show.
</P>
<P>
   After that ``90201'' began tackling what were then unusual
subjects for a seemingly frivolous teen-ager series. ``We had shows
about racism, we had shows about condom use, we had a show about a
kid accidentally killed by his father's gun left in a drawer,''
said Spelling. ``We had shows about violence at school. Remember
this was years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rosin, an executive producer of the series in its first
five years, said these breakthroughs went unnoticed by critics.
``We broke ground on many different levels,'' he said. ``Our lead
characters were sexual. In our ninth episode we dealt with AIDS.
They were computer-literate as far back as 1993. We would scour
what was going on in the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there was style and facade. But underneath we dealt with
a whole jangle of anxieties and insecurities back then which we
take for granted today. We took teen-agers seriously, their
melodramas and relationships and problems. Television shows back
then didn't do that, except for heavy after-school specials which
dealt with the problem of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, ``Party of Five'' was developed as a replacement
for ``90210,'' which was then in its fourth year. Keyser and
Lippman, who had met years before in a writing class at Harvard,
said that the idea for ``Party of Five'' came from Sandy Grushow,
now chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow, then a high-ranking Fox television executive, said he
was concerned about how long the Beverly Hills show would last. He
said he and several other executives discussed a series about
teen-age empowerment and struck on the idea of a family of
teen-agers who lost their parents in an accident. Keyser and
Lippman turned the show into one that was more serious than Fox
intended.
</P>
<P>
   `` `90210' was initially a straight-down-the middle soap opera,
whereas `Party of Five' was conceived by Chris and Amy to be a more
serious contemporary drama,'' said Grushow. ``I probably conceived
it somewhere in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   At least at the outset the two shows would have been unthinkable
on ABC, CBS and NBC. ``The idea that any of those three networks
would do a show about teen-agers and for teen-agers was absurd,''
said Grushow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party of Five,'' was never in the same ratings league as
``90210.'' But because it followed the Beverly Hills show on
Wednesday nights on Fox, the more somber show was buoyed by the
success of ``90210.'' Still, ``Party of Five'' was never among
television's Top 20 shows, and its situation has been dicey over
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Fox moved the show to Tuesday nights at 9, against
NBC's ``Will and Grace'' and ABC's ``Dharma and Greg.'' Some of the
stars of ``Party of Five'' had either left or were reducing their
number of episodes. More important, most of the show's characters
were now young adults. As a result Fox decided to end the show.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the two teen-age dramas faded because their stars had
grown older, and the longevity of the two series, especially
``90210,'' may have made them a little tired. At the same time the
growth of cable networks like MTV, VHI and E! and the appeal of the
Internet have splintered the teen-age audience.
</P>
<P>
   But these shows' impact remains considerable. WB's ``Dawson's
Creek,'' ``Felicity,'' ``Popular,'' ``Angel'' and ``Roswell,'' and
even NBC's acclaimed but canceled high school comedy, ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' owe a debt to the two Fox series that took teen-agers and
their issues seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of those connected with ``90210'' and ``Party of
Five'' say the series gave them a career boost, some writers and
actors said they were concerned that the shows had typecast them,
and that they were seeking to reach beyond the teen-age genre.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wolf, one of the stars of ``Party,'' was on Broadway last
year in ``Side Man.'' He has recently worked at several repertory
theaters and is actively pursuing a film career.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series, ``I was sort of bopping around, getting work
in commercials, doing whatever I could get my hands on,'' said
Wolf, 31. ``This has radically changed my life.'' He said he was
convinced that the show succeeded because it was so different from
conventional television series about teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Ian Ziering, a star of ``90210,'' said that no matter
how glamorous or even unreal the characters on the show seemed at
times, audiences related to the series because there was an
underpinning of seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was only a show about hair styles, it would not have
survived,'' Ziering said. ``It was a show about young people
growing up together, living with the cards that life dealt them.
And a lot of people, young and not so young, related to that.''

   &QL; 
Toss out the notion loft-living in old industrial buildings is just
some spartan lifestyle for struggling artists in New York, Boston
or Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It's on the rise here in Southern California and in other parts
of the country, officials say, as more professionals are trading
trees and yards of sprawling suburbia _ and long daily commutes _
for interior space to create urban live-work environments.
</P>
<P>
   The Southland boom is strongest in downtown Los Angeles _ where
today and Sunday one such community, The Brewery Art Complex, opens
its loft doors to the public for tours and an art sale. Lofts have
been thriving downtown since the mid-1980s and many communities,
including the Brewery complex, still have waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   Now other areas like Hollywood and some industrial zones are
following suit, says Don Spivak, an urban planner with the Los
Angeles City Redevelopment Agency.
</P>
<P>
   More cities now see loft communities as both a revitalization
tool and a way to support growing arts communities, Spivak says,
noting that lofts are popular in Denver, Houston and San Francisco.
In Southern California, his research shows the trend has hit San
Diego, Santa Monica, Venice, Anaheim and Hollywood, while other
arts experts point to lofts cropping up in Santa Ana, Fullerton and
Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   City planners in Glendale and Ventura also are considering lofty
proposals to revitalize commercial or industrial zones, but are far
from final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a modern-day trend,'' said Jim Glaser, Glendale's
assistant director of planning. ``It's not only the single-family
homes in the suburbs that are the typical model for housing
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the century, there was a tendency to separate
zoning and business uses, but now people are beginning to rethink
that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of zoning changes passed last summer, several
projects are under way in downtown Los Angeles to convert vacant
office buildings into loft apartments. Spivak says the goal is
create more downtown pedestrian neighborhoods and consumer bases.
</P>
<P>
   And he's confident there's a market for loft-style housing in
urban centers, which have average monthly rents of $1 to $1.50 per
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Established loft complexes in downtown Los Angeles have had
waiting lists for years, including lofts on Eighth and Spring
streets, throughout the Artists' District, which encompasses
roughly 2,500 lofts between Alameda Street and the Los Angeles
River, the Santa Fe Art Colony on Long Beach Boulevard, and the
Brewery complex at North Main Street _ named after former occupant
Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a waiting list to fill all 250 lofts currently
transforming downtown's old banking district. The developer, Los
Angeles-based Gilmore Associates, is renovating vacant financial
buildings with new wiring to support modern technology in hopes of
enticing wide array of self-employed professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Brewery loft-dweller Nathan Swift _ a 30-year-old architect with
2,000 square feet of live-work space, concrete floors and a 23-foot
ceiling _ no longer commutes to work two hours daily on clogged
freeways.
</P>
<P>
   He also was able to open his own business without the extra
expense of a separate office. But unlike a suburban home office, he
has ample parking and equally business-friendly, arts-minded
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Spread over a dozen brick and concrete buildings, the Brewery's
300 units are filled with art and antique dealers, painters,
photographers, designers, musicians, welders, writers, film
technicians, performance artists, furniture makers, yoga masters
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an energy here that's hard to find in other places,
especially the suburbs,'' said Swift, who also holds gallery
openings in his loft with girlfriend and partner architect, Gloria
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a sense of community that's unparalleled in the
city,'' agreed neighbor Ted Meyer, a designer, teacher, writer and
painter whose specialties include model prints of clients' body
scars. ``I can knock on my neighbors' doors at 11 o'clock at night
and ask them what they think of a painting I'm working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer added, ``It's like living in a college dorm where
everyone's room is the size of a house and everyone's 30 _ or at
least has that maturity level.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not surprised artists are now regarded as solutions to
struggling areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know artists are the only people who would move into some
place that everyone else thinks is gross and make it really nice,''
laughed Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Ventura, which has been redeveloping its downtown
and waterfront, is studying artists' proposal to revamp old oil
refinery properties on the city's blighted west side into live-work
lofts, said Rochelle Margolin, a city economic development
associate.
</P>
<P>
   And in Glendale, a task force has suggested loft living in
vacant commercial and industrial zones as one of many solutions to
encourage community arts.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaser, the Glendale city planner, predicts there will be
several tough hurdles to clear before such projects are possible,
including enacting zoning changes, securing funding and finding
developers.
</P>
<P>
   And, depending on factors such as zoning and financing
provisions, Spivak says live-work loft complexes usually restrict
tenants to artists, or target various self-employed professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Brewery resident Mat Gleason, an art magazine publisher and
gallery manager, says he generally approves of cities' efforts to
create new loft communities for artists, if the intention indeed is
to encourage the arts and not use artists for a quick-fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do cities want more art museums and places for arts patrons to
go, or do they just want a reliable source to come in, and fix it
up, so it's nice enough for a Starbucks to move in next year?''
Gleason asked, then added with light-hearted resignation, ``But
hey, I guess those 10 to 15 years it takes to fix it up could be
fun.''

 &HT;    Great deals for shoppers in Ohio and Georgia
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The bad news for shoppers is that Roberds is
closing its doors.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for shoppers is the store's going-out-of-business
sale.
</P>
<P>
   It may mean great deals on refrigerators, stoves, televisions,
beds, stereos, lamps, tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds has engaged a liquidator to sell the inventory of its
Ohio and Georgia stores, a sale expected ``to begin in the near
future and conclude within 90 days,'' the company said. The
liquidation firm has not been named.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sturdavant, a liquidator for United American in Columbus,
said the point of such sales is to turn all assets into cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company typically checks with two or three liquidators and
then takes the best money offered,'' he said. ``They walk away free
and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it's up to the liquidator to get as much as it can for the
stock. Everything down to the bare walls is sold. Often, Sturdavant
said, two liquidation firms are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the merchandise people do their gig,'' selling the
store's inventory, he said. ``Then the fixture people take over _
selling visuals, shelving.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock may at first be offered at 10 percent off the original
price, then be reduced further. Customers begin getting really good
deals, he says, when merchandise is marked 50 percent off.
Depending on the sale, markdowns may eventually go as low as 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A liquidation sale puts the responsibility on the customer, who
must haul the merchandise away. Stock is sold ``as is'' so it's
important to examine it carefully. There are no exchanges or
returns, though warranties are frequently dealt to other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lunsford of National Content Liquidators in Springboro
says the Roberds liquidation will be of national scope because of
its size. ``You're talking about millions of dollars worth of
inventory,'' he said, even though the company already has
liquidated the contents of its stores in Florida and California.
</P>
<P>
   He also explained that the liquidation firm is likely to bring
in additional inventory from other sources and keep stocking the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, it's not a true liquidation sale, but it's a
nice deal for Roberds because they make a percentage of revenue
from what these guys bring in,'' Lunsford said.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdavant says all kinds of shoppers show up at liquidation
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see corporations, entrepreneurs, lots of people just
looking for a good buy,'' he said. ``It's really a hodgepodge.''

 &HT;    CLINTON BARS FEDERAL JOB DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PARENTS
 &HT;    360&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton issued a ban Tuesday on
employment discrimination against parents by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or promote employees who have children at home,''
Clinton said at the White House Conference on Teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   At the day-long meeting, experts, parents and teens spent much
of their time discussing ways for busy parents to keep close
relationships with busy adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's tough to be a teenager today, it's probably tougher to
be a parent,'' said first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``More and
more parents are working outside their homes (and) struggling to do
right by their families and their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said his executive order sends those who recruit,
refer, hire, promote or discharge federal employees this message:
``No glass ceiling for parents. The job they are doing at home is
more important anyway, and if they can do your job, you ought not
to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   While he ordered the Office of Personnel Management to set
guidelines for federal agencies, he stipulated that his order sets
a goal, rather than giving anyone the right to sue the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   His order, which doesn't require congressional approval, is
based on a much stronger bill that would give parents the right to
sue public or private employers who discriminate against them.
Congress has yet to act on the bill, which was proposed by Clinton
in January 1999 and introduced on his behalf in November by Sens.
Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about eliminating bias, not about guaranteeing
accommodation,'' said Dodd, who emphasized that parents would still
have to fill any job performance requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, an employer may discipline an employee who is late
because of child-care issues,'' Dodd said. ``Similarly, an employer
may reject an applicant for a job that requires extensive travel if
that applicant is unwilling to travel because of his or her
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   At the teen conference, which included a three-hour discussion
led by Mrs. Clinton in the East Room of the White House, the more
than 200 participants learned of several new polls and studies
concerning teens.
</P>
<P>
   Many were intrigued by a contrast between answers of 200 parents
and of 200 children aged 12 to 15 in a poll (with a margin of error
of plus or minus seven percentage points) that was conducted in
April for the YMCA of the USA:
</P>
<P>
   _ A strong 61 percent of the parents, but only 41 percent of the
children, said they talk frequently with each other about values
and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The top concerns listed by parents about their teens were
drugs, alcohol and violence, but the top concerns listed by the
children were education and ``not having enough time together''
with parents.
</P>
<P>
   _ While 78 percent of the children said they ate eight or more
meals with at least one of their parents during a normal week, only
61 percent of the parents said they ate that many meals with their
teens.
</P>
<P>
   Another study by Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers found
that teenagers who had dinner with their parent or parents five
nights a week were more likely than other teens to avoid smoking,
drinking, violence, suicide and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The council reported that it couldn't tell whether sharing
family meals helps teens avoid risk, or whether risk-taking teens
avoid family meals.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional and physical health of children is affected not so
much by the amount of time parents spend with their teenagers as by
the teens' perceptions of the warmth and closeness of their
relationship with their parents, according to research cited by
Robert Blum, an adolescent health researcher at the University of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Galinsky, president and co-founder of the Families and
Work Institute, said that in her surveys of the children of working
parents, ``Kids said they wish their parents were less stressed and
less tired.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in her surveys of employers, she found, ``Unfortunately,
only 12 percent are doing something specifically to help the
parents of teenagers.''

RUTH D. TURNER, 85; WAS EXPERT ON SHIPWORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Dixon Turner, a professor at Harvard University and curator
of malacology at the school's Museum of Comparative Zoology known
affecionately as ``Lady Wormwood'' for her wide knowledge of
shipworms, died Sunday in Meadow Green Nursing Home in Waltham. She
was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Turner was a leading expert on teredos, bivalve mollusks
sometimes called shipworms that cause widespread destruction by
eating wood in ocean environments. Teredos led to the loss of all
of Christopher Columbus's ships on his fourth voyage to the New
World and are the reason why there was so little wood left on the
wreck of the sunken ocean liner Titanic when it was located by
Robert Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of these borers on the history of man is difficult
to estimate,'' Miss Turner said in a story published in the Globe
on Nov. 16, 1961, ``but it has certainly been tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   She said accounts of the early voyagers such as Cooke and Drake
made it clear that they dreaded shipworms as much as the they did
scurvy.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Turner speculated that many of the explorers who had set
sail and were never heard from again may have gone down because of
shipworms.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors weren't the only ones threatened by the worms. In 1730,
they riddled the wooden-faced dykes in the Netherlands with holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' Miss Turner said in 1961. ``Maybe the legendary
little Dutch boy who saved the dyke by plugging a hole with his
finger was actually stopping up a seaworm hole.''
</P>
<P>
   During her 50-year career, Miss Turner worked closely with the
UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Navy's Office of
Oceanography, which funded much of her research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to participating in expeditions throughout the
world, she maintained a laboratory in Puerto Rico and also did
research at Northeastern University's marine laboratory in Nahant,
Mass. and the marine biological laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass.,
where she used the Deep Submergence Research Vehicle to study the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Melrose, Mass. and graduated from Bridgewater
(Mass.) Teachers College. She earned a master's degree at Cornell
University and a doctorate at Radcliffe College.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves two sisters, Winifred Garrity of Sudbury, Mass. and
Lina MacNeill of Wayland, Mass.

   When Wolfgang Petersen talked to actors about being in the film
adaptation of Sebastian Junger's runaway non-fiction best seller,
``The Perfect Storm,'' he had one question he'd always ask first:
Do you know what you're in for?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to know that this was not going to be an easy
shoot,'' Petersen says. ``I wanted to get them psyched up for
something that would be a little frightening, but also very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg signed on to play
the leaders of the six-man crew of the Andrea Gail, the fishing
boat that endured a Force 12 storm off the coast of Newfoundland.
Petersen, who, with ``Das Boot'' on his resume, knows a thing or
two about waterlogged movies, spent three weeks filming at sea in
both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. But the majority of the shoot
took place inside Stage 16 at Warner Bros., where the filmmakers
created their own version of the great gale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never seen so many wind machines in your life,''
Petersen says. ``The actors really were good sports because we
pelted them with tons of water non-stop for days on end. Mark
Wahlberg told me he felt like he was enduring a beating, but two
days after we finished filming, he wanted to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the editing room, Petersen combined the soundstage work with
the state-of-the-art special effects from Industrial Light and
Magic. He says the results were so seamless that he sometimes would
ask his editor if they shot it or if it was a full CG
(computer-generated) shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have made this movie even two years ago,''
Petersen says. ``The technology is so advanced that I promise you,
the audience is going to feel like wringing the water out of their
clothes when they leave the theater.''

&HT;     RUSSIAN SAYS MISSILE SYSTEM COULD IGNITE NEW `COLD WAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three Russian lawmakers warned Congress Tuesday
that if the White House follows through on plans to build a
national missile defense system, the U.S.-Russia relationship would
be severely undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Shabanov, deputy chairman of the Duma's foreign
relations committee, said the missile defense program could spark
``another Cold War,'' and he warned of ``very dangerous''
repercussions. The Duma is Russia's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if the United States deploys such a system _ which
Russia views as a threat to its nuclear deterrent _ Moscow might
not feel bound by top-priority defense arrangements, such as a
joint effort to stem the flow of nuclear weapons and missile
technologies to nations that Washington considers international
pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a joint gathering of Russian and U.S. lawmakers on
Capitol Hill, Shabanov added that a national missile defense system
would further isolate Russia from the United States and Europe,
forcing Moscow to form alliances with countries unfriendly to the
Americans and Europeans. ``Leaving Russia on its own is very
dangerous,'' he said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Kosachev, also a deputy chairman of the Duma's
foreign relations committee, said Moscow is angered that the United
States is moving ahead on missile defense ``unilaterally without
taking into account the Russian position.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosachev said that Washington has backed Moscow into a corner,
forcing Russia either to agree to changes in the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to allow for the deployment of such a
defense system or threatening to abrogate the treaty altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Kosachev said that the fast pace of proposed changes to such a
fundamental arms control treaty was unnecessary. ``We shouldn't
hurry on this matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stated reason behind the U.S. push to deploy national
missile defense is the alleged threat posed by North Korea, which
U.S. intelligence asserts is developing a long-range missile
capable of striking U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
   But Vladimir Ryzhkov, a Duma member, challenged U.S.
intelligence estimates. He said the threat from North Korea ``is
highly exaggerated.'' Shabanov added that Russia has determined
that North Korea lacks the economic wherewithal to develop a
long-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey, former director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, countered Russian assessments of the North Korean threat.
The Russians have ``bum dope and are badly in need of accurate and
complete information,'' he said, adding that North Korea has
achieved many technical milestones in its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the same conference, Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., said it
was certain that the United States would eventually deploy a
missile defense system, despite Russian objections. ``There will be
a deployment of NMD by the United States,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   The missile system is supported by the White House and both Vice
President Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to make a decision about whether
to deploy the national missile defense system no earlier than this
fall. The United States and Russia have entered preliminary
discussions about renegotiating the 1972 missile treaty, and
Clinton is scheduled to travel to Moscow next month to meet with
Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the topic.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow objects to amending the ABM Treaty because it is
viewed as a stabilizing force between two giant nuclear arsenals.
Russia's view is that by prohibiting national missile defenses,
each side is ensured that it could destroy the other, thus
deterring the other from launching a first strike.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have stressed that national missile defense would
be ``limited,'' aimed at defeating a dozen or so missiles launched
from countries such as North Korea or Iran and that it in no way
could defeat Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, however, is concerned that the proposed U.S. missile
defense system would soon be enlarged where it could defeat
Russia's missiles, thus disrupting the strategic balance between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The technology for such a missile system still has not been
perfected. The results so far have been mixed with another key
missile test scheduled for next month. The system could be
completed by 2015.

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (New York) _ President Clinton and his national
security adviser warned Tuesday that failure to extend new trading
rights to China would be a self-inflicted wound, compromising
America's global leadership as it undermined Chinese reformers. In
sometimes dire language that seemed to reflect the administration's
nervousness about prospects for congressional approval of the China

   WOOING-STUDENTS (Undated) _ The period from April 1 to May 1 is

screening potential candidates against a yardstick of their own
idiosyncrasies. And the officers are reduced to mere applicants,

professors _ while bracing for rejections from hundreds of
desirable students, who will ultimately choose to attend college
elsewhere. By Jacques Steinberg.

GRIER SPENDS TIME WITH PATRIOTS OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Deposed vice president of player personnel
Bobby Grier had a final meeting with Patriots owner Robert Kraft at
Foxboro Stadium Tuesday, presumably to get a handshake and perhaps
a severance package.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on whether Kraft offered Grier a job within
the organization, as the Red Sox did when Lou Gorman was replaced
by Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, 57, isn't ready to retire, but the timing of his
departure will make it very difficult to hook on elsewhere for the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The timing, in fact, raises the question that if Belichick and
the Krafts didn't care for Grier's draft selections, why did they
put off firing him until after the draft?
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Sports, a watchdog group that promotes diversity in
professional sports, watched closely the firing of Grier, an
African-American, as it did the firing of Ray Rhodes as Green Bay
coach this year. It asked for and received a satisfactory
explanation from the Packers, who fired Rhodes after one 8-8
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Belichick has every right to hire and fire as the new
head coach of the New England Patriots,'' said Charles Farrell,
director of Rainbow Sports. ``All that we're concerned about is
hoping that Mr. Belichick will consider an African-American, a
Latino, a woman as a replacement for the position. All we ask for
is equal footing.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell said Grier's firing ``took us by surprise. He is a
well-respected football executive with 18 years of experience.
That's rare for an African-American in the sports business. Our
hope is that Mr. Grier will land on his feet in another position in
the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell said his group will look into the Grier firing but in no
way was he suggesting that it was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``As positions open up, we remind teams to embrace diversity and
emphasize that diversity is good for everyone in business,'' said
Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is looking around for more of his loyalists to round
out the personnel staff. With Scott Pioli the main assistant in
charge of pro personnel, look for Belichick to hire a director of
college scouting or someone with expertise in that area.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scouts and executives with the Jets and Ravens have
ties to Belichick and may find their way here. Among them are Jets
scouts Lionel Vital, who worked with Pioli in Baltimore and then
with Pioli and Belichick in New York, and Trent Baalke. Hingham's
Terry McDonough, an assistant with the Ravens, is another, as is
Phil Savage, the Ravens' director of college scouting, though he
recently signed a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick certainly has not been shy about cleaning house; the
only question is where will he stop. Several employees of the team
are wondering who's next.

&HT;     GOP PRIMARY PROPOSAL WOULD PUT SMALLER STATES AHEAD OF
CALIFORNIA, N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican task force on Tuesday recommended a
four-tiered primary balloting schedule that would put small states
first, and push giants such as California and New York to the back
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP commission headed by former Sen. William Brock of
Tennessee was assembled by Republican National Committee Chairman
Jim Nicholson last July to figure what to do about
``front-loading,'' the process in which states clamor for attention
from presidential candidates by scheduling their primaries earlier
and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This year, California and New York moved their primaries from
their historic positions late in the political calendar to March 7
_ Super Tuesday _ in an effort to get more attention from
candidates. The two states send a total of 263 delegates to the GOP
convention, nearly a quarter of the delegates needed to win the
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in favoring smaller states accelerated this year when
both parties' winners emerged by early March, before half the
states had held primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   To address this perceived imbalance, Brock unveiled the Delaware
Plan, named for its originator, Delaware GOP Chairman Basil
Battaglia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, states would be grouped in four tiers
according to population. The most populous _ California, New York
and Texas among them _ would go into the fourth tier of states that
are barred from holding their primaries any earlier than the first
week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller states such as Delaware, New Hampshire and North Dakota
would have the first crack, holding their primaries the first week
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The next tier would go no sooner than the first week of April.
This bloc would include states such as Arkansas, Iowa, South
Carolina and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The third tier would hold primaries no sooner than the first
week of May. This group includes Arizona, Missouri, Washington and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The final tier of large states also includes Florida, Michigan,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats last week considered a similar plan and rejected
it, according to a statement from the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats had serious reservations about the lack of diversity
in the small states that would go first'' in the Delaware Plan, DNC
Rules and Bylaws co-chairman Jim Roosevelt said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   New York and California were reliable supporters of President
Clinton in the last two presidential elections and Democrats are
not anxious to anger the party faithful in those states.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Plan is to be reviewed by the GOP's rules committee
in Indianapolis next week. If approved, the entire Republican
National Committee would vote on the plan at the party's convention
in Philadelphia in August.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, Brock told a news conference here, is to restore
smaller states and their Main Street politics to their leading role
in the nominating process. Front-loading the primary schedule with
larger states turns the race into a chase for money and soundbites,
with little real debate, he added.
</P>
<P>
   This year, six GOP contenders dropped out of the race before the
first ballots were cast in Iowa and New Hampshire because of
because they could not raise enough money to compete in the big
states, where candidates must spend more on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there's value in retail politics,'' Brock told
reporters. Concentrating on small states early would give
candidates a chance to ``wrestle through'' the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a lot of money to run in Wyoming,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brock plan groups Iowa and New Hampshire into their
appropriate population categories, it does not close the door to
their traditional standing as the first states to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The plan immediately drew fire from Republicans in larger states
such as New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For parochial reasons, we don't like the Delaware Plan,'' said
Jeffrey Buley, general counsel to the New York Republican Party.
The primary schedule should produce ``the best possible nominee
with the best chance of winning in November,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Plan, he added, ``will produce a protracted battle
(and) a broke and bloodied nominee at the convention.''

WITH NINE SIDEBARS -- HOLLOW, ROADTRIP, XMEN, MISSION, ROCKY, DINO,
IRENE, PATRIOT AND STORM 
SUMMER MOVIE PREVIEW -- FROM THE `CAN'T HARDLY WAIT' TO `HUH'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS &AMP; GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first summer movie season of the new millennium is,
appropriately enough, overstuffed with entertainments claiming
astonishing new visions and technological breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   You'll believe dinosaurs can talk, a squirrel can fly and Eddie
Murphy can play six comically obese people all at once. Or,
perhaps, you won't, but that will not be due to lack of effort and
expense on Hollywood's part.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer should also be richer than most in, of all
things, human- scale drama and grown-up comedy. The independent and
art house distributors, which have traditionally ceded the
warm-weather months to big studio escapist fare, have remarkably
full slates of releases planned.
</P>
<P>
   Some, obviously, are hoping to score a surprise bonanza like
last summer's supersleeper ``The Blair Witch Project.'' While it's
unlikely that phenomenon will repeat itself, such delusional
optimism should benefit moviegoers everywhere with an exceptionally
wide range of options between now and Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The big studios should also be more competitive than usual this
year. Since no one film appears poised to dominate the marketplace
as ``Jurassic Park'' or ``Star Wars: Phantom Menace'' have in
summers past, the major releases will theoretically have to earn
their audiences with quality.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this means that ``The Perfect Storm'' will be as
tragically gripping on the big screen as it was on the page, or
that ``X-Men'' will revitalize the sclerotic superhero film genre
the way it did in comic books, or that ``Me, Myself and Irene''
will be the gross-out laugh fest that Jim Carrey's fans have too
long been longing for, all remains to be seen.

<P>
   Along with those three films, we've spotlighted six others films
likely to generate heat _ ``Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,''
``Road Trip,'' ``Patriot,'' ``Hollow Man,'' ``Mission: Impossible
2'' and ``Dinosaur.'' But one thing's for certain: There will be a
lot to see this summer, and the law of averages indicates that a
nice percentage of it will, at the very least, be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The following list of summer films and their release dates is as
comprehensive and accurate as we could make it. However, dates,

&HT;     GOP PRIMARY PROPOSAL WOULD PUT SMALLER STATES AHEAD OF
CALIFORNIA, N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Examiner; adds quote from Calif. GOP)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican task force on Tuesday recommended a
four-tiered primary balloting schedule that would put small states
first, and push giants such as California and New York to the back
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP commission headed by former Sen. William Brock of
Tennessee was assembled by Republican National Committee Chairman
Jim Nicholson last July to figure what to do about
``front-loading,'' the process in which states clamor for attention
from presidential candidates by scheduling their primaries earlier
and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This year, California and New York moved their primaries from
their historic positions late in the political calendar to March 7
_ Super Tuesday _ in an effort to get more attention from
candidates. The two states send a total of 263 delegates to the GOP
convention, nearly a quarter of the delegates needed to win the
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in favoring smaller states accelerated this year when
both parties' winners emerged by early March, before half the
states had held primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   To address this perceived imbalance, Brock unveiled the Delaware
Plan, named for its originator, Delaware GOP Chairman Basil
Battaglia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, states would be grouped in four tiers
according to population. The most populous _ California, New York
and Texas among them _ would go into the fourth tier of states that
are barred from holding their primaries any earlier than the first
week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller states such as Delaware, New Hampshire and North Dakota
would have the first crack, holding their primaries the first week
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The next tier would go no sooner than the first week of April.
This bloc would include states such as Arkansas, Iowa, South
Carolina and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The third tier would hold primaries no sooner than the first
week of May. This group includes Arizona, Missouri, Washington and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The final tier of large states also includes Florida, Michigan,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats last week considered a similar plan and rejected
it, according to a statement from the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats had serious reservations about the lack of diversity
in the small states that would go first'' in the Delaware Plan, DNC
Rules and Bylaws co-chairman Jim Roosevelt said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   New York and California were reliable supporters of President
Clinton in the last two presidential elections and Democrats are
not anxious to anger the party faithful in those states.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Plan is to be reviewed by the GOP's rules committee
in Indianapolis next week. If approved, the entire Republican
National Committee would vote on the plan at the party's convention
in Philadelphia in August.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, Brock told a news conference here, is to restore
smaller states and their Main Street politics to their leading role
in the nominating process. Front-loading the primary schedule with
larger states turns the race into a chase for money and soundbites,
with little real debate, he added.
</P>
<P>
   This year, six GOP contenders dropped out of the race before the
first ballots were cast in Iowa and New Hampshire because of
because they could not raise enough money to compete in the big
states, where candidates must spend more on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there's value in retail politics,'' Brock told
reporters. Concentrating on small states early would give
candidates a chance to ``wrestle through'' the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a lot of money to run in Wyoming,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brock plan groups Iowa and New Hampshire into their
appropriate population categories, it does not close the door to
their traditional standing as the first states to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The plan immediately drew fire from Republicans in larger
states.
</P>
<P>
   California's March 7 primary this year was ``the first time for
many of us that our vote counted in the presidential selection
process,'' said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the California
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The plan ``definitely would be a situation that would not excite
Republicans in California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For parochial reasons, we don't like the Delaware Plan,'' said
Jeffrey Buley, general counsel to the New York Republican Party.
The primary schedule should produce ``the best possible nominee
with the best chance of winning in November,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Plan, he added, ``will produce a protracted battle
(and) a broke and bloodied nominee at the convention.''

SUMMER MOVIE PREVIEW -- FROM THE `CAN'T HARDLY WAIT' TO `HUH'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS &AMP; GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first summer movie season of the new millennium is,
appropriately enough, overstuffed with entertainments claiming
astonishing new visions and technological breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   You'll believe dinosaurs can talk, a squirrel can fly and Eddie
Murphy can play six comically obese people all at once. Or,
perhaps, you won't, but that will not be due to lack of effort and
expense on Hollywood's part.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer should also be richer than most in, of all
things, human- scale drama and grown-up comedy. The independent and
art house distributors, which have traditionally ceded the
warm-weather months to big studio escapist fare, have remarkably
full slates of releases planned.
</P>
<P>
   Some, obviously, are hoping to score a surprise bonanza like
last summer's supersleeper ``The Blair Witch Project.'' While it's
unlikely that phenomenon will repeat itself, such delusional
optimism should benefit moviegoers everywhere with an exceptionally
wide range of options between now and Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The big studios should also be more competitive than usual this
year. Since no one film appears poised to dominate the marketplace
as ``Jurassic Park'' or ``Star Wars: Phantom Menace'' have in
summers past, the major releases will theoretically have to earn
their audiences with quality.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this means that ``The Perfect Storm'' will be as
tragically gripping on the big screen as it was on the page, or
that ``X-Men'' will revitalize the sclerotic superhero film genre
the way it did in comic books, or that ``Me, Myself and Irene''
will be the gross-out laugh fest that Jim Carrey's fans have too
long been longing for, all remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Along with those three films, we've spotlighted six others films
likely to generate heat _ ``Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,''
``Road Trip,'' ``Patriot,'' ``Hollow Man,'' ``Mission: Impossible
2'' and ``Dinosaur.'' But one thing's for certain: There will be a
lot to see this summer, and the law of averages indicates that a
nice percentage of it will, at the very least, be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The following list of summer films and their release dates is as
comprehensive and accurate as we could make it. However, dates,
titles and even descriptions (some of these things haven't been
test-screened yet) are subject to change. &QL;

(SPIA Entertainment) &QL; 
---May 19 &QL; 
Dinosaur: This fabulous-looking ultra-expensive combination of
live-action backgrounds and computer-animated prehistoric creatures

Disney Pictures)

   Set Me Free: Drama about a young girl from France. (Artistic
License)

in this story about a Chinese imperial guard sent to the Old West
to rescue a kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu). (Touchstone Pictures) &QL;

   Me, Myself and Irene: The return of the Farrelly brothers
(``There's Something about Mary'') also marks the return of Jim
Carrey to flat-out comic territory. The plot, such as it is,
follows a mild-mannered Rhode Island cop who has a split
personality disorder. Both of them fall in love with Rene
Zellweger, as did Carrey when he made this film. (20th Century

</P>
<P>
   The Perfect Storm: Sebastian Junger's best-selling non-fiction
account of the mother of all Atlantic storms is visualized by

Wahlberg are two of the unlucky fishermen. (Warner Bros.)

   Disney's The Kid: Not to be confused with Charlie Chaplin's
``The Kid,'' nor a certain profitable encounter Bruce Willis had
with an eerier tyke last year. In this one, Willis somehow

disappointed with the guy he turns out to be. (Walt Disney
Pictures)

seduced by L.A. debauchery. (Seven Arts International)
</P>
<P>
   Untitled Nora Ephron Project: The film from director Ephron
(``You've Got Mail'') used to be called ``Numbers.'' Now, it's just
the John Travolta movie where he doesn't play a 9-foot alien.
Instead, he's a TV weatherman looking to rig the state lottery with

</P>
<P>

   Wonderland: Three generations of a London family find their
paths intersecting during a boisterous weekend. (USA Films) &QL; 
---Aug. 4 &QL; 
Coyote Ugly: The title's the name of a trendy New York bar, not a
description of its beautiful and provocative female staff. Think
``Flashdance'' meets ``Cocktail'' ... or, more to the point, don't
bother to think at all. (Touchstone Pictures)
</P>

   Hollow Man: Scientist (Kevin Bacon) unlocks the secret of
invisibility and disappears into a life of evil. Paul Verhoeven

</P>
<P>
   Cecil B. Demented: The latest from John Waters (``Serial Mom'')

serial killer so she can save his latest victim. That she does so
while remaining fully clothed represents the latest curve in this
young woman's career. (New Line)

   It's hard to make a movie set against the backdrop of the bloody
brutality of the American Revolution and have it come out with an
audience-friendly PG-13 rating. Or so says Mark Gordon, co-producer
of ``The Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we weren't going to be good with the MPAA,'' Gordon
says. ``But we're not going to compromise the movie just to get a
PG-13 rating. I mean, it is what it is. War is hell.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Patriot,'' written by ``Saving Private Ryan's'' Robert
Rodat, doesn't turn away from that hell, particularly when it comes
to the damaging effects a cannonball can have on the human head.
But Gordon says the movie is a family story, not a war picture.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Roland Emmerich (``Independence Day,''
``Godzilla''), the movie follows a father (Mel Gibson), who becomes
caught up in the conflict after his son is captured by the
Redcoats.
</P>
<P>
   Emmerich and producing partner Dean Devlin might seem strange
choices to bring a historical epic to the big screen, but Gordon
(who produced ``Saving Private Ryan'') says ``the two are great
storytellers, no matter the genre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a successful movie set against the American
Revolution in 50 years,'' Gordon says. ``We were looking for
someone who has good instincts that could make this movie
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's involvement may ensure that. The filmmakers are banking
on it, having paid the star $25 million for his involvement. Plus,
nobody says, ``Give me back my son!'' with quite the same panache
as Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real family man,'' Gordon says. ``We even added a child
to his character's family; he now has six kids. But we couldn't
keep up with Mel. His wife had their seventh just as we started
making the movie.''

TOM GREEN, TALKING DOG WILL HAVE YOU TRIPPING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Breckin Meyer, the star of this summer's designated keg-party
movie ``Road Trip,'' has never actually taken a road trip himself,
which he admits is pretty pathetic. Then again, if the road trips
he was to take turned out anything like the one in the movie, he'd
be better off locking his doors and staying at home.
</P>
<P>
   The gross-out comedy ``Road Trip'' has Meyer and some buddies
driving from Ithaca, N.Y., to Austin, Texas, to retrieve a
videotape that Meyer's college friend accidentally sent to his
long-distance girlfriend. The tape features proof of a night of
drunken infidelity, hence the urgency to recover it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie's got everything a summer movie needs,'' Meyer says.
``Sperm banks, tainted french toast, infidelities, naked girls _
emphasis on the naked girls _ and a talking dog. Oh, and Tom Green
eats a mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, MTV's resident guerilla freak, plays Meyer's roommate.
Director Todd Phillips says Green's tribulations with the mouse are
among the movie's funniest moments, but he also wants people to
know that his comedy isn't entirely geared toward adolescent (in
body and/or spirit) males.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women seem to like it, too,'' Phillips says. ``I mean, it
treats women in an interesting way, showing that the girl has a lot
of power in most situations. The women here are very proactive, and
they win in the end. I think it shows that it's OK for women to be
sexually aggressive and make the first move.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, proactive, sexually aggressive women. Isn't that every
adolescent male's fantasy, particularly if the emphasis is, as
Meyer says it is, on them being naked?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess it is,'' Phillips admits. ``Did I mention we
have a talking dog?''

IT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE: BROTHERS TAKE RISK FOR KILLER COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every new Farrelly brothers movie has its defining moment, a
scene that has the filmmaking duo wondering if this time they've
taken their brand of wacky humor just a little too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our comedy is pretty risky,'' says Bobby Farrelly, who writes
and directs with brother Peter. ``I mean, that hair gel scene in
'There's Something About Mary' could have ended Cameron Diaz's
career.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, of course. And chances are their new movie, ``Me,
Myself and Irene,'' won't do anything to dim Jim Carrey's star
power. In fact, after his two rather somber turns in ``The Truman
Show'' and ``Man on the Moon,'' ``Irene'' promises audiences the
goofy Carrey they came to know and love in movies like the
Farrellys' early hit, ``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Carrey plays split personalities, and they're both in love
with the same woman, Irene (Rene Zellweger). Coincidentally (or
perhaps not so much so), Carrey and Zellweger fell in love during
the making of the film.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not ``Irene's'' defining moment. What is? We'd best
let Bobby explain:
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, Jim's wife runs off with an African-American little
person, leaving him with her three illegitimate sons. The story
starts when they're born and continues through high school. We had
no idea if it was going to fly, but it turns out to be the funniest
part of the movie. It really gives the story some heart. Really.''
</P>
<P>
   History bears him out. Now we'll just have to see if the
brothers' latest effort holds together and, um, jells.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What would you do if you could make yourself invisible?
</P>
<P>
   Director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship Troopers'') suspects very
bad things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plato says you'd go into somebody's house, get what you want,
rape the woman and kill the man,'' Verhoeven says. ``It's the
constraints of society that makes man good. Take away those
restraints, and you take away the goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when the Jekyll-and-Hyde scientist in
Verhoeven's new movie, ``The Hollow Man,'' hones his disappearing
act. Kevin Bacon plays the sinister scientist; Elisabeth Shue is
his colleague who tries to steer him back to the straight and
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   To give the movie a greater reality, Verhoeven insisted that
Bacon actually be physically present during all his scenes. That
necessitated a tiresome makeup process that turned Bacon various
colors, depending upon the effect, while putting contact lenses the
size of half dollars into his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for the best because it allowed the other actors to
interact with Kevin instead of talking to a blue screen,''
Verhoeven says. ``It makes everything seem more real, and thus more
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   And an atmosphere of fear was what Verhoeven wanted, not the
sort of camp that has characterized many previous invisible
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have any pencils or cups flying through the
air,'' says the director. ``You won't see Kevin eating a sandwich
and then the food floating in the stomach. This is pure evil. The
audience gets to watch evil encroach upon a man soul.
</P>
<P>
   Verhoeven can barely contain the glee in his voice. ``Hey,
people love to see something that starts out good and then morphs
into evil. I know I do.''

FANS' ENTHUSIASM ASTONISHES `X' MAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' director Bryan Singer was curious about what people
were saying about his movie on the Internet, so he asked an
assistant one day to log on, print some stuff out and report back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stacks he gave me were so huge that I just gave up,''
Singer says. ``I have no idea what people are thinking about this
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Bryan, we'll clue you in: ``X-Men'' is the summer's most
anticipated movie, certainly among fans (and there are a lot of
them) of the film's comic book source material.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on a long-running series about a group of
superhuman mutants who are trained to use their specific powers for
the good of humanity. This isn't always an easy thing to do since
normal folks regard the X-Men with suspicion and fear. And that
prejudice doesn't sit right with some of the X-Men, members of the
Brotherhood, who want to take revenge upon the human race.
</P>
<P>
   The series' underlying themes of intolerance were mostly what
attracted Singer (``The Usual Suspects'') to the project, although
he was eager to try his hand at special-effects filmmaking. He had
no idea how popular the comics were, nor did Australian actor Hugh
Jackman, who landed the coveted role of the fiery loner, Wolverine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met people who have Wolverine tattoos and who have named
their dogs after the character,'' Jackman says. ``The weirdest
thing was meeting a bunch of writers who worked for sci-fi
magazines. They didn't say anything for a while, and then kind of
stammered, `We're really sorry, but we just can't believe were
talking to !ital!Wolverine.' It's like the enormity of it was too
much for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackman should have time to get used to the attention. ``We're
hoping to make a few of these movies,'' Singer says.
</P>
<P>
   He'd better buy more paper for his printer.

WOO'S IDEAS MAKE `MISSION' POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just like the rest of us, Hong Kong director John Woo saw
``Mission: Impossible,'' and just like the rest of us, he left the
theater scratching his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story was a little confusing to me,'' Woo says. ``And it
also felt too cold. There was always too much going on; it was just
so busy.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the director, hot off the success of his breakthrough
American film, ``Face/Off,'' was approached by Tom Cruise to make
the sequel, Woo had plenty of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the movie a little more charming, kind of like `To
Catch a Thief,''' Woo says. ``I like my movies to be
character-driven and have some romance. And Tom, he wanted each
`Mission: Impossible' episode to have a different style, so we were
seeing eye to eye right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has Cruise battling Anthony Hopkins over a female agent
(Thandie Newton). Hopkins' villain, incidentally, wants to unleash
a deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
   Woo admits to having some disagreements with producer-star
Cruise along the way (``Tom has plenty of ideas''), but that was
the least of his problems during a long, hard and complicated shoot
in Australia. The production was plagued by horrible weather,
logistic problems during urban shoots and the defection of
cinematographer Andrew Lesnie to the ``Lord of the Rings'' trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most difficult movies I've ever made,'' Woo
says. ``But we overcame. We kept fighting. After all this, I hope
people will like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And even with the heavy-metal soundtrack featuring artists such
as Limp Biskit and Rob Zombi, we should be able to figure out
what's going on this time around.

HEY ROCKY, WATCH ME PULL A MOVIE OUT OF MY HAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   The world has changed a great deal since we last saw those Cold
War cartoon heroes Rocky and Bullwinkle, and it would be pretty
easy to dismiss the goofy moose and his diminutive squirrel pal as
passe. But that old-hat perception is precisely one of the reasons
acclaimed theatrical director Des McAnuff thought it'd be fun to
revisit the animated icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've parachuted them into the present day and given them full
room to ply their smart-aleck brand of humor,'' McAnuff says. ``One
thing it does is show you just how much our world has changed and
how cynical we've become about things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' pits the animated
heroes against their traditional flesh-and-blood counterparts.
Jason Alexander and Rene Russo play spies Boris and Natasha, and
Robert De Niro plays the fiendish Fearless Leader. These days, the
Leader is a media mogul with designs on world domination.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro may seem like an unlikely candidate for this material,
but apparently he was so happy with the screenplay by his ``Analyze
This'' collaborator Kenneth Lonergan that he signed on to produce
the movie as well. He even pokes fun at his ``Taxi Driver'' persona
with a ``You talkin' to me?'' routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good sport about that,'' McAnuff says. ``I hesitated
to even suggest the idea, but I think he's at a point in his career
where he really enjoys this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearless, indeed.

DISNEY'S NEW ADVENTURE NO WALK IN THE `JURASSIC PARK'

<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to Disney's new computer-animated feature,
``Dinosaur,'' it's hard to say what's more amazing: the images on
the screen or the speculation that the film's budget (including the
start-up costs of a new digital production studio) may be as much
as $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk to you about specific numbers, but let me just
say this movie cost the same as any other animated movie,'' says
``Dinosaur'' producer Pam Marsden, who has worked on the film for
the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' certainly isn't like any other animated movie
Disney has made. The film's title characters were done entirely on
computer and then dropped into live-action backgrounds. There are
no songs (leaving the Oscar race wide open this year), and it's
rated PG for a couple of pretty intense scenes involving the film's
ferocious villain, the carnotaur, and some nasty raptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some good, scary stuff,'' Marsden says. ``But I think
children 5 years of age and older will be OK. It'll be up to
parents whether to bring the younger kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's six-minute trailer drew plenty of oohs and aahs when
it played with ``Toy Story 2'' last Thanksgiving. It introduced the
movie's cuddly central character, an orphaned iguanodon, who comes
of age in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``These creatures aren't just monsters; they have
personalities,'' Marsden says. ``It's not other movies, like
`Jurassic Park,' where there are humans. Here, it's just dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which should be fine with the kids. Those humans always just
got in the way of the reptiles, anyway.''

Redcoats.
</P>
<P>
   Emmerich and producing partner Dean Devlin might seem strange
choices to bring a historical epic to the big screen, but Gordon
(who produced ``Saving Private Ryan'') says ``the two are great
storytellers, no matter the genre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a successful movie set against the American
Revolution in 50 years,'' Gordon says. ``We were looking for
someone who has good instincts that could make this movie
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's involvement may ensure that. The filmmakers are banking
on it, having paid the star $25 million for his involvement. Plus,
nobody says, ``Give me back my son!'' with quite the same panache
as Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real family man,'' Gordon says. ``We even added a child
to his character's family; he now has six kids. But we couldn't
keep up with Mel. His wife had their seventh just as we started
making the movie.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; COVER STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOGUL-IMAGE-FILMS (Hollywood) _ When Budd Schulberg dreamed up
Sammy Glick _ the ultimate Hollywood wheeler-dealer, back in the
1930s, he meant his novel, ``What Makes Sammy Run?,'' to be seen in
part as a cautionary tale. Back then, Sammy Glick was the villain
of the piece, the awful example of what might happen if you let
individualism and free-enterprise run away with you. But Not until
the 1970s did Schulberg notice the beginnings of a ``180-degree
turn in our national attitude toward Sammy.'' By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT-TV (Los Angeles) _ For more than two decades, Robert
Greenwald, a prolific television producer, has owned the films he
made, which gave him the leverage to do such Emmy Award-winning
shows as ``The Burning Bed'' and ``A Woman of Independent Means.''
But now Greenwald and virtually every other producer of films and
series is under powerful pressure to yield to the networks and
allow them to own the shows. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HAMLET-FILM (Undated) _ Given the story's familiarity, it seemed
altogether natural to locate a new ``Hamlet'' in the immediate
present, to translate the Danish kingdom into a multimedia
corporation, and to watch the story unfold in penthouse hotel
rooms, sky-level office corridors, a coffee shop, an airplane, the
Guggenheim Museum. Director Michael Almereyda discusses his
decision to bring Hamlet into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   HEART-FILM (Undated) _ The first-time writer-directors Anthony
Stark and Sean Smith, best friends since high school, are in a
difficult position when they talk about their new movie, ``Into My
Heart,'' a dark story about two men, best friends since childhood,
whose relationship takes a tragic turn after they grow up and get
married. Stark and Smith's reluctance to admit that their art may
imitate life could be more than the usual insistence by writers
that their creation is a work of fiction. By Dana Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   LANCASTER-FILM (Undated) _ In many ways, Burt Lancaster is the
antithesis of the modern leading man. Today's young actors build
themselves the bodies of athletes. He was an athlete who built
himself into an actor. Lancaster was both of his time _ a
golden-age Movie Star _ and way ahead of it. As an independent
producer, he helped sabotage the studio system that made him, at
one time, the highest-paid actor in the world. By Rick Marin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY-REUNION-THEATER (London) _ T.S. Eliot's ``Family
Reunion'' has risen greatly in critical esteem since it flopped in
the West End 60-odd years ago. Many now regard the poet's story of
the English lord impelled by updated Furies to atone for his wife's
dark death as the nearest to a theatrical masterpiece Eliot ever
wrote. New Yorkers will make up their own minds when the Royal
Shakespeare Company's revival opens at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music on Wednesday. By Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   ORESTEIA-THEATER (Undated) _ Murder. Adultery. Courtroom drama.
A fugitive's hair-raising flight from implacable justice. With
super-heated elements like these to work with, it's no wonder
modern playwrights keep rewriting Aeschylus' ``Oresteia,'' the
fifth-century B.C. dramatic trilogy about a family ensnared in
guilt and violence. By Celia Wren.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE-THEATER (New York) _ John Guare's play ``Gardenia'' begins
in 1875 with Joshua Hickman reading from Walt Whitman's poem ``On
the Beach at Night Alone'': ``A vast similitude interlocks all.''
That quotation about the interconnectedness of humanity is the
central theme of the 1982 play and of the cycle of plays of which
``Gardenia'' is a part. Whitman's line was also at the heart of
``Six Degrees of Separation,'' Guare's 1990 play about the idea
that ``everybody on this planet is separated by only six other
people.'' In the world of Guare, a vast similitude interlocks all.
After years of revising that earlier cycle, he has reordered it
into two plays under the collective title ``Lydie Breeze.'' By Mel
Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-COMEDY-TV (Undated) _ The proportion of viewers
admitting that they get their politics from television comedy may
not be overwhelming. But considering that the 1996 presidential
election was decided by a mere eight percentage points, what each
and every consumer of comedy on television takes away from the
experience can be highly significant. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JOPLIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When the directors of Opera Theater of
St. Louis began planning its 25th anniversary season, the idea of
presenting Scott Joplin's ``Treemonisha'' as its opening production
seemed a natural. It was in St. Louis that Joplin conceived and
largely composed ``Treemonisha,'' a tender story of a Negro
community on a plantation abandoned to its former slaves in
Reconstruction-era Arkansas. And yet, the directors of the Opera
Theater hesitated for some time about presenting ``Treemonisha''
out of concern for the Joplin's text, which is riddled with what
audiences today might consider demeaning Negro stereotypes and
dated dialogue. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   BEETHOVEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When in the course of human events,
musicians feel impelled to declare to the world and to themselves
the highest ideals of which the individual and humanity are
capable, the composer to whom they are most apt to turn is
Beethoven. By Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRO-ACOUSTIC-MUSIC (Undated) _ Electro-acoustic
improvisation is a growing phenomenon in the music world. By Ben
Ratliff.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ABT-DANCE (New York) _ With the turn of the millennium, American
Ballet Theater moved into overdrive on its new production of ``Swan
Lake.'' The production will have its New York premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera House on May 19 and is expected to be the
blockbuster of the company's 60th-anniversary season, which opens
with a gala performance May 8 and runs through July 1. By Iris
Fanger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART/ARCHITECTURE/PHOTOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCHWARTZ-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ When he saw a camera obscura
on the roof of a private museum in Kyoto in 1991, Charles Schwartz
knew he had to have one. So now, poking through the roof of his
staid apartment building on the Upper East Side, is a jaunty,
medieval-looking turret that holds the telescopic lens and mirror
of what surely is the only camera obscura of its size in Manhattan,
and one of the very few private devices of its kind in the world.
By Grace Glueck.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-CHINA-ART (Santa Ana, Calif) _ The opulence of China's
last imperial rulers is an ever-present thread in the largest-ever
exhibition of national treasures from China's Imperial Palace,
installed in February at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, a
Spanish-style hacienda near downtown Santa Ana, Calif. By Andrea
Adelson.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-COMMUNE-ART (Paris) _ The Paris Commune of 1871 is one of
those smoldering ruins in French history. As the first news event
in French history covered by photographers, the Commune and its
aftermath also left a unique visual record, as a compelling new
exhibition at the Musee d'Orsay, on view until June 11, makes
clear. By Richard C. Woodward.

`STUBBORN' GENERAL FACES BITTERSWEET RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUTTGART, Germany _ General Wesley K. Clark's career has been a
succession of high notes: No. 1 in the West Point class of 1966, a
Rhodes scholar, key peace negotiator in the Bosnia accords at
Dayton, the NATO war hero who won the alliance's only war in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But bittersweet is this retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Clark stepped down Tuesday as head of US European Command and
its 109,000 US troops, and will leave his post Wednesday as NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander. General Joseph W. Ralston, vice chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, takes over both posts.
</P>
<P>
   While a military band played the West Point march as Clark
inspected the troops one final time, the decidedly subdued
atmosphere was due to how Clark is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and General H. Hugh Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had arranged for Clark to
leave his post a few months early. The official explanation was
that it was the doings of bureaucracy: Ralston's term as vice
chairman had ended Feb. 29, and unless he was appointed to a new
post within two months, he had to retire.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials quietly acknowledge a different reason as
well: that Clark for too long wouldn't take no for an answer as he
argued several positions contrary to those held by top Defense
Department brass. The most important disagreement centered on
whether a limited air war against Serbia would force Serb troops
from Kosovo. Clark wanted to use much more firepower, a decision
that in hindsight was largely correct; his superiors, including
President Clinton and many Europeans leaders, often disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark's incredibly bright but he's stubborn,'' said a Pentagon
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``His biggest
error may have been he forgot who was boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Both immediate bosses, Cohen and Shelton, shared the stage with
Clark and Ralston. They spoke only kind words.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should ever doubt either your service or your
success,'' Cohen said to Clark. ``Faced with an adversary who
manufactured a vicious humanitarian nightmare, you responded with
compassion and speed to relieve human suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the war's end, Clark has spent most of his time trying to
keep peace in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians have carried out many
revenge attacks against Serb villagers. But Clark said he is
beginning to see some hope.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he visited Kosovo and said there was an ``increasing
sense of security, the indicators of recovery from strong-arm
ethnic cleansing and even some first budding signs of willingness
to tolerate ethnic differences and cooperate among ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ceremony ended, Cohen departed almost immediately,
skipping Clark's reception. The two men will see each other again
Wednesday in Mons, Belgium, at the NATO command change.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the ceremony was Jeffrey H. Smith, a West Point
classmate of Clark's, a former general counsel to the Central
Intelligence Agency and now a Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very emotional,'' Smith said later, his suitcoat off,
revealing West Point cufflinks. ``I think of all those years, and
all that has happened, and to see Wes succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he expected the four-star general to enter a second
career after 34 years in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Wes, I think he would like to try something very
different for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark declined to speak to reporters after the ceremony. A
spokesman said it was traditional for the departing commander not
to overshadow the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Ralston, who entered the Air Force a year before
Clark and flew 147 combat missions over Laos and North Vietnam,
told reporters that he would now focus on NATO's relationship with
Russia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have an opportunity to see what we can do with our
relationship with the Russians and the Russian military,'' Ralston
said. ``Perhaps we have a window of opportunity now with President
Putin taking over,'' referring to the new Russian leader Vladimir
V. Putin.

 PERSONALS: Standing on the Corners Watching  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mural incorporating a  &UR; Lawrence Ferlinghetti &LR;  poem, painted by
graffiti artists two years ago on the outside of the Black Cat, a
restaurant at Kearny and Broadway in San Francisco, was painted
over last week. Poetry fans who contacted Personals are upset by
what they see as the loss of ``an unpublished original poem by our
poet laureate'' in the restaurant's attempt to ``attract the
Financial District lunch crowd,'' but the poet himself is unfazed
and the Black Cat's owner,  &UR; Reed Hearon &LR; , has an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti, who wrote the untitled poem in exchange for free
meals, says he's not upset because his words were barely legible on
the wall. He hopes, however, that Hearon reinstates the poem on his
menu, where it used to be printed.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon says the work will be honored in a more profound medium
than the menu, when a permanent tile version is installed in about
six weeks. Hearon had the mural removed, he said, because police
told him about an Alcoholic Beverage Control Department ruling that
requires bar owners to remove graffiti; and because the
mural-bearing wall had ``turned into a graffiti magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges that he is trying to attract a Montgomery Street crowd
are unfounded, he said. ``Most of the people I've seen from the
Financial District are visiting other establishments on Broadway
during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A historic marker unveiled about a year ago at Webster Street
and Atlantic Avenue in Alameda, Calif., near the confluence of
Walgreens, Starbucks and Kinko's, notes that it was ``Donated by
Browman Development to the Housing Authority of the City of
Alameda.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaque marks the ``Site of the former Rosefield Packing Co.,
incorporated on August 24, 1926.  &UR; Joseph Rosefield &LR;  was the
inventor of hydrogenated peanut butter. Before this process was
developed, peanut butter would separate and quickly spoil. Mr.
Rosefield received a patent for his process in 1923 and three more
patents as he improved the process over the next seven years. Under
Mr. Rosefield's guidance, his packing company in Alameda became the
largest peanut butter manufacturer in the nation, with up to 90
employees working three eight-hour shifts, seven days a week. The
product was sold under the name of Skippy Peanut Butter. Tours of
the facility were enjoyed by generations of Alameda schoolchildren.
The Alameda plant closed in 1974. The Skippy brand continues to be
popular today.''

   _  &UR; Donna Hanover &LR; , wife of New York Mayor  &UR; Rudolph Giuliani &LR; ,
has announced that she's postponing her appearance in ``The Vagina
Monologues'' ``due to personal family circumstances.'' Giuliani
announced last week that he has prostate cancer. Reader
 &UR; Steve Blasberg &LR;  notes, for the record, that Hanover, who was born
 &UR; Donna Kofnovec &LR; , is a graduate of Fremont High School in Sunnyvale
and Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Camilla Parker Bowles &LR;  has not been invited to a June 21
party at Windsor Castle to celebrate the 100th birthday of the

   _ When raindrops started falling on the large unsheltered crowd
at Foreign Cinema on Monday night, in the middle of an outdoor
screening of the new movie ``Luminarias,'' faces turned to the sky,
hands were extended palms up, rustling was heard ... but the movie
continued and no one left. The credits included a thank you to Our
Lady of Guadalupe, who must have had a hand in stopping the rain
after a few minutes.

<P>
   The publisher of  &UR; Ward Connerly &LR; 's anti-affirmative action
memoir, ``Creating Equal'' (Encounter; $24.95), is crowing about
the amazon.com notation that the book is ``popular in: University
of California: Office of the President,'' specifically, No. 9 on
the office of the president's best-seller list. Scurrying right to
that list, Personals found:
</P>
<P>
   The top three books were Harry Potters. No. 4 is ``Dr. Atkins'
New Diet Revolution''; No. 5, possibly a backlash to No. 4, is
``Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``People are mostly attracted to the familiar and comfortable in

that nobody thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Richard Chamberlain &LR; , who opened Tuesday in San Francisco in
``The Sound of Music.'' Chamberlain was not, apparently, discussing
the show; he was discussing his paintings, which are on exhibit at
the Hanson Gallery in San Francisco in conjunction with the show.

   WASHINGTON _ The former Justice Department prosecutor who
investigated possible campaign finance violations told Congress
Tuesday that Attorney General Janet Reno should have appointed a
special prosecutor to probe ``five areas'' related to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Labella, who headed the Justice Department's campaign
finance task force from September 1997 to July 1998 when he left to
take over as interim U.S. attorney in San Diego, declined to go
into the ``nuts and bolts'' of his still-confidential 1998 memo to
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The memo summarized his recommendations after his investigation
into possible illegal campaign fund raising in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella, who testified under subpoena before a panel of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, said disclosing the contents of the
memo would ``cause a chill among every Justice Department attorney
who would fear their internal debates which they rely on'' would
become public.
</P>
<P>
   Although he refused to discuss specific details of his memo,
LaBella did reveal at least one of the five areas during
questioning from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who read the memo
Monday night after the Justice Department turned over the document.
</P>
<P>
   While LaBella did not specifically talk about the area, he
confirmed that passages from the memo read by Specter were
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from the memo, Specter said that LaBella had sought an
investigation of the president and the head of Loral Corp. because
of $1.5 million in donations by the business executive to the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Loral later obtained a waiver from the Clinton administration
allowing the company to do satellite business with China.
</P>
<P>
   Specter also revealed parts of the memo referring to Vice
President Al Gore. The senator said LaBella wrote that ``the vice
president may have given false statements'' to Justice Department
prosecutors and FBI agents when he denied knowing that some of the
money he was raising from his office was put in ``hard money''
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal to use government offices or phones to raise money
for specific political campaigns, money referred to as ``hard
money.'' In contrast, ``soft money'' refers to contributions made
to political parties for general issue advertising or so-called
``party building'' activities.
</P>
<P>
   Specter asked LaBella whether he remembered writing in his memo
that Gore's answers on the ``hard money'' accounts were
``reminiscent of the lack of recollection of the Buddhist temple
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a phrase I used,'' LaBella answered.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he didn't know that an event he attended at a
Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, California was a fund-raiser,
saying initially that he thought it was an act of community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than $100,000 in donations from the temple
event were illicit contributions from people who were reimbursed
for their donations by the temple, which is barred from making
political contributions because it is a tax-exempt religious
institution. In the memo, LaBella reportedly accused top Justice
Department officials of using ``intellectually dishonest'' double
standards by endorsing independent counsels to investigate
Cabinet-level officials _ while opposing the appointment of
Clinton, Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and former White
House aide Harold Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes is a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New
York. Reno, while avoiding comment on specific charges in the memo,
has downplayed LaBella's strong language and his questioning of the
motives of her top aides.
</P>
<P>
   During his Tuesday testimony, LaBella said Ickes was involved in
a number of the areas that he investigated. ``He touched on a lot
of investigations,'' LaBella said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's refusal to appoint an independent counsel for campaign
fund-raising has drawn intense fire from Republicans who charge she
is covering for the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But LaBella defended the attorney general, saying: ``She made no
decision to protect anyone. She listened to the advice of other
people and took that advice.''
</P>
<P>
   However, LaBella acknowledged that he and Reno never had a
``detailed'' discussion of his memo and that his relationship with
the department is ``quite cool.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBella resigned from the Justice Department in 1999 after
Clinton nominated another candidate for the regular San Diego post.
He is now senior managing director of Decision Strategies/Fairfax
International, an investigative and consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.

 PERSONALS: Standing on the Corners Watching  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mural incorporating a  &UR; Lawrence Ferlinghetti &LR;  poem, painted by
graffiti artists two years ago on the outside of the Black Cat, a
restaurant at Kearny and Broadway in San Francisco, was painted
over last week. Poetry fans who contacted Personals are upset by
what they see as the loss of ``an unpublished original poem by our
poet laureate'' in the restaurant's attempt to ``attract the
Financial District lunch crowd,'' but the poet himself is unfazed
and the Black Cat's owner,  &UR; Reed Hearon &LR; , has an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti, who wrote the untitled poem in exchange for free
meals, says he's not upset because his words were barely legible on
the wall. He hopes, however, that Hearon reinstates the poem on his
menu, where it used to be printed.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon says the work will be honored in a more profound medium
than the menu, when a permanent tile version is installed in about
six weeks. Hearon had the mural removed, he said, because police
told him about an Alcoholic Beverage Control Department ruling that
requires bar owners to remove graffiti; and because the
mural-bearing wall had ``turned into a graffiti magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges that he is trying to attract a Montgomery Street crowd
are unfounded, he said. ``Most of the people I've seen from the
Financial District are visiting other establishments on Broadway
during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A historic marker unveiled about a year ago at Webster Street
and Atlantic Avenue in Alameda, Calif., near the confluence of
Walgreens, Starbucks and Kinko's, notes that it was ``Donated by
Browman Development to the Housing Authority of the City of
Alameda.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaque marks the ``Site of the former Rosefield Packing Co.,
incorporated on August 24, 1926.  &UR; Joseph Rosefield &LR;  was the
inventor of hydrogenated peanut butter. Before this process was
developed, peanut butter would separate and quickly spoil. Mr.
Rosefield received a patent for his process in 1923 and three more
patents as he improved the process over the next seven years. Under
Mr. Rosefield's guidance, his packing company in Alameda became the
largest peanut butter manufacturer in the nation, with up to 90
employees working three eight-hour shifts, seven days a week. The
product was sold under the name of Skippy Peanut Butter. Tours of
the facility were enjoyed by generations of Alameda schoolchildren.
The Alameda plant closed in 1974. The Skippy brand continues to be
popular today.''

&HT;     LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SAY BANKRUPTCY REFORM GOES TOO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four liberal Democratic lawmakers joined labor and
consumer advocates Tuesday to denounce a bankruptcy reform bill
they say excessively punishes debtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate has been unfairly slanted towards the credit card
companies and the banks at the expense of vulnerable Americans,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``This Congress should (not pass
a bill that comes) at the expense of large numbers of citizens who
the bankruptcy laws are supposed to help, not hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., called the legislation ``an
anti-consumer bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of bankruptcy reform say the current law makes it too
easy for debtors to escape their obligations, even if they are able
to repay some of what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   To make it more difficult for a debtor to declare bankruptcy,
the House passed a bill that would require a debtor to pay some
debts if the debtor's income after important living expenses
totaled more than $1,200 a year over five years. A Senate bill
would set the threshold at $2,000 a year. Both bills are pending in
a Senate-House conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal critics of the bills say the changes go too far.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said people hit with large medical
bills from catastrophic illness should not be held responsible for
the costs they incur.
</P>
<P>
   ``A middle class family suddenly hit by half a million dollars
in medical bills didn't deliberately undertake debt except in
(saying yes to) the heart transplant,'' he said. Nadler asked
rhetorically, ``That's voluntarily undertaking debt?''
</P>
<P>
   A study by Harvard University law professor Elizabeth Warren
indicated that one-third of all personal bankruptcies filed last
year were related to substantial medical costs of the filer or a
family member.
</P>
<P>
   ``People under certain circumstances should have the opportunity
for a fresh start,'' Nadler said. ``They shouldn't be burdened with
impossible debt for the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers who oppose the bill also found fault with
provisions that would allow creditors to dip into debtors' pensions
and would strip tenants who declare bankruptcy of the right to stay
in their homes even if they are behind on rent. Currently, all
pension plans are untouchable to creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bankruptcy bill has the potential to be one of the great
injustices of the 106th Congress,'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed a ``small victory'' when he announced that other
senators he had spoken with were willing to remove what he termed
the ``pension grab.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also envisioned poor people being thrown out on
the street because their landlords would be allowed to evict them
easier under the bankruptcy bill's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said the provision ``takes away from the tenant the
right not to be summarily evicted'' when they declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone and the other lawmakers charged that bill supporters
were favoring large lending institutions over the public. Wellstone
said he works in ``a Senate of, by and for credit card companies.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters that
passing a bankruptcy bill is ``a high priority for this Congress
and for me.''

FOCUS ON SCHOOLCHILDREN

<TEXT>
<P>
   US senators have a choice. As the Capitol Hill debate on public
education turns serious Wednesday, senators can try to make
political points or they can do something to help the nation's
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers aren't hopeful. In a presidential election year,
partisanship is the easy path. So Republicans are likely to insist
stubbornly on block-grant proposals that shift too much discretion
to the states and encourage high-risk voucher programs, while
Democrats, if their more sensible programmatic proposals don't
prevail, are threatening to muddy the bill with gun-control
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The better course would be cooperation on specific steps,
tightly focused on classroom improvements that have already shown
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Senators would do well to remember that the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act was originally passed in 1965 specifically
to supply help to districts where students were receiving poor
educations because their states had let them down. What progress
there has been in closing the gap between poor districts and
wealthier communities is largely attributable to federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   When the law was last reauthorized in 1994, Congress took a
crucial step by requiring states to set high standards for all
students, eliminating longstanding disparities in many states under
which less was expected of poor children, so they were taught less.
</P>
<P>
   The bill before the Senate would take a step backward with its
block grant approach. This would not, as advertised, give local
districts, parents, and teachers more control. It would merely
shift direction from Washington to the states, which have proven
themselves notoriously variable.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the proposals to be advanced by Democrats  &UR; today &LR;  are
far more promising, focusing on hiring new, well-trained teachers,
repairing school buildings, and supporting after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, however, Senator Edward M. Kennedy is threatening
to offer an amendment that would restrict gun purchases at gun
shows. Kennedy is understandably frustrated that this provision,
which passed the Senate last year, has been stuck in a conference
committee that hasn't met for eight months. Still, it has no
business in the education bill, which should be fought on its
merits.
</P>
<P>
   Political infighting would be the easy course for both parties.
But the irony is that a strictly partisan debate, while clearly
betraying the educational needs of a generation, might not produce
political advantage either. Voters hate gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate can do the hard work of bipartisan compromise, it
will regain a measure of public respect and help the nation's
future.

BATTLE OF MEDIA GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner and Disney are locked in a serious tussle over the
costs of cable programming and access. This clash of the media
titans is viewed by many as competition on a grand scale. But it
could just as well be a grand conspiracy. There's nothing like a
celebrity ruckus to attract attention, and everyone knows that in
show business, publicity is the name of the game (just spell the
name right!)
</P>
<P>
   The battle is nasty enough to inspire a legion of Hollywood
scriptwriters. Disney, the parent of the ABC television network,
wants Time Warner to include its channels in the basic package the
cable giant offers to its subscribers. But Time Warner says Disney
charges too much for its popular programming. No deal, no place on
Time Warner's cable network, and 3.5 million households around the
country were blacked out Monday night, looking at nothing but an
eerie, dare we say Orwellian, message from Time Warner: ``Disney
has taken ABC away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday ABC was back on again, and negotiations had been
extended until July. So millions of Americans will be able to see
Saturday's Kentucky Derby after all. And the latest quiz craze,
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' won't be zapped. But viewers
already know who wants to be a zillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The game of corporate chicken left consumers either belligerent
or bemused, depending on how much they wanted to watch people vie
for big bucks for remembering which letter comes between A and C.
But there is a more serious portent to all the media
conglomeration, especially as Time Warner looks to merge yet again
with America Online, the Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   We have already seen how a cable giant is capable of blocking
access to programming in an economic dispute. The aggregation of
vast power in a limited number of hands also aggregates control.
What is to prevent some media mammoth from keeping unfavorable
content _ an expose of one of its subsidiaries, for example _ off
the air?
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission ought to step in soon with
some ground rules. Otherwise, consumers will be like the victims in
the old fable: When the elephants fight, only the grass gets
trampled.

RACE A RAW NERVE IN US, PROFESSOR TELLS PRESS GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Calling the issue of race ``America's rawest nerve,''
Cornel West says the nation will not heal its racial wounds without
a fuller examination of the ``dark side'' of its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deep legacy of white supremacy,'' said West, a
professor of Afro-American studies at Harvard. ``And it's a history
that's often held at arm's length.''
</P>
<P>
   West was on a panel of Harvard officials Tuesday that included
Anthony Appiah, an Afro-American studies professor; William Julius
Wilson, the Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser university professor ; and
Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Afro-American studies
department, as the International Press Institute's World Congress
moved to the Harvard campus.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the hundreds of IPI journalists visiting Boston
attended seminars on international diplomacy and the changing media
universe. Tuesday, the discussion shifted to two of this nation's
hot-button social issues _ race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gilligan _ who is Harvard's Patricia Albjerg Graham
Professor of Gender Studies and moderated the second panel _ echoed
West when she suggested that society had failed to come to grips
with the reality of changing gender roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in the midst of a remarkable social and cultural
transformation on the subject of gender,'' she said. ``And I think
it's one of the least talked about subjects.''

   The unifying theme of Gilligan's panel was the matter had moved
well past traditional calls for equality of the sexes. The idea is
``not simply to repopulate the heirarchy, but to rethink the
heirarchy itself,'' said panlist Lani Guinier, the first black
woman to become a tenured Harvard Law professor.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that point, Guinier _ best known as President Clinton's
unsuccessful nominee to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division _ recounted how the height requirement for the New York
City Police Department had been modified because it discrimated
against women. More important than the new standard, she said, was
that female officers were able to patrol dangerous housing projects
by non-traditional means, proactively reaching out to potential
trouble makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here, is to think about the women's approach to
conflict resoultion as perhaps a functional way for all police
officers to think about dissipating conflict,'' Guinier said.
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Swanee Hunt, director of Harvard's Women and Public
Policy Program, discussed the ``Women Waging Peace'' initiative,
which hopes to use grass-roots women's groups to forestall or
ameliorate local armed conflicts by capitalizing on their ``ability
to connect and organize at a very personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   While Guinier and Hunt talked about the struggle to incorporate
women's voices into society, West lamented a ``pigmentocratic''
society unable to confront its racist past. ``It's very difficult
for the American empire of the 21st century to look closely,
candidly, critically, at its dark side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Wilson traced racial tensions to two decades of
economic decline and federal retreat from American cities. The
solution, he said, may rest with ``metropolitanism,'' the idea that
cities and suburbs are ``economically interdependent'' and vital to
each other's survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of metro regions in the United States, as a well as
the social inclusion of its residents, ... may well depend on the
success in eliminating the urban-suburban divide,'' he said.

YOUNGER MEN VALUE FAMILIES MORE, STUDY FINDS

<P>
   While previous studies portrayed American men as more concerned
about power, prestige, or money than about their families, new
findings by the Radcliffe Public Policy Center indicate men between
the ages of 20 and 39 are more likely to put family matters first.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing its national survey of attitudes about work, life,
and family relationships Tuesday, Radcliffe said the findings
suggest a generational shift, with younger men breaking ranks with
their fathers and grandfathers, who for years shaped the image of
American males.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by Harris Interactive and financed by
FleetBoston Financial Corp., involved telephone interviews with 482
men and 526 women.
</P>
<P>
   Of the male participants between ages 20 and 39, about 82
percent placed time with family members at the top of a wish list
that also included flexible work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 71 percent said they would give up a portion of
their pay to ensure they could have more time with their families.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 80 percent of the men between ages 40 and 49 said
doing work that allowed them to utilize their skills was more
important than community service, additional family time, or job
security.
</P>
<P>
   Of men 50 to 64, 82 percent said they were chiefly concerned
with developing good relationships with their coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men who are in their 60s have always seen themselves as
sole breadwinners,'' said Paula Raymancq, director of the Radcliffe
Public Policy Center. ``If you look at the research conducted over
the years, you will find that the baby boomers in their 40s and 50s
grew up thinking of themselves as primary breadwinners. Younger
men, however, are working alongside women and they are married to
women who have comparable full-time jobs. So they are more likely
to talk about sharing family responsibilities and about equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Poussaint, a Harvard University psychologist and director
of the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston, said other issues
also might be in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older men may no longer have children at home,'' he said.
``Their interests may have changed. With the younger men, family is
more immediate.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harris pollsters interviewed women ages 20 to 39, they
pinpointed another trend: 25 percent said they did not plan to have
children, up from 19 percent in a 1993 survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are young women with dual-income parents or people with
single parents who now feel that it is impossible to do it all,''
Rayman said. ``These young women are not saying they are not going
to get married, but they are ambivalent about having children. And,
what we are seeing is that the average age for women to have
children has increased from 21 years old to approximately 27 years
old, a five-year jump for the first child.''

   LOMPOC, Calif. _ The Santa Ynez Valley stretches west through
central Santa Barbara County, reaching toward this small city and
the Pacific Ocean beyond. It's a land of relaxed beauty, where
narrow roads curl through the knobby, windswept Santa Rita Hills,
through rows of walnut trees and strawberry fields, past acres of
cabbage and broccoli and, here and there, a few sparse vineyards.
It's certainly not Burgundy, where grapevines are planted to the
edge of the highway, or Napa Valley, where the wineries are as
densely packed as a suburb of split-levels, but make no mistake:
This is wine country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the Santa Barbara wine region has grown
astonishingly. Since 1997, the amount of land planted with grapes
has shot up to more than 18,000 acres, from about 10,000, and the
number of wineries in the county has almost doubled in the last
decade, to about 50. Most of that acreage was planted by big
wineries like Beringer, Robert Mondavi and Kendall-Jackson, which,
recognizing the quality of Santa Barbara grapes and the relative
affordability of the land, bought up huge tracts in the Los Alamos
Valley and the Santa Maria Valley to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But the true measure of excitement here is focused a little
farther south, on the western Santa Ynez Valley, where smaller
parcels of land, ranging from just a couple of acres to a few
hundred, have been planted with pinot noir and chardonnay grapes.
Growers expect these Burgundian varietals to flourish in the cool
climate that is moistened by fogs blowing in almost daily off the
Pacific Ocean, and the first wines, made from vines planted three
years ago, show excellent potential. The chardonnays are almost
crisp with citrus flavors, while the pinot noirs, flamboyant in
their youth, should achieve elegance as the vines mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see some brilliant wines coming out of Santa
Barbara,'' said Alan Phillips, the winemaker and general manager of
both Foley Estate and LinCourt Vineyards, which have planted about
250 acres, mostly of chardonnay and pinot noir, on undulating
slopes facing south and west. ``The cool climate wines are
absolutely stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally exciting are the passionate young winemakers like Steve
Beckmen, 31, of Beckmen Vineyards and Andrew Murray, 28, of Andrew
Murray Vineyards, who have seized on Rhone varietals, particularly
syrah, and have planted new hillside vineyards in the warmer
central part of the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The best Santa Barbara syrahs are rich and complex wines,
layered with nuances as in the northern Rhone Valley of France,
syrah's home territory, rather than lightly likable, as so many
California syrahs have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started making syrah, I think there were four other
people in the state who were doing it,'' said Bob Lindquist of
Qupe, who made his first syrah for Zaca Mesa in 1982 and who saw
the potential for Rhone grapes early on in the Santa Ynez Valley.
``Now, I think there are 25 syrah makers in Santa Barbara County
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara is not the only booming region in California. San
Luis Obispo County, the Monterey Bay region and Sonoma County have
all experienced similar rapid development. But this sleepy county
about 100 miles north of Los Angeles may be the most unlikely
California region to be joining the top echelon of wine producers.
It's far better known for the relaxed city of Santa Barbara, for
its beautiful hills that have offered refuge to the likes of Ronald
Reagan and Michael Jackson and for its 18th-century adobe missions.
The missions were the first in the county to make wine, a sweet and
sturdy beverage that no doubt had its secular as well as its
sacramental uses. Wine was made in the county right up through
Prohibition but seemed to die out after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the late 1960s and early '70s, well after the
California wine industry began to take off, did Santa Barbara again
try its hand at grape growing and winemaking. Pioneers like
Firestone Vineyards, Zaca Mesa and Sanford &AMP; Benedict arrived, with
little idea of what grapes to plant and where.
</P>
<P>
   Many early arrivals planted cabernet sauvignon in areas ill
suited for the grape, producing weedy, vegetal wines. Others
planted chenin blanc and riesling, noble grapes that have never
achieved much popularity in California. But some got it right
almost immediately. The 130-acre Sanford &AMP; Benedict vineyard, the
first planted in the western part of the Santa Ynez, has been a
superior source of pinot noir and chardonnay grapes for 25 years,
while the 900-acre Bien Nacido vineyard, first planted 30 years
ago, graces the labels of many of the county's finest bottles.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'80s, acclaimed wineries like Au Bon Climat, Qupe,
Babcock Vineyards and Sanford Winery were firmly established, soon
to be joined by others like Foxen Vineyard, the Lane Tanner Winery
and Fess Parker Winery and Vineyard. Big organizations like
Beringer had begun to make inroads, but the winemakers were largely
a small, close-knit community, many of whom had learned their craft
together, and the county reflected their irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Jim Clendinen of Au Bon Climat, an
iconoclastic winemaker who wore long, shaggy hair after it had been
stylish and a goatee before goatees came back, worked feverishly to
draw attention to Santa Barbara wines, traveling the world to tout
their quality. In Santa Barbara County, he and Lindquist of Qupe
had a cooperative agreement to share production facilities at the
Bien Nacido vineyard, an arrangement that has set a collegial
standard for the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Clendinen has been huge, as far as his ambassadorial role
in bringing attention to the area and paving the way for others to
follow, and to illustrate what the potential of Santa Barbara
County could be,'' said Greg Brewer, 31, of Brewer-Clifton, one of
the county's hottest winemakers today. ``In the late '80s and early
'90s, he was a larger-than-life figure here.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they had eked out a reputation for seductive, elegant
pinot noirs and ripe yet nicely acidic chardonnays as well as a
scattering of good syrahs, Santa Barbara wines were still largely a
footnote in California.
</P>
<P>
   But that made Santa Barbara all the more attractive to wealthy
wine lovers in Southern California, who saw greater opportunities
to make an immediate mark in the wine industry nearby, rather than
in Northern California, where they would be greeted with yawns, if
they were noticed at all. That and the fact that prime Santa Ynez
vineyard sites are a relative bargain, under $20,000 an acre,
compared with $35,000 to $45,000 an acre in the Carneros district
of Napa Valley, by one winemaker's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Melville, who owns a securities firm in Los Angeles,
actually bought land in Napa Valley before settling on several
hundred acres in the Santa Rita Hills, where he built Melville
Vineyards and Winery. He hired Brewer to oversee his operations.
Melville will release its first bottles, from the 1999 vintage,
later this year. The families of both Beckmen and Murray moved up
from Los Angeles, choosing Santa Barbara over Northern California
to build wineries. Fess Parker, the Hollywood actor who played Davy
Crockett and Daniel Boone in the '50s and '60s, opted for elbow
room and wide open spaces in Santa Barbara County in the late '80s,
over densely populated Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the county, Parker points to great untapped
potential in the region, and with recent purchases in both the
western Santa Rita Hills and the central Santa Ynez, he is doing
his best to tap it. He owns hotels in Santa Barbara and in Los
Olivos, a quiet town of cafes, galleries and wine-tasting rooms,
where Parker is trying to develop a world-class restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals here are not modest,'' he said. ``I want this to be
the French Laundry of Santa Barbara County. Napa Valley wasn't any
fun until the restaurants came in.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Parker's winery, a sprawling ranch-style building with a
rambling veranda, is on Foxen Canyon Road, a winding country lane
of stunning vistas of hills and valleys, sprawling coastal oak
trees and wild flowers, with hawks and vultures drifting overhead.
While most of the small wineries on this route that links the Santa
Ynez Valley with the Santa Maria Valley welcome visitors, Parker's
is one of the few equipped to handle big groups, complete with a
large tasting room, a gift shop where you can buy wines, local
foods and of course, coonskin caps.
</P>
<P>
   Such an operation sends cold chills through many in the county,
who see wineries as harbingers of the kind of large-scale
development they detest.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jams are unknown in Santa Ynez, short of the tourists
who slow to gawk at the twirling windmills in the town of Solvang,
where the main draw is not wineries but a quaint and kitschy
Scandinavian theme with plenty of clogs and shoppes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of where Napa was 25 years ago,'' said Gary Burk,
a marketing and production executive with Au Bon Climat and Qupe,
who incidentally makes very good pinot noirs and chardonnays under
his own label, Costa de Oro. ``Are we going to stay a little
country place that makes wines, or are there going to be wine
trains and bed-and-breakfasts all up and down Foxen Canyon Road? I
don't know if everybody wants that. Some people will welcome that,
I think especially the newer people. The older people prefer making
wines in a more casual environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow development, the county has put up numerous
regulatory hurdles _ ``the madness,'' Phillips, the Foley
winemaker, calls it. Well-financed concerns like Foley Estate can
battle their way through the obstacles, but some smaller winemakers
are opting out.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer-Clifton, which makes minute quantities of pinot noir and
chardonnay from purchased grapes, is moving its winemaking
operation to a warehouse in the city of Lompoc, which is within the
county lines but is not bound by its rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lompoc is a funny town that's screaming for business,'' Brewer
said. ``Santa Barbara County is very resistant to more wineries
going in. There are all kinds of regulations, permits and delays.
It's a long, arduous process.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Though the regulatory tensions are bound to continue (the latest
debate was over a rare salamander that received an emergency
listing as an endangered species, grinding several winery projects
to a halt), one thing the wineries seem to be figuring out is to
how to use the climate for the maximum advantage of each particular
grape.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Ynez Valley is blessed with long growing seasons with
plenty of sunshine, offset by natural, fog-induced maritime
air-conditioning, a product of the east-west valleys that are a
peculiar feature of the jutting coastline below Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique combination,'' said Lindquist of Qupe. ``We're
far enough south so that we don't get hit by the rains that come
down from the northwest, and yet because the coastline is turned
around we have this tremendous cooling effect. The soils are
important, but not nearly as important as the climate.''
</P>
<P>
   That moderate climate, Murray of Andrew Murray Vineyards said,
is what gives the Rhone varietals such potential in the central
Santa Ynez. ``Too warm and you might get a more insipid-style
syrah,'' he said. ``Too cool and it might be too lean. Somewhere
right in the middle, you get your darkest, richest wines,
full-bodied but still elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other places in California make good syrahs, too, Murray
admitted, but he believes that the long Santa Barbara growing
season is a definite advantage. ``We were picking syrah at the end
of November,'' he said. ``That's when you can really eke out not
only those fruit flavors, but those flavors of earth and spices and
violets, the real pretty side of syrah, which you find often in the
syrahs of this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The California wine boom has sent the demand for grapes soaring,
forcing many winemakers to seek new supplies or to grow their own.
Chris Whitcraft, who has been buying grapes to make small
quantities of pinot noir and chardonnay since 1985, had to get his
pinot noir from Sonoma County in 1999. When the demand exceeds the
supply, the small winemakers are the first to lose out, one of the
reasons that Beckmen of Beckmen Vineyards feels more secure with
his own supply of grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, having 80 acres of syrah, I get calls every day
asking if I have syrah grapes available to sell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that the expansion can be too rapid, and that a fall
will be inevitable. ``Will there be a home for all these grapes,
especially if the economy takes a dip?'' Lindquist asked. ``Both
'98 and '99 were small crop years. But in '97, there were more
grapes than we could handle. A lot of winemakers have short
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the wines themselves are concerned, a Santa Barbara
signature has been elusive. The future looks very good for syrahs,
which can be spicy, nuanced and elegant. Some optimistic winemakers
even expect that the eastern end of the Santa Ynez, the warmest
part of the valley, will one day produce good Bordeaux varietals
like cabernet sauvignon and merlot, grapes that have failed
miserably in other parts of the valley.
</P>
<P>
   But most people agree that the county's greatest successes have
been its richly textured, sweet pinot noirs and its chardonnays,
some of which resemble Chablis in their blend of citrus and mineral
flavors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some like Brewer, who can sound almost mystical discussing
how Brewer-Clifton wines reflect the soil from which the vines
emerge, this is a noble challenge. Others like Richard Dore, an
owner of Foxen Vineyards, seem to say, slow down and catch your
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing this for 30 years, and we're just figuring
out where to plant stuff, let alone how to make it,'' Dore said.
``In Burgundy they've had 3,000 years to get it right.''

JAPANESE WHO HAVE LIVED ABROAD FIND TROUBLE FITTING IN BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When Ayako Shima first returned to Japan after spending
her secondary school years in South America, she found herself
reveling in a newfound power to make decisions and express
opinions, abilities that set her apart in classrooms where no one
ever seemed to volunteer to speak.
</P>
<P>
   But as fellow students began to shun her and it became harder to
make friends, she, like many other Japanese who have lived long
stretches outside their country, gradually began to perceive that
the sense of freedom that had become second nature abroad could be
a major handicap back home.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Shima, who is a 21-year-old college student in
Tokyo, was biting her tongue instead of speaking out, masking the
fact that she spoke two foreign languages fluently and making her
speech vague with the maybes, perhapses and other hedging
expressions that pepper conversational Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating not to state my feelings, but people here
call you bossy and get angry at you when you do,'' Shima said. ``In
Japan I've discovered that you always have to express yourself in a
very careful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Japanese started to live in the West and travel there
in large numbers in the 1970s, people have been predicting dramatic
changes for one of the world's most insular societies. But in a
country already famous for keeping foreigners at arm's length,
returning Japanese say that the taint of other cultures is often
enough for them to be regarded as somehow no longer fully Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon, experienced by many Japanese expatriates, is
perhaps the most dramatic measure of the challenge this nearly
ethnically homogeneous nation faces as it struggles to come to
terms with the pressures of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   In a reaction that is being called the ``U-turn phenomenon'' by
sociologists, Japanese who are frustrated by their reception back
home and are no longer willing to put up with the society's many
strictures are often going back overseas as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The problems they encounter, many say, go far beyond the simple
use of language, encompassing the whole range of human relations,
from the stressful rhythms of daily life and workplace politics to
a mechanical educational system and affairs of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, many overseas Japanese say that the adjustment
required to fit back into their society is often more traumatic
than the adaptations required in moving abroad.
</P>
<P>
   School-age returnees, for example, say they are often taunted as
``gaijin,'' a mildly derogatory word for foreigner, by their
schoolmates. Many young people also say they feel saddened and
empty by the emotional reserve that is the norm here: eye contact
is rare in Japan, hugging and touching are far less common than in
Western cultures, and simple gestures like smiling or holding the
door for strangers are almost unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Companies hiring new recruits often frown on Japanese with
foreign high school or college educations as insufficiently
socialized into the ways of Japan, which place an emphasis on
outright acceptance of directives from above and preserving group
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   And even managers sent overseas by their own companies are
routinely assigned to back-office jobs until their superiors can be
sure that their foreign ways have dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first returned, after eight years in the United States,
my boss would tell me flatly that America had spoiled me, and kept
me in a position where I would have really limited contact with
customers,'' said Toyokazu Matsumoto, 51, a manager with a major
Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a meeting in Japan you are not supposed to react to things
quickly,'' Matsumoto said. ``I still find it difficult not to show
some reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of experiences like these, many returning adults,
including Matsumoto, are opting to send their children to
international schools in Japan, where they can escape the heavy
rote learning that prevails in Japanese schools and maintain their
individuality without being made to feel like oddities.
</P>
<P>
   With its population dwindling more rapidly than any other
industrialized country, Japan has recently begun to debate the
extent to which it will need to attract workers from other
countries to work in this country. The experiences of expatriate
Japanese suggest, however, that even before it comes to terms with
new immigrants, this country will first have to learn how to better
accommodate its own citizens who have lived abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of assimilation pressure here is very strong,'' said
Kazuhiro Ebuchi, a professor of cultural anthropology at the
University of the Air, in Tokyo. ``Even people who speak good
English are teased here because Japanese should speak English in
the Japanese way. Japanese people like to say that we appreciate
cultural differences, but this is only lip service. In fact, there
is not much place for difference here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to official statistics, the number of Japanese
studying overseas increased nearly tenfold over 15 years, to
186,827 in 1999. From 1988 to 1998, the number of Japanese
officially working overseas increased from 80,000 to 298,000.
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion polls here have shown that by a substantial
margin, Japanese expatriates are happier overseas than they are
back home. This is particularly true for women, and especially so
for those who have lived in Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the factors cited in these polls are obvious, such as
the more spacious homes and lower cost of living that are typical
in the West. But the polls have also revealed more subtle reasons.
Some cited, for example, the habit of people in Japan to identify
themselves strongly with groups, such as their company or school,
instead of the individualism practiced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Females often cite the lower status of women in Japan than in
many other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   When Makiko Okada, who is 48, returned from the United States in
the early 1960s, people like her were so unusual that she was
turned away by public schools. ``It was very traumatic, because
there were no other returnees around me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of Japanese living overseas has reduced the
oddity factor considerably since then, but in many ways Okada, who
is now the director of a program for returning students at
International Christian University High School in Tokyo, says the
adjustments she has felt compelled to make as an adult are even
more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always uncomfortable with the groupism in Japan, but as
I have matured, I find what bothers me most is the nonegalitarian
ways of this society,'' she said. ``Japan is a much more male
oriented society than the United States, although I think that is
changing a bit. Still, as a female, I constantly have to tone down
my views when I give an opinion, and work very hard not to
intimidate my peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women told of having to remember not to smile too freely
around men in the workplace, lest they take it as a sexual advance,
or relearning the habit of keeping their voices in the high, dulcet
tones still commonly adopted by working women.
</P>
<P>
   Chihiro Shiono, a 22-year-old law student at Tokyo University,
spent much of her childhood in England, Wales and Malaysia,
returning home for brief stints before her family moved overseas
again. Even from an early age, she said, the intense social
pressures to conform grated her.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a little girl I was teased a lot at school,'' she said.
``People called me a boy because in England I had learned to sit on
the floor with my legs crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   To ease her adjustment when she returned to Japan briefly for
secondary school, Shiono's parents deliberately selected a school
where returnees were common. But even there, when she spoke to
another returnee in English in one of her first days at the school,
she was bluntly warned by the girl that to do so placed her at risk
of becoming an outcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really frightened me,'' Shiono said. ``I never spoke
English like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   As she grew older, Shiono became more at ease with her
international identity, but the chafing sensation of her
separateness never completely faded. In junior high school, girls
teased her cruelly for having boys for friends, as was common in
England, but rare for that age in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   She also felt odd in subjects like literature, where students
were expected to recite the teacher's interpretations of whatever
was being read rather than expressing their own views. Later,
entering college, she felt uncomfortable during the near compulsory
college rounds of bottoms-up beer drinking, known as icki-icki.
</P>
<P>
   For Shiono, like for many other returnees, the impact of
experiences like these has often made her itch to return to a life
overseas. ``I don't want to remain in Japan for the rest of my
life. I came back to Japan to understand Japanese values, but I
want to return overseas sometime soon.''

MULLEN NEW BIOGEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The line of Jims continues in the chief executive officer's
suite at Biogen Corp.
</P>
<P>
   James ``Jim'' Mullen was named the company's CEO Tuesday. Mullen
became the Cambridge, Mass. company's president 17 months ago after
the abrupt departure of James ``Jim'' Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen's promotion, which will take effect at Biogen's annual
meeting on June 16, was announced by Jim Vincent, the company's
long-time chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, 41, raised Biogen's international profile by registering
and launching the company's multiple sclerosis treatment Avonex in
Europe. He was vice president of international operations when
Tobin was president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin's surprise decision to leave Biogen in December 1998, over
uneasiness that Vincent was second-guessing his decisions, led to
Mullen replacing him as president and chief operating officer.
Vincent, who was chairman when Tobin left, returned temporarily as
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, 60, will remain Biogen's chairman when he relinquishes
the chief executive's role next month. He said he has known Mullen
for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I would have made him president when I started
the search for a president six years ago,'' Vincent said. ``But he
just needed more management experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, who ran Biogen from 1985 to 1997 when Tobin took over,
is credited with turning a troubled company into one of the
nation's most successful biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who is now president and chief executive of Boston
Scientific Corp. in Natick, Mass., said Mullen is ``one of the best
young managers and I am glad he is getting the recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen said he has a solid relationship with Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When questions and problems arise, we talk them over and kick
ideas around,'' Mullen said. ``In the nearly year and a half since
Jim (Tobin) left, we have reorganized the management team, expanded
the pipeline and moved a lot of (Avonex) product. Biogen is
becoming a global marketing company''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts applauded Mullen's promotion. They said
Biogen remains one of the nation's most solid biotech companies,
dominating the multiple sclerosis drug market with Avonex, which
last year had sales of $621 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also stumbled last fall when it stopped six
clinical trials that used Antova, one of its most promising
experimental drugs, after some patients suffered blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing intensive research over the last six months
to learn what happened,'' said Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen's shares closed at $58.9375, up 75 cents in Nasdaq
trading.

`STUBBORN' GENERAL FACES BITTERSWEET RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUTTGART, Germany _ General Wesley K. Clark's career has been a
succession of high notes: No. 1 in the West Point class of 1966, a
Rhodes scholar, key peace negotiator in the Bosnia accords at
Dayton, the NATO war hero who won the alliance's only war in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But bittersweet is this retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Clark stepped down Tuesday as head of US European Command and
its 109,000 US troops, and will leave his post Wednesday as NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander. General Joseph W. Ralston, vice chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, takes over both posts.
</P>
<P>
   While a military band played the West Point march as Clark
inspected the troops one final time, the decidedly subdued
atmosphere was due to how Clark is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and General H. Hugh Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had arranged for Clark to
leave his post a few months early. The official explanation was
that it was the doings of bureaucracy: Ralston's term as vice
chairman had ended Feb. 29, and unless he was appointed to a new
post within two months, he had to retire.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials quietly acknowledge a different reason as
well: that Clark for too long wouldn't take no for an answer as he
argued several positions contrary to those held by top Defense
Department brass. The most important disagreement centered on
whether a limited air war against Serbia would force Serb troops
from Kosovo. Clark wanted to use much more firepower, a decision
that in hindsight was largely correct; his superiors, including
President Clinton and many Europeans leaders, often disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark's incredibly bright but he's stubborn,'' said a Pentagon
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``His biggest
error may have been he forgot who was boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Both immediate bosses, Cohen and Shelton, shared the stage with
Clark and Ralston. They spoke only kind words.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should ever doubt either your service or your
success,'' Cohen said to Clark. ``Faced with an adversary who
manufactured a vicious humanitarian nightmare, you responded with
compassion and speed to relieve human suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the war's end, Clark has spent most of his time trying to
keep peace in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians have carried out many
revenge attacks against Serb villagers. But Clark said he is
beginning to see some hope.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he visited Kosovo and said there was an ``increasing
sense of security, the indicators of recovery from strong-arm
ethnic cleansing and even some first budding signs of willingness
to tolerate ethnic differences and cooperate among ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ceremony ended, Cohen departed almost immediately,
skipping Clark's reception. The two men will see each other again
Wednesday in Mons, Belgium, at the NATO command change.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the ceremony was Jeffrey H. Smith, a West Point
classmate of Clark's, a former general counsel to the Central
Intelligence Agency and now a Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very emotional,'' Smith said later, his suitcoat off,
revealing West Point cufflinks. ``I think of all those years, and
all that has happened, and to see Wes succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he expected the four-star general to enter a second
career after 34 years in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Wes, I think he would like to try something very
different for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark declined to speak to reporters after the ceremony. A
spokesman said it was traditional for the departing commander not
to overshadow the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Ralston, who entered the Air Force a year before
Clark and flew 147 combat missions over Laos and North Vietnam,
told reporters that he would now focus on NATO's relationship with
Russia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have an opportunity to see what we can do with our
relationship with the Russians and the Russian military,'' Ralston
said. ``Perhaps we have a window of opportunity now with President
Putin taking over,'' referring to the new Russian leader Vladimir
V. Putin.

AFTER 11-YEAR WAIT, FAMILIES SEE LOCKERBIE TRIAL BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   ZEIST, Netherlands _ The trial of two Lybians charged with
planting the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 opens
Wednesday at a site so out of the way that Jim Swire bought a
second-hand bicycle for $35 in order to save on cab fare.
</P>
<P>
   Swire, a courtly British physician who is one of the leaders of
the families of Pan Am 103's victims, figures it was money well
spent, since he will be monitoring the sessions at the isolated
former US airbase for what could be a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting more than 11 years for the trial take place,
neither Swire nor most of the other families of the 270 victims are
complaining about the remote setting. But many of the relatives of
the victims are reserving judgment on whether justice will be
served by the trial, which is being held here under Scottish law as
the result of an elaborate compromise between Libya and the British
and American governments.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Swire's daughter Flora, those on board the
London-to-New York flight when it was blown out of the sky over
Lockerbie, Scotland, were 189 Americans _ including many college
students heading home for the Christmas break _ 44 Britons, and
passengers from 20 other countries. In addition, 11 residents of
Lockerbie were killed by the debris that rained down on the
Scottish countryside the night of Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Swire has abandoned his practice in England to monitor the trial
and taken a year's lease on an apartment in this sleepy town 32
miles southeast of Amsterdam. Some newfound Dutch friends painted
and decorated it for him.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the American families whom Swire has befriended plan to
attend the proceedings more occasionally. Dozens of Americans,
including Jack and Kathleen Flynn of Montville, N.J, whose son John
was killed, have come over for the trial's opening. Swire, the
Flynns, and the other relatives are antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to get on with it,'' said Swire.
</P>
<P>
   A 100-acre section of Camp Zeist has been legally declared
Scottish soil for the duration of the trial, and nearly $20 million
has been spent converting it into a high-security, high-tech
criminal justice center.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects _ Abelbasset Ali Al Megrahi, 48, and Al Amin
Khalifa Fhimah, 44 _ are held in a specially-built jailhouse that
has four-foot-thick walls that can withstand bombs and tank fire.
They are guarded by a contingent of 200 Scottish police and prison
officers.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors call the first of more than 1,000 witnesses,
the Lybians will walk to the court room through an underground
tunnel and sit behind bullet-proof glass.
</P>
<P>
   A huge gynmasium has been converted into a media center to house
the hundreds of journalists from more than 200 news organizations
who have descended on the area.
</P>
<P>
   It took Herculean judicial and political maneuvering to get this
far. The two suspects were indicted more than eight years ago. They
insisted they were innocent, and Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy
refused to turn them over to western authorities, accusing the
Americans, in particular, of being on a witchhunt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, in an attempt to break the impasse, the United Nations
Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya, but for years the
Libyan leader refused to budge. Wanting to end the international
isolation of his country, and after considerable persuasion by the
likes of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and South African
President Nelson Mandela, Khadafy finally allowed the suspects to
be extradited to the Netherlands in April of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives, including Susan Cohen of New Jersey, whose
20-year-old daughter Theodora was among those on the flight, worry
that the two suspects are scapegoats and that those who
orchestrated the bombing will never be held accountable. Cohen and
her husband, who wrote a book critical of way the families have
been treated, are far from alone in fearing that the geopolitical
stakes are so high that the trial will avoid pointing the finger at
high-ranking officials in the Middle East who ordered the bombing,
and at others in Washington and London who may have failed to
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will try to convince a tribunal of three Scottish
judges sitting without a jury that the two suspects were Libyan
intelligence agents and planted the bomb in retaliation, most
likely, for US warplanes' bombing of Tripoli in 1986. That bombing
was in turn ordered by President Ronald Reagan in retaliation for a
terrorist attack on a West Berlin disco frequented by US soldiers,
which Washington blamed on Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish lawyers defending the two suspects will try to
raise doubts by citing the other theories that prosecutors pursued
before settling on the two Libyan suspects. Specifically, defense
lawyers will argue that the bomb was planted by a convicted
terrorist named Mohammed Abu Talb, an Eyptian-born Palestinian who
led a Syrian-based terrorist group that was intially the prime
suspect. Talb is serving a life sentence for an unrelated attack on
a synagogue in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, lead by Colin Boyd, the Lord Advocate of
Scotland, will bank heavily on its star witness, Abdu Maged Jiacha,
a Libyan intelligence agent who defected to the CIA. Jiacha claims
that the two suspects used their covers as employees at Libyan Arab
Airlines at Malta's airport to slip the bomb into a suitcase on a
flight to Frankfurt. From there, the suitcase was sent onto London
and loaded onto Pan Am Flight 103 at Heathrow Airport, bound for
John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It exploded while the airliner was 31,000 feet above Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the bombing was one of the most extensive
in history. The forensic case is, according to independent
observers, rock solid. There seems little doubt that the bomb was
made of Semtex, the Czech-made explosive that can be undetectable,
and was hidden in a Toshiba radio-cassette player, a device used
before by terrorists in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Less conclusive, however, is the evidence that it was the two
suspects who planted the bomb, and even less conclusive is the case
that they were anything but low-level operatives, put up to the job
by far more senior people.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case has taken a beating in recent months. A
key witness who had initially claimed to have sold to the Libyan
government the sort of electronic timer used to detonate the bomb
has since begun to waffle. An FBI agent who argued that his
colleagues were going down the wrong path by pursuing Talb and
helped steer the investigation toward Libya has since been charged
with tampering with evidence in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd tried to get a postponement last week, saying the defense
had sprung a last-minute list of surprise witnesses. But the
presiding judge, Lord Ranald Ian Sutherland, would have none of it.
Sutherland believes the prosecution, which will outline its case
for months before the defense makes its case, has had plenty of
time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Sutherland, Jim Swire, the Flynns, and the Cohens likely
agree on one thing: After nearly 12 years, it's time to get on with
it.

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ On April 24, shortly before dawn in
Hanoi, a 43-year-old Canadian seamstress named Nguyen Thi Hiep _
convicted of attempting to smuggle heroin out of Vietnam _ was
blindfolded, gagged, and tied to a wooden stake in a field near the
Xuon Phuong detention center in the communist capital of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   There was no one there except the firing squad and a few passing
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Nguyen's family nor the Canadian government had been
alerted _ indeed, officials in Ottawa and the woman's kin in
suburban Toronto were under the impression that the execution had
been postponed indefinitely after Canadian police furnished Vietnam
with new evidence suggesting the woman was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 sharp, the six executioners raised their rifles and
fired a single volley, according to a prisoner who witnessed the
execution and later described it to her family. An hour later, her
husband _ in Hanoi to visit Nguyen _ was hustled to the killing
ground and shown the bullet-torn post and the place where she was
buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was blood all over the ground,'' Tran Hieu told
reporters in a call home to Brampton, Ontario. ``The last shot was
to her head. They already had a hole dug and had a box ready to put
her body in. . . My wife is dead, they killed her.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vietnam celebrates the 25th anniversary of its military
victory over the United States, once-warm relations between the
regime and Canada _ which opposed the Vietnam war and threw its
doors open to American draft dodgers _ have been cast into
diplomatic disarray by Nguyen's execution.
</P>
<P>
   Her case is quickly becoming a cause celebre as Canadians react
with horror to the brutally lethal punishment for a crime hardly
proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Even as the US basks in
dramatically improved relations with the old foe, Canada's ties
with Vietnam are being strained to the snapping point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deplore this absolutely unacceptable conduct of the
government of Vietnam,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien said shortly
after Ottawa announced that it had withdrawn its ambassador to
Hanoi and suspended other diplomatic contacts. It also this week
halted millions of dollars in development aid to the impoverished
Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence, carried out in secret and revealed last week to
stunned Canadian authorities, seemed an almost perverse slap at
Canada's attempts to win pardon for Nguyen and her 74-year-old
mother, still incarcerated in the rat-infested Hanoi facility. The
execution squad opened fire just four days before Vietnam released
12,500 prisoners, including convicted murderers, in a mass amnesty
to mark the victory celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we are shocked is too mild,'' said Reynald Doiron, a
spokesman for Canada's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ``This Canadian
citizen was shot dead . . . after we were given assurances in
writing that she would be spared at least until we could present
new information.''
</P>
<P>
   The execution came only weeks after Canada offered Vietnam new
material from the Toronto Metropolitan Police supporting Nguyen's
claim that she was the unsuspecting dupe of Canadian-based heroin
smugglers. Right to the end, she refused to sign a confession and
adamantly maintained her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, evidence suggests she was guilty of minor greed and
major bad judgement,'' said a Canadian diplomat, requesting
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The execution came almost precisely four years after Nguyen and
her mother, Tran Thi Cam, were arrested at Hanoi's Noi Bai
International Airport on April 25, 1996 while preparing to fly
home. It was their first visit to Vietnam since fleeing as part of
the huge post-war exodus of boat people.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen was caught with 12 pounds of heroin, worth $3.4 million,
concealed in decorative frames of lacquer paintings in her
suitcase. Her mother, also on the trip, was charged as an
accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daugher said Ngueyn had been paid $100 by the
neighbor of a relative in Canada to carry the artwork back home
from Vietnam as a sort of paid favor.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation has been branded a lie by Vietnamese officials.
But Nguyen won surprising support from Toronto police, whose drug
investigators believe she and her mother were unsuspecting mules
tricked by drug smugglers. Toronto police even made a highly
unusual offer to send detectives to Hanoi to plead her case.
</P>
<P>
   The modus operandi was identical to that one used with another
Vietnamese woman recruited by the same man to carry heroin-packed
artwork back to Canada. That woman was apprehended at a Toronto
airport within days of Nguyen's arrest, but released after
detectives became convinced she had been hoodwinked into doing a
``favor'' and had no idea she was carrying narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Nontheless, Nguyen was sentenced to death by a Vietnamese court,
and her elderly mother was handed a life sentence. The only details
of the case that Hanoi has provided Ottawa are in a confusing
eight-page document whose main point seems to be that Nguyen at
first lied about receiving the $100.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Canada gave Vietnam details of the case
involving the second woman and other evidence indicating Nguyen was
not a knowing trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Family members who visted Nguyen over the years said she was
kept in shackles in a squalid cell overrun with rats, cockroaches,
and other vermin. In Brampton's close-knit Vietnamese immigrant
community she had the reputation of a hardworking seamstress whose
life revolved around family, especially her two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now our only hope is that her remains can be released for
cremation in accordance with Buddhist custom,'' said one of the
sons, Tu Le. ``She suffered so badly in this life we need to
perform the ceremonies to help her gain good fortune in the next
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, like several other nations in Southeast Asia, imposes
the death penalty in almost every case involving narcotics
trafficking. The execution of Nguyen marks the first time a
Canadian citizen has received the death penalty on a foreign drug
charge.

IVORY COAST JUNTA CHIEF HINTS THAT HE MAY SEEK ELECTION AS
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Since staging this West African country's
first military coup last Dec. 24, the army has not shied away from
trying on new roles besides politics.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time a couple of months ago when it tried its hand
energetically, if somewhat too energetically, at coaching soccer.
Ivory Coast's national team, the Elephants _ made up mostly of
Ivoirians who play for high-paying European teams and reluctantly
took time off to participate in the African Nations Cup in Ghana _
performed so spiritlessly that they failed to qualify for the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly angered, the country's military rulers forced the
players to make an unexpected detour on their way back to Europe _
to a military camp in Abidjan. Stripped of their passports and
their freedom, not to mention their cell phones, the soccer stars
spent two days at the base taking lessons in civics and patriotism,
and doing pushups.
</P>
<P>
   Then recently soldiers driving sports-utility vehicles bearing
no license plates began patrolling a 25-mile stretch of highway
between Abidjan and Grand-Bassam, a beach resort popular among
expatriates. Bad drivers have been summoned to appear in sweats at
a nearby military base, where they have been lectured and forced to
jog _ and to pay a $7 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic cop, soccer coach, gym teacher _ the army is control in
Ivory Coast, a country that for decades had been one of the few
African nations not to have experienced military rule and still
stands as the richest in French-speaking Africa. More than four
months after an initially popular coup, it remains unclear when the
army will relinquish power _ though most assume that it will happen
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the uncertainty stems from Gen. Robert Guei, the leader
of the junta, who only a few months ago had declared in an address
to the nation that, ``Contrary to what we have seen in many
countries in the sub-region, power does not interest me.'' In
recent months, Guei has eschewed such clarity in favor of coy
comments that suggest that he is, in fact, interested in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guei is behaving more and more like a candidate,'' said one
Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   As the Ivoirian political class and Western diplomats have come
to believe that the general is preparing to present himself as a
presidential candidate, the possibility is likely to complicate
further the country's year-long political crisis. The trouble led
to the overthrow in December of President Henri Konan Bedie, whose
party had been in power since independence from France in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Bourbana, a slum sprawling on a hill next to a lagoon across
from the skyscrapers of downtown Abidjan, Guei's rise was cheered
in December. The residents of Bourbana, mostly northerners or
immigrants who had become targets during Bedie's increasingly
xenophobic administration, still spoke well of the general.
</P>
<P>
   The putrid smell from the lagoon wafted up the hill through the
labyrinth of narrow alleys that criss-cross Bourbana. Women cooked
and sold small items; stagnant water had collected in many alleys,
and pedestrians stepped around them with great difficulty.
Nevertheless, life had improved in Bourbana, said a group of
jobless young men milling around in one of the few open spaces. The
police, they said, no longer harassed them and did not stop them
from setting up small commercial stands along the nearby highway.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this slum, however, some expressed worry about the
repercussions of the candidacy of a man who had seized power
through the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Guei becomes president, it would please us,'' said Seydou
Ouattara, 68, the traditional chief of this community. ``I don't
know how to read or write, so I am not sure, but he's a military
man. And if he becomes president, the whites will not give us
money.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Almost all foreign aid to the Ivory Coast has been suspended
because of the coup. And as the junta delays announcing whether it
will hold elections by October _ the original timetable, which
seems less and less likely now to be respected _ most programs go
unfinanced.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department last month came out strongly against a
possible candidacy by Guei, describing it as ``inappropriate,'' and
any electoral outcome as clouded from the start. Officials from
France and the European Union, however, would be more likely to
countenance his candidacy, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor expected to influence how a Guei candidacy is
accepted abroad is the lack of any other presidential candidate who
is popular nationwide. The leaders of two of the three main parties
are divisive figures, each for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The question over the eligibility of Alassane D. Ouattara, a
former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
contributed to the December coup; a constitutional referendum that
will essentially decide whether he can run has already been
postponed. Whatever the outcome, Ouattara's base is mainly among
Muslim northerners.
</P>
<P>
   The deposed president, Bedie, stirred up hatred against
northerners and immigrants by claiming that some were more Ivoirian
than others. Since the coup, Laurent Gbagbo, another potential
candidate, has taken up that strategy through a newspaper close to
his party, Notre Voie.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whoever becomes the next president will have a hard time
restoring the luster to a country whose commercial capital,
Abidjan, was once called the Paris of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy worsening, banditry has risen. The military
government has responded by increasing summary executions. In
April, Guei announced that 66 bandits had been executed in the
first three months of the year, compared with 33 for the previous
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivoirian League of Human Rights denounced the extra-judicial
killings, saying in a statement that there was nothing to ``boast''
of in this ``sad record.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks against journalists, which occurred in the previous
government, have been notable in several instances. The randomness
of the attacks by soldiers, apparently uncoordinated, have also led
to suggestions that Guei does not have full control over the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Young soldiers began the insurrection in December, displeased
that they had not been paid money owed to them. A mutiny erupted at
a military camp in western Ivory Coast over the same issue in
March, and one soldier was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do what we can for the young soldiers, but they cannot
resort to blackmail,'' Guei said in an interview with Radio France
International at the time. Recently, the general has been pointedly
avoiding the media.
</P>
<P>
   Le Jeune Democrate, an independent daily, and Le National, a
newspaper that was close to the toppled government, have both been
targets in recent months, leading the Committee to Protect
Journalists to protest to Guei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had freedom of speech in the Ivory Coast, but it's
the dimension of the current repression that is cause for worry,''
said Jules Toualy, an editor at Le Jeune Democrate who was held for
five hours by two soldiers after he wrote about the March mutiny.
Toualy, who revealed the identity of his source after he was
tortured, has now become a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers raided Le National twice after the paper published
articles critical of the general. One time they fired shots into
the ceiling and forced journalists to do push-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that soldiers do whatever they wish,'' said
Theodore Brouhaud, an editor at Le National. ``They go wherever
they want.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When soldiers visited his newsroom, Brooss said, they asked each
journalist to do 100 push-ups. ``They would force us onto our knees
or outside the office so that we would be in the sun for 15
minutes,'' he said. ``Then they would let us under the shade and
then back again under the sun. It was a game for them. It lasted
two hours. We had marks on our wrists from all the push-ups.''

GORE OFFERS $500M PLAN TO TEST, TREAT DRUG ADDICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore Tuesday proposed spending
$500 million to help states test and treat drug addicts who pass
through the criminal justice system, a move Gore said would reduce
repeat criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Outlining his strategy for crime control in an address delivered
in Atlanta, the presumed Democratic nominee urged a policy of ``get
clean to get out, stay clean to stay out'' to keep released
prisoners from returning to a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was noteworthy for its deviation from the
punishment-focused, tough-on-crime message candidates in both
parties have sought to convey. Crime control packages on Capitol
Hill as well have tended toward increasing penalties for criminals,
including expanding the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Crime continues to show up in opinion polls as an important
concern to voters, although crime is decreasing nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Drug treatment for inmates, while appearing to be a softer
approach to reducing crime, is supported by many criminal justice
experts, who say it is the best way to stop repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies show it's just about the best investment you can make
right now in the criminal justice system,'' said William Williford,
assistant commissioner for program services in the New York State
Department of Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 75 percent of the 1.8 million people
incarcerated nationwide suffering from a drug or alcohol abuse
problem, ``there's a lot of treatment beds needed,'' said
Williford, who works for Republican Governor George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 to 15 percent of inmates needing treatment are now
getting it, Williford said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already spends more than $3 billion a
year for drug treatment in state and federal prisons, said Robert
Weiner, spokesman for White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey. ``Drug
treatment is tough on crime because it stops crime,'' Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore in his speech criticized Texas Governor George W. Bush, the
presumed Republican presidential nominee, on his approach to crime
control _ an issue on which the Republicans traditionally have an
edge in voter polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that breaking the cycle of drug addiction is essential
to fighting crime'' and reducing the rate former convicts commit
new crimes, ``yet George W. Bush slashed drug treatment and alcohol
treatment programs for Texas prisoners,'' Gore told a group of law
enforcement officers, community leaders and children at a YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush seems content to keep pushing them out of a
revolving door'' that elevated the recidivism rate by 25 percent,
``far above the national average,'' the vice president charged.
``The people of Texas deserve better, and the people of America
deserve better. We need to get tough on repeat offenders, not just
push them back out on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign vehemently disputed Gore's statistics. Dan
Bartlett, a spokesman for the campaign, said there are no recent
number on the recidivism rate of inmates released after 1994, when
Bush took office.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged cuts in funding are also ``wildly distorted and
mischaracterized,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   When drug treatment in prisons was greatly expanded by former
Texas Governor Ann Richards, a Democrat, the initial proposal was
for 12,000 drug treatment beds. But the Texas Criminal Justice
Policy Council, a government panel, determined that the state had
adequately trained staff to handle only 5,000 to 5,500 beds,
Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also reiterated some earlier crime proposals, including
putting another 50,000 police on the street, that total $1.3
billion. The money is in the White House's current budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president voiced his support for the Violence Against
Women Act and the Victims Rights Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything Gore is for, the Republicans are going to be against
initially,'' said Senator Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware, who
authored several of the initiatives Gore is supporting. But ``the
approach we're arguing is right.''

N.Y. CONSERVATIVE'S PLANNED SENATE RUN A BLOW TO GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's running a neck-and-neck Senate race against the
first lady. He's facing the battle of his life against prostate
cancer. What an irony, then, that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may find
his political future dashed by an obscure ex-congressman who hasn't
won an election in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph DioGuardi announced this week that he will seek the
nomination of the New York Conservative Party, with the blessings
of the party's iron-fist chairman, Mike Long.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative ballot line tends to pull around 5 percent of
the vote in a statewide contest. But given how tight this Senate
race is, and given that most of this vote would probably come at
Giuliani's expense, that could be enough to hand victory to Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Long and DioGuardi insist they do not mean to run a ``spoiler''
campaign. They both think New Yorkers are already so tired of
Giuliani and Clinton that the ex-congressman could beat them both
in a three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, to Long's mind, is that the question of who
wins this election takes second place to long-term principles.
</P>
<P>
   A self-avowed ``Goldwater Republican,'' Long is most reluctant
to support the mayor because, as he put it, ``Rudy Giuliani is no
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary and Rudy,'' he said, ``are the same on gays in the
military, they're the same on the 2nd Amendment, they're the same
on abortion _ on issue after issue, they offer no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Giuliani has run in the last two mayoral races not
only as a Republican but also on the ticket of the Liberal Party _
which, years ago, was truly a liberal party but is now a one-man
fiefdom controlled by Giuliani's ally and adviser, Raymond Harding.
This weekend, the mayor will seek the Liberal endorsement again.
And one of Long's hard and fast rules is that his party will not
endorse anyone who is also favored by the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't run north and south at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Liberal line was crucial to Giuliani's first
victorious run as mayor of New York City, where Democrats outnumber
Republicans 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statewide contest, where more voters tilt to the
right, no Republican has won without the Conservative Party's
support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton may have her own third-party problem: Not since
1944 has a Democrat won statewide election without the Liberal
Party's support.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's dilemma is probably more severe, though. The First
Lady, whose liberal credentials are secure, is unlikely to lose
much support on the left simply because Giuliani is on the Liberal
line. However, the mayor could lose support on the right if the
Conservative candidate loudly tags him a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Long has said for months that he would back Giuliani if the
mayor dropped the Liberal Party and supported a ban on
partial-birth abortion. ``We will compromise on everything else _
and that's a lot to compromise,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has refused both conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party members who support Giuliani as the lesser
evil say they would challenge DioGuardi's candidacy at the party's
convention this summer _ and possibly demand a primary with
Giuliani's name, or a blank space for a write-in, on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's welcome to do that,'' Long said, ``but most of the
Conservative voters will reject him.''
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, 59, comes into the race with a tiny warchest compared
with Giuliani, who has raised nearly $20 million, or Clinton, who
is not far behind. He was narrowly elected to the US Congress in
1984 from suburban Westchester County, won reelection in 1986, then
lost in 1988 to Nita Lowey, who still holds the seat. He tried to
run again the next three races, twice as the Right-to-Life Party
candidate after losing the Republican primary.

   FUNDRAISING-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
said at a hearing Tuesday that Charles La Bella, the former head of
the Justice Department's campaign finance unit had unsuccessfully
urged the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate
President Clinton and Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman of the Loral
aerospace company. La Bella, who responded obliquely to Specter's
questions, did not dispute that he had recommended an outside
inquiry. Schwartz has been one the Democratic Party's largest
donors and had contributed $1.5 million during the 1996 election
campaign. His contributions have continued even as his company
became the subject of a separate investigation into whether Loral
broke the law by providing important technological help to China's
rocket program. By David Johnston.

   HEALTH-AGENCY (Washington) _ The Clinton administration said
Tuesday that proposals to create an independent agency to run the
Medicare program or to administer prescription drug benefits for
the elderly were unwise and probably unconstitutional because the
new entity would not be accountable to the president. Most
Republicans in Congress and many Democrats want to reduce the
authority of the agency that now runs Medicare, the Health Care
Financing Administration. In carrying out laws passed over the last
three decades, they say, it has become a heavy-handed regulator. By

   KANSAS-CITY-SCHOOLS (Chicago) _ Despite spending more than $2
billion over two decades to improve education and attract more
white students, the Kansas City School District has essentially
been judged a failure by a state education review board, which has
denied it accreditation. With the loss of state accreditation on
Monday, the Kansas City schools took another blow to its battered
image. Despite long and ambitious efforts stemming from a 1977
desegregation law suit, it remains a district where some 75 percent
of students are members of racial minorities and where test scores
remain low. By Dirk Johnson.

matinee curtain call last Saturday in which he accused the Shubert

actor for breach of contract, on the grounds that he is not
permitted to do any publicity for the play without producer
approval. By Robin Pogrebin.

COUNTERING PREDICTIONS, AUTO SALES REMAIN STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and
higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American
economy by now, including the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet at
car dealerships across the country, business is still booming, with
every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing on Tuesday that
April sales exceeded last year's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old
human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge
blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. The Federal Reserve's
interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he
wrote a check for the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the
proceeds of some stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by
the price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain size requirement we needed for the family,''
he said, including three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several months, economists and auto executives have
been predicting that auto sales would slow significantly, but that
has not happened. While sales slowed very slightly in April from
the record-setting pace of the first quarter of this year,
adjusting for seasonal variations, they were still up 10.5 percent
from the extremely strong level of April last year. It was the auto
industry's best April ever, according to Ward's Auto Infobank.
</P>
<P>
   Other economic indicators are also showing surprising strength.
The Commerce Department said that new home sales leaped 4.5 percent
in March, while the Conference Board in New York announced that its
index of leading indicators rose a tenth of a percent in March
after edging down in February.
</P>
<P>
   The auto sales report is a clear sign that robust growth
continued into the second quarter. Auto executives and economists
said the biggest reason is that buyers still feel confident about
the economy and still have money to spend. ``Real wages are really
strong and it's hard to stop this train,'' said Diane C. Swonk, a
senior vice president and chief economist at Bank One Corp. in
Chicago. ``You don't need any more gains from the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that automakers are still piling on rebates,
discounted interest rates and other incentives in a frantic
struggle for market share even as sales boom. Automakers are using
their enormous profit margins to subsidize prices and keep monthly
payments from rising for the 80 percent of their customers who use
car loans or leases instead of paying cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fly in the ointment is the incentives for everybody are
very tough,'' said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's
Chrysler subsidiary. ``With interest rates escalating, trying to
hold payments constant is getting expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballew, GM's general director of global market and industry
analysis, said that the company actually hoped that auto sales
would slow soon, because factories were struggling to keep up with
demand, and so many sales now might subtract from sales in the
future. ``We would like and expect to see some moderation _ it's
not in our interest to have an exaggerated cycle,'' said Ballew,
the Federal Reserve's top expert on the auto industry in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs that the pace of sales might be cooling.
Frank Ursomarso, a dealer with franchises in Wilmington, Del., said
that he had noticed a slightly slower tempo and had charted a
pattern over the last 44 years in which sales tended to precede the
overall industry's increases and declines. ``The floor traffic has
been trending down a little each month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler announced on Friday that it was reducing
production slightly of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which faces growing
competition in the market for mid-sized sport utility vehicles.
Holden said the company had decided that it was better to lose a
little market share than to keep increasing incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the industry is running at $2,000 incentives, which is
creating this hyper industry, sometimes you take a few losses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   GM's market share was 28.3 percent in April, down from 30.6
percent a year ago. But almost all of the decline reflected the
company's continued weakness in the unprofitable small car market,
in which it faces growing competition from low-cost Korean imports.
GM has been gaining in the profitable market for full-sized sport
utility vehicles, as recently redesigned models like the Chevrolet
Suburban and the GMC Yukon have enjoyed vibrant sales.
</P>
<P>
   GM reported a smaller increase in sales than any other big auto
maker last month, a 2.2 percent gain overall as a 7.1 percent gain
in sales of sport utilities, pickup trucks and vans more than
offset a 2.5 percent decline in car sales. GM's arch-rival, the
Ford Motor Co., reported a different pattern, as a 15.4 percent
increase in car sales led the company to an overall increase of
12.1 percent, while its sales of so-called light trucks _ sport
utilities, pickups and vans _ were up 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ballew said that this might be the first full year in which
light truck sales inch ahead of car sales, although this has
already happened in a few months during the last three winters.
Market share gains for light trucks have slowed sharply from the
mid-1990s, and are increasingly the result of rising sales of
all-wheel-drive wagons, like the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Toyota
RAV4, that the auto industry chooses to classify as light trucks
because of preferential regulatory treatment for vehicles not sold
as cars.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's sales rose 5.3 percent, led by ever-popular
sport utilities, pickup trucks and Mercedes cars.
</P>
<P>
   Among other automakers announcing results today, Asian
automakers thrived last month, with Honda's sales rising 14.7
percent from a year ago, Toyota's up 15.7 percent, Nissan's up 31.8
percent, and Mitsubishi's up 49.2 percent. European automakers also
prospered, with BMW posting a 12.1 percent increase while
Volkswagen reported a gain of 14.7 percent. &QL;

PRODUCERS TURN TO UNION IN DISPUTE WITH PATRICK STEWART
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The producers of the Broadway play ``The Ride Down
Mount Morgan'' have filed charges with the stage actors union
against the show's star, Patrick Stewart, citing a speech he made
from the stage on Saturday accusing the producers of failing to
promote the play adequately.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint of unprofessional conduct, filed with the Actors
Equity Association, could result in Stewart's expulsion from the
union, which would be a professional blight but would not bar him
from Broadway productions. The union rarely expels a member, but
Stewart could be reprimanded or fined if the union agrees with the
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and one of the producers will each have the opportunity
to speak before a hearing committee of four Equity actors. The
hearing has yet to be scheduled. Under Equity rules, agreeing to
this procedure means that the producers have waived their right to
take other legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the charges
Tuesday. The spokeswoman, Kelly Bush, said that Stewart had not yet
been notified of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, along
with the other producers of the show, said simply, ``In our opinion
we thought the matter should be brought to Equity's attention.''
Schoenfeld said that the producers had spent more than $1 million
on advertising and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's speech _ which he made on behalf of himself and the
play's author, Arthur Miller, nine days before Tony nominations are
to be decided _ stunned Broadway, not only because a precedent
could not be recalled, but because Stewart publicly took on the
powerful and legendarily tough-minded Shuberts, as the organization
is commonly known.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, who agreed to take a lower salary than usual for
``Mount Morgan'' in exchange for a percentage of the show's
profits, had until then had a close relationship with Schoenfeld,
having worked with him on ``A Christmas Carol'' and ``The
Tempest,'' both of which were produced in Shubert theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Morgan,'' which received positive reviews, has been
running at nearly full capacity, according to Variety, but most of
the tickets have been heavily discounted, selling for about $40,
down from the top ticket price of $80. As a result the play has
been taking in 61 percent of its optimum gross. The producers would
not say how much revenue the show needed to take in to make money.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Stewart said that Schoenfeld had
rejected requests to meet with him and Miller and that Stewart's
agent, Sam Cohn, relayed a message from Schoenfeld demanding a
written apology. ``Of course I have no reason to make an apology of
any kind,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was driven to deliver his statement _ which he made
standing alone onstage after the curtain call at Saturday's matinee
and evening performances _ because he felt that the concerns he had
voiced to Schoenfeld were being ignored. ``It's not as if I were
trying to create a controversy around a failed production,''
Stewart said. ``The production is a success. The reviews are
excellent. But people are not being told that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he believed that other nonmusicals like ``The Real
Thing'' and ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' were being advertised
more aggressively. ``We are all in competition for audiences and
for awards and nominations when they come around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he had received assurances from Schoenfeld last
week over the telephone that an advertisement for the play would
run the following Sunday in the Arts &AMP; Leisure section of The New
York Times. The ad appeared in less than half of the copies _
700,000 of 1.8 million, advertising personnel at The Times said,
because it arrived at the Times after the deadline. He also said he
had assurances that the exterior of the Ambassador Theater would be
decorated with signs quoting the positive reviews, but that these
never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said the signs would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that before he made the speech, he alerted Miller;
the play's director, David Esbjornson; Bush, his spokeswoman; and
the rest of the cast. The actors declined through a secret ballot
to join Stewart onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stewart had initially vowed to continue making his
speech, he said he changed his mind because of the wide attention
his comments attracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disturbing thing for an audience to experience that,''
Stewart said. ``And I was disturbed at having to do it.''

   &QL;  McCAIN TO PROBE BIG DIG INSURANCE PROGRAM, FEDERAL FUNDING
</P>
<P>
   By Alex Canizares
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 2 - In a Senate hearing to probe the Big Dig's
cost overruns, Senator John McCain will examine the project's
discredited funding schemes today, and seek assurances that no
additional federal money will be used if costs rise further.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who chairs the Senate Commerce committee, will focus on
the Big Dig's controversial $800 million insurance fund and other
federal funds that a recent US Transportation Department audit
found to be illegitimate sources to help pay for the Central
Artery, a Senate aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Kerry, who is also on the committee, has received
assurances from the former presidential candidate and Arizona
Republican that the Big Dig would not be made into a ``political
football,'' spokesman David Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   And Senator Edward Kennedy said he approved of the hearings and
downplayed any political firestorm. ``I don't there's any time
bombs in this,'' he said in an interview yesterday. ``I think,
hopefully at the end of the hearing there will be an even greater
sense of support for continuing to move ahead in a timely way and
complete the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain will grill witnesses, including Big Dig chief Andrew
Natsios, to explain the project's insurance scheme, which the
project has attempted to use as a source of funding as well as
insurance reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance fund has been called a ``fiction'' by the US
Transportation Inspector General Kenneth Mead, who will testify
today.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said he would re-offer an amendment from last fall
designed to strip $150 million from the trust fund if the program
is retained, a Senate aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would drop it again,'' the aide said. ``We are in regular
contact with the (Inspector General) on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and federal highway auditors are separately
grappling with a way to pay for the project -- which will cost
between $13.4 billion and $13.6 billion -- and both have called for
scrapping the insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is expected to grill Richard Thomas, senior vice
president of the American Insurance Group Inc., to explain
allegations of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   US Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Matthew Wiley,
project manager of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, the join venture
that handles the Big Dig's daily operations, will also testify.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios, who replaced James Kerasiotes as the state's Turnpike
chairman last month, will pledge his complete cooperation with
overseers in Washington to restore the project's credibility, said
spokesman Joe Landolfi. ``We need to reach a certain comfort level
with Congress and federal highway officials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to probing past mistakes, McCain will seek
assurances that no additional federal funding is at risk beyond the
$8.5 billion already promised in highway money.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Inspector General Kenneth Mead is expected to say
the Big Dig's most recent finance plan drafted under Kerasiotes
could raise the federal share to $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the finance plan has been rejected by the state and its
delegation in Washington, McCain's aides disagreed that federal
funds are legally protected, and said Slater would be asked about
an informal cap on the Big Dig. ``There is no cap,'' the aide said.
``The cap exists in somebody's mind''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig is currently limited to an informal cap of $8.5
billion in federal funds, according Federal Highway Administrator
Kenneth Wykle, in a ``hand-shake'' agreement that is not written
into law.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts congressional aides dismissed any notion that
McCain, whose committee doesn't handle the Big Dig's funds, would
take any action that could affect the project's finances. l. z

 &HT;    Roberds customers left holding receipts
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman and Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Roberds Inc. customers drove up to locked stores
Tuesday, clutching receipts and wondering when or how they would
get the sofas, refrigerators or chairs they paid for weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Or could they get their money back?
</P>
<P>
   ``They were still taking orders up until the end of last week,''
said Sandy Hack, angry that she and husband Jim spent $1,600 in
March on an upholstered chair and loveseat and don't have the
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they knew there was a problem, they should not have taken
cash or credit cards or whatever from customers,'' Mrs. Hack said
in front of the silent, sun-baked store in suburban Beavercreek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It aggravates me that so many people are going to get burned
because of this,'' said Hack, a retired General Motors employee.
The couple put down $400 in cash and placed the balance on their
Roberds credit card. Mrs. Hack, a New Jersey native, declared that
she won't pay those charges unless she gets her furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Simegnish Hunegnaw, a native of Ethiopia who described himself
as a loyal Roberds customer for 20 years, drove up to the
Beavercreek store in a pickup truck hoping to get the refrigerator
he ordered for $793.24. He, too, placed the purchase on a credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will get something,'' Hunegnaw said. ``We don't
want to lose our money.'' He said he would be in line, receipt in
hand, when the liquidation sale begins.
</P>
<P>
   Hunegnaw said the company seemed to change, and not for the
better, as it grew. When Roberds had only the West Carrollton
store, he said, the selection was great and delivery, always free,
was superb.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time we bought a recliner, and we were unhappy with it,''
he said. ``They came back and replaced it and it was no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company may have become overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to get big in a short period of time,''
said the Dayton resident, who furnished much of his home with
merchandise from the original store. ``We were satisfied customers.
But now they've got stores all over. Maybe they've stretched too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck and Becky Smail of Springfield were perplexed. They put
$450 down on a $990 sofa, and don't know how to get the
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I owed them,'' Chuck Smail said, ``they'd be right on my
doorstep.''

 &HT;    Gore stumps in Atlanta, pitches crime proposal
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore delivered a major policy speech
on crime Tuesday, detailing a package that includes funding for
50,000 new police officers and an amendment to the U.S.
Constitution to expand crime victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in casual slacks and a tan polo shirt, Gore outlined his
plan at an Atlanta YWCA in front of about 250 uniformed police
officers and local and state public officials.
</P>
<P>
   The audience broke in with applause more than a dozen times
during the approximately 45-minute address. One of the loudest
rounds came after Gore called so-called racial profiling of
suspects an unjust practice. ``It is unfair and inconsistent with
the idea of community policing that has worked so well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the speech, Gore's remarks turned overtly
political as he blasted his Republican presidential opponent, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, for proposing a $2 trillion tax cut that would
inevitably dry up funding for Gore's planned police positions. Gore
said he favored a Senate plan to create a budgetary ``lock box'' on
that police funding now.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is preparing to pick the lock with his tax cut
giveaway,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, a Democrat who
attended, said Gore's plan increases pressure on Bush to deliver
his own anti-crime agenda. The Bush campaign faxed a three-page
response to Gore's speech about an hour after he finished speaking.
</P>
<P>
   To Gore's claim that prison inmate recidivism in Texas had risen
nearly 25 percent during Bush's term as governor, Bush spokesman
Dan Bartlett shot back:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore is willing to attack Texas where violent crime is
at a 20-year low and the largest prison drug treatment program in
the country is located, we're also expecting attack on Texans for
defending the Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to deliver the major anti-crime speech in one of
Atlanta's trendy and heavily Democratic neighborhoods signals his
determination to make Georgia a presidential battleground, said
Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes to avert a Republican sweep of the South by focusing
time, energy and money in both Florida and Georgia, Black said.
``Gore wants to split the South,'' Black added. ``If Gore wins
Georgia, it's hard to see how Bush wins the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-crime package he outlined includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased drug testing of prisoners, parolees and probationers
to help reduce the number of drug addicts released from prison back
onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   _ An amendment to the U.S. Constitution to expand the rights of
crime victims by allowing them to participate in trials and by
notifying them of criminals' release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   _ 50,000 new police officers. The program would be a follow-up
to President Clinton's 100,000-police officer initiative in 1994.
The Clinton slots are all funded, but only 60,000 of the 100,000
positions have been filled.
</P>
<P>
   _ New federal legislation to empower local communities to break
up violent teen gangs.
</P>
<P>
   _ More after-school programs for teens to cut down on juvenile
crime committed in the afternoon when parents are still at work.

STATE BIDDER BUYS RELICS FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM with MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The confrontation between Chinese authorities and Hong
Kong's premier auction houses over the sale of looted imperial
treasures has been defused, for now at least, by an unlikely
source: a giant Chinese state-owned corporation that became the
winning bidder on three of the four contested objects.
</P>
<P>
   The company, China Poly Group Corp., which until last year was
owned by the People's Liberation Army and is best known for its
global weapons sales, recently established a small antiquities
museum here with an emphasis on ancient bronzes. Part of its
mission is to buy choice Chinese relics abroad and bring them back
to the motherland, and as was clear in recent days, it has very
deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong auctions at Christie's on Sunday and at Sotheby's
on Tuesday, the Poly Group bought the three objects, bronze animal
heads that once helped form a zodiac fountain at the Old Summer
Palace north of this city, for a total of $4 million, far above the
expected price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to buy these things because they belong to us,
they're part of the Chinese people's national treasure,'' said the
assistant curator of the new Poly Art Museum, Jiang Yingchun.
``Since the attempts to halt the auction or even bring the relics
back by legal means or persuasion had failed, we had to resort to
commercial means.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth object, a Qing dynasty vase also believed to have
been stolen from the Old Summer Palace when it was pillaged by
invading British and French troops in 1860, was sold at Sotheby's
Tuesday afternoon for an equally astounding $2.7 million to an
unidentified Beijing antiquities company.
</P>
<P>
   Because the objects all appear to be returning to China, albeit
at premium prices, the immediate tensions seem to have dissipated.
But left hanging for the auction houses, and more generally for the
booming global market in Chinese antiquities, is a major question:
How serious is the government's new aggressiveness over the
international trade in Chinese relics, many of which were
originally stolen or smuggled out of the country?
</P>
<P>
   This week's disputed items were, to be sure, in a special
category. The Old Summer Palace, known in Chinese as Yuanmingyuan,
or Garden of Perfect Brightness, is idealized here, and the story
of its sacking is taught to every schoolchild as the ultimate
symbol of national humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Built by 17th- and 18th-century Qing emperors as their summer
residence and fantasyland, the palace was actually a vast estate of
landscapes, lakes and finely crafted traditional buildings, and
even included a cluster of rococo marble palaces designed by
European Jesuits. The estate was stocked with China's finest arts
when it was burned and looted as invading colonial powers forced
China to accept the opium trade.
</P>
<P>
   During its 27 years in Hong Kong, Sotheby's has sold other
relics from the Old Summer Palace without any objections from the
Chinese government, said Carlton Rochell, the managing director of
the China and Southeast Asia division for the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   But since Hong Kong officially became part of China in 1997,
while maintaining a separate legal system, public awareness about
relics has increased. After seeing the four items openly marketed
as Old Summer Palace treasures, some Chinese officials began to
complain last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese State Relics Bureau stepped in last week, sending a
letter to Christie's and Sotheby's asking them not to auction the
items in Hong Kong, saying that it would be a deep insult to the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   The auction houses decided to hold their ground, and much to
their relief, the Poly Group and the unidentified Beijing dealer
apparently decided to win back the objects at almost any price.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Poly Group was the chief global arms seller in
China. It attracted attention a few years ago in the West when a
subsidiary was caught smuggling assault rifles into the United
States for sale, and later when its chairman, Wang Jun, became
known as the Chinese arms dealer who was brought to a White House
meeting of political fund-raisers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Poly Group was forced to separate from the military last
year because of a new national policy to end military involvement
in business. The company says that its operations are now
concentrated in real estate, industry, high technology and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Following the model of American corporate philanthropy _ a new
concept in China _ the company decided to improve its image by
doing visible good and established the museum in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Baoping, the assistant director of the museum and a former
military officer, said that as company executives traveled
overseas, they noticed how many premier Chinese relics were in
foreign hands. ``We felt that if we could bring some of these
objects back to China, it would be a patriotic act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the collecting of the Poly Art Museum had focused on
ancient bronzes and other relics. The decision to buy the three
comparatively recent bronze animal heads this week was made only on
Sunday, just before the Christie's auction began, museum officials
said. They declined to say whether they had consulted with
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Chinese national dignity and self-respect, you
can't measure the importance of these objects in money alone,''
said the Poly curator, Jiang.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the auction Tuesday, Sotheby's sold its first disputed item,
an intricately decorated 18th-century hexagonal vase, for more than
double the estimated value.
</P>
<P>
   As the bidding began, a man at the rear of the ballroom shouted,
``It is shameful to sell off national treasures of China!'' He was
removed without incident, and the bidding quickly narrowed to a
duel between the Beijing company and a collector from Taiwan with
ties to an art museum there. The vase has a twin that sold at
Sotheby's in Hong Kong in 1988 and now belongs to the Taiwanese
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The second piece, a bronze tiger's head from a zodiac fountain
that is believed to have been designed by a Jesuit artist who lived
in China, sold for $2 million, more than three times its estimated
value of $580,000, with the price driven up by an unidentified
telephone bidder.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The bronze ox and monkey heads sold by Christie's on Sunday,
taken from the same fountain, each sold for about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   China's overall position on sales of Chinese relics is unclear.
A relics bureau representative said that the goal was simply to get
the auctions out of Hong Kong and Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
   But a Beijing newspaper quoted a senior official at the relics
bureau Tuesday as saying that international precedent and law
required that objects plundered during wartime must be returned no
matter how much time has passed, an opinion that, even if not
rooted in international law, could presage more conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that no international agreements mandate the return
of items stolen so long ago. Still, a more assertive China could,
at a minimum, make life difficult for auction houses and dealers
hoping to do business on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   When objects have been stolen more recently and proof exists,
the situation is different: many countries, including China, have
signed a 1970 UNESCO treaty requiring their return.
</P>
<P>
   Institutionally Christie's has kept a poker face throughout the
dispute, but on Tuesday, executives at Sotheby's said they were
relieved by the outcome of the auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great resolution because mainland Chinese were able
to purchase these things, which clearly the nation was very
passionate about having back,'' said Rochell of Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Rochell defended the practice of auctioning relics, even those
from historically symbolic places like the Old Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these objects weren't traded openly and freely at auction
they might have remained underground, and the people from Beijing
wouldn't have had the opportunity to buy them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged that the criticism from China surprised
and shook the house.
</P>
<P>
   In future cases of relics involving particular historical or
emotional significance, he said, Sotheby's will discuss the sale
with the Chinese government in advance, although to what end is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was from a known place that was sacked, we'd want to be
more careful,'' Rochell said. ``One has to be very sensitive about
the objects that are in an auction.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I first saw them in a spice shop in London. Not long
after, they were spotted among the ingredients on a bottle of Van
Gogh gin. Their name alone, grains of paradise, sparkled. Then a
friend gave me a small bagful as a gift from his travels.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, I had my hands on an ingredient before it
was, like lemon grass or chipotle, strewn across every menu. It was
as refreshing as it was disconcerting: I had no idea what to do
with it. The tiny round grains, brown as nutmeg, looked as
promising as an oyster in the shell. Paradise could not have seemed
farther away.
</P>
<P>
   I put a few between my teeth and crunched. They cracked like
coriander, releasing a billowing aroma, and then a slowly
intensifying heat, like pepper, at the back of my mouth. The taste
changed by the second. The heat lingered. But the spice was
pleasantly tempered, ripe with flavors reminiscent of jasmine,
hazelnut, butter and citrus, and with the kind of oiliness you get
from nuts. They were entirely different from black peppercorns and
in my mind, incomparably better.
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper has become something that cooks, myself included,
use mindlessly. It is added to dishes as sugar is stirred into
coffee or ice is added to a glass. Taste is not so much the point
as the burn.
</P>
<P>
   Black peppercorns are sharp and harsh by comparison. Grains of
paradise are dense fragrance underlined with heat.
</P>
<P>
   I soon realized there is probably no recipe in which grains of
paradise can not be substituted for black peppercorns. Like
peppercorns, they can be crushed in a mortar and pestle or ground
in a pepper mill. But with a different effect: spread as a crust on
tuna, they gave the fish a round, faintly peppery edge, rather than
blunt heat.
</P>
<P>
   The more I came to know them, and the more I was seduced by
their lingering, comforting aroma, the more astonished I was that
they had not already caught on in America, where heat is often
irresistible. Spice dealers like World Spice Merchants in Seattle,
Vanns Spices in Baltimore and Adriana's Caravan in Manhattan have
begun carrying grains of paradise in the last few years. The spice
is not expensive, only about $3 to $5 an ounce, against about $1.50
for black peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   I began poking around, trying to piece together what I could
about grains of paradise. Food encyclopedias helped little. Grains
of paradise remain in the realm of African scholars and spice
purveyors.
</P>
<P>
   For ages, the spice has been relished for its heat in both
religious rituals and cooking in West Africa, where it originated.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is what has kept grains of paradise alive in people's
minds. It grows wild in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, Aframomum melegueta, is a short shrub that produces
pods the size of figs, each containing 60 to 100 seeds, or grains.
Grains of paradise are also called guinea pepper, atare, alligator
pepper and melegueta pepper (not to be confused with pimenta
malagueta, a Brazilian chili of the same name, usually preserved in
oil). But it is not a relative of the Piper nigrum family, the
source of black and white peppercorns. Even experts disagree,
though it is most often linked to the cardamom family.
</P>
<P>
   Grains of paradise is one of many hot spices, like long pepper
and cubeb, from West Africa, where spices are ground and combined
in complex blends. Grains of paradise is mixed with coriander,
cinnamon, dried chilies and cloves as a condiment for grilled lamb,
chicken, fish, pumpkin and okra, or added to soups, stews and
pickling mixtures. It also turns up in raz al hanout, the homemade
spice mixture of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, before trade routes from Europe to the East
were established, grains of paradise were sought as a substitute
for black peppercorns, an expensive import from the East. West
Africa was much closer to Europe and was also important for the
trades in gold dust, ivory and slaves. Europeans began importing
grains of paradise, using the spice to season foods. It also found
its way into the spiced beers of Belgium. (It can still be found in
some beers, like ales of Ommegang, a New York state brewery, and
Blanche de Bruges from Belgium. As with Van Gogh gin, it becomes a
discreetly layered aromatic, indiscernible as grains of paradise.)
</P>
<P>
   Trade in the grains grew so much that the coastline just north
of the Ivory Coast became known as the Grain Coast. Trade prospered
until Europeans found their way around the Cape of Good Hope,
making the East and all of its spices, including black peppercorns,
much more accessible. Black peppercorns, which are easier to
cultivate, came down in price, and the market for grains of
paradise in Europe evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Grains of paradise remains more vital perhaps in religious
ritual. Yvette Burgess-Polcyn, a Manhattan priest who practices the
Nigerian religion of the Yoruba people, said that the spice is used
as an offering to the spirits. When a follower is coming for a
spiritual consultation, she will arrange on a saucer nine pieces of
fresh coconut the size of a pea, each dabbed with palm oil and a
grain of paradise, and she will place it on an altar. Sometimes the
grains are added to food prepared as an offering to a deity. They
are also used ritually in the religion of the Ibo people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful with guinea peppers not to drop them,
because anyone stepping on them could generate fights,''
Burgess-Polcyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica B. Harris, a culinary historian in Brooklyn, said grains
of paradise is also a paradigm of abundance. With so many seeds in
the pod, she said, ``If you drop it, if you lose it, you're cutting
your abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   Its heat has great power metaphorically, said Robert
Farris-Thomson, a professor of African-Atlantic art at Yale
University. ``If you want to bless someone, you chew on this hot
pepper, and it is believed that the heat of the pepper on the
tongue will go into your words and spiritually underline them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor of heat extends to food as well, Farris-Thomson
said. In the belief of the Kongo people, you can defend yourself
from envious people by eating foods cooked with grains of paradise
or other peppers.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism of heat stayed with African people in the New
World, but the sources of heat changed, to chilies and peppercorns.
Spices like grains of paradise stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in America, we were forced to come up with new variations
on old themes,'' said Diane Spivey, author of ``The Peppers,
Cracklings and Knots of Wool Cookbook: The Global Migration of
African Cuisine'' (State University of New York, 1999).
African-Americans, she said, used what was available here and,
drawing on what they knew, created new dishes.

   It is difficult to find African restaurants that use grains of
paradise. Mama Zee in Staten Island is one. Oyebolanle Grant, the
chef, who is from Nigeria, uses the grains in a dish called suya,
mixed with peanut butter, dried red pepper, salt and a bouillon
cube, then spread on beef, sliced as thin as bacon. The beef is
strung on skewers, then grilled and served with more of the rub.
</P>
<P>
   She also adds grains of paradise to a custard with ginger, a
traditional Nigerian breakfast dish, which takes four days to make.
</P>
<P>
   Both dishes sounded appealing but were not exactly what I had in
mind when I first tasted the spice. I wanted to use it more as
Europeans had, in place of black peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   I started off pan-roasting pieces of cod. When they came out of
the oven, crisp on the edges and opaque in the center, I squeezed
on a few drops of lemon juice, sprinkled on a little olive oil and
then let flecks of grains of paradise, crushed in a mortar and
pestle, speckle the fish. Cod, which is buttery and sweet, was a
perfect fit for the oily fragrance of the grains, and they did not
seem unnecessarily aggressive, as ordinary pepper can.
</P>
<P>
   With a baby chicken, I rubbed the skin with a mixture of grains
of paradise, crushed coriander and lemon zest _ all of which are
fruity and floral. The mixture, which lightly freckled the skin,
whispered its flavor just enough for the mild flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The roundness in flavor of grains of paradise is reminiscent of
sweet spices like nutmeg, coriander and cinnamon. It struck me that
it would be terrific with sauteed chicken livers, showered with
grains ground in a pepper mill as they finish cooking in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   I pressed some grains into a fresh pink piece of tuna, then
seared it in a shallow iron pan. I let the tuna cool to not quite
room temperature, then laid it on salad greens with green beans and
hard-cooked eggs, a loose interpretation of salade Nicoise. The
spice's fragrance had not diminished but had infused the fish,
adding heat without bite.
</P>
<P>
   I rolled a small crottin of fresh goat cheese in the crushed
grains, flecked it with thyme and drizzled it with a stream of
golden olive oil. What I needed was a good loaf of bread and plans
for a brunch.
</P>
<P>
   As I was cooking, I realized that using black pepper had become
a reflex. I had to be more thoughtful with grains of paradise;
their gentle flavors could be easily overpowered.
</P>
<P>
   I later learned that Jean-Georges Vongerichten is one of the
very, very few chefs who have begun experimenting with the spice.
He crusts halibut with the crushed grains, adds them to mignonette
sauce for oysters and stirs them into tomato juice with balsamic
vinegar and lime juice to make a startlingly peppy bloody Mary.
</P>
<P>
   John Ash, the culinary director for Fetzer Vineyards, slips the
grains into tomato water and herbal syrups and sometimes infuses
creme anglaise with them.
</P>
<P>
   I tried his recipe for rosemary syrup with grains of paradise,
chopped ginger, white wine and balsamic vinegar. As it simmered on
the stove, it darkened like wet leather. I strained it and spooned
it over slices of ripe mango. I was skeptical, and I worried about
the mango, which I had patiently ripened. I have had syrups of
ginger and black pepper before, many of which are like a shot of
cheap whiskey coursing down your throat. This was different. It was
like a decadent, aged port, and thin enough barely to wet the
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   I have a new black pepper in my kitchen and I'm not looking
back.

RESULTS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT ATT REVAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T Corp. lost nearly one-seventh of their value
Tuesday as Wall Street punished the telephone giant for reporting a
first-quarter profit drop and warning that this year's sales and
earnings will narrowly miss analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T stock, the nation's second most widely owned after Lucent
Technologies, plunged $6.6875 to $41.9375 in New York Stock
Exchange trading, one of its worst one-day falls since the the 1987
stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
   News that AT&AMP;T expects to miss its year-long profit goals by
just 1 percent seemed to crystallize Wall Street fears that the
company is struggling to execute its conversion from a dinosaur in
the dwindling long-distance business to an Internet-age provider of
high-speed access, cable TV and wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market generally overreacts to news like this from
a financial perspective, but the issues that are being raised are
valid and important,'' said Brian Adamik, a telecommunications
analyst with The Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honeymoon is over,'' Adamik said. ``Now it's all about
execution. It's all about signing up customers and lighting up the
network. People see the strategy, but they're not seeing the
numbers of customers they said they would deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is in the middle of a $120 billion ``bet-the-company'' move
into cable television. Its plans to buy MediaOne Group,
Massachusetts' dominant cable TV provider, are part of a strategy
of delivering telephone, TV and Internet access over upgraded cable
lines. AT&AMP;T also announced a deal last week to buy Cablevision's
franchises in Boston and 38 suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with stock analysts, AT&AMP;T chairman C.
Michael Armstrong insisted that ``we know where our problems are.
We know what to do and how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said profits for 2000 will be $1.87 to $1.92 a share
before special factors, about 2 cents less than previous forecasts.
Sales will grow 7 percent to 8 percent, rather than the 8 percent
to 9 percent AT&AMP;T forecast in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reignite growth,'' Armstrong promised, adding that the
company will eliminate 6,200 jobs by next year, about 4.2 percent
of its current workforce.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, MediaOne is making far more progress bringing
telephone and high-speed Net customers to its cable systems than
AT&AMP;T has. AT&AMP;T hopes to close its $58 billion purchase of MediaOne
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T confirmed figures reported in The Wall Street Journal that
the company by the end of March had signed up only one tenth the
400,000 to 500,000 new customers it had planned to bring into its
former TCI cable systems. The company needs to start signing up
customers 43 times faster than it did in 1999 to meet its targets.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne already has 94,000 telephone customers nationally, and
just in Massachusetts and New Hampshire has over 120,000 cable
modems in service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T still gets three-quarters of its sales from residential and
business landline telephone customers, a market where it faces
unrelenting competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has apparently taken away hundreds of thousands of
AT&AMP;T long-distance customers in New York state, and is aiming to
get into long distance in Massachusetts, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania this year. Other Baby Bells are looking to enter the
long-distance market in Georgia and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings warning came a week after AT &AMP; T spun off $10.6
billion worth of tracking stock in its fast-growing wireless unit
in the country's largest initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors grumbled that AT &AMP; T should have made its
problems in the core business clear before the wireless deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder why they didn't make us aware of the problems they
were having before now. My strong gut feeling is they wanted the
wireless offering to go off well,'' said Jana Harris of the Ohio
Public Employees Retirement System. ``A lot of people feel
misguided or somewhat deceived.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless shares fell $2.50 to $32.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shareholders of Colorado-based MediaOne are guaranteed $85
in AT&AMP;T stock and/or cash for each of their shares as long as AT&AMP;T
trades between $51.30 and $57. AT&AMP;T could be forced to come up with
$3.5 billion more in cash if the shares remain at or below the
bottom of that range. AT&AMP;T's meltdown also dragged down shares of
MediaOne, which fell 8 percent to $71.4375 on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Among numbers reported by the New York-based company:
</P>
<P>
   --First-quarter profit from operations fell 9 percent to $1.51
billion, or 46 cents a share, from $1.66 billion, or 59 cents, a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   --Sales rose 5.8 percent to $15.84 billion, but it was the
second straight quarter of slowing revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   --Because of the long-distance price war, consumer long-distance
revenue will fall 5 percent to 7 percent this year, more than the
earlier predicted decline of 3 to 5 percent. Business telephone
revenue will grow 8 percent, down from a previous forecast of 9
percent to 11 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   --AT&AMP;T Wireless revenues jumped 41 percent in the winter quarter
to $2.2 billion, with total US customers _ including those of
affiliates _ climbing 30 percent to 13.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Broadband unit revenues, including the former
Tele-Communications Inc., bought last year, increased 7.9 percent
to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated that AT&AMP;T may create additional
tracking stocks or spin off its broadband operations to pump up its
stock and bring in new funds for expansion. Armstrong would only
say that ``we keep our options open going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 months, AT&AMP;T shares have risen on average only
17 percent a year, below the 22 percent yearly growth of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index and way under top rival MCI WorldCom's
33 percent annual increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a very volatile market and any news one way or the
other is disproportionately reacted to,'' Armstrong said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. He predicted investors will ``look
at a 1 percent change in outlook in terms of revenue and bring it
back into equilibrium.''

NO FOOD, PLEASE, ITS FOODIEVILLE! 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have to say that if I were the editor of the brand-new Foodie
Magazine, I probably would have put Stephen Baldwin on the cover of
the first issue.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Baldwin epitomizes the reader that this food magazine
wants to reach. He's a man, in his mid-30s and he doesn't cook. And
in a short question-and-answer interview inside that avoided
discussion of how bad the food really was at Alaia, his short-lived
Manhattan restaurant, Baldwin eloquently summed up the appeal of a
trendy, buzz-driven eatery: ``It can be a hell of a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also the rallying cry for Foodie Magazine, which arrived
in the last two weeks. More and more glossy food magazines are
being crammed onto newsstands during these flush times; in the
first three months of this year, a dozen new ones joined the 50 or
so mainstream food titles already vying for the attention of the
eating obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   But Foodie manages to stand out. For one thing, it has no
recipes: not for Foodie the prosaic coverage of, say, the best way
to insert raw chicken into an oven to achieve an edible result, the
sort of topic to which magazines like Gourmet and Fine Cooking _
and yes, even Food's Easy Cooking _ have devoted pages in recent
issues.
</P>
<P>
   With most food magazines, I know where I stand. When I see
Gourmet, I think of my mother-in-law and her friends, all fine
cooks, who learned in the 1960's the value of adding red wine to
their pate _ and who still keep back issues on their coffee tables.
Bon Appetit reminds me (again) that it's time to visit Italy, and
Saveur nudges me to add more butter to that sauce _ OK, cream, too
_ because we should be good to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, everything about Foodie is a call to unite a new
generation of groupies (the young, the hip, the
testosterone-and-cash-laden) who avidly embrace the celebrity
culture that surrounds food these days. I think this might explain
the big photo of a tattooed chef who cooks for rock stars. And a
spread on sushi that features more photos of scary, sharp knives
than of actual food. And one hopes, the item extolling the virtues
of a Web site called Chowhound.com, which Foodie describes as a
``boundless, stream-of-consciousness dining diary,'' recounting
eating excursions around the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   I called Foodie's editor, Gus Floris, who confirmed the
masculine slant. ``More and more, men are into food today,'' he
said. ``They dig it because celebrity chefs like Bobby Flay and
Emeril are making it cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, they crave details of Steven Spielberg's breakfast
routine in the Hamptons (he speed-walks to a local gourmet shop),
or Frank Sinatra's tipping habits (he'd give $100 to the
bartender). And don't get me wrong. I am as interested as the next
eater to learn that a former fashion editor at Elle magazine is the
one to thank for the chichi swimming club decor at Isla, the hip
Cuban restaurant in Greenwich Village. But is this sort of
information _ a curious blend of People magazine meets Hulk Hogan _
enough to sustain a long-term audience?
</P>
<P>
   Quite possibly, said Samir Husni, a professor of journalism at
the University of Mississippi who specialized in the magazine
industry. ``This is a good time for magazines,'' he said. ``The
unprofessional approach may work for them, if they can find enough
people in the world who belong to the swinging club of food
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The club president, Floris, is a former associate publisher of
Sportswear International, an industry magazine, where he worked for
10 years. Floris, whose father owned Greek diners in New York City,
said he yearned to create a magazine that would combine the glamour
of the fashion industry with the hype surrounding the latest hot
restaurants. In fact, he said he got the idea for the magazine's
name four years ago. He recalled: ``I was sitting in a bar with a
friend of mine who's a certified chef. He said, `Call it Foodie,
because that's what's happening now.'''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a cultural phenomenon, but Floris is content to start
small. After founding Morpheus Publishing Inc., and obtaining
private financing, he hired a skeleton staff of five and put
together the first issue of what he plans as a quarterly. With a
print run of 52,000 copies, Floris said he expected to sell no more
than 4,000 on newsstands at $3.95 a copy. He will mail another
25,000 to ``a list of names I rented,'' and has also struck a deal
with the online food retailer Fultonstreet.com to distribute 15,000
to customers.
</P>
<P>
   With the second issue, scheduled for Aug. 21, Floris plans to
print 100,000 copies. The staff, he said, will remain lean. Not to
sound picky, but he might consider hiring an additional copy
editor: the first issue is riddled with misspellings and factual
errors, like describing Quisp cereal as ``long gone.'' (It lives,
Foodie, and it's a cult favorite among your target audience.)
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, I couldn't quibble with Floris' decision to put
the rock star Sarah McLachlan and her hunky, peroxide-blond chef on
the cover. He explained his logic: ``It's a perfect fit _ she's a
celebrity and she's a lover of food. And they definitely appeal to
the target audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Or put another way: She's a famous person who eats. And he's a
tattooed person who cooks. In a culture obsessed with style and
with eating, they cover almost all the angles. The only thing
missing is food. &QL;

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Seven years ago three guys named
Sebastiani, Sangiacomo and Bundschu got together over beers at a
Sonoma pub to lament the sorry state of wine drinking in America.
</P>
<P>
   The young men, all scions of prominent Sonoma Valley wine
families, were particularly disturbed about the wine-drinking
habits of their own generation. The common wisdom was that members
of so-called Generation X preferred margaritas to merlot and
considered wine to be elitist, boring and passe.
</P>
<P>
   The beers kept flowing and the conversation became more
impassioned _ after all, family fortunes and life styles were at
stake. The grape heirs decided they had to do something to make
wine cool for the cyber generation or else the party could be over.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Brats, now a national movement with 16,000 members, was
born following that sudsy night of brainstorming.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the Wine Brats was just the three young men
armed with an ambitious goal: to knock wine off its lofty pedestal.
The idea was to make wine fun, accessible and relevant to a
generation skeptical of glitz, glamour and glad-handing sales
pitches. Their mantra was ``Wine for the People.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message was, wine doesn't have to be pretentious,'' said
Wine Brat Jeff Bundschu, 31, a sixth-generation Sonoma Valley
vintner who is now general manager of his family's
Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Vineburg. ``You don't have to drink it
out of crystal glasses and it can fit into your lifestyle and, by
the way, it goes great with pizza and burgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bundschu teamed with childhood pals Mike Sangiacomo, 31, of
Sangiacomo Vineyards, and Jon Sebastiani, 29, of Viansa Winery, to
found the Wine Brats in 1993. The name fit. Growing up, they and
other privileged children of wealthy winemakers were fondly called
wine brats by their families and members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   The trendy group created an energy of its own, spreading like
morning glory in a vineyard. Wine Brats now has 45 chapters
throughout the country, with Chicago and New York leading Brat
enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Brats converge at wine raves where cabernet and merlot are
savoured in a multimedia blowouts with art, music, food and
technology. They attend seminars on how to pair wine with popcorn,
corn chips and salsa while big screen television sets play reruns
of ``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   From its humble beginnings in the Sonoma pub, Wine Brats has
become an Internet-based collective of young wine enthusiasts, with
the organization's core age group 24 to 36.
</P>
<P>
   They have even written a book: ``The Wine Brats' Guide to Living
With Wine,'' published by St. Martin's Griffin of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The original Wine Brats are now older than many of the members
who have jumped on their fast-moving wine train. They also are
busier than they were seven years ago when all three were single,
footloose and just embarking on careers at family wineries and
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all three Wine Brats are married, and Bundschu and
Sangiacomo each have a child. All say their family obligations and
wine jobs are demanding, limiting the time they have to raid Gen X
hangouts to pour pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finding it extremely difficult to juggle my personal life
and my professional role at Viansa. The last few years have been
very busy,'' said Sebastiani, who is now president of Viansa
Winery, the winery and Italian marketplace owned by his parents,
Sam and Vicki Sebastiani.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sangiacomo is now the ranch manager at his family's
Sangiacomo Vineyards, one of Sonoma County's premier grape
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Wine Brats' 16,000 members are young, affluent urban
consumers wired to the Web. They prefer high-energy parties _
rather than sedate sippings _ to sample wine.

<P>
   ``One of the things we've always stressed is that wine is an
agricultural product,'' said Bundschu. ``It comes from the earth
and is dependent on weather. It's real, healthy and doesn't have to
be complicated.'' That goes hand-in-hand with young peoples' demand
for simplicity, intelligence and a healthy nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Brats does not want people to increase their alcohol
consumption, just their beverage of choice. The group's motto is:
``Drink less, drink better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sebastiani, Sangiacomo and Bundschu remain on the Wine
Brats' board of directors, they are not as involved as they were in
the early days. The other two members of the Wine Brats' board of
directors are Dawn Dooley, formerly of Duckhorn Vineyards in the
Napa Valley and now with Hedges Cellars in Washington, and Mimi
Gatens of Vine Cliff Winery in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Brats directors hold board meetings via e-mail. The
organization's day-to-day operation is done by a paid staff headed
by executive director Joel Quigley, who has held the position since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, 38, uses the Internet and his staff's youthful energy
to spread the word about wine and build membership. Working with
Quigley out of the Wine Brats' Santa Rosa office are six full-time
staff members and seven interns from the wine business program at
Sonoma State University.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Brats has become a think tank for the wine industry, he
said, evaluating trends and assessing wine's place in changing
lifestyles. ``We have no constraints, which allows us to think
outside the box and run with our ideas,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Wine Brats is an acronym _ Wine to Benefit
Responsible Adults for Tomorrow's Society _ but few people, even
the Brats themselves, ever use it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 wineries and wine industry groups contribute to the
Wine Brats budget, which this year is approaching $1 million. The
Wine Institute, a trade group based in San Francisco, provided
$10,000 in seed money to launch the Wine Brats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our mission is to convert the unconverted, then television
and mainstream media are where we have to be seen,'' said
Sebastiani. ``Young adults who don't drink wine, don't read wine
publications. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley and the Wine Brats have ambitious plans, dreaming of new
venues, bigger crowds and greater influence. There are still many
tequila drinkers to convert to the joys of cabernet and zinfandel,
Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not stopping,'' said Sebastiani, ``until Dennis Rodman
is sucking down chardonnay.''

STEPPENWOLF AND LONG WHARF, WHERE THE ENSEMBLE IS THE STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Steppenwolf Theater Company, which will celebrate
its 25th birthday next season, has become known, somewhat
paradoxically, for both its ensemble ethos and the stars that have
emerged from its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand the company is, in many ways, emblematic of the
thriving and close-knit theater world here, a city where a
surprising number of actors manage to work and live without making
the pilgrimage to either coast and where a de facto performance
style has arisen as a result. Chicago actors tend to be less
career-oriented offstage and thus less audience-oriented on. They
play to one another here; they do not mind turning upstage. Actors
here speak of this as liberating, a license to challenge their
colleagues with a vigor that isn't necessarily appreciated
elsewhere. The physically robust quality that many critics have
attributed generally to Chicago actors is a manifestation of this.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the fame and reputation of Steppenwolf rests
largely on the individuals who have leapt from here to celebrity:
John Malkovich, Gary Sinise, Laurie Metcalf, John Mahoney and Joan
Allen are among the company's 33 current members, many of whom no
longer live in Chicago. Even though most return periodically for
company productions, the traditional definition of an ensemble
troupe is not really applicable to Steppenwolf any longer;
star-studded ensemble is something of an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   Two current productions provide an interesting illustration of
this peculiar dynamic at work. One is at Steppenwolf, where Sinise,
a founding member of the company, is starring as McMurphy in Dale
Wasserman's adaptation of the Ken Kesey novel ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, where
Martha Plimpton, a Steppenwolf member for the last two years, is
performing the title role in ``Hedda Gabler.'' Both lead actors are
giving ensemble-oriented performances in roles that are often
played as tours de force. Why ``Cuckoo's Nest'' is the more
satisfying has to do with the productions that contain them.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Doug Hughes, the Long Wharf's artistic director,
from his own script adaptation, this ``Hedda'' is a chilly one.
Played against a curving ice-blue wall conspicuously in need of a
paint job, with minimal furnishings and only the ominous portrait
of Hedda's military father as a decorative touch, the production is
devoid of the sumptuous affluence that Hedda, the manipulative and
unsatisfiable new wife, insists on exhibiting in her new home and
that her weak-kneed scholarly husband, Tesman, cannot afford. The
directorial idea _ a home that is warmthless and barren _ puts
obvious emphasis on Hedda's tortured sexuality, but it also places
huge demands on all the actors, leaving an enormous vacancy onstage
for the characters to fill with their collective anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which is scheduled for a reprise at Steppenwolf
next season, begins with Plimpton, wraithlike in a long white
dress, entering alone, running back and forth across the stage as
if in flight from an invisible demon. It's an effective
introduction to the powerlessness Hedda can neither escape nor
abide. She's a trapped rat in an oversize maze, and for the rest of
the play, you can not forget the image; her wheedlings and
plottings loom as an ever more desperate search for an exit. The
best moment of this production is the first.
</P>
<P>
   But from then on, with the entrance of the other characters, the
production creaks like uncarpeted floorboards. These are tough
roles in any case, with inbred ambiguities that should swell as the
play proceeds. But here, only Quentin Mare as Lovborg, Tesman's
rival scholar and a self-destructive, charismatic man with a
discomforting hold on Hedda's heart, has found the weight in his
character that can command the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Winton plays Tesman as a man oblivious to the most
evident innuendo; Jenny Bacon, as Thea Elvsted, the woman who has
fallen for Lovborg, seems purely feckless. By the end, after
Lovborg's death, they seem remarkably untouched by the action
around them, simply getting out of the way so Hedda can get on with
her suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Best known as a film actress, Plimpton has nonetheless
established her stage chops; as Pegeen Mike in ``The Playboy of the
Western World'' and Laura in ``The Glass Menagerie,'' both at
Steppenwolf during the last two seasons, she demonstrated a
wide-ranging gift. But with her reedy voice and slight build, as
Hedda she never exudes real potency, never swells to a near
triumph. Hedda's feigned self-possession is unpersuasive; she's
straining to assume authority rather than creating a mask and
hiding behind it, and as a result, Hedda's self-inflicted demise is
no dramatic fall, just a closing event. In the end, this is a
production that could have used, from her, a bit more diva.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, here in ``Cuckoo's Nest,'' which is the city's
hottest ticket right now, Sinise is being buoyed and challenged by
a company of actors in strong character turns, and by a director,
the Steppenwolf member Terry Kinney, who has made sure his star
never has to seek the spotlight. It's a mediocre play _ the stage
version extracts the theme of righteous rebellion against injustice
without the Faulkneresque darkness of the Kesey novel _ but the
production is a crowd pleaser, played in the first act for laughs
and the second for tears. It will travel to London for a brief
sojourn this summer, and, with a commercial producer, Fox
Theatricals, behind it, Broadway may beckon, particularly if Sinise
is willing to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuckoo's Nest'' is the story, of course, of Randle Patrick
McMurphy, a gregarious prisoner who is transferred to a mental
asylum, where he becomes a doomed messiah, bringing life and hope
to the inmates as he disrupts the emasculating ward routine.
Sinise, a burly man with a natural swagger (he's physically closer
to the Kesey description of the character than was Jack Nicholson,
who won an Oscar for the role in Milos Forman's 1975 film), exudes
here the capability of physical threat and an instinctive sympathy
for the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   He plays the part for the melodrama the play insists on _ the
renegade with the heart of gold _ and it is a winning performance,
not least because it isn't overdone. In an admirably modest star
turn, he's willing to share the stage, and happily, he has worthy
colleagues here.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Ratched, his nemesis, is played here with stony
unrufflability by Amy Morton, one of many Steppenwolf actors of
deserving local renown in the cast. They include Mariann Mayberry
as a riotously salacious prostitute McMurphy smuggles into the
ward; Rick Snyder as Cheswick, a patient who behaves, a pathetic
and hilarious amalgam of bravado and retreat; and K. Todd Freeman
as a doctor caught between McMurphy's charm and Nurse Ratched's
punishing authority. They are joined by Ross Lehman, marvelous as
the patient Harding, whose erudition is no salve for his crippling
sexual inadequacy, and Eric Johner, well cast as the stammering,
suicidal Billy Bibbit; his gentle good looks make Billy's
unbearable insecurity especially touching.

CHICAGO: especially touching.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the play's most difficult role is that of Chief Bromden,
the belittled Indian giant who feigns being deaf and dumb to
survive on the ward and whose long-buried sense of self is restored
by McMurphy. He is played with effective lumbering sadness by Tim
Sampson, an Oklahoman whose father, Will, played the part in the
film. But it's a role that suffers in translation from page to
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, it is the chief who narrates; his strange and
moving voice combines shrewd observation with the deranged
fantasies of a man who wants only to hide in plain sight. This is
what the play misses, the sense of organic misery that soaks the
ward and that gives the novel its earned tragedy. The Chief's
paranoid inner monologues are illustrated here with interludes of
stagecraft: the Chief standing and speaking in a shaft of light,
with huge projections of machineworks on the white institutional
walls and steel-latticed windows of Robert Brill's set. The
projections, by Sage Carter, are dramatic, but anyone who has read
the novel will feel them as a makeshift ploy.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the actors are the heart of the production. Their
firm characterizations seize the sympathy of the audience without
ever stealing its attention, allowing Sinise to play off them
without undue clamor. Though there are moments when Kinney calls
the jittery energy on the ward to an awkward halt to allow McMurphy
to linger in the spotlight, this is, by and large, a highly
successful example of ensemble power. It's what Steppenwolf has
always done best.

STUDY UNCOVERS MUCH OVERUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Prompted by the rise of drug-resistant ``superbugs''
that are not killed by standard antibiotics, Massachusetts
officials and insurers have begun questioning doctors' prescribing
practices and warning that overuse and misuse of drugs may be
breeding the next generation of superbugs right here.
</P>
<P>
   Early state findings suggest that some doctors may be
contributing to overuse of drugs by prescribing them without seeing
the patient, or by giving in to patients' demands for antibiotics
even when they're not needed. Overuse of antibiotics increases the
chance that bacteria can breed new strains able to survive the drug
onslaught, rendering it ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   A survey carried out by the state agency that oversees Medicaid
showed that 44 percent of prescriptions written for 76,000 mostly
low income Mass Health members in 1999 were given without seeing
the patient in an office visit, said Dr. Annette Hanson, director
of the state Division of Medical Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these prescriptions were for ear infections in children,
which are often caused by so-called ``streptococcus'' bacteria that
are increasingly resistant to standard antibiotics, said Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some doctors said the patients wanted the antibiotics `just in
case,' and others said the patients felt the doctor didn't care
about them unless they were given a prescription,'' Hanson said
Tuesday at a conference on the antibiotic resistance problem.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, part of an elaborate study on antibiotic resistance
being funded in Massachusetts by the federal government, also
showed that 90 percent of antibiotics were prescribed without a lab
test to determine what type of bacteria were involved. This
practice can lead to prescribing an unecessary or wrong antibiotic,
although for many childhood infections like those of the ear, it's
difficult to obtain a sample to test.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Finkelstein, a Harvard Medical School physician who
is principal investigator of the study, said the researchers will
take bacteria samples from patients around the state to determine
how widespread and serious the problem of drug-resistant bugs is.
That information, together with further surveys of how doctors are
prescribing antibiotics, will then be funneled into a plan to
educate doctors and consumers about how to use antibiotics
properly.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which received funding in January, comprises
researchers from Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of
Public Health, the state Department of Public Health,
Harvard-Pilgrim Health Care and a number of other HMOs, said
Finkelstein.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``miracle drugs'' like penicillin began
encountering resistant bugs almost as soon as they started saving
lives in the 1940s, the trend has worsened in recent years.
According to the ``antibiotic paradox,'' named by Dr. Stuart Levy
of Tufts University, organizer of the conference, the more
antibiotics are used the more likely they are to kill susceptible
bacteria, but encourage the growth of random mutants that aren't
vulnerable to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Levy described the continuing appearance of drug-resistant
bacteria in hospitals and among the public, but said, ``I don't
think antibiotic resistance is inevitable'' if the drugs are used
wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, the resistance problem is only beginning to be
measured, said Rosamund Williams, head of drug resistance
containment at the World Health Organization in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're horribly short of global data,'' said Williams, but she
mentioned some particularly worrying trends:
</P>
<P>
   -- Up to 70 pecent of streptococcus bugs are
penicillin-resistant in South Korea, while the
penicillin-resistance rate is 56 percent in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cure rates of malaria in Thailand have dropped steeply within
a few years after each new malaria drug has been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   -- The bug that causes gonorrhea has become resistant to
penicillin in the Western Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
   The results are not only that infections become harder to treat,
but more expensive drugs are necessary, which many in developing
countries cannot afford. Consequently, said Williams, a cost
increase ``means no treatment, or treatment with the wrong drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors worsening the problem are unregulated sales of
antibiotics in many countries, giving the wrong drug or dose or for
the wrong length of time, as well as people self-medicating with
drugs they accumulate or buy over-the-counter. Paradoxically she
said, ``30 percent of the world lacks access to essential
antibiotics like penicillin or chloramphenicol, but at the same
time, in the United States and Canada, 50 percent of outpatient
prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   And both of those statistics, she said, contribute to the
resistance problem.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, ``Antibiotic Resistant Infections: A Global
Problem with Local Solutions,'' was sponsored by the Mass DPH, the
Massachusetts Medical Society, the Alliance for Prudent Use of
Antibiotics and the American Association for World Health.

&HT;     A LONGSHOT, CAMPBELL BELIEVES HE CAN WIN CALIF. SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Behind in California's all-important money chase
and statewide polls, Republican Senate candidate Tom Campbell still
believes he can beat two-term veteran Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   If his own polling shows a close race this fall, and ``it's a
good year for Republicans, I win,'' he told reporters at a luncheon
here.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's dream scenario? Vice President Al Gore, the
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, selects Feinstein to
be his running mate. ``That is a gift from heaven if it occurs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old House member whose district runs through the
Silicon Valley said he intends to make to make foreign policy a
major fault line in his uphill bid to unseat Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein backed the Clinton administration in its conduct of
the NATO air campaign over Serbia and Kosovo last year. Campbell, a
former Stanford University law professor, opposed it as an
unconstitutional exercise of the president's war-making powers.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell led a failed bid to put the House on record as either
declaring war or calling for an end to the air war.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had no business intervening in what was
essentially a ``civil war,'' Campbell said. Atrocities by the Serb
forces of Slobodan Milosevic were exaggerated and, he said, the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were also guilty of mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also said the effort to halt international drug
trafficking has proven ineffective and more attention should be
paid to domestic demand for narcotics. While he supports
prosecution of drug traffickers, Campbell said he is open to making
drugs available to addicts and permitting marijuana for medicinal
use.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said he opposes permanent normal trade relations
with China, known as PNTR in the world of Washington acronyms. A
decisive vote in the House is three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   With a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago,
Campbell argued that normalizing trade relations with China would,
in essence, give an OK to Chinese government subsidies of commerce
and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Congress must renew trade privileges for China each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of permanent trade relations would weaken Washington's
ability to police possible unfair trading practices by China,
Campbell said. Feinstein, in contrast, is a strong supporter of
giving China permanent trade status and has led the fight to get
China admitted to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Most statewide polls show Feinstein leading Campbell. In the
March 7 primary _ when Democrats and Republicans appeared
side-by-side on the ballot _ Feinstein won 51 percent overall,
Campbell won 23 percent. He was the top Republican vote-getter in a
crowded field of GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell said his last poll prior to the primary put him at
42 percent against Feinstein's 48 percent in a one-on-one matchup.
``That's really good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the incumbent leads on the money front. From Feb. 17 to
the end of March, Feinstein took in $988,000, spent $360,000, and
reported about $2.2 million in the bank. In the same period,
Campbell raised $565,000 and spent nearly $700,000, leaving a
balance of $615,000.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, speaking Tuesday, said he has raised about $2.5
million. But it takes a minimum of $10 million to $12 million to
run a statewide campaign in huge state such as California, where
personal campaign appearances take a back seat to advertising on
television and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Campbell is planning a district-by-district approach to
campaigning, counting on local media coverage to get his message
across to voters. And he said he hopes to do well enough in
fund-raising to be competitive on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tremendous room to grow,'' he said, a boyish grin
lighting up his face. ``She (Feinstein) really doesn't.''

GOP PANEL WON'T GUARANTEE NEW HAMPSHIRE FIRST PRIMARY STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican Party advisory commission declined
Tuesday to guarantee that New Hampshire should hold the nation's
first presidential primary and also recommended switching the
Massachusetts vote from March 7 to May.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves drew immediate protests, and the proposal faces a
possible fight on the Republican convention floor this summer.
Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin called the
commission report ``an absurd proposal that will never be
approved'' by the full Republican National Convention. The report
calls for four rounds of primaries in which the smallest states go
first and the largest go last. Galvin has backed an alternative
plan to rotate regional primaries, which the commission rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision also could be influenced by the party's
all-but-certain nominee, Texas Governor George W. Bush, who lost
the New Hampshire primary this year and has much sway over the
convention delegates. There has been concern about whether Bush
would use his influence with the advisory commission to end New
Hampshire's status of voting first, according to Galvin. But Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ``The governor didn't do that,''
noting that Bush has supported New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
role.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party so far has not tried to change New
Hampshire's status, creating the possibility that the state could
hold primaries for each party on different days.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican's 10-member Advisory Commission on the
Presidential Nominating Process, chaired by former Senator Bill
Brock of Tennessee, did not include any people from New England.
The proposal's fate will debated by the party's Rules Committee
next week in Indianapolis and is likely to be decided by delegates
to the Republican National Convention, where large states that
oppose the plan have much more power.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner said he had not
been informed by the commission that the state's first-primary
status was left unprotected by the panel. Indeed, he cited a draft
report by the panel that guaranteed New Hampshire and the
first-caucus state of Iowa would lead the way as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report, according to Gardner, said the panel was
``recognizing the tradition of Iowa and New Hampshire. We would
allow Iowa and New Hampshire to go first.''
</P>
<P>
   But the final report, released Tuesday afternoon, was changed.
``The Advisory Commission does not believe that the Iowa-New
Hampshire issue needs to be decided in conjunction with a reform
model; in fact, the majority of the commissioners feel that the
issue should be voted upon separately,'' the final report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission does not single out Iowa and New Hampshire for
either special treatment nor special inclusion,'' said RNC
spokesman Larry Purpuro.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is the brainchild of Basil Battaglia, chairman of the
Delaware Republican Party. Battaglia bombarded GOP officials with
100-page documents outlining what became known as the ``Delaware
plan.'' He said the commission chairman, Brock, ``fell in love with
the idea because it makes so much sense,'' and he predicted that
the Rules Committee would adopt it. Brock did not return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Battaglia said that he thought New Hampshire's effort
to retain its first-primary status ``is in trouble'' with the Rules
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Battaglia became a familiar player in the primary wars after he
fought with New Hampshire officials in 1996 about Delaware's effort
to trump the first-primary state. New Hampshire officials won a
promise from most of the presidential candidates not to campaign in
Delaware that year because Delaware wouldn't abide by New
Hampshire's demand for a week-long break between the first and
second primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to revamp the primary schedule has been the subject
of debate for years and took on an added urgency as a result of
this year's primary schedule, when the nominees of both parties
were all but certain by March 7, leaving a months-long campaign
vacuum until the national conventions this summer. Many states
jockeyed to hold early primaries, resulting in a bunched-up
schedule that favored the best-financed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   California, which had been holding its primary in June, voted on
March 7 this year in order to have more impact on the race. But
under the plan California would once again be relegated to a June
vote. That upset California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who
served on the advisory commission but was unable to persuade his
colleagues to support the regional rotating primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't spend all that time moving California to the front
just to be in the back permanently,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the commission plan said it would be fair because
it would encourage more ``retail'' politics in small states during
the early stages of the primaries, providing a boost to candidates
who initially have fewer resources. That would give longshot
candidates a better chance of using momentum in early primaries to
collect funds for the later and most expensive stages of the
campaigns in larger states.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would leave 47 percent of the delegates to be chosen in
June, an effort to address concerns that the race would be over
before the largest states participate.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of larger states said the plan was
unworkable because it would require candidates to travel across the
nation to an array of small states and permanently put larger
states at the end of the process, when the race is more likely to
be meaningless.

 &HT;    Financially plagued Roberds closes its doors
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CARROLTON, Ohio _ Strapped for cash and struggling to keep
its stores filled with merchandise, home furnishings retailer
Roberds Inc. on Tuesday closed stores and distribution centers in
the Dayton and Atlanta areas and prepared to go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds, a West Carrollton-based retail chain that first sought
bankruptcy protection from creditors in January, filed a petition
Tuesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court calling for it to cease
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Closure of the chain's 15 stores in Ohio, Indiana and Georgia
will cost 1,300 jobs, including 650 in Roberds' Dayton market,
store officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds closed the stores so employees can take inventory and
prepare for a liquidation sale. Though the retail chain hasn't
selected a liquidator or determined when the sale will begin, the
company hopes to conclude the liquidation sale within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Melvin H. Baskin assured customers waiting for
purchased items that Roberds would try to provide them with either
merchandise or refunds. But he also asked customers to be patient
as management decides how to handle these claims. He hopes to have
more information for consumers within the next few weeks, he said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin, however, stopped short of pledging that all Roberds
customers will get either the money or goods owed to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee,'' he said. ``There is likelihood,
strong likelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberd's announcement Tuesday ended speculation about the
company's future that surfaced after it postponed its annual
shareholders meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said cash-flow problems and an inability to get furniture
and appliances from suppliers forced Roberds to abandon its
reorganization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Turning around the financially beleaguered company hinged on
attracting shoppers back to the stores and getting them the
merchandise they wanted, Baskin said. Since the bankruptcy filing,
though, vendors have been reluctant to supply the chain with
merchandise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to reach credit terms with vendors so Roberds
would have merchandise to sell has been one of the most frustrating
aspects of the reorganization, Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Vendors) were very cautious,'' Baskin said. ``We were quite
surprised that they did not stand behind us to the level that we
thought they would.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the Roberds board voted unanimously Thursday to
close the company. They had exhausted all other options, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genuine bottom line is we ran out of cash,'' he said. ``We
simply did not have any more money. So that left us with no
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the arrival of Best Buy, Circuit City and Rhodes
Furniture into the Dayton market made it more competitive and
contributed to Roberds' struggle.
</P>
<P>
   However, he would not blame Roberds' problems on a single
factor, including his management.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a series of events over a number of years that have
brought this company to where it is right now,'' said Baskin, a
former Federated Department Stores executive. ``My presence was an
attempt to turn the business around so that this would not happen.
I think that speaks to some degree for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberds has seen annual revenues dip from $342 million in 1996
to $287 million in 1999. The company also has experienced four
consecutive years of net losses. Sales for stores opened a year or
more have declined over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   When Roberds filed for Chapter 11 protection in January,
executives announced plans to exit the money-losing Cincinnati and
Florida markets, concentrating instead on Dayton and Atlanta.
Initially, management had hoped to turn the company around and
emerge from bankruptcy within 90 days. The company in January
listed assets of $142.5 million and debts of $117.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, executives met with employees to announce Roberds'
impending closure and to hear worker concerns about issues such as
medical benefits. Baskin said the decision to close the stores was
a difficult one, but he considers watching out for the employees to
be a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a lot,'' he said, his eyes moist. ``These are
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the company has tapped officials in Ohio, Indiana
and Georgia to supply workers with help as they lose their jobs. He
declined to discuss employee severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the company's headquarters and its flagship store,
both in West Carrollton, declined comment as they left Tuesday's
meeting. Uniformed security guards patrolled the store's parking
lot, turning away customers who wanted to know about undelivered
merchandise or refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin was unsure how much Roberds owes in furniture or refunds.
Some of the credit card purchases have been paid back, he said.
Still, the company has several million dollars in outstanding
merchandise due to customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot predict how much cash we will generate from the
going out of business sales or from sales of our various
properties,'' Baskin said. ``We therefore cannot predict at this
time how much money will be available to pay our various creditors
or whether any funds will be left for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident, however, that our current course of action
is the best option available under these circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Barkin, an assistant U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee said,
customers, along with taxes and administrative expenses, typically
are considered priority creditors.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton market, Roberds closed stores in Beavercreek,
Piqua, Springfield, Vandalia, West Carrollton and Richmond, Ind.,
as well as a distribution center in Fairborn. The company also will
close seven stores and a distribution center in Georgia. The
company already had planned to close a store in Atlanta, Ga., as
part of its reorganization effort.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors had hoped Roberds would emerge successfully from
bankruptcy proceedings, said Lawrence Walter, co-counsel for the
unsecured creditors committee. But he lauded Roberds' decision to
close before it exhausts all of its assets and can no longer pay
creditors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've made the appropriate decision, no matter how
lamentable that may be,'' he said. ``I can't fault them.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks for the creditors to still get some of their money
back, though he is unsure how much.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds executives said Tuesday they look for Nasdaq to remove
Roberds' stock from the exchange's small cap market. Trading of
Roberds' shares (NASDAQ:RBDSQ) halted in January after the company
filed for reorganization protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know what market, if any, will exist for our
stock,'' Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Those holding the company's 6.2 million shares of common stock
are considered unsecured creditors and whether they can recoup any
of their investment remains in question. Shareholders include
Chairman Don Wright, Deborah Fletcher, widow of Roberds co-founder
Kenneth Fletcher, Baskin and a handful of high-profile Dayton
business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Roberds' recent problems, Baskin said the company made
its mark in the local retail industry by offering strong customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that, Roberds leaves a powerful legacy,'' he said.

   REPUBS-PRIMARIES (Washington) _ A high-level Republican
committee proposes a new presidential nominating system intended to
build suspense and interest from March through June, with smaller
states voting first and larger states casting the decisive final
votes. The proposal comes as a sharp reaction to the current
system, in which both party nominations are effectively decided by
March 7, the first big primary day, before millions of Americans

the Southlake resident makes final preparations for the GTE Byron
Nelson Classic and MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe, 34, plans to play practice rounds at the host sites of
both local PGA Tour events this week. But he would prefer to be
called off the course by a call from his wife, Jennifer, who is due
May 14 with the couple's first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal situation would be to get the call Friday or
Saturday,'' said Jobe, who practices regularly at the Four Seasons
Resort in Irving, site of the Nelson tournament. ``That way, we'll
have family in town ... and Nelson week can be one, big
celebration. I think it would be pretty cool every year to be able
to celebrate your daughter's birthday in the same week as the Byron
Nelson.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said ``daughter.'' The Jobes already know they're having
a girl, which has complicated the name game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told us if it was a boy, we should name him Byron. But
what do you do with a girl ... call her Byretta? That doesn't sound
so good,'' said Jobe, who proudly peeled off his golf glove to
display a scar on his left index finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crib work,'' Jobe said. ``This is going to be a thrill. I just
hope little baby Jobe cooperates and I don't have to withdraw from
one of these events. If I do, I think everyone would understand.''

TIGER OPTING FOR NELSON NOT A SNUB TO COLONIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ By Friday, the worst-kept secret on the PGA
Tour will become public knowledge. Tiger Woods, barring unforeseen
circumstances, will commit to play in next week's GTE Byron Nelson
Classic for a fourth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the uncomfortable comparisons will resume for MasterCard
Colonial officials.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Fort Worth have known since February that Woods, the
lone golfer capable of elevating a tour event into a civic
happening, would be jetting off to Germany during Colonial week
(May 18-21) to defend a title at the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open on the
European Tour. For those keeping score, that's three consecutive
misses on the Tiger trail for the guys in plaid jackets, while
their Nelson counterparts continue to bat 1.000 in landing the
world's top-ranked golfer.
</P>
<P>
   That fact, compounded by rumor and innuendo, has convinced some
local golf fans that Woods has scratched Colonial from his PGA Tour
schedule for the next millennium. They envision a permanent Woods
boycott, turning the 54-year-old invitational event into the John
Deere Classic or B.C. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've heard that, too,'' said Clark Martin, a member of
the Colonial board of governors and a former club president.
</P>
<P>
   Martin punctuated his response with a wry smile and a roll of
his eyes. That's because such sentiment is in direct opposition to
feedback Colonial officials have received from Woods'
representatives. Those exchanges have centered on scheduling
conflicts, rather than negative perceptions about the tournament,
as reasons why the PGA Tour's top gate attraction has not set foot
in Fort Worth since 1997. That's why Colonial officials envision a
return engagement. And soon.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial tournament chairman Phil Thomas spoke confidently about
the possibility of Tiger sightings at ``Hogan's Alley'' in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would come close to betting that Tiger would be in this
field next year, unless he wins again in Germany,'' Thomas said,
noting that a repeat triumph probably would trigger another
European title defense during the week of the 2001 Colonial. ``I'm
not concerned about him \Rnever\S coming back. I don't think we're
on his bad list. I firmly believe he'll be here next year, and we'd
love to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Woods to tip his hand about scheduling plans. He
has yet to commit to the 2000 Nelson, much less the 2001 Colonial.
It's his policy not to acknowledge upcoming tournament appearances
until the Friday before the event, the minimum advance notice
required under PGA Tour rules.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that Woods was noncommittal when asked
about a possible return to Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said. ``Maybe some day, I'll be able to put my
name on that trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean? Only Tiger knows.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty about Woods and Colonial is that there were
hiccups in their initial encounter, which occurred at the apex of
the ``Tigermania'' craze during his rookie season. Colonial
officials began circulating Woods' name on their unofficial]
commitment list a month before the 1997 tournament, raising
eyebrows from agents who preferred a last-minute release of such
information.
</P>
<P>
   Once in town, Woods was greeted by a national media contingent
interested in chronicling his pretournament meeting with Fuzzy
Zoeller, who had uttered racially insensitive remarks in an
ill-advised attempt at humor after Woods' victory at the Masters.
Colonial officials went public with a suggestion that the two play
a bury-the-hatchet practice round, which never materialized. From
all indications, the idea was better received by Zoeller than
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   During the final round, Woods surrendered a share of the lead
with double bogeys at No. 9 and No. 17, ending his three-event
winning streak. Afterward, he refused interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Woods said, the off-course distractions he faced
during his six-event winning streak this season were ``not as bad,
or anywhere close, to what it was \Rlike\S at Colonial in 1997.
That was interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, some surmise that Woods has written off
Colonial. I disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be known, both Woods and Zoeller expressed gratitude to
club officials for their professionalism in handling their
clear-the-air luncheon summit in 1997. And, until proved otherwise,
I'll buy scheduling conflicts as an ongoing reason for Woods
skipping Colonial. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Woods vowed to significantly vary his 1998 schedule from events
he played as a rookie to placate the tournaments he skipped in
1997. In doing so, he skipped the 1998 Colonial. Last year, he
accepted a $750,000 appearance fee to play in Germany during
Colonial week, then won the event. This year, he's defending that
title. Perfectly reasonable, up and down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we've ever been told, in terms of Tiger, is that he's had
scheduling conflicts,'' said Scott Corpening, a tournament
committee member. ``I'd be absolutely amazed if he has an ax to
grind with Colonial.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Colonial deserves the benefit of the doubt in the saga
of the missing Tiger. But if Woods loses in Germany and skips Fort
Worth in 2001, it's time to start searching for that ax.

WHITE SOX'S BLISTERING START MIGHT NOT BE A MIRAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ We know that April showers bring the promise of future
flowers, but there's no axiom to tell us what future harvest will
be reaped from some of the bizarre statistics throughout baseball
in the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Are they aberrations or indicators, trends or flukes?
</P>
<P>
   It can be stated with some certainty that Jermaine Dye and Jose
Cruz Jr. won't finish the season first and second in the American
League in home runs, that Mike Bordick won't lead the AL in runs
batted in, and that Mike Morgan won't have more saves than John
Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's a pretty good bet that balls will
continue to clear the fence at record paces, that Enron Field will
continue to challenge Coors Field for the title of World's Best
Launching Pad, and that John Rocker will continue to be booed every
time the Braves leave Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   What to make, then, of the Chicago White Sox?
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to be also-rans, but instead went 17-8 in
April, the best record in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   They scored 181 runs, a major-league record for April. They led
the AL with a .304 average, 268 hits, 451 total bases, 11 triples,
and 173 RBI, and were second with 35 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   They spent 12 days alone in first place, 11 more than their
combined total from 1994-99.
</P>
<P>
   Trend, or fluke?
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, naturally, take the former view.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why we can't play like this every month of
the year,'' first baseman Paul Konerko said.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic viewpoint, however, suggests that they won't
continue to average 7.2 runs per game, that they won't continue on
a 110-victory pace, and that they won't continue to need a rearview
mirror to view the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's possible they just might be in
contention for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the White Sox were good going in,'' Indians GM John
Hart said. ``They're a lot like we were five or six years ago:
young, but a very good offensive team just starting to come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox are coming together only three seasons after they
were torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   They thought they were contenders after signing free-agent
slugger Albert Belle in 1997, and they indeed were in position to
make a run in the final couple of months. They were 31/2 games out
on July 31, and All-Star third baseman Robin Ventura was returning
from an injury.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of charging, they retreated. Sox management traded
closer Roberto Hernandez and starting pitcher Wilson Alvarez to the
San Francisco Giants for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Fans and media criticized the trade and with good reason. Teams
in contention should not roll over and play dead.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, though, the deal was the best thing to happen to
baseball on the South Side since they put those horrible mid-'70s
softball-style uniforms in mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   The trade brought in Bobby Howry and Keith Foulke, who are key
parts of a strong bullpen. Howry is the closer, and Foulke has
become the best setup man in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it signaled a commitment to rebuild with young
players. That strategy is paying off now with Magglio Ordonez,
Konerko, Carlos Lee and Chris Singleton, all key parts of the
lineup. Those players were able to develop over the past couple of
years in pressure-free environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been consistent for a longer period of time, and that
comes with experience,'' manager Jerry Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the White Sox remain contenders could depend a great
deal on what the front-office does in late July. The White Sox have
enough prospects in the system and there should be enough
flexibility in a small, $30 million payroll, to allow a trade for a
frontline starting pitcher that could make the difference in making
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, at least the White Sox have an intangible benefit
from the April numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun coming to the ballpark when you know you have a
chance to win,'' reliever Bill Simas said.

AFTER MAKING ADMISSIONS OFFERS, COLLEGES VIE FOR SELECT STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT18 is being sent to NYT photo clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert Dixon III, 18, thought he was dreaming when he was
awakened at 7 on a March morning by an admissions officer calling
from Williams College. She informed him that a thick letter
announcing his acceptance was on its way, as was a free round-trip
ticket to the campus, just to check out Williams one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Making his decision more difficult, Dixon, an aspiring history
teacher from San Francisco, had already received a more attractive
offer of free tuition from Morehouse College, a historically black
institution in Atlanta. (Williams had offered him only loans.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Wesleyan University, which had used a softer
sell _ a call of good wishes from a current student _ but had urged
him to attend a celebration last month for accepted seniors. He
left the campus in Middletown, Conn., smitten with the thick french
fries in the cafeteria and moved by an impromptu discussion of the
Holocaust that began after a videotape snapped in the middle of a
history class.
</P>
<P>
   For Dixon, who had spent the better part of a year pleading with
colleges to accept him, the role reversal was jarring.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 days from April 1, when such offers are generally
proferred, to May 1, when such decisions are due, is a time unlike
any other in the college admissions season, at least for a select
group of several thousand students. They become the
decision-makers, screening potential candidates against a yardstick
of their own idiosyncrasies, while the officers are reduced to
supplicants, promoting their schools as they brace for  &QL; 
rejections from many of those they wanted most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a courting period,'' said Rafael Figueroa, an associate
dean of admissions at Wesleyan. ``You're telling them, `This could
go places. We could have a great thing, you and me.' Then they turn
around and tell you, `Have a nice life. I'm going to Brown.'''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that Dixon _ who is black and whose high
College Board score of 1480, out of 1600, belied his B average _
felt like a prized athlete throughout April, so often was he plied
with messages from admissions officers, professors and students at
the six universities where he was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most sought-after candidates to top colleges receive
plane tickets from faraway places, but, as is the case at dozens of
colleges, all 1,850 students accepted to Wesleyan were to have
received at least one follow-up call, if not several, because a
letter of admission is no longer regarded as sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   This admissions season was the most competitive for the nation's
elite colleges, including Wesleyan, a lush-green liberal arts
college where enough students applied to fill the 715-member Class
of 2004 10 times. Flooding the class was an especially long
pipeline of high school graduates, many of them convinced that
attending a selective institution provided a guarantee of success
in life.
</P>
<P>
   But the proliferation of good applicants did not mean that
Wesleyan could let the responses just roll in. Hedging their bets,
many seniors like Dixon had applied to more than 10 colleges, which
only served to elevate the students' anxiety _ and the
institutions' _ as the students deliberated throughout April.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions officers, at Wesleyan as elsewhere, were uneasy
because they were intent on engineering a student body that was a
little better than last year's, to say nothing of those of rival
schools _ with ``better'' defined to include students with high
College Board scores, roots in minority communities, leadership
skills, science aptitude and the ability to play the oboe or second
base.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges like Wesleyan reason that assembling such a class can
only elevate the experiences of students and faculty, while
providing fringe benefits like a prouder alumni body (which may
give more money) and perhaps a higher ranking in closely read
guidebooks like those by U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it often seemed to admissions officers at Wesleyan, as
at Amherst and Williams, that they were pursuing many of the same
1,500 teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Jordan Goldman, 17, an aspiring writer from New
York City's Staten Island who has already collaborated with the
novelist Richard Price. Throughout the year, Goldman asked himself
if he needed the imprint of an Ivy League institution like Brown,
or whether he would be happier at a smaller, though still
prestigious, university like Wesleyan.
</P>
<P>
   He also could not dismiss an alluring proposition from New York
University, which dangled four trips to Europe as part of a
study-abroad program.
</P>
<P>
   And Jannely Almonte, 18, a resident of the South Bronx who
attends a prep school on scholarship in New Jersey, had to sift
through nine acceptance letters from selective colleges, as well as
their financial aid packages.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the unending flurry of e-mail messages from
professors and undergraduates that left her most confused: when she
returned from a trip to Columbia University last week, she found a
phone message from someone at Wesleyan encouraging her to call with
any questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a Michael Jordan trading card from his rookie
season,'' Almonte, who wants to study biology, said during a visit
to Wesleyan last month. ``The schools are putting in a lot of
effort to get me while I'm in mint condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the attention makes me feel good,'' she said. ``But I feel
bad. I have to think of some way to let them down easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the seniors worried that picking the wrong college might
darken the rest of their lives, with some waiting until Monday
night, within hours of the midnight deadline, to mail out their
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really see this decision as monumental,'' said Stephen
Singer, director of college counseling at Horace Mann School in New
York. ``You say to them, `There's no way you can screw this
decision up.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes them feel better,'' he added. ``For a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wesleyan had been hoping to persuade 650 to 675 of the students
it accepted to attend, leaving room to take as many as 50 others
off the waiting list in May and June. (By Tuesday, deposits from
656 were in hand, with perhaps two dozen more expected in
Wednesday's mail.)
</P>
<P>
   Those taken off the waiting list will be chosen, in part, to
``correct imbalances'' in the class, whether on the football team,
in science laboratories or among the ranks of Asian-American or
Hispanic-American students, when their representation in the new
class is compared with last year's, said Gregory Pyke, the senior
associate dean of admissions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To insure that its acceptances were accepted, Wesleyan employed
gestures as large as a phone call from a department chairman, to
jottings as small as ``Come to Wes!'' and ``Yes!'', which the dean
of admissions, Nancy Hargrave Meislahn, scribbled on all 1,500
letters of acceptance mailed out in late March. (About 350 other
students had been accepted early.)
</P>
<P>
   The officers plotted every detail, including when a dean might
contact a desirable student to make a pitch. (If the call came too
early, would Wesleyan appear desperate? If it was too late, would
Swarthmore have already gotten there?)
</P>
<P>
   They even hired a recent graduate _ his job is so new he does
not have a title _ to make e-mail contact on behalf of Wesleyan
with ``hot prospects,'' making sure, for example, that a student
who identified himself as Jewish knew how to reach the campus
rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   To help the students deliberate, Wesleyan created a list-serve _
a mass e-mail directory in which a message posted by one registered
applicant is automatically sent to all _ in which the accepted
students counseled each other, joined by the occasional Wesleyan
undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the dispatches on the list-serve, in which 200 high
school seniors posted as many as 400 messages a day, was like
looking through a microscope. Late at night from home, the high
school seniors dissected Wesleyan, along with Brown, Amherst,
Williams, Vassar and Dartmouth, seeking to determine whether the
number of Nobel laureates on the faculty (none at Wesleyan) was as
important as whether dogs are permitted in residence halls (they
are not.).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, the budding screenwriter, used the list-serve to hash
out his own decision, agonizing for eight long pages on April 17
over whether he should choose Wesleyan, ``Ivy U,'' ``Big City U,''
or a college he identified as ``Unnamed Gorgeous Small Liberal Arts
School.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final sentence, he revealed his decision: Wesleyan.
</P>
<P>
   What impressed him most, Goldman said, was that the university
had allowed students to put up posters during the celebration for
accepted applicants that took issue with the weekend being
alcohol-free _ not because they supported underage drinking, but
because they felt students might be getting a sanitized portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman wrote that he was struck by the ``absolute free
expression'' and that ``you won't find that an Ivy League school.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman _ who was accepted by Johns Hopkins and Vassar, but not
Brown or the University of Pennsylvania _ was so persuasive that at
least 25 seniors reported that his dispatch had made the difference
in their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can retire,'' Figueroa said. ``Jordan can take over from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Almonte, the prep school student in New Jersey by way of the
Bronx, managed in early April to jettison Trinity, Union College,
the University of Rochester, Connecticut College and Haverford,
leaving only Columbia and Wesleyan.
</P>
<P>
   Because her mother is a home health aide with a spare salary,
she had expected to go with the best financial offer. Though
Wesleyan and Columbia were close, Wesleyan was offering more money
up front, with Columbia tying up more aid in loans.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Goldman, Amonte, a Dominican whose parents did not
attend college, decided that an Ivy League education was too
important to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, my grandmother, my aunts and uncles, they always
expect me to choose the best,'' she said. ``And according to their
mind, Ivy League is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesleyan also lost out on Katie Stockhammer, a straight-A soccer
captain from Florida, who had impressed the admissions committee in
March by maintaining her grades while being treated for cancer. She
chose Swarthmore, outside of Philadelphia, in part because it was
closer to a big city.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dixon felt like a three-pronged wishbone tugged by Morehouse,
Williams and Wesleyan?
</P>
<P>
   Though Morehouse's offer of a free ride would have eased the
financial burden on his father, an executive at a software company,
Dixon and his dad agreed that the education he'd receive at
Williams or Wesleyan would be superior.
</P>
<P>
   But which one?
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Sunday, over a slice of the special lemon pound cake
that his mother had prepared for his birthday, Dixon summoned his
parents to the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams is a school that most parents and teachers think is
great, simply because it's rated high academically,'' Dixon
explained. ``But socially, it's out in the middle of nowhere. And
it's really conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesleyan, he concluded, was not only more liberal and diverse,
``but in the classes I attended, even the kids I thought wouldn't
be smart or intelligent in a conversation ended up having some
pretty good things to say.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there were those Wesleyan french fries, which his dad
remembered as fondly as he did.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Dixon decided to head back for four years' worth of
second helpings.

   Admission to elite colleges is more competitive than at any time
in history. The New York Times asked Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Conn., to give a reporter full access to its selection
procedure. It did so, permitting him to read applications and
attend admissions meetings, on the condition that applicants'
identities not be revealed during the process. This is the third,
and last, of the articles. The previous articles can be found on

WHY THE NETWORKS DON'T SMELL IT WHEN SHOWS GO BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer is term limits. And the question has nothing to do
with Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   No indeed. It has to do with the shelf life of TV shows.
Specifically, a statute of limitations. Should a series be produced
with a termination date already in mind? And should networks offer
a warning when they introduce their new shows? Something like:
``Welcome to `ER.' We hope you enjoy the 44 episodes that we plan
to produce over the next two seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. If shows came stamped with an expiration date,
like a gallon of milk, we'd avoid the sour-smelling puddle of ennui
that seeps out from under the TV table whenever a show starts to
get long in the tooth. This feeling of detachment, characterized by
an uncontrollable urge to see what else is on, varies from one show
to the next. But, aside from the occasional exception like ``The
Simpsons,'' it's pretty much inevitable. With ``Ally McBeal,'' it
happened early in the second season. With ``ER,'' it was season
four. Or maybe five.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. It's as predictable as green on cheese. Like it or
not, a TV show is perishable, just like broccoli. It eventually
becomes unappetizing, and ultimately unconsumable. At this point,
we tend to throw the food out. But networks will serve the rank,
the stale and the moldy without a moment's hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   It's because no one is checking to see when a good show has gone
bad, least of all the viewers. We get hooked when things are good,
when the show is crackling with witty dialogue, clever plot twists
and great chemistry. We expect it to remain good because no one
told us that the last decent idea the show ever had was used up a
couple seasons back, just before the original writers and producers
departed to start another series. That's why last week's plot
seemed remarkably like one that ran during the show's second
season, only with different characters in the key positions.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, long-running shows _ the kind that go on for
five, six, seven seasons _ are scarcer than homely people on The
WB. In England, for instance, no one really worries about a series
overstaying its welcome, because they don't stay long. Two or three
seasons, maybe four, and it's on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   That probably would have been a suitable life expectancy for an
ensemble series like ``Party of Five,'' which ends its six-season
run Wednesday night on Fox. I ceased being a regular watcher two
seasons ago after Charlie, flush with his victory over Hodgkin's
disease, met a stripper and got her pregnant. It seemed that the
writers were reaching, grasping, clawing to keep the story of the
orphaned Salinger siblings viable. I remember thinking at the time
that no family could possibly experience as much melodrama in a
year as the Salingers did in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rosie O'Donnell, who claims to have seen every episode of
``Party of Five,'' I packed it in just about the time Julia got
back into Stanford. I missed, thank heaven, Julia's newest
ill-starred relationship, Charlie's proposal of marriage to Kirsten
(she said yes), Bailey's proposal of marriage to Sarah (she said
no), Charlie and Kirsten's wedding, and Claudia's losing her
virginity. Eeew. I'd rather remember Claudia as the
wiser-than-her-years moral compass who kept the rest of the gang
centered.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, you'll never get a producer to admit that a show has
lost its edge. As long as the studio is willing to pay a handsome
sum _ usually in the mid to high six figures each season _ not too
many producers would have the artistic courage to follow along when
his muse decides to take a sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   And so greatness, or near-greatness, begets mediocrity, as good
shows peter out after passing what should have been their natural
expiration dates. Granted, it's impossible to know exactly when a
show will lose it. But doesn't it make sense to decide up front
that a show will have a finite run of, say, three or four seasons?
That way, the ending might come before the wheels start to fall
off.
</P>
<P>
   The inherent lunacy of term limits is that you just don't cancel
a show, no matter how tired, if people are still tuning in. ``ER''
is rarely hitting on all cylinders these days, but it remains the
favorite drama series in America because viewers have simply become
conditioned to tuning in on Thursdays at 10. Still, I can think of
several new shows that are infinitely more appealing right now,
notably ``The West Wing,'' ``Roswell'' and ``Once and Again,'' but
NBC recently renewed ``ER'' through the 2003-2004 season, assuring
it of at least a 10-year run.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' is the exception to a rule that requires most series to
disappear after a brief time in the spotlight. So the idea of
predetermining a show's lifespan is counterintuitive in an industry
set up to perpetuate an economic model that anticipates a large
failure rate. Without this model, the industry would collapse under
the weight of too many successful shows preventing new pilots from
getting on the air.
</P>
<P>
   But these successes are measured in quantity, not quality. Once
a show gets four seasons in, it has enough episodes to be
syndicated, which is where the real money is. If some network
executive were to decree that the premise of a certain show seems
doable for only three seasons before it runs out of steam, the
whole syndication bonanza is out the window.
</P>
<P>
   That's the biggest problem with term limits, and the reason
it'll never happen in this country until the networks put art
before the dollar.

NEW CHIEF NAMED IN POWER SHIFT AT POP POWERHOUSE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a long-expected power shift, Antonio Reid was
formally named Tuesday as the new chief executive of Arista
Records, the 25-year-old pop powerhouse that for months has been
bracing for the departure of its founder and longtime leader, Clive
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the record label's parent, BMG
Entertainment, ended what had been a long-running and uncommonly
public struggle over the replacement of Davis, 67, an old-fashioned
music industry titan who nurtured artists like Janis Joplin, Barry
Manilow, Whitney Houston and Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 43, chief of his own Atlanta-based label, LaFace Records,
said Tuesday that he had discussed his appointment with Davis. It
remained unclear what sort of role Davis would play in a
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was noticeably muted Tuesday in his comments about his
replacement, who will take over in early July after Davis' own
contract ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I regret the imposition of the Bertelsmann retirement
age policy, it's time now to turn to a new and vital chapter in
this fast-changing world of music,'' Davis said in a statement he
issued after declining to be interviewed. He added that he was
looking at offers to start his own record label, including a
potential deal with BMG.
</P>
<P>
   BMG Entertainment said that LaFace Records would be consolidated
with Arista through BMG's purchase of the remaining 50 percent of
LaFace that it did not own.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation could lead to expansion because of plans to
increase Arista's reach into genres like Latin music, said Reid and
Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of BMG Entertainment. ``Neither
one of us expects to go through the unfortunately typical process
of roster reduction and consolidation that new label presidents
often go through,'' Zelnick said.
</P>
<P>
   With gross revenues of about $425 million, Arista is expected to
achieve record profits by the end of its fiscal year in June,
partly on the strength of Santana's best-selling album
``Supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reid said that Arista could probably improve its
performance. ``We intend to make Arista the home for many Latin
artists, record producers and Latin superstars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, the son of a Cincinnati seamstress who got his musical
start as a drummer for a group called the Deele, helped create
LaFace Records 11 years ago, cultivating Atlanta's thriving hip-hop
and urban music scene with performers like Toni Braxton, TLC, Usher
and OutKast. He founded that label with Babyface Edmonds, a
left-handed guitarist from the Deele. Edmonds is to head his own
record label, which will be called Joe Lies Music. &QL;

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ As the Rangers prepare to negotiate with
Las Vegas officials, the Florida House of Representatives passed a
bill Monday that would provide $75 million in tax money to upgrade
the state's spring training facilities. The bill must still be
passed by the Senate and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' facility in Port Charlotte, Fla., is among those
that would receive financing. Charlotte County officials recently
asked the Rangers for a wish list of improvements that would keep
them there after their lease expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers vice president John McMichael said the club is looking
for increased storage space in the major-league clubhouse, a
permanent weight room in the minor-league facility, meeting rooms
and a renovated press box.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and five other teams _ Los Angeles Dodgers, Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros and Toronto Blue
Jays _ are considering moving their spring training facilities to
Las Vegas in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still working on that,'' McMichael said. ``We're talking
among ourselves, and they're still looking at projections,
revenues, how much everything will cost. We're preparing to
negotiate with them, and they're preparing to negotiate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers stay in Port Charlotte and use state money to
upgrade the facility, the bill requires that they sign a 15-year
lease and agree to pay for half the costs of improvements.  &QL; 
Palmeiro returns
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro returned to the Rangers' lineup last night, even
though he's still bothered by a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've missed enough games,'' Palmeiro said. ``I'm sure I'm
risking something, but anytime you go out there, you're risking
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Danny Wheat said Palmeiro played with a strained
hamstring early last season and only missed one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went back out there while it was still bothering him, but
after a couple of games, he was fine,'' Wheat said. ``He's shown me
he knows how to protect it and play.''  &QL; 
Other injury news
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Justin Thompson played catch in the outfield and felt no
pain in his left shoulder. He'll test the shoulder again today with
a throwing session in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer, on the disabled list after undergoing ankle
surgery, has begun running in the outfield and hitting balls off a
tee. He reported no problems with the ankle, but his hamstring is
not quite 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto (torn groin muscle) is walking without pain
but is still limited in his workouts. He's going to be out awhile.
 &QL; 
Big start for Clark
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates does not hide the fact that tonight is a
big start for Mark Clark. The Rangers' fifth starter has allowed 11
runs in 61/3 innings over his past two starts, and Oates is
considering starting a left-hander _ either Doug Davis or Matt
Perisho _ against Oakland on Sunday. In that scenario, Rick
Helling, who normally would pitch Sunday, would be moved to Monday
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time, we have to make decisions,'' Oates said. ``I'd like
nothing better than Mark to pitch well and earn a chance to go back
out there in four or five days. It makes us a better ballclub if he
pitches well.''  &QL; 
Early work for Mateo
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers held extra early batting practice yesterday for the
second time on the road trip. Ruben Mateo was there, as he was
Friday in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to work out early, the first day in a city,'' Mateo
said. ``I want to keep on doing what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo went into last night's game with eight hits in his past 21
at-bats, raising his average to a season-high .281.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I'm not happy, but I would feel better if
the team was winning,'' Mateo said. ``It doesn't matter if you're
doing well ... it would be much better if the team was winning and
I was putting up numbers.''  &QL; 
Canseco likely to miss series
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco was scratched from the Tampa Bay lineup yesterday
because of tightness in his right calf muscle. Canseco has been
bothered by that and a strained left hamstring muscle since spring
training. He is not expected to play in any of the three games
against the Rangers.

RANGERS USING PLATOON AT THIRD BASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Rangers are trying to find a way to
get their pitching staff down to 11 pitchers and keep Mike Lamb and
Tom Evans as a platoon at third base for the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on what they do with pitchers Mark Clark and Matt
Perisho. But having Evans and Lamb share third-base duties seems to
be the Rangers' best answer at a troubling position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Johnny \ROates\S about something along those
lines,'' general manager Doug Melvin said. ``If we can get down to
11 pitchers and keep pitching effectively, it would be nice to have
that extra bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers third basemen went into last night's game hitting .224
with one home run and eight runs batted in. Lamb, a left-handed
hitter, and Evans, a right-handed hitter, have been platooning at
third since Frank Catalanotto went on the disabled list with a
strained groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had 11 pitchers and both those guys on the team, you'd
have one guy \RLamb\S known for his bat and another \REvans\S known
for his glove,'' Melvin said. ``It would be nice to have both on
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have some time to make that decision because
Catalanotto is expected to need at least two more weeks before he's
ready to return. That gives Lamb and Evans time to catch Oates' eye
and prove they belong in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're both going to get a chance to play as much
as possible,'' Oates said. ``It will depend on if I need a 12th
pitcher more than a backup third baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Rangers haven't needed 12 pitchers. Going into
yesterday, their starters had worked 1541/3 innings, second in the
American League behind the Anaheim Angels. That gives the Rangers
hope they might be able to drop a pitcher when Catalanotto
returns..
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Lamb is getting most of the playing time at third. He
has started seven of eight games since being called up from the
minor leagues, all against right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things,'' Evans said. ``I understand.
When I was in there against right-handers, I didn't produce the way
they wanted. So right now I've got to out there in batting practice
and work that much harder and focus more, because I'm not going to
be in there that often. Games that I am in, I've got to be prepared
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Oates: ``Both have a chance to play at the big-league
level.Eventually you'll have to make a decision on who will play
every day. Not right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Rangers go with a platoon.

   Bill West is intent on repairing his image and plotting his next
act. History will show, he insists, that his nightmare with the
Clinton Justice Department was all the doing of his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a wave of Bill nostalgia. When you look at the
alternatives, these guys start to look pretty good. For better or
worse, they're originals.

 &HT;    Ambitious company facing competition on several fronts
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier and Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The mission: Turn the Internet into the medium for 30
billion health care transactions each year, make it the place where
consumers, doctors, hospitals and insurers go for information, the
forum in which they do business.
</P>
<P>
   It is a giant undertaking, but the payoff could be stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Healtheon/WebMD plans to become the one company
that achieves those goals, reaching from one end of the health care
system to the other and connecting it all via the Net. With tens of
billions of dollars at stake _ investors have already pumped well
over $1 billion into Healtheon/WebMD _ the atmosphere has been
rarefied, but the path has been a bit bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon got its start in Silicon Valley, founded by Netscape
founder Jim Clark. WebMD was founded in Atlanta entrepreneur Jeff
Arnold, now 30. The two companies seemed headed in the same
direction _ each convinced that the trillion-dollar health care
economy would inevitably move to the Net, each with huge ambitions
to shape and dominate the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the two merged.
</P>
<P>
   The deal formed an online health care conglomerate _ if such a
thing can be said about a young company far from turning a profit.
The stock market valued the new Atlanta-based company at more than
$19 billion. It started an impressive run of partnerships and
acquisitions, capped by a flurry earlier this year:
</P>
<P>
   In January, Janus Capital bought 15 million shares of
Healtheon/WebMD at $62 a share, an investment of $930 million.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February, Healtheon/WebMD agreed to buy Envoy,
OnHealth Network and CareInsite for stock that was worth, at the
time of the deals, almost $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Healtheon/WebMD hired the head of ABC Television,
Patricia Fili-Krushel, and Steven Grant, a vice president with
American Express. Grant is the new chief operating officer,
replacing Mike Long, who remains co-chairman. Fili-Krushel, the
first woman to run a major television network, oversees WebMD
Health, which includes WebMD TV, a joint effort by WebMD and Fox
Television. The channel is expected to be launched this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Other news has been less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   And Healtheon/WebMD's stock has suffered as a result. Shares of
Healtheon traded above $60 when those deals were made earlier this
year. The stock even crested above $100 when the merger with WebMD
was announced last spring. The stock closed Tuesday at $20, up 25
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the stock's slide lies with Healtheon's
performance. The company's first-quarter earnings, reported in
March, underwhelmed analysts and started the stock on a downward
slide. But competition also has something to do with it.
Healtheon/WebMD's marketing message is that it wants to ``make
health care ... healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of the companies are showing signs of healing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In March, insurance companies and drug makers said they
considering forming an Internet venture to link doctors, patients
and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Cigna, WellPoint Health Systems, Oxford
Health Plans, Foundation Health Systems and PacifiCare Health
Systems said they wanted to make the Internet the place doctors,
for example, checked whether a patient was eligible for health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``push back'' from other quarters _ many of them with deep
pockets _ was predictable, said Elizabeth W. Boehm, an analyst with
Forrester Research. ``Healtheon/WebMD had come at them with a very
arrogant message _ that health care was fouled up and they were
going to fix it. The message (from insurers) is that existing
insurers don't necessarily want another player to come between them
and their members, between them and their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort could pose a threat to Healtheon/WebMD, which is
trying to do the same thing. In mid-April, the challenge grew more
ominous. Five major health care product distributors said they were
creating Web sites to preserve their place in the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriSource Health, Cardinal Health, Fisher Scientific
International, McKesson HBOC and Owens &AMP; Minor said they would
invest $100 million to create NewHealthExchange.com. The venture is
designed as an Internet marketplace for physicians with one place
for information about medical products, pricing and availability.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is not only competition but a fragmented health
care sector where it is hard to be all things to all people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the shine has come off Healtheon/WebMD in the past few
months,'' Boehm said. ``The question is whether they can do all of
it well if they are going to do so many different things. Execution
is a lot harder than it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are a key to Healtheon's ability to link insurers,
patients and hospital groups.
</P>
<P>
   The cliche is that doctors resist technology. Physicians are
increasingly coming online, but most practices lack Internet
access. The percentage of doctors using the Web rose from 20
percent in 1997 to 37 percent in 1999, according to a December
study by the American Medical Association. Some 58 percent said
they plan on acquiring access to the Web in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of doctors who use a computer stayed flat, at 41
percent, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors use the Web, according to the study, to send and receive
e-mail, to find medical information and for travel information.
They are not yet converts to the ``new economy'' _ at least not at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the AMA study, a report from Forrester says that much of
the buzz about getting doctors connected rests on fallacies. For
example, consumers will not quickly force doctors online. Yet
Forrester predicts that after a nasty shakeout of weaker players,
Heatheon/WebMD will be one of the survivors.

COMMENTARY: BLESSED ARE THE WEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So this is the way the euro begins: not with a bang but a
whimper.
</P>
<P>
   Many enthusiasts for Europe's new unified currency, introduced
only 16 months ago, expected the euro to quickly become a powerful
rival to the dollar; they also expected the euro to be a very
strong currency, largely because of its international role. This
never made much sense if you thought it through; but anyway, it
hasn't happened. Introduced at a value of roughly $1.17, the euro
has been more or less steadily declining ever since; last week it
briefly fell almost to 90 cents before staging a modest recovery.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, when it comes to the euro I am an ugly American.
That is, I am one of those naysayers who was never convinced that a
unified European currency was a particularly good idea, and always
suspected that Europeans were enthusiastic about monetary union
because it gave them an excuse not to think about other problems.
So you might expect me to be gloating over the euro's slide. But
the truth is that the weakness of the euro is not a sign of
economic malaise. European economies are actually doing somewhat
better than most outsiders, myself included, expected. And the
currency's decline despite that good news says more about the
rationality of markets than about Europe's monetary experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's three fundamental problems _ the problems that monetary
union gave Europeans an excuse to ignore _ are jobs, jobs and jobs.
An old joke among economists is that the European definition of a
boom is a year in which the unemployment rate rises less than
usual. Behind this poor employment performance lies the phenomenon
of ``eurosclerosis'': a labor market so clogged with government
rules and regulations that European companies have had little
incentive to create new jobs _ especially the low-wage jobs that in
the United States provide the young and minority groups with a
first step into the world of work. Europeans have, of course, been
caustic about the American model. And this rhetoric, whose
implications we ugly Americans in turn tend to ridicule as a policy
of no jobs at good wages, continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look at what is actually happening in Europe, you
discover that in the last couple of years quite a lot of job
creation has in fact taken place _ and much of it involves the
creation of precisely the kind of low-wage employment that European
governments supposedly oppose. The telltale sign is what is
happening to output per worker; in the countries where employment
is expanding fastest, like Spain, productivity is actually
declining. This is, believe it or not, a good sign, an indicator
that marginal workers are finally finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   What naive Americans failed to understand, it turns out, was the
talent of at least some European societies for creative hypocrisy.
The government of France, for example, continues to talk the talk
of horror at the brutal American model of capitalism. In reality,
however, even as the French government introduces seemingly
anti-market policies like a mandated reduction in the workweek, it
has quietly allowed companies to exploit loopholes in the system _
using the shortened official workweek as an excuse to scrap old
rules about worker scheduling, employing vast numbers of part-time
workers, and so on. The result is that while unemployment in much
of Europe is still extremely high by U.S. standards, and especially
so among the young, it is finally starting to come down.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the weakness of the euro is unjustified,
that markets are not giving Europe enough credit? In a word, yes.
Look at the interest rates: 10-year euro bonds yield about 5.2
percent, not much less than the 6.1 percent yield on dollar bonds.
So anyone who buys a dollar bond instead of a euro bond is in
effect forecasting that the euro will be worth barely more 10 years
from now than it is today. This is just not plausible when you bear
in mind that the United States is running a huge trade deficit _
and has inflation that, while not severe, is significantly above
the rate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of the euro, then, is not a verdict on the European
economy. It's just one of those things that markets do now and
then; and it, too, shall pass.

POWER STRUGGLE AT ROOT OF FORMER SLOVAKIAN LEADER'S ARREST
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia _ Bold or bizarre, the violent arrest of
former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar may finally, the government
hopes, put an end to his extraordinary influence over Slovak
politics.
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, masked commandos from the organized-crime unit blew
down the back door of Meciar's villa with dynamite and took him
away at gunpoint for questioning. He was quickly released. But the
raid raised new questions about a bruising politician who, polls
show, may be both the most popular and the most unpopular in
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Populist, nationalist and hyperbolic in his language, Meciar, a
former boxer, ran Slovakia from its independence in 1993, after the
divorce from the Czech Republic, until September 1998, when he was
defeated by a coalition of four diverse parties.
</P>
<P>
   His government was widely considered illiberal, discriminatory
and corrupt, practicing crony politics. So much so that Slovakia
became a pariah, left out of the first round of NATO expansion and
shunned for entry negotiations by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But only a year ago, Meciar won 43 percent of the vote in the
presidential election, losing to a former Communist, and his party
remains the most popular, winning 25 percent support in polls.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, despite difficult economic times _ including an
unemployment rate of 22 percent _ because of long-delayed
restructuring and reform, Meciar's popularity has been dropping
enough that the government of Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda was
able to quietly sanction the raid on Meciar's villa.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his arrest, several thousand supporters rallied
here to protest and scream epithets at Dzurinda.
</P>
<P>
   Meciar was seized because he refused to cooperate with
investigators. Although he was quickly released, he is being
investigated for paying $350,000 in ``illegal bonuses'' to cabinet
members, and he faces questioning about the kidnapping of the son
of the president of Slovakia in 1995. The kidnapping is widely
believed to have been carried out by the secret police on Meciar's
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is formally about the bribes but informally about the
kidnapping,'' said Grigorij Meseznikov, president of the Institute
for Public Affairs, a research group. ``Everyone knows he was
involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Meciar's party had dropped, from 32 percent in the polls to 25
percent, Meseznikov said, and the criminal accusations will hurt
him. ``I don't think he can return to power,'' Meseznikov said.
``It's hard to imagine that any of the democratic parties will go
into coalition with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and added: ``Of course, since 1990, people have been
saying that Meciar was finished. But he keeps coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dzurinda is widely admired in the West for trying to bring
Slovakia back, as quickly as he can, to the prescribed route of
reform for former Communist states. With a smart young economist,
Ivan Miklos, as deputy prime minister, he has moved rapidly to cut
the budget, trade deficits and foreign debt and to restart a more
open process of privatization that will include banks, energy and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   But ``because of Mr. Meciar, we've lost time, nearly 10 years,''
Miklos said. ``The Meciar legacy is lack of investor confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That is most visible in comparison with the Czech Republic,
which has some of the same problems of cronyism and corruption.
Last year, the Czech Republic attracted $4 billion in direct
foreign investment; Slovakia, just $350 million. And as usual,
restructuring has led to higher unemployment and a drop in the
government's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Dzurinda has also promised new respect for human rights and a
fairer deal for Slovakia's Gypsies, who make up 8 percent of the
population and who face widespread discrimination and joblessness.
He is pushing Slovakia for the next round of NATO expansion,
whenever that will come, and trying to get President Clinton to
stop here next month.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia is about to join the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, and the European Union has invited the
new government to talks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dzurinda expressed some concern over the
cohesion of his broad coalition. His center-right party is itself a
merger of five smaller parties. A new populist party called Smer,
or Direction, run by a young lawyer and former Communist, Robert
Fico, has quickly emerged from nothing to become the second most
popular party.
</P>
<P>
   Fico is described by experts and diplomats here as purposefully
vague, making broad populist comments that criticize crime,
corruption, the Russian and Slovak mafias and the Gypsies, but
maintaining a pro-European stance and saying he will never
cooperate with Meciar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold the door open for Fico,'' Dzurinda said. ``On the one
hand, I'm not so happy with his party. He's a bit populist. But
he's not Meciar.''

 &HT;    Ga.-Pacific reaching out to consumers with new ads
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ In its broadest image-building move ever,
Georgia-Pacific plans to unveil TV ads today that emphasize it's
more than just a paper and wood products company.
</P>
<P>
   The new branding campaign reminds consumers the Atlanta-based
manufacturer is an integral part of home life.
</P>
<P>
   In one ad previewed Tuesday at the annual shareholders meeting
in Augusta, there are flashes of household activities and little
reminders of where Georgia-Pacific fits in. A family unpacks
groceries at a kitchen table, and the word ``here'' pops up on a
package of Angel Soft bathroom tissue and also on a wooden table
leg. ``Not here'' appears on aluminum foil that a young girl plays
with nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In another segment, ``yesses'' are superimposed on parts of a
deck and windswept sheets of paper that youngsters scramble to
grab. The tagline is ``We make the things that make you feel at
home. ``We want Georgia-Pacific to be widely known as more than a
collection of building products and paper products,'' Chairman and
Chief Executive Pete Correll told shareholders. ``Ultimately, we
want to make the Georgia-Pacific name a preference-driving vehicle
for all of our products.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Georgia-Pacific has been stamping its name on stacks
of lumber and other building products, but only recently has the
company best known for pulp and plywood tried to push its name
closer to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, its logo began appearing on the front of Sparkle paper
towels and Angel Soft tissue packages. The company's new liquid
hand soap, Pacific Garden, also carries the logo.
</P>
<P>
   The new TV spots were created by Fallon McElligott New York
City. Framed in a ``letterbox'' cinematic style with upbeat,
acoustic music in the background, the ads aim to reach homeowners
rather than Georgia-Pacific's base of commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   The switch in marketing mind-set came after Georgia-Pacific made
its timber-growing business a separate operating group from its
manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, we built our company on a philosophy of
looking at the resource, determining what we could manufacture and
then driving that product to the market,'' Correll said. Now the
marketing perspective has turned away from two-by-fours and other
commodities to a focus on consumer products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now must become a company that talks to our customers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will start running Thursday on national cable networks
such as Home &AMP; Garden Television and the Food Channel. They'll also
run on network stations in regional markets where Georgia-Pacific
has a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Georgia-Pacific's stock rose $1.25, closing at
$38.25.

MARKET PLACE: DESPITE PROGRESS, AT&AMP;T FINDS INVESTORS IMPATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a day like Tuesday, it is easy to see that C.
Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&AMP;T, may have the toughest job in
Corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst day for AT&AMP;T's investors in more than a dozen
years, and Armstrong probably has not had such an unpleasant
professional experience since he took over the company in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T announced quarterly financial results that met analysts'
expectations. But the company also warned that its earnings and,
perhaps more important, its revenue growth for the full year would
be lower than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfalls are slight. Rather than earning $1.89 to $1.94 a
share before special charges, the company now expects to earn $1.80
to $1.85. Revenue after acquisitions had been expected to grow by 8
to 9 percent, but the company cut that projection to 7 to 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, AT&AMP;T's shares fell 14 percent, or $6.8125,$41.9375,
on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the biggest percentage
decline in AT&AMP;T's stock, one of the most widely held in the nation,
since the stock market crash of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps adding some psychological pain to the financial burn,
AT&AMP;T ended a trading session for the first time with a lower market
value than one of its Baby Bell progeny _ $134 billion to SBC
Communications Inc.'s $144 billion _ according to Thomson Financial
Securities Data, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking AT&AMP;T's top job after three decades at IBM and a
stint running General Motors' Hughes Electronics unit, Armstrong
has been a whirlwind of activity trying to reinvigorate AT&AMP;T and to
take advantage of the revolution in digital communications. He has
committed more than $90 billion of his shareholders' money to build
the nation's biggest cable television operation. He has spent
billions more building the company's torrid wireless division. He
is intent on making AT&AMP;T the biggest provider of high-speed
Internet service to American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's vertigo-inducing selloff, all these
initiatives are going well. But AT&AMP;T simply has not been able to
escape its deteriorating legacy as a long-distance telephone
carrier and is running out of chances with impatient investors who
are hoping that AT&AMP;T's future is now.
</P>
<P>
   With defiance in every word, Armstrong defended his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of speculation or comment on whether we can
we grow the businesses that we've invested in and acquired,'' he
said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ``Take wireless and
broadband. We're redefining the AT&AMP;T circuit-switched network to
one that is both optical and broadband. These are the businesses
that we have invested in for the future, and this year they're
going to grow over 12 percent and their growth rate is
accelerating. Three years ago, we were growing at 1.7 percent and
we had a domestic long-distance voice business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news about today's results,'' he added, ``is that it
is a confirmation that the growth businesses are growing. They are
meeting all of their underlying metrics.''
</P>
<P>
   However, AT&AMP;T said Tuesday that its core consumer long-distance
telephone business is shrinking even faster than the company had
previously led analysts to believe and that its unit that serves
business customers had mismanaged some of its biggest accounts.
Forbearance was not in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, AT&AMP;T had guided stock analysts to expect that
revenue for its consumer unit, which is dominated by long-distance
telephone sales, would shrink by 3 to 5 percent this year. Tuesday,
the company said the unit would shrink by 5 to 7 percent, a victim
of the growing popularity of wireless phones and of low-cost
calling plans like its own flat-rate long-distance plan for 7 cents
a minute. (AT&AMP;T added that if a regulatory plan to which it has
agreed takes effect, the decline would actually be 6 to 8 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   That was not a killer for AT&AMP;T. Just about everyone on Wall
Street and in the communications business knows that AT&AMP;T's
consumer unit is shrinking and if the pace is accelerating, well,
perhaps that is to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   What was not expected was the problem in the company's business
services unit, which has been consistently robust in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, AT&AMP;T transferred almost 300 of its biggest
corporate accounts to its Concert joint venture with British
Telecom. The company also moved 1,200 big accounts into a different
internal organization that Armstrong believed enjoyed better
executive leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the shuffle, some customers were neglected, if not lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really shuffled too many people too fast across accounts,
broke a few relationships,'' Richard Roscitt, the new chief of
AT&AMP;T's business-services unit, said Tuesday in a conference call
with financial analysts. ``It is a set of accounts where we frankly
did not pay enough attention to the high end.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company said that the business-services unit
would grow by about 8 percent, instead of the previously expected 9
to 11 percent. (By comparison, AT&AMP;T's wireless unit is expected to
grow by 25 to 30 percent, and the company's cable unit by 12 to 14
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   As in the consumer unit, the shortfall in the business-services
operation did not appear huge. In fact, judging strictly by the
numbers, a strong case could be made that the magnitude of
Tuesday's sell-off was an overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   But when investors have the jitters about a company, as they do
about AT&AMP;T, it is rarely all about the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's people anticipating another shoe dropping,'' said
Richard G. Klugman, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
``It sounded like these were not blips on the radar screen. It
sounded like there are fundamental issues that the company will
have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Discounting special charges and some outside investments, AT&AMP;T
met analysts' expectations by earning 53 cents a share, or $1.7
billion, in the last quarter, down from 61 cents a share, or $1.7
billion, a year earlier. Revenue after acquisitions increased by
5.8 percent, to $15.8 billion, from $15 billion during the
comparable period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Including all charges, investments and acquisitions, AT&AMP;T earned
54 cents a share, or $1.7 billion, up from 38 cents, or $1.1
billion, during the comparable period last year. Reported revenue
increased by 12.3 percent, to $15.8 billion from $14.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing its cost-cutting drive, AT&AMP;T said it would cut 6,200
jobs, or about 4 percent of its work force, by the end of the year.
The company declined to provide more specific information about the
cuts, but more than 1,000 jobs could be lost in New Jersey, home to
AT&AMP;T's headquarters, according to an executive close to the
company.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: TALKS CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   After inconsequential meetings with Ulster's Catholic and
Protestant political leaders at 10 Downing Street, Prime Minister
Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, scheduled more
talks in Belfast on Thursday. The sessions are seeking to restart
the power-sharing government suspended by Britain, which said it
acted because of the failure of the Irish Republican Army to make
expected moves on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND: BODY SEARCH
</P>
<P>
   Working with new information from the Irish Republican Army,
diggers searched in County Louth for the remains of Jean
McConville, a mother of 10 who was killed by the IRA in 1972 after
she comforted a wounded British soldier. Digging for the bodies of
nine IRA victims from the 1970s began at the end of last May; three
bodies were found before excavation was suspended.

   Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, 60, the new bishop in a turbulent
diocese in Chiapas state, said he is opposed to the armed tactics
of the Zapatista guerrillas but also warned that poverty and
inequality breed violence. Thousands of Indian worshippers thronged
San Cristobal de las Casas when Bishop Arizmendi took over from
Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, who retired after 40 years. Ruiz was
revered by many Indians but was accused by the government of
preaching Marxism.

   Seventeen U.N. peacekeepers from India and Kenya were taken
hostage in northern and eastern Sierra Leone by rebels who have yet

   Seeking increased diplomatic pressure on President Robert
Mugabe, Britain won support from the 54-nation Commonwealth in
condemning political violence, lawlessness and the occupation by
squatters of white-owned farms in Zimbabwe. A statement from an
influential Commonwealth panel in London coincided with reports
that a 15th opponent of Mugabe had died in violence linked to
coming elections.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Jockey Julie Krone, who took her final ride a
year ago at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie, became the first woman
to be elected into the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame, hall
officials announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Also elected were trainer Neil Drysdale, 1992 Horse of the Year
A.P. Indy, 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors and 1956
Kentucky Derby winner Needles.
</P>
<P>
   Krone's 3,545 victories are the most by a female jockey and she
is the only female jockey to win a Triple Crown race (aboard
Colonial Affair in the 1993 Belmont Stakes). Krone, 36, cried when
she talked about how her mother, Judi, helped her achieve her
dreams. Her mother died in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   When she told her mother she wanted to be a jockey, her mother
took her to Churchill Downs. But Julie Krone couldn't get in the
barn area because she was 15, a year too young. So Judi Krone went
to a store across the street and changed the date on the birth
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom had a sense of adventure,'' Krone said. ``She told me
when someone shuts a door on you, they left open a window.''
</P>
<P>
   The induction ceremony is scheduled Aug. 7 in Saratoga Springs,
N.Y.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The time looked good. But trainer Steve
Asmussen decided not to enter Snuck In for the Kentucky Derby
because the colt's work at five-eighths of a mile in 59 seconds _
the fastest of 26 horses at that distance yesterday at Churchill
Downs _ wasn't what Asmussen was hoping to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for him to settle,'' Asmussen said. ``His
demeanor right now isn't one that would be successful on Derby
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   That demeanor showed when Snuck In, under exercise rider Krissie
Knorr, aggressively tossed his head as he and his work mate began
picking up speed toward the five-eighths pole. Snuck In was even
more of a handful before he made it in front of the clocker's stand
on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real bad at the seven-eighths pole,'' Asmussen said.
</P>
<P>
   Asmussen said Snuck In is being pointed to the Preakness Stakes
on May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Asmussen also worked Lone Star Derby third-place finisher Big
Numbers yesterday. Big Numbers covered five-eighths of a mile in
1:001/5, fourth-fastest of the day at Churchill, and he's being
pointed to the May 13 Illinois Derby.  &QL; 
Other workouts
</P>
<P>
   Two other notable horses worked five-eighths yesterday: Captain
Steve went in 592/5 seconds, and The Deputy covered it in 1 minute.
Both Bob Baffert (trainer of Captain Steve) and Jenine Sahadi
(trainer of The Deputy) were pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Captain Steve worked without blinkers after racing
with them the past seven starts and will go in the Derby with
blinkers off.  &QL; 
A spot for China
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Laura Wohlers said Ifitstobeitsuptome won't race in the
Derby, leaving the door open for China Visit to get into the field.
</P>
<P>
   China Visit is undefeated in two starts, including the United
Arab Emirates Derby, and was flown to Kentucky from Dubai last week
by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.
</P>
<P>
   China Visit galloped 11/2 miles yesterday and is scheduled to
work five-eighths today.

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ In a highly critical report, a
commission investigating the fatal collapse of a traditional Texas
A&AMP;M University bonfire tower concluded Tuesday that students made
fundamental mistakes in building the huge structure and that
university officials failed to properly control the student-led
project.
</P>
<P>
   The accident on Nov. 18 killed 11 students and 1 former student
and injured 27 others. The five-member commission determined that
construction flaws and a sloped surface caused the lowest tier of
logs to break and set off the collapse of the 59-foot structure.
Yet in assessing responsibility, the commission pointed not to
current students and administrators but to an insular university
culture developed over decades that was resistant to change and
outside criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This failure has roots in decisions and actions by both
students and university officials over many, many years,'' said the
commission chairman, Leo Linbeck Jr., a Houston construction
executive. ``It created an environment where a complex and
dangerous structure was allowed to be built without controls.''
</P>
<P>
   For Texas A&AMP;M, known for the intense devotion and loyalty of
students and alumni, the accident has prompted much public
soul-searching over whether to continue the 90-year-tradition of
the bonfire. Every year, students spend two months harvesting
thousands of trees and erecting the tower in anticipation of the
school's annual football game with the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ray M. Bowen, the university president, said he would decide
the fate of the tradition within six weeks after reviewing the
commission's 2-inch thick report and consulting with student
leaders, faculty members, university officials and alumni. In
recent weeks, more than 6,000 students have signed petitions in
favor of continuing the tradition, known on campus simply as
Bonfire. About 3,000 people, mostly students, attended Tuesday's
final commission meeting at the school's basketball arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not made up my mind,'' Dr. Bowen said at a news
conference after the commission meeting. ``It may be that we will
continue to have a bonfire, it may be that we will not.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, speculation had swirled about the accident. News
accounts and documents released by the university revealed that
students had failed in several instances to follow a safety
handbook. The tower exceeded the allowed 55-foot height. Freshmen
and sophomores, who were considered inexperienced, were working on
the structure's top levels despite safety guidelines that
prohibited them from doing so. A crane operated by a student had
struck the tower. The guiding pole had snapped at least three
times. And toxicology reports indicated that 2 of the 12 victims
were legally drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did find evidence of drinking, horseplay and
hazing but said none of those activities contributed to the
collapse. The commission also minimized the impact of the incident
involving the crane and the actions of the students atop the stack,
and it ruled out sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire is a student-run activity with a faculty adviser and
a university committee, neither of which monitors the structure's
design.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Callaghan, a commission member, portrayed a loose
atmosphere in which the tower was built ``with no written
guidelines.'' Upperclassmen known as Red Pots and Brown Pots are
expected to train the thousands of students who take part, but
Callaghan said student leaders lacked the proper knowledge to
safely construct the tower.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bonfire was never built the same way twice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan also blamed university officials, saying the school
``addresses risk in student organizations reactively.'' She said
there several warning signs of problems: The tower collapsed in
1957 and again in 1990, though no one was injured. Injuries related
to the bonfire had risen to 59 in 1998 from 32 in 1996. Yet she
said university officials had ``tunnel vision'' in failing to
recognize that such problems could foretell a structural and
cultural problem. Other universities, she said, are much more
aggressive in monitoring student-led activities.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the physical cause of the collapse, Hugh Robinson,
a commission member who runs a Dallas engineering firm, noted that
the tower had evolved over many decades from a pile of trash to a
complicated, engineering project that weighed more than 2 million
pounds. Despite this evolution, Robinson noted that university
officials took a very limited role in the building of the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhaustive engineering review, the commission traced
the problem to the lowest tier of the wedding cake shaped tower,
Robinson said. Since 1994, students had wrapped steel cables around
this lowest tier of logs for extra support, he said. He compared
the cables to the strips of metal that encircle a wooden barrel.
But this year, students did not use the cables, partly because they
wrongly believed that the cables made the wooden stack burn faster.
In addition, students used inadequate wiring to bind individual
logs together, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said students also improperly wedged the second tier of
logs into this lowest tier. Students thought doing so would provide
more stability and create a tighter foundation, but Robinson said
the opposite occurred: The pressure from the wedged logs helped
push the lower tier apart. Finally, a sloped ground surface
contributed to the instability as did the excessive size of the
second tier.
</P>
<P>
   ``A combination of factors and not any one factor led to the
collapse,'' Robinson said. Still, he noted that using the steel
support cables ``would have greatly reduced the likelihood of
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The one piece of solace for family members of the victims is
that the accident apparently occurred in an instant. ``This
collapse happened very quickly,'' Robinson said. ``Eyewitnesses
were stunned.``
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Dr. Bowen admitted that his heart told
him to carry on the bonfire tradition. But he quickly added that he
would make his decision with his head. ``If we do continue to have
Bonfire,'' he said, ``there will be appropriate changes to the
culture. That's essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Countryman, 22, a senior who is a member of the school's
military-styled Corps of Cadets, listened to the commission's
presentation from the bleachers of the basketball arena. ``I think
we'll have it next year,'' he said. ``I think it will change, but I
think it was an accident. I don't know how much you could prevent
it. Accidents happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tragic,'' he added. ``Planes crash, things happen.''

<P>
   The first-time writer-directors Anthony Stark and Sean Smith,
best friends since high school, are in a difficult position when
they talk about their new movie, ``Into My Heart'' _ a dark story
about two men, best friends since childhood, whose relationship
takes a tragic turn after they grow up and get married. (The film
opens May 5.)
</P>
<P>
   At first, Stark and Smith, both 39, best friends since they met
in 1977 at the Browning School on Manhattan's Upper East Side,
insist there is ``only a little autobiography'' in the story of Ben
and Adam, two sons of affluent East Coast families who are ``like
two olives in a martini,'' according to Adam's father, yet very
different.
</P>
<P>
   Stark and Smith's reluctance to admit that their art may imitate
life could be more than the usual insistence by writers that their
creation is a work of fiction, not real life. The character of Ben,
played by Rob Morrow, the chief instigator in the movie's twisted
quadrangle, raises uncomfortable questions about betrayal and
infidelity and whether so-called nice, normal people can commit
destructive, hurtful acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who see it focus on Ben as this monolith of evil,''
Stark said. ``Many people just don't want to believe that good
people can do bad things. We wanted to show the moral hypocrisy of
that and ask who can presume you couldn't do what these people
did.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more mundane level, Stark and Smith will admit to being
part of an upper-middle-class social circle like that of the WASPy
young adults in the film. The movie's characters spend weekends at
Adam's family's country house in the Berkshires and play word games
like the ``name game''; Stark has been a frequent guest at Smith's
family's weekend house near the Berkshires and the name game is one
of their favorites. And Stark said he modeled Adam's wife on a
woman he knows well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're a lot more like Ben and Adam than they
claim,'' said Morrow, 37, who signed on for the low-budget film
after being won over by the script. ``I've heard them talk about
the movie and pass it off as if it isn't their story. But you hear
the characters of Ben and Adam come out of their voices.''
</P>
<P>
   The character of Ben is restless, cynical, ambitious _ and a
veteran of bad relationships. Adam, played by Jake Weber, described
as a ``golden boy'' in the film, is romantic, loyal _ and happily
married to Nina, the love of his life, a woman he meets in college.
Nina, played by Claire Forlani, becomes the catalyst that shatters
the friendship between Ben and Adam forever.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to a table at the Algonquin Hotel recently, where Stark and
Smith are explaining their own lives _ over two glasses of Jack
Daniels apiece. The very likeable but often cynical Stark, the son
of Art Stark, a television producer who produced NBC's ``The
Tonight Show'' until 1969, is divorced and claims he would like to
be in a stable relationship with one woman, ``but I've blown so
many opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I decided to get married it was to the sweetest woman in
the world,'' he said. ``There was nothing wrong with her at all. I
just got bored and had to blow something up.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Smith, the son of a poet and a schoolteacher, who
has a calm, contained manner, has been married for 10 years to his
``first love,'' a woman he met 20 years ago in college. They have
two young children. ``I think I was very lucky,'' said Smith of his
wife, Virginia Keeny, a civil rights attorney in Los Angeles. ``I
found a really special person. I loved her instantly. And I still
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark said he and Smith, who have written several movies
together but never directed before, rarely argue over personal
issues, but they have a longstanding disagreement over people who
remain stuck in unhealthy relationships. ``Sean can't understand
why supposedly smart people stay in bad relationships,'' he said.
``As someone who has stayed in more than his share of bad
relationships for far too long, I don't understand why he can't
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith smiled at Stark indulgently. ``It's not that I don't
understand it _ to a point,'' he said. ``It's just that in
Anthony's case it seems to go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark does not seem to mind such statements, which mirror
spirited exchanges between Ben and Adam in ``Into My Heart.'' But
perhaps more tellingly, when it comes to his writing partner's
long, seemingly idyllic relationship with his wife, Stark does not
seem to harbor the sort of unspoken envy Ben has of Adam.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like a perfect family,'' Stark said of Smith's wife
and children. ``But I'm not jealous. I've had a lot of chances but
I've blown them and it's almost always my fault. If I can't commit
myself, who else is there to blame?''
</P>
<P>
   So while the contrasting personalities of the two best friends
in ``Into My Heart'' eventually lead to tragedy, Stark and Smith
have managed to profit from their own admittedly ``good cop, bad
cop'' friendship by translating it into professional success.
</P>
<P>
   Both men now live in Los Angeles but spent considerable time
apart after graduating from high school. Stark went to Columbia and
later studied at the London Film School. Smith attended Harvard and
got his doctorate in modern British history at Stanford. He spent a
year supposedly doing doctoral research in London but said he ended
up hanging around Stark in his film classes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith later moved to Los Angeles, where he waited on tables and
worked as a freelance film journalist until Stark joined him there
and they started collaborating in 1991. After writing what Smith
called ``pretty stupid genre movies'' like ``Dogfighter'' (1996)
and ``Art of Murder,'' which will be released straight to video
later this year, they decided to write the kind of movie they liked
to watch and came up with ``Into My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The script wound up in the hands of Jean Doumanian, the veteran
producer of eight Woody Allen movies, when an associate in Los
Angeles recommended it to her. Jean Doumanian Productions is
opening the movie for a two-week run at the Quad with the intent of
getting wider distribution. ``I think it strikes at something
universal,'' Doumanian said. ``When two couples are friendly or
double-date I think at one time or another they are attracted to
the other. I knew two couples that ended up married to each other's
spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Into the Heart,'' however, does not have such a happy ending.
In the movie's pivotal scene, Ben, who is by now married himself
(his wife is played by Jayne Brook), kisses Adam's wife and sets in
motion the smashing of all four people's lives. Stark is happy to
go on the record and declare that he has never once kissed Smith's
wife. Smith, for his part, said, ``I wouldn't kill myself if he
did, I would kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   That occasion seems unlikely. After first talking about doing a
movie together in high school, Stark and Smith have finally gained
a foothold in Hollywood and are planning more scripts together as
well as solo projects. They are almost done writing their next
movie, a comedy that Smith called ``the best thing we've done so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ending of ``Into My Heart'' is given away in the
opening scene, Stark and Smith conclude the interview with a twist
of their own. When asked if either one can envision doing something
as destructive as Ben does, Stark, the bad cop, immediately says
``No.'' Smith says ``Yes,'' apparently surprising even himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not have said that,'' he said, laughing. ``Can I take
it back?''

GOP PANEL PROPOSES NEW PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATING SYSTEM

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A high-level Republican committee on Tuesday
proposed a new presidential nominating system intended to build
suspense and interest from March through June, with smaller states
voting first and larger states casting the decisive final votes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes as a sharp reaction to the current system, in
which both party nominations were effectively decided by March 7,
the first big primary day, before millions of Americans knew much
about the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brock, a former senator from Tennessee and a former party
chairman, who led the committee that offered the plan, said, ``Too
many people in too many states have no voice in the electoral
process that names our candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, said he
expected the plan to be adopted, although Republicans in the past
have been reluctant to impose national rules on state parties, and
some big states will be concerned that the nomination could be
decided before they hold their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican willingness to scrap the current nominating
system seems likely to open up a debate about the system in both
parties, althoughthe Democratic Party's reaction on Tuesday was
that since the present system had elected Bill Clinton twice, ``at
this point, there is little incentive to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans adopt the plan at their convention in August,
Democrats might be ready to negotiate changing the primary process
after the election. One key provision would give the Republican
National Committee the authority, which it now lacks and the
Democratic committee has, to alter delegate selection rules between
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   James Roosevelt, co-chairman of the Democratic Rules and By-Laws
Committee, said, ``If the Republicans can get that kind of
flexibility, then between cycles we could have some real
substantive discussions about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the 12 smallest states, the District of Columbia
and the territories would be allowed to hold primaries or caucuses
no earlier than the first Tuesday in March. Another group of 13
slightly larger states, including Connecticut and New Mexico, could
go on the first Tuesday in April. Thirteen middle-size states,
including Kentucky and Massachusetts, could go on the first Tuesday
in May.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, including New York, California, Texas, Florida and New
Jersey, could have primaries on the first Tuesday in June. Any
state could go later, and in the early stages, some might do so to
get a Tuesday that is less crowded. The plan makes no allowance for
early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, but that might be adjusted
by the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures would have to vote to adopt new primary
dates. To pressure them, the Republican National Committee would
have the power to deny state parties between 50 percent and 90
percent of their delegates.
</P>
<P>
   That degree of central control may be an issue, at the
convention if not earlier, at next week's meeting of the Republican
rules committee.
</P>
<P>
   John Deardourff, a Republican consultant whose first primary was
in 1964, said on Tuesday, ``The unwillingness to impose
Washington-based decisions and the unwillingness to accept them is
pretty strongly ingrained in Republican theology, and whether it's
the government doing it, or the party, it just doesn't sit well.''
</P>
<P>
   Deardourff, however, said he supported the plan. ``Anything
would be better than the current system, and that view may be
sufficiently widely held to produce some change.''
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle is clearly within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones, secretary of state in California, said the plan was
``absolutely not'' in his state's best interest because it would
mean California always came in the last group. He said the majority
of the Brock commission, on which he served, was mistaken in its
belief that because nearly half the delegates would not be chosen
before June that a contest would be keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had pushed to move the California primary up to March
7 this year, said he did not think the suggested changes would be
enough to overcome the current way of nominating a candidate, which
he called ``raise a lot of money, get it over quick.'' He said he
thought a system of regional primaries, in which different regions
each got their chance to go first, would be better.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, could play a decisive role in deciding
whether the plan is adopted at the convention. But his campaign had
no comment on Tuesday night, saying he looked forward to studying
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Brock commission report was issued on the day when North
Carolina and Indiana, the 11th and 14th largest states, held
presidential primaries that drew virtually no interest.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign turnout was high, at least among
Republicans, but by March 7, known as Super Tuesday, two-fifths of
Republican delegates and one-third of Democratic delegates had been
picked.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, who cheered the Brock report as ``the best thing since
sliced bread,'' said turnout since March 7 ``has been abysmally low
and the citizens in the states which were after Super Tuesday have
felt left out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brock Commission, whose undisclosed vote was not unanimous,
did offer a fallback proposal of rotating regional primaries _ a
plan suggested by the National association of Secretaries of State.
They said that proposal would allow a different region to go first
every four years, and believed it would reduce front-loading.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican senator said at a hearing Tuesday that
the former head of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit
had unsuccessfully urged the appointment of an independent
prosecutor to investigate President Clinton and a top executive of
the Loral aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, made his comments
during the questioning of Charles La Bella, the former Justice
Department official. La Bella responded obliquely to Specter's
questions, but did not dispute that he had recommended an outside
inquiry of Clinton and Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman of the Loral
Space and Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Loral officials had no immediate reaction to Specter's
disclosure Tuesday. Previously, they have defended Schwartz's
actions and said that company officials did nothing wrong in their
dealings with scientists in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz has been one of the Democratic Party's largest donors
and had contributed $1.5 million during the 1996 election campaign.
His contributions have continued even as his company became the
subject of a separate Justice Department investigation into whether
it broke the law by providing important technological help to
China's rocket program. At the same time he was contributing money
to the Democratic Party, Schwartz's company was seeking government
approval for satellite launches in China.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday whether La Bella had referred in his memo
to any specific evidence suggesting that either Clinton or Schwartz
had engaged in improper conduct. Other officials said that they had
never established any reason to question the legality of Schwartz's
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the officials who have read the memorandum written by La
Bella to Attorney General Janet Reno in 1998 said that he did urge
her to seek the appointment of an independent prosecutor to
investigate the matter, in part because of the appearance that the
Justice Department could not credibly investigate the president on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose Tuesday at a hearing of a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee when Specter referred to passages in La Bella's
still-confidential memo, whose existence and conclusions have been
the subject of reports by a number of news organizations. In the
memo La Bella strongly recommended the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate allegations of fund-raising
abuses in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a section of your report which deals with Loral on the
technology transfer from Loral to the People's Republic of China,''
Specter said. ``And there was a recommendation as to proceeding as
to an investigation for the chief executive officer of Loral,
Bernard Schwartz, who had contributed some $1,500,000 to the
Democratic National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter then said that the memorandum indicated that if the
Justice Department opened an investigation of Schwartz, it should
also begin an inquiry of Clinton, who was subject to the
independent counsel statute.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella, accepting Specter's account, replied,
``Hypothetically, if you're going to investigate the person who
gave the contribution because you think something was wrong with
that because they were seeking a quid pro quo, then it seems to me
that part of the area of investigation would be the person who
received the contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno rebuffed La Bella, who wrote his memorandum as he was
departing after a sometimes fractious tenure as head of a high
profile investigation into possible campaign finance irregularities
stemming from the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Reno never discussed La Bella's memo with him and, ultimately
she decided against seeking an independent counsel to investigate
Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, whose fund-raising activities,
according to La Bella's memo, also raised enough questions to
warrant investigation by an outside prosecutor.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OPPOSES SHIFT IN MEDICARE OVERSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Tuesday that
proposals to create an independent agency to run the Medicare
program or to administer prescription drug benefits for the elderly
were unwise and probably unconstitutional because the new entity
would not be accountable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans in Congress and many Democrats want to reduce
the authority of the agency that now runs Medicare, the Health Care
Financing Administration. In carrying out laws passed over the last
three decades, they say, it has become a heavy-handed regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the leading proposals in Congress for Medicare coverage
of prescription drugs would create a quasi-independent board, which
would hire private entities to administer drug benefits under
guidelines set by the government. Many lawmakers would like to give
the board additional powers over Medicare in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department said such proposals ``would
constitute an unwarranted and unwise erosion of the president's
authority to oversee the functioning of the executive branch'' of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed legislation raises serious constitutional
concerns'' and ``poses a serious threat to the core constitutional
values of political accountability and coordinated executive branch
policy-making,'' the Justice Department said in a letter to Sen.
John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., . He asked the department for its
views in February.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton administration persists in its opposition to an
independent board, it could seriously complicate Congressional
efforts to offer drug benefits to the 39 million people on
Medicare. Support for such a board appears to be growing on Capitol
Hill. Many lawmakers have said they fear that if the Health Care
Financing Administration is responsible for new drug benefits, it
may eventually try to regulate drug prices as it has regulated
doctors' fees and hospital payments under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department expressed its views in a critique of
legislation introduced by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Bill Frist,
R-Tenn.. The Medicare board in their bill was modeled, in part,
after the Federal Reserve Board and other independent agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Breaux said he saw no basis for the Justice
Department's concerns. The Medicare board, he said, would be
outside the Department of Health and Human Services, but it would
still be in the executive branch, like the Social Security
Administration, which was removed from the department by a 1994
law.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned in the Breaux-Frist bill, the Medicare board would
be ``an independent agency of the United States.'' It would
generally supervise the Medicare program and manage a competitive
market in which health insurance plans vie with one another, and
with the original fee-for-service Medicare program, to provide
coverage to people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The board would have seven members, appointed by the president
for seven-year terms. The president could remove a member ``only
for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,'' the bill says. The
Justice Department strenuously objected to this restriction on the
president's power to dismiss board members.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said, ``It's easy to construct a Medicare board that
would meet constitutional requirements.'' If necessary, he said,
the bill could be revised so board members would serve at the
pleasure of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, like the Clinton administration, opposes the idea
of an independent Medicare board, saying it would create a new
bureaucracy that is not accountable to either beneficiaries or
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pass the buck,'' Rockefeller said. ``Removing
Medicare from the accountability of Congress and the president
amounts to an abdication of duty that would risk the health care of
millions of America's seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Breaux and Frist said they had been assured by
lawyers at the Congressional Research Service that the proposed
Medicare board would not violate any provision of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for Medicare drug benefits have already become an
issue in many election campaigns this year. But Rep. Bill Archer,
the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said Tuesday, ``We want to work with President Clinton
in a bipartisan fashion to make a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare a reality, not a political bumper sticker.''

CONGRESSIONAL GOP PULLING BACK FROM CALLS FOR HEARINGS ON ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a barrage of fiery talk critical of the
Justice Department's raid to retrieve Elian Gonzalez, Senate and
House Republicans are now distancing themselves from the case,
agreeing they are no longer sure that hearings are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Descriptions of ``jack-booted thugs'' and ``storm troopers''
have been all but muted in the last few days, replaced by a
cautious call for answers, maybe even just written ones, from the
Justice Department about its decision to send heavily armed agents
into a private home.
</P>
<P>
   While several prominent Republicans, including Sen. Trent Lott,
the majority leader, still want to publicly delve into the Elian
case, many others have come to realize that doing so could be a
grand political miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   Those Republicans, who range from conservative to moderate, have
counseled taking a more measured approach and have helped tone down
the rhetoric surrounding the Justice Department's raid on the Miami
house of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In part, members of Congress are heeding public opinion surveys
showing that most Americans agree with Attorney General Janet
Reno's decision to raid the house; disagree with the boy's Miami
relatives who seek to prevent his return to Cuba; and scorn
Congress' desire to dredge up the details of the raid once again.
The members also recognize the political danger of hearings, which
tend to become overly partisan and often paint Republicans as
overzealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be turned into political theater, and I don't think
anyone wants that,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
second-ranking Republican in the Senate, who does not routinely shy
away from investigating the Clinton administration. He added, ``I'd
like to get some answers to some questions, but I don't think we
need a big show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine, echoed
several colleagues' comments when she said she worried that
hearings would be viewed as just more political posturing on a case
that many feel has already been overpoliticized. So far, the
political fallout for Republicans in siding mostly with Elian's
Miami relatives, who have been seen by the public as intransigent,
has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would look like a lot of political grandstanding and I
would be concerned about that,'' Snowe said. ``This could be done
without hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly news conference, Rep. Dick Armey, the House
majority leader, seemed to search for the mildest characterizations
he could find to talk about both the Elian case and the possibility
of hearings. After calling the photograph of a federal agent with
the submachine gun removing Elian from a closet in the Miami house
``frightening,'' Armey said that members needed ``to sit down and
talk about'' hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the answer to whether or not a hearing will be
necessary,'' he said. ``Depends on how forthcoming they are to any
inquiries our guys make.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, who had referred to the
agents who seized Elian as ``storm troopers,'' has lowered the
volume as he considers a run for the Senate. At a speech to more
than 1,000 fellow Republicans in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., on Friday,
he refrained from calling the raid ``unconscionable,'' as he
previously had; nor did he lay blame for the raid, as he did
earlier last week, on ``Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton and Janet
Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   John Kingdon, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Michigan, said Republicans may have initially misread
the Elian case, especially the level of outrage about the raid and
the photograph of the agent with the gun. They also appeared to
underestimate the power of another set of photographs, those of a
beaming father and son.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculations also shifted after Reno and her deputies
appeared on television numerous times to discuss the case and
defend their actions. While Republicans say a number of legitimate
questions remain unanswered, the Justice Department has already
tried to address concerns about cost and the search warrant. And
Reno has spoken of the events leading up to the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really miscalculated the political benefits,''
Kingdon said of the Republicans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At this point, Senate hearings would most likely last one or two
days and focus on whether the raid was legal and proper, Lott said.
The House has said it will begin a ``preliminary inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican retreat began last week when Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who had hastily
called a hearing for this Wednesday, postponed it because the
Justice Department had failed to produce the information he sought.
On Sunday, Hatch raised the possibility that his committee might
not hold hearings if the department documents adequately explain
its decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Hatch said he was still waiting for the
department to turn over the requested documents. He also criticized
Reno for making television appearances in the midst of pleading for
more time to collect the documents.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the case in November _ when Elian was rescued
in the Atlantic Ocean after a vessel carrying Cuban emigres sank,
claiming the life of his mother _ many Republicans were quick to
side with Cuban-Americans in Miami who fought to keep the boy in
the United States, even if it meant separating him from his father
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Top Republicans leaders, including presidential candidates,
unleashed sharp attacks on Castro and argued that the boy's case
should be heard in a state family court, even though it has no
jurisdiction over an immigration case.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, treading carefully, broke with the
Clinton administration and also suggested that the case was best
left to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In January, with Congress just back from its recess, Republicans
pushed for a bill to make Elian a citizen. But in another retreat,
Republican leaders dropped the effort, without saying so outright,
after it became clear they lacked the votes in their own party to
push the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans viewed the Elian case as a family issue
_ a son being kept from his father _ and found it difficult to
support any measure that suggested the two should not be reunited.
They were not the most vocal, but their influence was considerable.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a crucial group of Cuban-American voters, which
leans Republican but helped deliver Florida to President Clinton in
1996. Some analysts say Republicans were just trying to help George
W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, win
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utlimately, it's a Florida issue,'' said Brian Kennedy, a
Republican political consultant. ``Some would suggest that if Gore
can deny Bush Florida, Gore would be hard to beat. Republicans want
to remind people that it was the Clinton administration that came
in and pointed guns to take this boy back.''

WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE OFFERS ADVICE TO PARENTS WITH TEENS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It may take a village to raise a child, but as most
parents know, that pales next to the time, patience, and
perseverance required to rear a healthy teenager.
</P>
<P>
   To explore the issue, Hillary Rodham Clinton Tuesday hosted the
first White House Conference on Teenagers, which assembled experts,
activists, adolescents, and even actors who offered more counsel to
concerned parents than criticism of the teenage culture.
</P>
<P>
   There was common-sense advice (eat meals with your teenager);
new research (the brain's gray matter expands at puberty); and an
executive order aimed at ending discrimination against parents in
the federal workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or to promote employees who have children at
home,'' said President Clinton, who was introduced by Mrs. Clinton
as her ``co-parent.'' The president said he signed the executive
order to say, ``No glass ceiling for parents. The job they are
doing at home is more important anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The daylong event followed the teenage killings at Columbine
High School by a year and the teen shooting of seven children at
Washington's National Zoo by a week. It also comes in the thick of
the political season when pollsters see work-family pressures
emerging as a potent issue, especially among women voters, and when
Mrs. Clinton is running for the US Senate in New York as an
advocate of families and children.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she understands that it's hard being an
adolescent today _ harder than when she was a girl - and that the
teen years can be times of great stress, alienation, and confusion.
But, speaking as the mother of a daughter just-turned-20, Mrs.
Clinton said her heart goes out to parents of teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are worried about the movies their children are
seeing, the Web sites they are visiting, the music they are
listening to,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who moderated two panels for
several hundred guests in the East Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of worry that all those heart-to-heart talks
and those efforts to communicate, which are sometimes so awkward
and difficult, about values and good behavior, are getting drowned
out by a popular culture filled with gratuitous sex and violence,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton shared some personal observations. One was that
even with their hectic schedules, she and the president always
tried to eat at least one meal a day with Chelsea before she went
to college. And Mrs. Clinton admitted the reason the First Couple
didn't plunge into the Washington social scene during the first
term was because they needed to stay in the White House, ``hanging
around, waiting for a (Chelsea) sighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when you have one (teenager) in your home, you want
to hang around with the hope that just maybe they'll deign to say
something to you,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Occasionally it worked,
but not always.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Tuesday by the YMCA of the USA showed
teenagers are concerned about the lack of time they spend with
their parents and the depth of their communication. In responses
from 200 parents and 200 teens, the poll found that 61 percent of
parents say they talk frequently to their children about values and
beliefs, but only 41 percent of the teens report having those
conservations.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Galinksy, head of the Families and Work Institute in New
York, said her studies show teenagers want strong relationships
with their parents and value quality over quantity time. They wish
their parents weren't always so tired and under stress, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychological connectedness'' of parents to children _ talking
to them on the phone, leaving notes on the refrigerator, assigning
them responsibilities and chores _ is the best prescription for
lowering the risk of unhealthy teen behavior, said Dr. Robert Blum
of the University of Minnesota. Access to weapons in the home, peer
drug use, and sexual victimization all raise the risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeffrey Brown, pastor of Union Baptist Church in
Cambridge and co-founder of the Boston's Ten Point Coalition to
check youth violence, said Blum's message of making teenagers
responsible was one he would carry home. Brown said the message he
himself brought to the conference was that ``building a dialogue
between families and teenagers relates to transforming
neighborhoods and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Three teenagers, all success stories, spoke about the strength
of their family bonds. Edwin Speaker, 17, of Los Angeles, said he
was nervous _ ``How many kids get to fly six hours and stand right
next to the first lady?'' _ but not afraid to speak up about his
relationship with his single father: ``It takes a man to raise a
man,'' Edwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Danny DeVito, the father of three teenagers, said parents
need to tell children ``they weren't always so perfect, like they
are now.'' DeVito and his wife, Rhea Perlman, are leading a group
called the After School Alliance, which aims to provide quality,
after-school care in all of the nation's elementary schools by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his 2001 budget request to Congress includes
doubling the funds to $1 billion for after-school and summer-school
programs. He has also called for expanding the Family and Medical
Leave Act to include more firms and purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a new report by his Council of Economic Advisers
presented a mixed picture of today's teenager. ``The good news is
that teenagers are far healthier, more prosperous, and look forward
to more promising lives than ever before in our history,'' he said.
But he cited ``a significant opportunity gap'' between white and
minority students, and he said the incidence of teen smoking, drug
use, pregnancy, and gun violence remain ``too high.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, aimed at giving attention to what experts say is
an understudied social issue and getting the family-advocacy
community energized, explored everything from Internet technology
(many teenagers know more than their parents, Mrs. Clinton said),
to new adolescent brain research.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Jay Giedd of the National Institute of Mental
Health, preliminary data from sophisticated new scanners indicates
that while the brain is 95 percent formed by the first grade, there
is a second growth spurt during puberty. The implication is thicker
gray matter, Giedd said, and it suggests teenagers can ``use it or
lose it.''

WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE OFFERS ADVICE TO PARENTS WITH TEENS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It may take a village to raise a child, but as most
parents know, that pales next to the time, patience, and
perseverance required to rear a healthy teenager.
</P>
<P>
   To explore the issue, Hillary Rodham Clinton Tuesday hosted the
first White House Conference on Teenagers, which assembled experts,
activists, adolescents, and even actors who offered more counsel to
concerned parents than criticism of the teenage culture.
</P>
<P>
   There was common-sense advice (eat meals with your teenager);
new research (the brain's gray matter expands at puberty); and an
executive order aimed at ending discrimination against parents in
the federal workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or to promote employees who have children at
home,'' said President Clinton, who was introduced by Mrs. Clinton
as her ``co-parent.'' The president said he signed the executive
order to say, ``No glass ceiling for parents. The job they are

<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ Donald P. Jacobs jumps into a swimming pool
every day at 6:30 a.m. and spends 45 minutes doing laps. During
rainstorms, he sometimes dashes without an umbrella between
buildings on the Northwestern University campus here, even as the
wind off Lake Michigan musses his hair. When he gives public
speeches, he often wears a sweatshirt. When he finds something
funny, he throws his head back, crosses his arms over his chest as
if to hug himself and guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has a rather loose style for a business school dean,
especially one who passed the traditional retirement age seven
years ago. But nothing is frivolous about his accomplishments: No
one has had a greater effect on management education in the United
States than he has, say his peers at schools around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them can remember when he was not around. This spring,
Jacobs is celebrating his 25th anniversary at the helm of the
Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern. He has held
his job longer than any current major university president or other
business school dean, higher education experts say. When he took
over, Cal Ripken Jr. was playing high school baseball and Pope John
Paul II was still Karol Wojtyla, archbishop of Cracow.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Jacobs created the prototype of the modern
business school, management experts say. Well before many of its
rivals, Kellogg interviewed all its applicants, published students'
evaluations of its professors' teaching skills and encouraged
students to help design the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Kellogg caters to its students as if they were
customers. It unabashedly considers the teaching of skills like
teamwork and social networking as central to its mission, and seeks
students who agree. ``If you think you are that kind of person, you
fit,'' Jacobs recently told a group of accepted applicants. ``If
not, this is the time to get the hell out,'' he added, as the room
burst into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the changes _ many of which once seemed heretical in
the world of higher education _ and to the recruitment of ambitious
young professors, the school that once had little respect on its
own campus steadily climbed the national rankings, securing a solid
spot in the top five and forcing more prestigious schools to
imitate it.
</P>
<P>
   Professors say Jacobs is the symbol for the business school boom
that over the last quarter century has tripled, to 100,000, the
number of MBA's awarded each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has quite done what Don has done,'' said Rajat Gupta,
the managing partner of McKinsey &AMP; Co., who sits on advisory boards
at Kellogg, Harvard and the universities of Chicago and
Pennsylvania. ``Which is to transform an average school into a
top-five school and keep it there for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a business world that craves speed and flexibility, Jacobs, a
tall, jovial, blunt-speaking economist, has also become something
of a model manager himself, his colleagues say. Kellogg, with a
relatively small administrative staff, relies on its version of
factory-floor employees _ its students _ to study many of its
problems and suggest solutions. Unlike many academic institutions,
it acts quickly, putting in place pilot programs and taking time
later to decide whether they deserve a permanent place in the
curriculum. ``He pushes constant change,'' said Robert Duncan, a
professor of leadership who has taught at the school since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for example, reacting to student criticism that
Kellogg had not devoted enough attention to the Internet and risked
falling behind its peers, Jacobs and a few faculty members drew up
plans for an e-commerce major that includes 16 courses. It is
already the third-most popular major at the school. Kellogg also
now offers an executive education class on the Internet every
month.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Jacobs' strategy has been strengthening the ties
between the ivory tower and a business world that sometimes views
intellectuals as eggheads. Over the skepticism of other
Northwestern officials, he built an executive education center 20
years ago that now brings in $93 million a year and has inspired
similar versions at Stanford, Pennsylvania and other schools. He
was also among the first deans to encourage professors to make
international trips a part of actual classes.
</P>
<P>
   He himself continues to teach every year, both the full-time day
students and the executives who pass through. Between 1975 and
1979, he served as the chairman of Amtrak and has also been a
director for First Chicago, Commonwealth Edison and Hart Marx, the
high-end clothing company. (One of his board stints, on a
meat-packing company, turned him into a vegetarian, he said, after
he had learned the details of the industry's operations.)
</P>
<P>
   A competitive man whose sometimes fiery temper has cooled only
recently, friends say, and who needs little provocation before
lobbing insults about the nearby University of Chicago, Jacobs says
Kellogg makes a legitimate claim to be the nation's top business
school. More removed experts call that wishful thinking, if only
barely. Given the choice, most students enroll at Harvard or
Stanford over Kellogg, for example. After building a top-notch
business faculty, Kellogg has lost a few academic stars to rival
schools in the last three years whom it has failed to replace with
researchers of the same rank, professors say.
</P>
<P>
   What most management experts agree on, however, is that few
graduate schools of any kind have come as far as Kellogg has over
the last 25 years, and few institutions bear the mark of their
leader as much as this one. ``His personality really infuses the
place,'' said Mike Miles, the former chairman of Philip Morris who
heads the school's advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Some students and professors worry that Kellogg's biggest
problem is that Jacobs has not surrounded himself with strong
candidates to replace him, even though he says he will definitely
retire, and spend more time teaching, within the next few years.
``There's nobody that is a natural successor to Jacobs within the
school right now,'' said James Schlesinger Jr., the former editor
of the student paper, who will graduate this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs grew up as the son of bakers on the far west side of
Chicago, three blocks from the suburb of Oak Park that Frank Lloyd
Wright was making famous. Until junior high school he suffered from
what doctors would now call dyslexia and, he said, is still
terrible at remembering names. He enlisted in the Navy at the age
of 17, just weeks before Japan surrendered in World War II. He
returned home and attended Roosevelt University in Chicago, where
an economics professor encouraged him to take up the subject.
Jacobs eventually earned a doctorate in economics at Columbia. ``I
never, ever thought of being anything but a professor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first job at City College but, not wanting to raise
children in New York, began looking around in the mid-1950s.
Northwestern's business school was the next place to offer him a
position, Jacobs said. The dean at the time, Richard Donham, son of
the founding dean of Harvard Business School, said Jacobs could
have a job if he promised to teach in the executive education
program, a forum that many faculty members considered
intellectually weak. Donham ``wouldn't have hired me if I wouldn't
do it,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   The experience changed his view of business education and,
eventually, remade Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two decades, Jacobs taught finance, took regular
sabbaticals in Washington and, in 1974, found himself on a search
committee to find a replacement for John Barr, the former chief
executive of the giant retailer Montgomery Ward who was then
stepping down as head of Northwestern's business school. The
committee offered the job to a French diplomat and to
administrators at both Princeton University and the University of
Pennsylvania. All three said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the search committee,'' said Duncan, another
committee member, ``almost in desperation, said: `Enough is enough.
Somebody's got to be dean.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, as the senior faculty member on the committee, was the
choice, and he set aside his academic career to accept the post.
``He wasn't thrilled about it,'' Duncan said. ``I don't know that
anyone was thrilled about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs threw himself into the job. On his first day, a
Monday, he told the outgoing dean that he wanted the school to
focus, in part, on the teaching of business people who were in
their 30s and 40s and no longer interested in attending school
full-time. By Friday, he was meeting with James Allen, a founder of
Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, to pitch his idea to build a separate
executive education center for weeklong and monthlong classes. The
following Monday, Allen agreed to finance much of the project, and
the planning began.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' idea was hardly met with unanimous enthusiasm. ``The
university thought he was crazy,'' said Meyer Feldberg, now the
dean at Columbia, who was the center's first director. More
prestigious schools like Harvard already had thriving programs, and
with the U.S. economy mired in an inflation-induced funk, companies
were not rushing to make large new investments.
</P>
<P>
   When the center, named for Allen, opened in 1979, the corporate
landscape was starting to change. The globalization of markets and
the acceleration of technological change had made doing business
more complicated. The Allen Center had little trouble filling its
seats, and Northwestern professors soon had the advantage of being
in constant contact with their core audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our faculty were good theorists,'' Jacobs said, ``but they
honestly understood the problems businesses really faced. It was
one of the things that made us different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Allen Center also became an unofficial advertisement for
Kellogg, as the school became known in 1979 after a gift from
relatives of the cereal company family who were largely unconnected
to the business. After a few weeks of study in Evanston, executives
went home more willing to consider Northwestern graduates as well
as the Harvard, Pennsylvania and Chicago MBA's that they had long
hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strategy was absolutely clever,'' said Robert Hamada, dean
of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, offering a rare
compliment for the local competition. ``He was the first of the
major deans _ and he wasn't even a major dean at the time _ to
think in terms of marketing.'' After years of ignoring the market,
Chicago itself began offering executive classes a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Kellogg burnished its reputation as a real-world
business school that emphasized teamwork. ``The notion that people
work cooperatively is almost un-American,'' Jacobs said. ``We've
built a culture that is contrary to people's idea of business
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The dean also signed alliances with schools in Germany, Hong
Kong, Israel and Thailand in an effort to overcome Northwestern's
reputation as a heartland school lacking an international outlook.
The school has never achieved the academic prestige of its rivals _
no faculty member has ever won a Nobel Prize, for instance _ but
among applicants and recruiters, it remains as popular as any other
school.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' biggest headache now is how to exit gracefully and allow
a smooth transition. It is a problem the students in his corporate
governance classes study in detail but one that he says is
difficult to solve at a university, where a successor must be
chosen by a search committee rather than groomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of succession drives me crazy,'' Jacobs said. ``A
well-run organization probably would have gotten rid of me by
now.''

REPORT LINKS U.S. SUPPORT FOR RUSSIAN LABS TO POSSIBLE GERM
WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Clinton administration seeks a tenfold increase in money
for Russian-American biological cooperation, the General Accounting
Office has concluded that American support could inadvertently help
Russian scientists and former weapons labs make germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report to be published this week, the GAO presents no
evidence that Moscow is conducting such illegal research or making
germ weapons. Nor does the report state that American assistance to
Russian labs and scientists is being diverted for military
purposes. But Congress' independent auditing agency said that
despite the administration's efforts to reduce the risks of such
misuse or diversion, there is no way to prevent Russian scientists
from ``potentially using their skills or research outputs to later
work on offensive weapons activities at any of the Russian military
institutes that remain closed to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times,
says that such concerns have been intensified by Russia's
unwillingness to open four military labs to inspection or visits by
foreign scientists. It also chides Moscow for retaining the ``Cold
War leadership'' of the germ weapons complex in key posts,
including Gen. Yuri T. Kalinin, who heads Biopreparat, an
organization that once directed the Soviet Union's germ warfare
program.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the GAO's concerns, the administration
argues that the risks of not helping 15,000 impoverished Russian
bio-weaponeers at some 50 institutes throughout the former Soviet
Union far outweigh the risks of doing so. Scientists desperate for
employment would likely find work with rogue states like Iran, the
administration argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stay home and wish the problem away, or we can confront
it head on at the source,'' one administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, officials cite what they call quiet breakthroughs in
scientific cooperation with the Russians that have enhanced their
confidence that Moscow is getting out of the germ weapons business.
For instance, a team of Russian scientists that once made a deadly
strain of anthrax gave their American counterparts at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta two rare anthrax
strains last week as part of a long-awaited exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also cite some progress in efforts to
open up Russia's closed military germ labs. A group of Russian
military scientists has agreed to visit American
chemical-biological defense centers this summer as part of another
exchange program, officials disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report is likely to help fuel a long-simmering debate
over whether Russia is still making germ weapons or conducting
illegal research and development, as the Soviet Union did after
signing a 1972 treaty that banned germ weapons. Former President
Boris N. Yeltsin declared in 1992 that Russia had ended its germ
warfare program and told Washington he would dismiss General
Kalinin, a former intelligence officer. But the general still heads
Biopreparat, which, even though it has been reborn as a state-owned
drug company, still controls many key Russian institutes, though it
no longer finances them. Russian officials and the general have
denied that Russia is making germ weapons or conducting illegal
research.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent the spread of deadly scientific knowledge from
Russia to Iran, Iraq, and other potentially dangerous states, the
administration has provided about $20 million between fiscal 1994
and 1999 to support collaborative research projects in Russia that
redirect former germ weapons scientists to peaceful research
activities. Between fiscal 2000 and 2004, the administration plans
to spend at least $220 million to expand efforts to engage former
Soviet germ weapons institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd D. Spence, the Republican chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said Tuesday that the GAO report ``reinforces
my concern that the administration's plans to increase assistance
to Russia could exacerbate the risk of a renewed Russian offensive
biological weapons effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts disagreed. Amy E. Smithson, a defense expert at
the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington who toured some of the
six labs that the GAO team visited, said that the report contained
considerable evidence that the administration's program was
effective.
</P>
<P>
   She noted, for instance, that the report says that American
support has prompted former Soviet scientists at some 15 labs to
reject an offer to cooperate with states like Iran. ``The American
auditing of its grants is usually very tight,'' Smithson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the State Department finds evidence that a scientist has
gone astray, the institute loses its grant. Whenever the U.S. has
placed that choice before a Russian scientist or lab, the answer is
always: `We're on your team,''' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. - The Kentucky Derby is central to the stories
of four of the five new Racing Hall of Fame members introduced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Neil Drysdale has favorite Fusaichi Pegasus and
contender War Chant in Saturday's 126th running of the Derby.
Drysdale-trained A.P. Indy (elected in the ``contemporary-male''
category) became one of the great what-ifs when he had to be
scratched from the 1992 Derby with a foot injury. Winning Colors
(``contemporary female'') won the Derby in 1988. Needles (``horse
of yesteryear'') won it in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The other 2000 inductee will be jockey Julie Krone, and although
she never finished better than 11th in the Derby, she gets
emotional thinking about how her career began here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not usually much of a crier,'' said Krone, who is the
first woman jockey elected to the Hall of Fame at Saratoga Springs,
N.Y. ``But flying here (Monday), I ended up crying on the airplane,
thinking about being 15 years old and driving to Churchill Downs
with my mother to begin my career as a jockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone's mother, Judy, died of cancer last year at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've almost dialed her phone three times (to say), `Mom, I
made the Hall of Fame!' '' Krone said. ``She'll have to be watching
from heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone won 3,545 races, including the 1993 Belmont Stakes aboard
Colonial Affair, in a 19-year career that ended in 1999. She is
developing a broadcasting career, including intertrack-TV race
analysis at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   She downplayed the first-woman angle, saying, ``Just being in
the Hall of Fame itself, that's the cake, the frosting, the
sprinkling, the candles and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Clocking The Deputy: Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy went 5
furlongs in 1:00 under Chris McCarron on a Churchill Downs track
rated ``fast'' despite light rain Tuesday morning. That's the time
the official clockers recorded, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Jenine Sahadi said she timed the work in 1:00 1/5.
McCarron said he got it in 1:00 2/5. McCarron is the rare jockey
who clocks workouts while riding them. He said that unless his
mount is pulling hard, his hands are together on the horse's neck,
so punching the buttons on his digital wristwatch isn't difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of riders say they have a clock in their heads. Well, I
have one on my wrist,'' said McCarron, who won the Derby with
Alysheba (1987) and Go for Gin (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Snuck out: Arkansas Derby runner-up Snuck In will skip the Derby
and aim for the May 20 Preakness.

REPORT LINKS U.S. SUPPORT FOR RUSSIAN LABS TO POSSIBLE GERM
WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Clinton administration seeks a tenfold increase in money
for Russian-American biological cooperation, the General Accounting
Office has concluded that American support could inadvertently help
Russian scientists and former weapons labs make germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be published this week, the GAO presents no
evidence that Moscow is conducting such illegal research or making
germ weapons. Nor does the report state that American assistance to
Russian labs and scientists is being diverted for military
purposes. But Congress' independent auditing agency said that
despite the administration's efforts to reduce the risks of such
misuse or diversion, there is no way to prevent Russian scientists
from ``potentially using their skills or research outputs to later
work on offensive weapons activities at any of the Russian military
institutes that remain closed to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times,
says that such concerns have been intensified by Russia's
unwillingness to open four military labs to inspection or visits by
foreign scientists. It also chides Moscow for retaining the ``Cold
War leadership'' of the germ weapons complex in key posts,
including Gen. Yuri T. Kalinin, who heads Biopreparat, an
organization that once directed the Soviet Union's germ warfare
program.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the GAO's concerns, the administration
argues that the risks of not helping 15,000 impoverished Russian
bio-weaponeers at some 50 institutes throughout the former Soviet
Union far outweigh the risks of doing so. Scientists desperate for
employment would likely find work with nations like Iran, the
administration argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stay home and wish the problem away, or we can confront
it head on at the source,'' one administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, officials cite what they call quiet breakthroughs in
scientific cooperation with the Russians that have enhanced their
confidence that Moscow is getting out of the germ weapons business.
For instance, a team of Russian scientists that once made a deadly
strain of anthrax gave their American counterparts at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta two rare anthrax
strains last week as part of a long-awaited exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also cite some progress in efforts to
open up Russia's closed military germ labs. A group of Russian
military scientists has agreed to visit American
chemical-biological defense centers this summer as part of another
exchange program, officials disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report is likely to help fuel a long-simmering debate
over whether Russia is still making germ weapons or conducting
illegal research and development, as the Soviet Union did after
signing a 1972 treaty that banned germ weapons. Former President
Boris N. Yeltsin declared in 1992 that Russia had ended its germ
warfare program and told Washington he would dismiss General
Kalinin, a former intelligence officer. But the general still heads
Biopreparat, which, even though it has been reborn as a state-owned
drug company, still controls many key Russian institutes, though it
no longer finances them. Russian officials and the general have
denied that Russia is making germ weapons or conducting illegal
research.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent the spread of deadly scientific knowledge from
Russia to Iran, Iraq, and other potentially dangerous states, the
administration has provided about $20 million between fiscal 1994
and 1999 to support collaborative research projects in Russia that
redirect former germ weapons scientists to peaceful research
activities. Between fiscal 2000 and 2004, the administration plans
to spend at least $220 million to expand efforts to engage former
Soviet germ weapons institutes.
</P>

 &HT;    Illegal fuel: Mayfield team busted
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After more than two weeks of delay, the NASCAR police
on Tuesday finally caught up with Jeremy Mayfield and the rest of
his race team.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's governing body found the Ford No. 12 team guilty of
using an illegal fuel additive at Talladega on April 16 and issued
one of the most severe penalties in Winston Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Michael Kranefuss was fined $50,000 and stripped of 151
owner points. Crew chief Peter Sospenzo was suspended for four
races. Jeremy Mayfield had 151 driver points wiped out, which
dropped him from No. 7 to 14th in the Winston Cup points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made and there were certainly some grave errors
in judgment,'' Kranefuss said in a prepared statement. ``Needless
to say, we accept the penalty, we have taken disciplinary action
within our team, and we apologize to our fans, our sponsors, NASCAR
and the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield also released a statement on Tuesday, saying, ``We're
all embarrassed and we're all going to make sure nothing like this
happens again.'' NASCAR said the team had not appealed the
penalties as of Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in NASCAR history, a team was subjected to
three different penalties for one infraction: a fine, a suspension
and the deduction of both driver and owner points.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR obviously felt like (this fuel situation) was severe
enough that they had to set someone as an example,'' driver Ward
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford No. 12 team still faces punishment for failing
post-race inspections after Mayfield won last Sunday's NAPA 500
Auto Parts 500. NASCAR determined that the car's roof was too low,
but it also conceded that it ``most likely'' occurred when Mayfield
repeatedly jumped on the roof in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Racing officials said Sunday that the team would be able to keep
the win _ the second of Mayfield's career _ but that it faces more
penalties this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Talladega controversy began when Mayfield's engine was torn
apart after the DieHard 500. Mayfield won the pole two days
earlier, but the engine breakdown was delayed because the No. 12
team decided to use the same motor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Chief Operating Officer Mike Helton said that more than
60 fuel samples, including one from Mayfield's tank, were taken
after qualifying and that all passed inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Through an extensive series of interviews with team members in
the ensuing weeks, Helton said, the ruling body was convinced that
the illegal fuel additive was added during the race by an crew
member who acted alone and without the knowledge of any others
within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was reported to have occurred during the final pit
stop, which happened with around 25 laps remaining. Mayfield
climbed as high as fourth after leaving the pit, but ended up in
14th place.
</P>
<P>
   Under NASCAR rules, the crew chief is ``responsible for the
actions of crew members during a race'', hence Sospenzo's
suspension. Kranefuss declined Tuesday to identify the crew member
but said disciplinary actions have been taken within the team.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield and Kranefuss were given 126 points after the car's
finishing position at Talladega. NASCAR took away those points on
Tuesday , and added a 25-point deduction because of the serious
nature of the infraction, which was tampering with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've related this to when you were young and your father
pulled off his belt -- at least it was that way when I was young,''
Helton said. ``The first two whacks were from what I did (wrong),
and the last one was to make sure I didn't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind the illegal fuel additive, which was
oxygen-based, was to add more horsepower to the motor.

YOUNG IMPROVISORS AT THE FAR REACHES OF JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By BEN RATLIFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In art, one ought to be skeptical of the idea of newness as a
guarantor of importance. But the upswell of young musicians playing
a new kind of electronic improvisation in the last few years has
begun to feel important _ and what they're doing is still so new
that they will be entirely absent from this summer's Vision and
Bell Atlantic Jazz Festivals, the two major New York events of
improvisation's outer limits.
</P>
<P>
   Electro-acoustic improv, as some of it is called, involves one
musician playing a noncomputerized instrument (guitar, saxophone,
drums, whatever) improvising alongside another ``playing'' a
computer or a sampler. There's also plain old electronic
improvisation, with a similar search for personal, abstract
improvisatory languages. It's not entirely new: electronics and
jazz-based improvisers like Steve Lacy were ad-libbing together on
stage in the early 1970s projects of Musica Electronica Viva; in
the English group AMM, founded in 1965, the guitarist Keith Rowe
folded short-wave radio sound into his improvisations. And Iannis
Xenakis used acoustic sounds in his composed tape manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   So if it's already been done, why is this new phase of
electro-acoustic improv spreading so rapidly? Because computer
technology has radically changed what computers can do in real-time
situations: with digital signal processing, someone controlling a
laptop can take what someone else is playing, alter it and feed it
back with all sorts of modifications in real time. Getting music
out of computers involves a process of writing and compiling codes,
and people are doing that on stage; it's a new form of
improvisation. Needless to say, the range of sounds one can get is
wider, and this has made the new music more fluid, less dry, less
dorky. But also, real-time signal processing gets someone working a
laptop much closer to the condition of being a musician _ one who
can immediately act or react and do so with an individual sound.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas one previously needed a university post to access
the latest computer-music technology, since the mid-'80s that
technology has become increasingly cheap and sophisticated. The
music has got more varied, because musicians from different
backgrounds are coming to it. Jim O'Rourke and Christof Kurzmann
have rock, among other things, in their backgrounds. Turntablists _
Otomo Yoshihide, Martin Tetreault and others _ are getting
involved: their language, noises from records and from the stylus
itself, is as infinitely wide as that of the laptop-wielders. The
guitarist Burkhard Stangl was involved in contemporary classical
music; Kevin Drumm, a guitarist from Chicago, was a floor reporter
at the Chicago Board of Trade before he started experimenting with
the guitar as an instrument of pure sound in the early '90s. Since
many of the musicians are using sampling and electronic percussion,
hip-hop is often there as a subliminal influence. But so are lots
of other kinds of music: these musicians are not yet invested in
advancing and protecting theories of what their music should
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Mueller, based in Itingen, Switzerland, is both a
musician and a producer; his record label, For 4 Ears, is an
imprimatur of the new music. He works with a small drum-set _ a
snare, floor-tom and cymbal _ as well as synthesizers and
prerecorded samples. Recently he explained how this music departed
from jazz. ``As I understand jazz, the soloist is very important,''
he said. ``And very often the soloist has to be a virtuoso, playing
very complicatedly and very fast. I understand music more as a
sound-field, where playing around silence can also be important.
Perhaps you can imagine improvisation as I'm doing it as an open
discussion with full risk, where you have to decide at each moment
if you want to support what's going on, contradict, play beside,
put some other material on top of it or underneath, break things,
imitate, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Or envelop it, pan it across the acoustic field, snip it off,
turn it into a sonic monolith. Here, eventually, we have to stop
talking about ``music'' _ melody, harmony, rhythm, song-structure _
and start talking about sound. One goal of the music is that you
really can't tell who's playing what. This is the case on a new
record featuring Mueller and the guitarists Keith Rowe and Taku
Sugimoto, ``The World Turned Upside Down.'' A similar melding of
sound, but more immaculate, less aggressive and with a minute sense
of quiet, is heard on ``Polwechsel 2,'' by the Viennese group
Polwechsel: it's the type of art that the British magazine Wire has
started to call ``microvising.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most extreme examples of this real-time intertwining
is a self-titled disc by the Japanese trio ISO _ a circumscribed
range of electronic scratches, sine waves and turntable sounds
which has an eerie sense of control and focus. And, to contradict
Mueller, there is a place for virtuosity in this music: the
saxophonist Evan Parker, a virtuoso of his own wavy, delirious
idiom, has created an important body of electro-acoustic work in
the last decade, recently culminating in ``Drawn Inward.''
</P>
<P>
   The closer it sounds to ``sound research'' _ with its academic
overtones of the early '60s experiments at the Columbia-Princeton
Electronic Music Center _ the more it fails; two CD's in
particular, ``The Magic Sound of Fenno'berg'' by Christian Fennesz,
Jim O'Rourke and Peter Rehberg, and the, uh, cleverly titled
``Dafeldecker/Kurzmann/Fennesz/O'Rourke/Drumm/Siewert,'' are as
stimulating, funny, aggressive and euphoric as anything I've heard
lately in rock 'n' roll. (All these discs are available from
sources like Forced Exposure, at www.fe.org, or Downtown Music
Gallery, at dtmgallery.com.)
</P>
<P>
   I can't say I like it all: glitchy data-transfer tones are
deadly dull unless you really know what you want to do with them. I
know I don't like it all the time: headphones are nearly essential,
unless you live by yourself and create an environment to hear all
the panning and layering of sound properly. But I find myself
continually going back to it, listening to it with all senses open
as if walking in the darkness, looking for the language of each
work, and usually, with delight, finding it.

TRAINER DRYSDALE SUCCEEDING WITH CAUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. - After Fusaichi Pegasus reared, threw his
exercise rider and toppled over on the Churchill Downs track in a
rambunctious moment one morning last week, somebody joked that
trainer Neil Drysdale would be forced to scratch the favorite from
Saturday's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus hasn't been injured. But he had gotten dirty.
How could Drysdale put up with such imperfection?
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale is so different from the typical Derby trainer, he is
being portrayed as the mad genius of this Derby week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil is unique,'' said an owner who has horses with him.
</P>
<P>
   He's better educated (University of Barcelona). He's more
worldly (he managed a stud farm in Venezuela). He sounds a lot more
like Alistair Cooke than Shug McGaughey (does a transplanted
Englishman who still says ``Darby'' deserve to win America's
greatest thoroughbred race?).
</P>
<P>
   And he might be the most cautious trainer ever actually to get a
horse to the track. A hair out of place, to exaggerate only
slightly, and a Drysdale horse will not run.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that despite the accomplishments that earned
the 52-year-old Drysdale election to the Racing Hall of Fame on
Tuesday, the most famous move of his quarter-century career was the
decision to scratch a sore-footed A.P. Indy from the 1992 Kentucky
Derby on the morning of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale says that was a ``black-and-white decision'' and will
admit to not the slightest regret or disappointment, even though
A.P. Indy's subsequent victory in the Belmont Stakes and Breeders'
Cup Classic suggested he would have been the best horse in the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   That's Drysdale, who rejects reporters' touchy-feely questions
and tries to take emotion out of horsemanship, refusing to dream of
victory in his first Kentucky Derby because ``my job is not to
fantasize - (it's) to get the bloody horses into the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if, sometimes, it appears he'd rather find an excuse to
keep them safely in their stalls.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale has two horses in Saturday's 126th running of the
1-mile race: Japanese-owned Fusaichi Pegasus, undefeated in 2000
with three victories at Santa Anita and a romp in the Wood Memorial
at New York's Aqueduct racetrack; and War Chant, 3 for 4 after his
second-place finish to The Deputy in the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   They embody the Drysdale style. Each was brought along more
slowly than the textbook Derby contender, each racing only once as
a 2-year-old, War Chant because Drysdale adjusted for his late
birthdate (May 22), Fusaichi Pegasus because the trainer wanted
time for the colt to grow into his huge frame.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Drysdale defies Derby history, which shows that Proud
Clarion in 1967 was the last horse to win after failing to win a
race at 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had pushed on with them, they might not be here now,''
Drysdale said while leaning against a rental car outside Churchill
Downs' barn 41 Tuesday morning. ``My feeling is I've come here with
talented horses. If I have to choose between talent and experience,
I'll take talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus and War Chant generally do not set stopwatches
aflame in their workouts, another element of the Drysdale approach
that distinguishes him from speed-crazy American trainers eager to
please Racing Form-reading American owners.
</P>
<P>
   That's his European background at work, and the influence of the
late Hall of Famer Charlie Whittingham, whom Drysdale assisted for
four years he refers to as ``a graduate course'' in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil doesn't train for owners. He trains for himself,'' said
Jeff Siegel, who was among the owners of Drysdale-trained Breeders'
Cup Turf winner Prized in 1989 and is here with The Deputy. ``He's
not obnoxious about it. He listens. But it doesn't change the way
he trains.''
</P>
<P>
   His fastidiousness, his emphasis on patience and planning might
frustrate owners and drive away potential clients. But it's hard to
argue with his results: five champions, including 1992 Horse of the
Year A.P. Indy, and five Breeders' Cup winners.

THE USES OF A NEW ART AT A DEVASTATING MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By RICHARD B. WOODWARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Paris Commune of 1871 is one of those smoldering ash
heaps in French history, like the 1968 riots, stirred habitually by
left and right to inflame old class allegiances and fears. To the
left, the Communards are secular martyrs who refused to accept the
humiliating peace imposed by Bismarck after the Prussian army
crushed the French in 1870. With Napoleon III readily conceding
defeat, these die-hard nationalists had no choice but to replace
the capitulators with leaders of their own. To the right, the
Commune is a vital lesson in the perils of social disorder. Without
respect for the central authority of the state, chaos ensues and
Robespierre's reign of terror is reborn.
</P>
<P>
   One uncontested fact in the struggle over national memory is the
bloody trauma of the uprising. In 72 days during the spring of
1871, many of the official symbols of Parisian culture and might
were leveled by Commune arsonists or stray artillery shells from
government troops. The Palais de Tuileries and the Hotel de Ville
were set ablaze and gutted; the Louvre, Palais de Justice, Palais
Royal and Notre Dame were scheduled for destruction but saved by
fire brigades. Generals, priests, judges, even the Archbishop of
Paris were put to death by the Commune. But the government exiled
in Versailles soon recaptured the city, hunted down the rebels and
exacted a brutal revenge. The numbers tell the story. Perhaps 1,000
Versailles soldiers died in actual fighting compared with 4,000
Communards, while 17,000 to 20,000 others were executed by the
Third Republic, more than perished in any battle during the
Franco-Prussian war.
</P>
<P>
   As the first news event in French history covered by
photographers, the Commune and its aftermath also left a unique
visual record, as a compelling new exhibition at the Musee d'Orsay,
on view until June 11, makes clear. ``La Commune Photographiee'' is
a small show, with fewer than 100 prints, but the curator, Quentin
Bajac, has chosen his examples well. Instead of taking sides,
either political or artistic, he has exposed the multiple
identities of photography at the time, illustrating how the
Communards and the state adapted the medium for their own ends.
Whether used to document common people in the streets or to
meditate on the nature of ruins, to produce mug shots for wanted
posters of the rebels or to embellish bizarre tableaus for
government propaganda, photography emerges in this show as
politicized as the events themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Braquehais (1823-75) is one of the few photographers to
have made a name for himself as a chronicler of the Communards.
While others took out their cameras only after much of the city had
been razed after May 1871, this deaf-mute who had begun his career
as a daguerreotypist made group portraits of the armed men as they
occupied the streets and public buildings. His series before and
after the destruction of the Vendome column on May 16 is an early
example of photographic reportage. Posing face-front with their
swords unsheathed and caps doffed, the masses of men (along with a
few women and children) are a ragtag army _ more shooting party
than military machine. But Braquehais has captured the pleasure
they take in one another's company as well as their childish joy in
having toppled a monument to Napoleon's martial prowess in the
heart of the fashionable Right Bank.
</P>
<P>
   For pure photographic thrills, however, nothing in the show
matches the many crisp and sensual wet-plate images of charred
ruins. No other city in the world is as proud of keeping up
appearances as Paris. To see Hyppolyte-August Collard's long
exposure of ghostly passers-by stopping to ogle the jagged shell of
the Hotel de Ville, or Alphonse Liebert's study of the eviscerated
Theatre Lyrique, a protomodernist abstraction of twisted wire and
bare concrete, can evoke feelings of loss along with
hard-to-suppress anarchic glee.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers, as they surveyed their once-tidy capital, seemed
also to oscillate between sadness and astonishment. As they had
when Baron Haussmann's decrees bulldozed old neighborhoods in the
1850s, they seized the opportunity to peer into the intestinal
structure of a city known until then mainly by its graceful and
often pompous facades. More than one art historian, while examining
these lovely X-rays of ashen destruction, has glimpsed the roots of
French surrealism. (A fine selection of digitized photographs and
artifacts from the Siege and Commune of Paris is available at
www.library.nwu.edu/spec/siege.)
</P>
<P>
   These are the best-known images from the Commune, the
devastating effects of the uprising on the physical plan of Paris.
Less familiar but no less intriguing are the ways in which
photography helped pro-government forces to identify the rebels and
to make a dramatic case of their crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The key figure in this activity is Ernest Eugene Appert
(1831-90?), a painter manque whose works dominate the last third of
the exhibition. Fervently pro-Versaillais, he produced not only
portraits of the Communards as they awaited trial in prison _ when
arranged on a grid they read as wanted posters _ but also a series
of small tableaus that may be the first political photomontages.
His ``Crimes of the Commune,'' made between 1871 and 1873,
illustrate in some 17 scenes the deaths by firing squad of priests,
hostages, generals and other opponents brutally liquidated by the
Commune. The realism of the photograph meets the fantasy of a
zealot in these re-creations of history. Pasting the photographed
heads and bodies of the victims onto photographs of the scenes of
the crimes, Appert arranged events as he imagined they had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The artist Jules Raudnitz (1815-72) brings 19th-century
photography even closer to standard postmodern practice. In his
series ``Bloody Sabbath'' he photographed reliefs, sculptured by an
unknown artist, depicting various famous events from the Commune
saga, then photographed and hand-colored them as stereograph
slides.

CHINA TRADE BILL GAINING IN HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned Tuesday that it would be a
``terrible mistake'' for Congress to deny the permanent extension
of U.S. trade benefits to China, as he joined with Republican
leaders in a harder pitch for the measure when it comes to a vote
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Passage in the Senate is virtually assured, with at least 60
senators expected to back it in a vote planned for June. But the
vote in the House, scheduled for May 22, could be close with
organized labor leading the fight against it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton and Republican leaders expressed confidence
that they will have the 218 votes needed to win approval in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Tuesday by Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., that he
intends to support the bill should boost that confidence even more.
Hoyer is co-chair of the Democratic Steering Committee and the
highest ranking Democrat so far to come out in favor of permanent
trade relations with China. Several other Democrats and Republicans
also moved Tuesday from the undecided ranks to support the bill,
which gave House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and other
leading backers of the measure even more cause for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battleground's been in the House. ... But we've picked up
a couple of good votes on our side, and the president seems to be
working as well. So, we're going to be driving hard (for final
passage),'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to say how many Republicans and Democrats are on
board in favor of the bill. But Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., who
is leading the administration's effort in Congress on the measure,
said he believes that at least 160 Republicans will back the bill
along with at least 60 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped up his own lobbying efforts on behalf of the
bill Tuesday, urging House and Senate members not to succumb to
arguments that the permanent extension of normal trade status to
China will end up costing U.S. jobs, harming the environment and
reinforcing Beijing's disregard of human rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He also intensified his lobbying campaign by hosting a meeting
between undecided lawmakers and Hong Kong Democratic Party leader
Martin Lee, a critic of Chinese human rights abuses who believes
that improved trade relations with Beijing will lead to more
democratic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   In two separate appearances before the Council for the Americas
and the Independent Insurance Agents of America, Clinton called
passage of the measure a matter of national security and insisted
the benefits to the U.S. economy would far outweigh any drawbacks.
He said granting permanent trade status would also increase the
likelihood that more democratic reforms will take hold in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national security point of view, it would be a very,
very unwise and precarious move to say that the United States
doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or not,''
Clinton told the insurance organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is not to turn back,'' he added later in a speech
to the council. ``The answer is to keep going forward, to spread
the benefits to more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a terrible mistake for the United States ever to
send a signal that we have any policy other than full-steam ahead,
more engagement, more support, more commitment. I think that is
very, very important,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As the president spoke, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, was busy trying to drum up support for the
measure, which would extend the same kind of U.S. tariffs and other
benefits to Beijing that most other countries now have. It would
also eliminate the annual review by Congress that China must
undergo in order to keep its normal trade status designation.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Archer also
indicated he might back an amendment to the trade measure that
would create a commission to monitor human rights violations in
China if it would help persuade some undecided lawmakers to support
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is for a clean bill,'' Archer said. ``But
because I feel so strongly about the importance of extending
(permanent normal trade relations) to China, I am willing to look
at proposals which would ensure victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of permanent trade benefits could help ease China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, even though Beijing is
expected to eventually gain admittance to the WTO anyway.

A CHANCE TO BE AT HOME WITH CHINA'S EMPERORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. _ The opulent and mysterious lives of China's
last imperial rulers can be glimpsed in the largest exhibition so
far of national treasures from China's Imperial Palace, installed
here in February at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 350 artifacts in ``Secret World of the Forbidden
City: Splendors From China's Imperial Palace,'' including
gilt-edged ceremonial suits of armor, solid-gold flatware and
gold-embroidered silk gowns, have not been seen before in North
America or even in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Finding adequate exhibition space for permanent collections is a
constant juggling act for most museum directors. At Beijing's
showcase, the Forbidden City Palace Museum, the dilemma is
different.
</P>
<P>
   The former Imperial Palace, the vast vermilion compound where
Ming and Qing emperors and their courts lived beginning in 1407, is
preserved largely as it was when the Qing dynasty ended in 1911.
Without climate control to protect the extensive art collections
and historical artifacts, such as gifts of state and household
possessions, curators keep much of the palace's contents sealed in
storage. The eight million tourists annually who tour the museum
see only a central section where they mostly appreciate the grand
architecture of three great ceremonial halls. A fraction of the
collection is on display there, covered with dust and inadequately
lighted by money-saving, low-watt bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Located near Tiananmen Square, the 180-acre palace encircled by
a moat and a 32-foot wall was for centuries a mysterious and
secretive place. Most of its 999 buildings with their 9,999 rooms
(an auspicious number in China) are still off limits. Because of
limited resources, buildings that housed the imperial household _
the artisans, guards, concubines and eunuchs _ are locked and
untended, with trees sprouting from some roof tops.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last decade, as China's relations with the West have
improved, has a portion of the Forbidden City collection been lent
to smaller exhibitions in Paris and Amsterdam. Curators have turned
instead to Taiwan's National Palace Museum, whose collection of
imperial Chinese artifacts, seized from the Beijing palace by
fleeing nationalists, is considered the best. The Taipei museum
lent 450 items to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996, provoking
demonstrations in Taiwan over the removal of national treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Chinese art shown by mainstream United States
institutions has focused on earlier periods more prized by experts.
Vishakha N. Desai, senior vice president and gallery director of
the Asia Society in New York, said of the Bowers exhibition, which
has objects dating back to the 1600s, ``I think it's absolutely
important to do a show like this.'' She added, however, that the
Bowers' portrayal of an emperor's life should be appreciated for
its educational value more than for its artistic value. ``Isn't it
remarkable it hasn't happened before?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The show is drawing record crowds to the Bowers, which is housed
in a Spanish-style hacienda near downtown Santa Ana, about 30 miles
southeast of Los Angeles. It will travel to the Oakland Museum
beginning Oct. 14 and to Houston's Museum of Natural Sciences in
March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, a coup for a small museum, had its origin in a
display of military court costumes that the museum's president,
Peter Keller, saw in Amsterdam in 1992 and coveted for the Bowers,
which tries to play host to an Asian exhibit annually. But it would
not have been won without the efforts of a persistent volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes organizer was the Taiwan-born Anne Shih,
45, the founder of a Chinese language school in Fountain Valley,
Calif., and a member of the museum's board.
</P>
<P>
   Her first success was bringing to the Bowers a jade exhibit in
1997, with the best pieces from a dozen private Taiwanese
collections, which also traveled to museums in Houston and
Washington. Before a trip to Beijing that year, Shih asked Keller
if she could be of any help again.
</P>
<P>
   As curator of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, he
had previously tried to borrow collections from museums in Taiwan
and China and got nowhere. ``The big piece of the puzzle I didn't
know was the only way of getting anywhere was to send a director,''
Keller said. Sending one who was charming, persistent and fluent in
Chinese didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, and eight trips to China, Shih was
able to accomplish as a volunteer what American museum officials
could not. ``They took us into parts of the Forbidden City that
hadn't been opened in decades,'' Keller said, adding that he and
Shih prowled the complex on bikes. ``Whenever they would show us
something, Anne would say, `Can we put it in the exhibit?'''
Eventually their picks filled a 747.
</P>
<P>
   Most negotiations were aimed at fulfilling Keller's notion of
recreating the lives led by the 10 Qing (pronounced ching) emperors
who reigned in the palace beginning in 1611. Each object was the
subject of a separate negotiated agreement. Selecting the pieces
was a laborious task, as the palace collection is estimated to
include a million artifacts. The jade collection alone numbers
50,000, dwarfing the best-known collection in the West, the
2,500-piece Avery Brundage collection at the Asian Art Museum in
San Francisco, Keller said. The exhibit will cost the Bowers $1.5
million over its seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials set a limit of 120 sets, which could be
individual pieces or groups of similar objects. Ultimately, the
Bowers' limited exhibit space and the jet's 10-ton weight limit
forced the Bowers officials, working with the exhibit's curator,
the Palace Museum director Yang Xin, to pare their selections,
cutting large furniture pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Shih learned that Chinese officials had asked
their consulate in Los Angeles to compile a dossier on her. ``They
wanted to make sure I wasn't a spy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mistrust was not an issue for Palace Museum employees, though.
Shih won them over with her rule-bending suggestion that a
succession of curators accompany the exhibit in the United States.
Instead of a single three-person group staying for the duration,
she proposed that teams come for three months at a time. ``I create
an opportunity for you,'' she said, adding that visiting the West
would be unlikely for most museum workers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the exhibit's most remarkable items are eight-foot-high
18th-century portraits of several emperors, their faces rendered in
near-photographic detail.
</P>
<P>
   In one striking painting, instead of the dragon-ringed throne
where the seven other rulers pose, the Qing Emperor Qianlong is
outfitted in battle regalia astride a horse. Though unsigned, the
portrait's Western style suggests the hand of the famed Giuseppe
Castiglione, an Italian Jesuit missionary who worked as a Chinese
court painter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are treasures,'' said John E. Wills Jr., a professor of
Asian history at the University of Southern California and a
featured speaker in the lecture series that coincides with the
exhibit. ``I was surprised to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one-of-a-kind object on display is a pearl-studded
golden statue of Maitreya, a Buddhist figure that distills the
cosmopolitan Qing dynasty culture. ``It encompasses several
traditions: the sensuality of India's art, the formality of Tibetan
art and the serenity of Chinese art,'' said Janet Baker, the
Bowers' curator of Asian art, who served as the exhibit's assistant
curator.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit conveys an emperor's life through palace scenes. It
includes recreations of a formal throne room; a study that includes
scientific instruments and carved red lacquer writing tools; a
dining room with solid gold implements; a wardrobe area for
ceremonial robes embellished with gold and pearls, and a bed
chamber complete with wash basin and silk-cushioned toilet. An
adjoining room holds suits of military armor and armaments and a
scale model of the Forbidden City.

PASSING THE 'SWAN LAKE' TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By IRIS FANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the turn of the millennium, American Ballet
Theater moved into overdrive on its new production of ``Swan
Lake.'' Mounting a classic as big as this one, with a price tag to
match, involved every resource the company could muster. Work days
turned into nights for Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic
director and ballet master, the dancers and coaching staff and the
technical crews, not to mention the efforts of the development
office, which raised $1.4 million to assure the splendor of the
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The production will have its New York premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera House on May 19. ``Swan Lake'' is expected to be
the blockbuster of the company's 60th-anniversary season, which
opens with a gala performance tomorrow night and runs through July
1.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie describes ``Swan Lake'' as the quintessential ballet,
the one that defines the standards of the company, tests its
dancers and ennobles the spirit of the viewer. ``It rings so true
of human nature, of man's inconsistency, of the victimizing of
women, so full of big truths,'' he says. ``The key point is about
not being able to marry one's ideals to one's realities.''
</P>
<P>
   These issues came to life on stage in St. Petersburg in 1895
when Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov created the choreography for the
``Swan Lake'' that has come down to us, joined to Tchaikovsky's
glorious score (the first, butchered staging of the score was in
1877). McKenzie has based his production on theirs, but combined
his own ideas with the familiar story about the Prince who falls in
love with a Swan Queen in the power of the wicked sorcerer von
Rothbart.
</P>
<P>
   Late one March afternoon, McKenzie stood watching a rehearsal of
the prologue he has added to ``Swan Lake'' while two two-man teams
double cast as von Rothbart refined a fancy twisting of the body
around an arm. In rethinking the scenario, McKenzie needed to
introduce up front his notion of presenting the evil sorcerer as a
split personality, with two dancers trading places as the character
throughout the ballet. It was not hard to picture the moment of
theatrical magic he intends with von Rothbart's transformation from
devil to suave courtier. Off in a corner, three of the principal
dancers cast as the Swan Queen at different performances _ Paloma
Herrera, Julie Kent and Susan Jaffe _ waited for the cue to walk
unknowingly into von Rothbart's trap.
</P>
<P>
   A prologue that explains the Swan Queen's enchantment in a
long-ago and faraway era before the familiar story unfolds is
another of the innovations McKenzie has brought to this ``Swan
Lake.'' Still another is condensing the ballet into two acts,
posing a challenge for the set and costume designer, Zack Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake'' takes place in four distinct locales, requiring
the shifting of backdrops and platforms from the palace garden, to
the lakeside, to the palace ballroom and back to a different
perspective of the lake. Brown solved the problem of only one
intermission by using a traveling curtain, with silhouetted trees,
to bring in the lakeside clearing, plus a transparent back wall for
the palace and a ballroom platform that breaks in half for the
final act. Before the ballet's premiere at the Kennedy Center in
Washington last month, Ballet Theater's technical crew spent a week
in one of the theaters on the campus of the State University of New
York in Purchase to devise the intricate backstage choreography for
the rapid set changes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barbara Matera's costume shop on the fifth floor
above the company's studios at 890 Broadway was buzzing with 85
workers constructing the more than 300 costumes required for the
multiple casting of roles. In one corner, three women did nothing
but hand beading and embroidery. Another worker bent over the
colored ribbon she was threading into fabric for the vests to be
worn by the Neapolitan dancers for about three minutes of stage
time. Forty-four swan tutus had to be hand pleated of tulle to look
like feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Horowitz, Ballet Theater's wardrobe supervisor for the
last 19 years, planned a strategy as complicated as a military
maneuver for the quick costume changes. The women of the corps de
ballet will have only a few minutes to shed their Act I peasant
costumes for tutus. During Act III, the corps members, dressed in
court costumes, must melt off the stage a few at a time to climb
back into tutus and point shoes. Horowitz had already measured the
dancers' feet for 140 pairs of leather boots that complement the
court and peasant costumes and sent the men's measurements to
Portland, Ore., and the women's to Russia, where the boots were
made.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who have seen a production of ``Swan Lake'' _ its
viewers since 1895 must number in the millions because the work is
a staple of repertories the world over _ retain, above all else,
the image of the Swan Queen, with her quivering arms, long, arched
neck and demeanor of doom. Behind her, sister swan maidens dance in
perfect symmetry to complete the moonlit vision that has remained
in collective memory.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie can be forgiven for having a viewpoint that differs
from the shared opinion that the ballet belongs to the Swan Queen.
The fate of Prince Siegfried has been his to ponder since 1980,
when he made his debut in the role, a year after he joined Ballet
Theater as a dancer. He believes the focus of the ballet is the
Prince. ``In my mind, the Swan's story is done,'' McKenzie says,
ending a 12-hour day at the studio by talking about his work on the
ballet. ``The story happens to Siegfried, not the Swan. He can't
marry his ideal to reality. That is the tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In radically shortening Act IV, McKenzie brings the story to a
quick conclusion. ``Prince Siegfried's rite of passage is that he
realizes he owes it to her to join her in death,'' he says. ``Her
rite of passage is that she realizes she can forgive him for his
betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   A full-length production of ``Swan Lake,'' choreographed after
Petipa and Ivanov by David Blair of the Royal Ballet, has been in
the ABT repertory since 1967, briefly replaced by Mikhail
Baryshnikov's production in 1988. However, Baryshnikov took the
rights to his ballet with him when he left the company in 1989.
Ballet Theater reverted to Blair's ballet in 1993 when McKenzie
first staged ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie was a teen-age ballet student in Washington when he saw
excerpts from ``Swan Lake'' on a Bolshoi Ballet program. A year
later he attended a Ballet Theater performance and saw his first
full-length ``Swan Lake.'' In subsequent years, the company became
an annual visitor to Washington at the Kennedy Center. McKenzie
went regularly to the performances. ``I grew up seeing all those
wonderful casts,'' he says. ``I was obviously very thrilled when my
time came to do the ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake'' has been a constant in the company's history since
1940, when the Act II lakeside scene was presented in its opening
season. Lucia Chase, a founder of Ballet Theater, its director with
Oliver Smith from 1945 to 1980 and its financial fairy godmother,
had dreamed of a full-length ``Swan Lake'' to replace the one-act
version. But there wasn't enough money or dancers until 1967, when
an enlarged company presented Blair's complete version. With its
premiere, the first of the evening-length classics that ABT would
produce, ``Ballet Theatre acquired the confident assurance that it
could rank itself among the half-dozen major ballet companies of
the world,'' according to Charles Payne in his detailed history,
``American Ballet Theatre,'' published by Knopf in 1977.

SPORTS COLUMN: MASHBURN, THE PLAYER ABLE TO ROCK THE KNICK BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It does not take a genius to handicap this one. The banged-up,
skill-challenged, hungry Heat will starve to death against the
Knicks on shots forced up as the 24-second clock winds down, on too
many paint-by-number offensive possessions. On Miami's 2000
tombstone will read an inscription that could be the title of Pat
Riley's next book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty Is Not Enough,'' it will say.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they know something in Miami we don't. Unless Tim
Hardaway isn't talking about the health of his foot because he
doesn't want to divulge the source of his cure. Unless Alonzo
Mourning has developed a go-to move. Or unless Jamal Mashburn is
finally ready to do what coaches have been after him to do since
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we were playing Tolentine, which had Adrian Autrey and
Brian Reese, and Jamal was like a man on a mission,'' said Tom
Murray, four decades the coach at Cardinal Hayes in the Bronx. ``He
went out and got 39. But, yes, sometimes there was frustration
because you wanted him to do more. Most of the time, he never had
it in him to just take over.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mashburn in 1990, Murray won his only city title, so this
was not meant as criticism, just an honest appraisal of who his
former player was, and is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we won,'' Murray said, ``because he was happy to
pass the ball, make the other kids better.'' Then Murray, no longer
in contact with Mashburn and more of a Knick fan than a Mash man,
said: ``I imagine Riley will run a lot of his offense through him
as the point forward, which is what he always wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with rest, even with a full week for the Knicks and Heat to
sit around and feign mutual respect, Hardaway will not be more than
a caretaker with 3-point range. Mourning will be Mourning, the
earnest bull in the Knicks' chop shop, at times physically dominant
while utterly defensible come crunch time. That leaves Mashburn as
the potential arrow on Miami's growth chart.
</P>
<P>
   The series ``oxymoron,'' as Riley called him not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   He does not have to be Vince Carter, who wasn't Vince Carter in
Round 1. Yet, if the Mashburn who has shown up in the last three
New York-Miami playoff series surfaces again, the Heat will be
fortunate to get a game.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn has averaged 8.4 points on 34 percent shooting in 17
games, 10 below his career scoring average. Two years ago in the
first round, it was an unsightly 6.2 points on 26 percent shooting.
Mashburn has set unofficial records for aborted drives following
promising first steps. He has seldom got inside, despite his
6-foot-8-inch, 250-pound body by Jake.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up near 159th Street in Manhattan, and Tom Murray can
still remember his father, `` Mash,'' coming to the games. It
turned out that Robert Mashburn had done some heavyweight boxing, a
sport completely incongruous with his son's personality and style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always unselfish, the team player,'' said Murray. When he
became rich, Mashburn wanted to give back to his community, so he
started a summer basketball tournament for kids. He appreciated
what was done for him during his three years with Rick Pitino at
Kentucky, so he started a scholarship fund and wrote a check for
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   He once told a reporter that he wished he could play music,
which he considered a real ``God-given talent.'' Basketball was
more of a vocation, he said, ``not a real big thing.'' He said he
wanted to maintain a healthy life perspective, not a great idea
when your coach is Riley and the next round's opponent is New York.
</P>
<P>
   For this edition of the Heat, the Eastern Conference semifinal
is life and death. Riley knows how much of his own reputation is
riding on Mashburn. His party line is that Mashburn has never been
completely healthy for these dysfunctional family reunions. He said
the real Mashburn stood up in the three-game sweep of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's healthy and performing,'' said Riley. ``He's never been
ready before.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he prepared to drive into the teeth of the Knicks' defense?
Handle Latrell Sprewell occupying his release space on the
perimeter and the double-team help when he puts the ball on the
floor and Marcus Camby's long arms when Jeff Van Gundy decides to
play big? Is he ready for the pushing, the holding, the Madison
Square Garden heat?
</P>
<P>
   If health and the new rules do not help Mashburn this time
around, we will punctuate the thought that he is less than the sum
of his parts. ``He's a skilled player, always has been,'' Murray
said. ``And I always thought it was a skill sport.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. Just not as much when these teams meet. &QL;

REPUBLICAN PANEL SEEKS PRIMARY CHANGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican advisory commission Tuesday proposed a
tightly controlled, three-month, presidential primary season in
which the least populous states would go first and megastates,
including Texas, would vote last.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation represents a major departure from the GOP's
traditional hands-off approach to the timing of delegate selection.
But commission Chairman Bill Brock, a former U.S. senator from
Tennessee and one-time Republican National Committee chairman, said
the proposal was a necessary response to the intense, ever-shorter
burst of early primaries which has grown over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican commission also proposed prohibiting
winner-take-all primaries and instead called for awarding delegates
proportionally to any candidate receiving 15 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that too few people have a say in the
process,'' said Jim Nicholson, the RNC chairman, who established
the commission but refused to endorse its recommendations
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican commission's recommendations are subject to
approval by a series of party groups, including the full national
convention, where the proposal could run into the most opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that in 1980 only 21 percent of Republican
National Convention delegates were selected by March 15. This year
63 percent of delegates were chosen by that date.
</P>
<P>
   If the smallest-first primary plan is not adopted, the
commission proposed an alternative for rotating regional primaries
in which a different area of the country would go first every four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Under either system, states that did not follow the
party-mandated primary schedule could lose up to 90 percent of
their Republican National Convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior party operatives were doubtful either plan would
pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's enough weight behind either proposal,''
said an influential party figure familiar with the commission's
work. ``And each plan has a string of unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Weddington, chairman of the Texas State Republican
Executive Committee, said, ``A change like this with so many
unanswered questions ... is going to have a difficult time'' being
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominating process, which is already more tightly
controlled by national rules, has been affected by similar early
bunching in the primary season, and a party committee has recently
completed a study.
</P>
<P>
   Having won the last two presidential races, Democrats are less
concerned than Republicans about how timing the primaries may
affect the result in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criticism about a front-loaded schedule has to be weighed
against a process that seems to be working well,'' the Democratic
Rules and Bylaws Committee said in a report last week.
</P>
<P>
   Major primary schedule changes ``would be very difficult to
implement,'' the Democratic report said, in part because almost
every state would have to change its election laws to accommodate
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic panel also expressed concern that concentrating
on small states first ``would not help the candidate design a
successful message with broad appeal in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic panel objected to the general lack of minorities
in the least populous states that would vote first. Eight of the 12
smallest states have less than 1 percent black residents. Six of
the 12 have less than 2 percent Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   Definitive Democratic proposals are not expected until after the
November election and can be handled by the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are more under the gun because current GOP rules
give the party's national convention sole authority to establish
nominating procedures. One of the commission's proposals is for the
Republican National Committee to be given the power to change
nominating rules, but Weddington and other party figures said that,
too, could face resistance at the convention.

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys talked contract numbers with Barron
Wortham's agent, Scott Casterline, yesterday but they did not
strike a deal to bring the former Everman High School star home.
</P>
<P>
   Casterline said Wortham is open to a deal friendly to the
Cowboys' salary cap, but he cautioned that the linebacker is also
drawing interest from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham played the past six years with the Tennessee Titans and
started in Super Bowl XXXIV against the St. Louis Rams. However,
Tennessee signed former Cowboys middle linebacker Randall Godfrey
in the off-season, making Wortham expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, who was released last week, would give the Cowboys some
insurance in case Dat Nguyen doesn't work out at middle linebacker
or as an option to Darrin Hambrick at strongside linebacker.
\Nsubheds:Williams practices A day after signing a one-year deal,
cornerback Charlie Williams practiced with the team for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who missed the minicamp last weekend and the first day
of the quarterback school on Monday, acknowledged being rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, however, said it feels good to be playing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite drafting three cornerbacks, the Cowboys re-signed the
six-year veteran because they coveted his experience, durability
and versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who played in 75 percent of the team's defensive plays
at cornerback last season, started his career at safety. The
Cowboys like that he can play both positions.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he doesn't care where he plays, ``as long as I get
to play and hit somebody.''  &QL; 
Line shuffling
</P>
<P>
   With right tackle Erik Williams sidelined by a sore elbow and
right guard Solomon Page absent because of personal reasons, Tony
Hutson and Jorge Diaz played tackle and guard, respectively, with
the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   The shuffling might give Diaz a slight advantage in the battle
to replace Everett McIver at guard. Hutson and Page are also
candidates for the starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Page, a second-round pick last season, is billed as the
favorite. He missed the first two days of minicamp last week,
returned for Sunday's practice, and then was gone again Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, a free-agent signee from Tampa Bay, is making the most of
the now unobstructed opportunity to familiarize himself with the
offense and center Mark Stepnoski.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Chad Hennings missed practice for the second
consecutive day because of personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Joey Galloway has garnered most of the attention,
butCowboys coaches say receiver Chris Brazzell has done well, too.
Brazzell, 6-foot-2 and 193 pounds, has the size and speed to have a
chance to become a factor next season, coaches say.

MCKNIGHT MAKING SURE COWBOYS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ James McKnight has shown this week at the
Cowboys' quarterback school that he has a full grasp of the three
R's.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, the three R's are receiving, rehabilitating and ...
making sure he was still remembered.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, 6-foot-1 and 198 pounds, never took a snap for the
Cowboys in either a preseason or regular-season game in 1999
because he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
during a noncontact drill during warmups for the Blue and White
Scrimmage at Wichita Falls on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, he underwent major surgery, which came barely
two months after he had joined the Cowboys in a trade (for a
third-round pick) from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do now? That's what I had to ask myself,''
McKnight said. ``Do I crawl into a hole and feel sorry for myself?
Or do I come back and rehab every day with a smile on my face, even
when I'm feeling like I'm in a hole?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an easy choice for me. I'm not the kind of guy who is
going to let his teammates or coaches see him down. Instead, I
decided, I'm going to beat this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, 27, added, ``The way I'm progressing right now, I feel
I can play five or six more years. And that's amazing. I just thank
God.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight has attended all the off-season workouts, even the
unstructured ones in which Troy Aikman and the receivers have met
twice a week to work on getting down their timing. He has impressed
Aikman with his long-striding speed _ something that can get
overlooked on a team with Joey Galloway and Raghib ``Rocket''
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKnight doesn't look like he's lost any speed,'' Aikman said.
``Actually, our team doctors have had tremendous success with ACL
surgeries, probably as much success as any \R team doctors\S in the
league. I can't think of anybody who has had an ACL \Rsurgery\S and
hasn't come back from it here.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight generally stays an hour after most of the players leave
Valley Ranch, icing down his left knee and tending to his shin
splints, which have occurred since he began pushing himself in
practice. Through seven months of rehab, he remains a tireless
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after McKnight left Seattle for Dallas, Galloway
followed in a blockbuster deal in February for two first-round
draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Joey on the phone a lot last year because he had
gone through a similar knee injury at Ohio State,'' McKnight said.
``I kept telling him how much of a family it is here. I told him,
`Joey, I love it out here. I'm not even playing and they make me
feel welcome.' I think that made his decision easier when Galloway
was ready to leave Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers coach Wes Chandler likes McKnight's size,
intelligence and ability to run patterns.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, whose best season in Seattle was in 1997 when he
caught 34 passes for 637 yards, is probably the leading candidate
to become the team's third receiver behind Galloway and Ismail.

   ``There's definitely a spot there,'' McKnight said. ``Remember,
we had a lot of injuries at receiver last year. So, I don't care if
you want to call me the `third' or `fourth' or `second' or `first'
receiver, I just want to have a chance to step up if something
should happen to Joey or Rocket. Just get me on the field. The rest
of it will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like his speed, his work ethic and the way he has
rehabilitated his knee since last year,'' coach Dave Campo said.
``These things are all positives when you're talking about James
McKnight.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight knows that the competition will be stiff once the
Cowboys report to training camp July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best bunch of receivers that we've had in
the 12 years that I've been here,'' Aikman said. ``We always had
Michael \RIrvin\S, an All-Pro wide receiver every year, but we had
never really and truly been able to complement him with that second
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have some legitimate speed receivers who can flat-out
run and make plays. So when you combine Galloway and Rocket with
receivers like McKnight, Jason Tucker, Chris Brazzell and Wane
McGarity, and then the tight ends out there like Jackie Harris and
David LaFleur ... it gives you some real options.'' nn

ABC TRANSMISSION RESTORED AFTER TRUCE BY DISNEY AND TIME WARNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DISNEY-MEDIA) 
 By BILL CARTER with STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under increasing pressure, Time Warner restored the
signals of ABC television stations to 3.5 million homes Tuesday
afternoon after agreeing to a temporary truce in its contractual
impasse with Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement put off until July 15 a deadline for Time Warner
Cable and Disney to come to terms on how much the cable company
will pay Disney for use of three of its cable channels. Time Warner
had sought an eight-month extension on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Homes in seven areas around the country, including parts of New
York, Los Angeles and Houston, had been without ABC for more than
39 hours when the programming resumed at about 3:21 p.m. Eastern
time. In New York, the actress Rebecca Herbst appeared, playing
Elizabeth Webber on the program ``General Hospital,'' crying
because her boyfriend, Lucky, no longer seemed interested in her.
Time Warner had cut off the ABC stations as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern
time Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's decision came just before the Federal
Communications Commission was about to rule in favor of Disney's
request to force Time Warner to restore the signal until after the
current ratings sweeps month ends on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure had grown on Time Warner as politicians in Washington
and New York either urged Time Warner to put ABC back on the air or
declared they would hold hearings on the issue. ABC also planned a
joint venture with DirectTV, a satellite company, to buy and
install satellite dishes in Los Angeles, New York and Houston for
viewers seeking an alternative to Time Warner's cable service.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ratings were not severely affected Monday night, even with
Time Warner blacking out 3.5 million of the 100 million homes with
television sets.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A celebrity version of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' drew a
rating of 22.1 (each point represents about 1 million homes). In
fact, in the New York area, where the signal was pulled in 1.5
million homes, about 15 percent of the total, the show exceeded the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   But in Houston, where almost half the city's homes are linked to
Time Warner cable, the falloff was noticeable as both
``Millionaire'' and many other ABC shows were down sharply.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's settlement came in full view of reporters assembled
for a news conference called by Time Warner to propose a new
October 15 deadline for the compensation talks. Disney officials,
responding quickly to a letter sent by Time Warner, simply changed
the date to July and faxed it to Time Warner executives, who, after
an impromptu huddle, accepted it in the middle of answering
questions about their October offer. Time Warner executives called
the acceptance of ABC's date a gesture of good faith.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials had regarded the dispute as a private matter
between the two companies, and had urged them to resolve it between
themselves. But the FCC's preliminary analysis had concluded that a
1993 commission regulation prohibited the broadcaster from being
pulled from a cable system during a ratings sweeps month, federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC decision could come into play again over the new
deadline because July is also a ratings sweep month. Robert A.
Iger, the Disney president, said he was not thinking of the sweep
month angle when he suggested the date be changed to July. But in a
reflection of the continuing hostility between the two companies,
Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner, said, ``It's very hard
to accept that anything Disney says or does in this matter has an
innocent reason to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they were relieved by Tuesday's truce
agreement, although frustrated that it had required a temporary
blackout that penalized millions of viewers. The FCC chairman,
William Kennard, called the situation a ``game of brinkmanship''
and said in a statement, ``The television sets of average consumers
should never be held hostage in these disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong pressure had been building in political quarters to end
the impasse. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who heads the Commerce
Committee, had already scheduled a hearing for next Wednesday to
address issues raised by Time Warner's decision to take ABC off its
systems. After the truce was announced, McCain postponed the
hearing until July.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other lawmakers, such as Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., had
written to the top executives of both companies asking that ABC's
signal be restored while the two companies continued to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, in a news conference before the two sides broke
their stalemate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani assailed Time Warner,
calling it an ``out of touch monopoly,'' with leaders who ``haven't
given us the courtesy'' of explaining their reasoning. In a
separate news conference, the City Council speaker, Peter F.
Vallone, established a commission to investigate and hold hearings
on the actions of the companies. Vallone threatened Tuesday to
subpoena the top executives of both companies to explain their
actions before a council committee.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement may not augur a new tone to future negotiations
between the companies. Disney executives said the company will
still go ahead with its satellite dish plan, in which the company
and DirectTV will offer to repay consumers for the entire $198 cost
of the purchase and installation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disney had previously set up a similar deal in Houston and more
than 15,000 homes had signed on with DirectTV as a result. That
program had become a serious factor in the growing enmity between
Time Warner and Disney, with the cable company's executives
charging that Disney was trying to undermine its business. As one
condition in the most recent negotiations between the two
companies, Time Warner has been demanding that Disney pay a fee for
every customer it has lost to DirectTV in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Luftman said Disney's decision to proceed with its plan to pay
consumers to switch to satellite distribution, after Time Warner
had taken a step to help resolve the impasse, was a ``nakedly
hostile act'' that was `'another indication of that Disney is
engaging in a campaign of destruction.'' The move ``can't help but
cast a dark cloud over the negotiations,'' Luftman said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Time Warner have been at loggerheads since their
compensation agreement expired in December. The dispute centered on
how much Time Warner will pay for Disney's Toon, Soap and Disney
cable channels. The payments are the means through which Disney is
compensated for allowing the cable system to carry the network's
broadcast stations. Disney had asked for carriage for new cable
channels as well as a sizeable subscriber fee for its existing
Disney Chanel, which the company wants to shift from a premium
cable channel to a basic cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives have maintained Disney made new demands
after America On Line announced its plan to merge with Time Warner.
Disney executives concede the proposed merger changed the landscape
of the media world so much that it caused them to reconsider the
terms they had previously been leaning toward agreeing to.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner said Disney's new demands would have pushed the
costs to Time Warner up beyond the December agreement about $300
million over 10 years. Time Warner executives said they would have
had no choice but to pass on the costs to their customers raising
monthly cable bills by $1.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Matson, the senior vice president of communications for
ABC, called the speculative $1 increase ``another bogus Time Warner
figure.'' Iger had previously called the $300 million figure
preposterous and Tuesday he said the companies were actually not
very far apart financially.

ADVICE IN VEEP RACE: WALK, DON'T RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., N.H., Texas, N.Y., N.J., Mich, Mass.)   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ It was not the spectacular golf course on
a cove overlooking the Pacific Ocean that led Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania to fly here the other day to address a group of
Republicans (though he did squeeze in a round before his speech).
It was the chance to do something that a politician rarely does:
praise another politician more than himself. The object of his
affection was Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, cut short a visit to
India for meetings on nuclear proliferation last October so he
could be in New Hampshire to toss questions at Vice President Al
Gore in preparation for his first debate with Bill Bradley. After
only 28 hours in India, Richardson rushed to London and then flew
to Boston, where a waiting Gore aide drove him frantically to
Hanover, N.H., just in time to catch the vice president in the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the presidential jockeying, a second
competition is well under way, for the spot as No. 2. Dozens of
governors, senators, House members, Cabinet secretaries, business
executives, retired politicians and maybe even a general are
maneuvering behind the scenes to get added to the candidates'
purported (and perhaps mythical) short lists.
</P>
<P>
   They are also seeking to score points with Bush and Gore:
stumping for them around the country, dispensing unsolicited
political and policy tips, and seizing every opportunity to say
flattering things about their party's standard bearer. Mindful that
they not appear unseemly, the one thing they dare not do is utter
two words directly to the candidate: running mate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for many, the watchwords are deftness and subtly.If you
are caught looking like you are actually campaigning, you may lose.
</P>
<P>
   Jack F. Kemp, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 1996
who did not lobby for the job, and, if anything, discouraged Bob
Dole from picking him, cautioned those who want to be considered:
``Keep your mouth shut, your head down _ and don't act like you
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   One big name politician in Washington who is frequently
mentioned as a possible vice presidential contender was eager in an
interview to make the case to a reporter for why he would be a
fabulous choice. But he insisted that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be quoted,'' he said conspiratorially. ``That
would be a good way to get off the list.'' Boasting about his
selling points, he said of the candidate, ``I won't say that I'm
one of his good buddies but I know him as well as anybody outside
his close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Another politician, a U.S. senator from a battleground state,
was happy to offer reasons why the politician quoted in the
previous paragraph would not be such a fabulous choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he brings anything to the campaign,'' he said.
Then he offered himself as a possibility, saying, ``I'm a tough
campaigner.'' Excusing himself for speaking anonymously, he said,
``It's important not to look too anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore and Bush camps have only begun their painstaking hunts
for just the right running mate _ and to resolve perhaps the one
lingering mystery in the presidential sweepstakes before the
national conventions in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman, has been
making the rounds, informing some politicians _ even some that
others on the campaign said they did not consider hot prospects _
that they were in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Coelho,'' said one politician. ``He told me I
would be considered. I said `thanks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho declined to discuss such conversations, and, in an
interview, would not even confirm that they were taking place. But
he chuckled at the attention he is getting from politicians who are
quietly trying to win him over.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if people were undermining their chances by being too
overt, he said: ``I don't think it hurts one way or another. It
identifies personalities _ and that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state, is running
the vice presidential selection process for Gore. The vice
president turned to him because Christopher had the same job in
1992, when he helped Bill Clinton settle on Gore, then a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, has picked Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and
White House chief of staff who served under his father, to conduct
his search.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both campaigns said they would be looking for
contenders who could plausibly _ and admirably _ serve as
president, but also who would complement the strengths or
weaknesses of the nominee and add some zip to the ticket. Despite
the coming months of floating names and speculation about who is on
which list, the campaign officials said the decisions were not
likely to be made until just before the national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Republican convention is first, Gore's choice may be
in direct reaction to Bush's. For example, Gore advisers said that
if Bush picked a woman, they might feel pressure to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Coelho said that because he and Gore knew most of the
contenders pretty well, one of the most important duties of
Christopher was to oversee their background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vetting process becomes important _ that will eliminate
some people,'' he said. ``That's what Warren does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even if they do not get picked, politicians say it burnishes
their image just to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said that when a few of his friends
in Congress and in labor unions asked him if they could float his
name, ``I didn't dissuade them; it's an honor.'' Asked if an
appearance on Geraldo was useful in getting his name mentioned, he
said, ``Absolutely.'' At the very least, Menendez said, he would
get the opportunity to press a favorite cause: ``Why Hispanic
Americans should be voting Democratic in this election.'' Some
possible contenders are being pushed into the limelight by people
far removed from the actual selection process. Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., his party's whip, said he publicly cited Menendez and
Richardson because ``they are both really qualified and fine people
and deserve to be very seriously considered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bonior also acknowledged that he thought it was important,
at the very least, for House members to get some attention. ``We
want our leaders considered for different positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several contenders said their model of what not to do was Gov.
John M. Engler of Michigan, who was viewed by many Republicans as
an unabashed self-promoter for the job four years ago, with
constant visits to Washington. Even so, while Engler did not get
picked, one strategist for Dole at the time said the nominee was
flattered by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats say that Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts has
been one of the most obvious practitioners of the
subtle-but-aggressive approach. He traveled to early primary states
to campaign for Gore and, the Gore campaign has noticed, has
delivered speeches on national policy that help raise his profile.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, advisers to Elizabeth Dole made no
secret of her desire to help Bush _ and get her name out. After
ending her own bid for the Republican nomination, she frequently
stumped for Bush in early primary states. And she has the added
benefit that her husband, Bob Dole, trumpets her availability while
she plays coy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ridge is cited by many Republicans for most adroitly
positioning himself. ``He has the keenest political eye to what you
may have to do to be considered,'' said Chris Hennick, a former
executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge is an obvious contender because he comes from a
battleground state, has a compelling biography as a Vietnam veteran
and is versed in national issues from his days in Congress. Most of
all, he gets along well with Bush. To many Republicans, his biggest
drawback is that he favors abortion rights, but that position could
help Bush appeal to independents and other swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge helped himself by successfully pushing for the Republican
National Convention to be held in Philadelphia. So he has a
legitimate explanation for traveling the country meeting with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance here before the Lincoln Club of Northern
California, a group of moderate Republicans, Ridge, brimming with
praise for Bush, spoke of the governor's ``candor, his
mischievousness humor, his directness, his decision-making
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's ``compassionate conservative message makes a lot
of sense.'' He defended Bush's controversial proposal to cut taxes
by nearly half a trillion dollars, saying, ``I don't think Gov.
Bush should abandon his plan to cut taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Ridge insisted in an interview that he had been
careful not to campaign to be picked as Bush's running mate. ``I
don't think it's his style,'' Ridge said of Bush. ``I don't think
it's appropriate. It's certainly not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ridge's behavior has seemed strikingly similar to that
of another Republican who was sleeping down the hall from Ridge at
the lodge in Pebble Beach: Dan Quayle. But he was here to play
golf, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this passage from Quayle's book: ``The vice presidency
isn't an office you can campaign for,'' he said. ``But I had tried,
as subtly as I could, to make clear I was both qualified and
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Ridge knock on the former vice president's door for advice?
He laughed and said he did not even know Quayle was staying here.

MAYFIELD, TEAM DEALT PENALTIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Penske-Kranefuss Racing was slapped with the second-largest fine
in NASCAR Winston Cup Series history yesterday after officials
determined a team member dumped an illegal fuel additive into
Jeremy Mayfield's gas tank during the DieHard 500.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief operating
officer, said team owner Michael Kranefuss was fined $50,000 for
the infraction, which occurred during Mayfield's last fuel stop at
the Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Peter Sospenzo, who under NASCAR rules is accountable
for the actions of his crew, was suspended by the sanctioning body
for four races through June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who started the race from the pole and finished 14th,
was docked 151 points _ the 126 he earned on-track and an
additional 25 points. Winner of the NAPA Auto Parts 500 at the
California Speedway on Sunday, the points penalty dropped Mayfield
from seventh to 14th after the season's 10th race. Kranefuss also
was docked 151 owners' points.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said a ``foreign substance'' that allowed additional
oxygen to be introduced into the fuel mixture was discovered during
a postrace sampling. All Winston Cup cars use racing gasoline
provided by Unocal. Helton said NASCAR sent samples to outside
laboratories for additional tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The additive was ... a performance-enhancer,'' Helton said
during a teleconference. ``It came down to a single crew member on
the car who added the fuel to the dump cans before the last fuel
stop. He takes full responsibility for doing it without knowledge
of the driver or car owner or crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're convinced neither Michael nor Jeremy knew what happened
at Talladega by the crew member.''
</P>
<P>
   The crewman in question has not been identified by either NASCAR
or Penske-Kranefuss officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all embarrassed, and we're all going to make sure
nothing like this happens again,'' said Mayfield, driver of the No.
12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Kranefuss, a Cup team owner since 1995, apologized for what he
termed ``some grave errors in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we accept the penalty,'' said Kranefuss, the
former director of Ford Motor Company's worldwide racing. ``We have
taken disciplinary action within our team, and we apologize to our
fans, our sponsors, NASCAR and the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, former championship-winning crew chief for Jeff
Gordon, was fined a NASCAR-record $60,000 for running unapproved
suspension parts at Concord, N.C., in May 1995.

MCKNIGHT MAKING SURE COWBOYS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ James McKnight has shown this week at the Cowboys'
quarterback school that he has a full grasp of the three R's.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, the three R's are receiving, rehabilitating and ...
making sure he was still remembered.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, 6-foot-1 and 198 pounds, never took a snap for the
Cowboys in either a preseason or regular-season game in 1999
because he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
during a noncontact drill during warmups for the Blue and White
Scrimmage at Wichita Falls on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, he underwent major surgery, which came barely
two months after he had joined the Cowboys in a trade (for a
third-round pick) from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do now? That's what I had to ask myself,''
McKnight said. ``Do I crawl into a hole and feel sorry for myself?
Or do I come back and rehab every day with a smile on my face, even
when I'm feeling like I'm in a hole?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an easy choice for me. I'm not the kind of guy who is
going to let his teammates or coaches see him down. Instead, I
decided, I'm going to beat this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, 27, added, ``The way I'm progressing right now, I feel
I can play five or six more years. And that's amazing. I just thank
God.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight has attended all the off-season workouts, even the
unstructured ones in which Troy Aikman and the receivers have met
twice a week to work on getting down their timing. He has impressed
Aikman with his long-striding speed _ something that can get
overlooked on a team with Joey Galloway and Raghib ``Rocket''
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKnight doesn't look like he's lost any speed,'' Aikman said.
``Actually, our team doctors have had tremendous success with ACL
surgeries, probably as much success as any \R team doctors\S in the
league. I can't think of anybody who has had an ACL \Rsurgery\S and
hasn't come back from it here.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight generally stays an hour after most of the players leave
Valley Ranch, icing down his left knee and tending to his shin
splints, which have occurred since he began pushing himself in
practice. Through seven months of rehab, he remains a tireless
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after McKnight left Seattle for Dallas, Galloway
followed in a blockbuster deal in February for two first-round
draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Joey on the phone a lot last year because he had
gone through a similar knee injury at Ohio State,'' McKnight said.
``I kept telling him how much of a family it is here. I told him,
`Joey, I love it out here. I'm not even playing and they make me
feel welcome.' I think that made his decision easier when Galloway
was ready to leave Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers coach Wes Chandler likes McKnight's size,
intelligence and ability to run patterns.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, whose best season in Seattle was in 1997 when he
caught 34 passes for 637 yards, is probably the leading candidate
to become the team's third receiver behind Galloway and Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a spot there,'' McKnight said. ``Remember,
we had a lot of injuries at receiver last year. So, I don't care if
you want to call me the `third' or `fourth' or `second' or `first'
receiver, I just want to have a chance to step up if something
should happen to Joey or Rocket. Just get me on the field. The rest
of it will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like his speed, his work ethic and the way he has
rehabilitated his knee since last year,'' coach Dave Campo said.
``These things are all positives when you're talking about James
McKnight.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight knows that the competition will be stiff once the
Cowboys report to training camp July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best bunch of receivers that we've had in
the 12 years that I've been here,'' Aikman said. ``We always had
Michael \RIrvin\S, an All-Pro wide receiver every year, but we had
never really and truly been able to complement him with that second
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have some legitimate speed receivers who can flat-out
run and make plays. So when you combine Galloway and Rocket with
receivers like McKnight, Jason Tucker, Chris Brazzell and Wane
McGarity, and then the tight ends out there like Jackie Harris and
David LaFleur ... it gives you some real options.''

PRIVILEGE WAIVED IN INQUIRY OVER WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration dropped its intention to
invoke executive privilege on Tuesday in a dispute over a
congressional request for some documents related to missing White
House e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White House on Tuesday turned over seven documents
sought by the House Government Reform Committee, led by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind. Burton's committee is investigating whether the
White House deliberately concealed the missing e-mail messages on
investigations ranging from campaign finance to President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said on Tuesday that the
documents that had been turned over to Burton's committee were
handwritten notes of White House lawyers on discussions they had
had with computer experts about the e-mail messages that were not
produced when they were subpoenaed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although it had provided the committee on Monday with a one-page
list of documents it was declining to turn over, Kennedy said the
White House voluntarily waived any potential privilege claim on
Tuesday ``after hearing back from the committee that they were not
interested in a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Burton's committee was preparing to hold additional
hearings on Wednesday and Thursday about the missing e-mail
messages. On Thursday, the former the White House counsel, Charles
F.C. Ruff, is scheduled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Burton's committee and the Justice Department
are trying to determine whether White House officials suppressed
large numbers of e-mail messages and covered up the existence of a
glitch in the White House computer system that made it impossible
to retrieve some e-mail correspondence. Investigators are also
looking into accusations that White House officials threatened
employees of a nongovernment contractor if they disclosed the
computer problem, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have blamed a ``disconnect'' between their
computer technicians, who diagnosed the e-mail problem in June
1998, and their lawyers, who apparently did not understand that the
glitch might affect pending subpoena requests from Congress, the
independent counsel's office and Judicial Watch, a conservative
legal watchdog group here that has pursued lawsuits against the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, a White House memorandum showed that White
House technicians were asked to delete old e-mail messages that had
been sent to Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide, before early
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The request to delete the e-mail messages ``is still being
mulled by senior management and OA (Office of Administration)
Counsel,'' wrote Daniel A. Barry, a computer specialist at the
executive office of the president, in a Jan. 6, 1999 memorandum to
his superiors. It was not known whether White House officials
permitted Blumenthal's e-mail messages to be erased from the White
House computers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the request to delete the e-mail messages sent to
Blumenthal, Congress was preparing for Clinton's impeachment trial,
which began on Jan. 14, 1999, and concluded on Feb. 12, 1999, when
the Senate voted to acquit Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said: ``I have no reason to believe that that relates in
any way to the e-mail issue that the committee is investigating. It
appears that this is related to a computer space concern because we
are often encouraging employees to delete unnecessary e-mails so
the system does not get clogged.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who was traveling in Berlin on Tuesday, declined to
comment on the matter.

GORE VOWS TO `INTENSIFY BATTLE' AGAINST CRIME, DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eager to steal a traditional Republican theme,
Democratic presidential contender Al Gore on Tuesday pledged to be
the ``law enforcement president'' by cracking down on drug use in
prisons, hiring more police, and giving off-duty officers the right
to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will intensify the battle against crime, drugs and disorder
in our communities,'' Gore said &QL; 
at the Virginia Highlands YWCA. He slammed Republican presidential
contender George W. Bush, claiming the Texas governor had slashed
drug-rehabilitation funds for Texas prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the proposals in the law-and-order speech were not
new, Gore fleshed out his previous plans by including a plan to
give states federal funds to provide mandatory drug testing for
prisoners, parolees and probationers.
</P>
<P>
   The program would require twice-weekly testing for probationers
and parolees, who would face increasing sanctions, including a
return to prison, for failure to remain drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should make prisoners a simple deal,'' he said.
``Before you get out of jail, you have to get off drugs. You have
to be clean and drug-free. And if you want to stay out, you better
stay clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said that although federal prisons require mandatory
drug testing, not all state and local criminal justice facilities
do. They said the cost of the program would be $500 million in the
first year, which would be in addition to the $1.3 billion
criminal-justice package Gore unveiled last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign fired back that Gore's tough talk on drugs was
undermined by the Clinton-Gore administration's record on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Al Gore uses this opportunity to explain why during
his term teen drug use in America nearly doubled, the number of
drug-treatment beds in federal prisons were cut by a third, the
office of National Drug Control Policy was cut by 83 percent and
federal gun prosecutions have decreased by 46 percent,'' said Bush
spokesman Dan Bartlett. ``If Al Gore is willing to attack Texas,
where violent crime is at a 20-year low and the largest
drug-treatment program in the country is located, we're also
expecting attack on Texans for defending the Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his overall crime plan, the vice president has
proposed funding for the hiring of 50,000 new police officers, on
top of the 100,000 new officers approved by Congress at the request
of the Clinton administration. About 60 percent of those officers
are already on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who has hammered Bush for supporting a
concealed-weapons law in Texas, said he would back legislation
giving off-duty and retired state and local police officers the
right to carry such arms.
</P>
<P>
   Such concealed-weapons legislation, his campaign said, would
give local and state police the same rights to carry concealed
weapons as federal law enforcement officials already have.
</P>
<P>
   The crime-and-drug speech was part of a series of addresses in
which Gore has sought to differentiate between himself and Bush on
a range of issues including the economy, education, foreign police,
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published Tuesday, voters ranked
crime among their top issues, behind only education and health
care. Overall, the poll found Bush edging Gore 49 percent to 44
percent, a slight improvement for the vice president, who trailed
by 9 percentage points three weeks ago. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As in his previous addresses, Gore sought to portray himself as
a centrist Democrat in the mold of President Clinton, who abandoned
some of the more liberal party positions that alienated many voters
in the 1970s and 1980s.

BOYS TOLD FRIENDS, BUT SUICIDE PLAN WENT UNREPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HADDAM, Conn. _ In the hours before they killed themselves
in a fiery car crash in Monday's predawn darkness, Michael
Dombrowski and Jeffrey Barton, two eighth-grade pals who were liked
by many and understood by few, called their friends on a cell phone
to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons that police investigators and school
administrators are still trying to fathom, none of the teen-agers
who received the calls reported them to the police or the boys'
parents, though Michael had been making increasingly overt suicide
threats in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised a lot of people he wouldn't do it,'' said a
14-year-old girl whom Michael and Jeff called before they died.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with several friends on the cell phone, the boys
apparently drove an old Ford Bronco owned by Michael's father down
winding Route 151, past their school, and aimed the speeding sport
utility vehicle at a thick Norwegian spruce tree towering in front
of the First Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same tree where Michael's older brother, Daniel, was
killed six months earlier in a car accident along with another
17-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known exactly when Michael's and Jeff's car struck the
tree. When the first state trooper arrived at the scene, at 3:23
a.m. on Monday, the Bronco was engulfed in flames so intense that
state investigators needed dental records to identify the bodies of
both boys Tuesday. Michael was 13 and Jeffrey was 15, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state police are investigating whether the boys used an
accelerant to make the car explode upon impact, said state police
Sgt. J. Paul Vance. The police are also investigating the phone
calls between the two boys and their friends, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Michael had grown alarmingly despondent over
his brother's death, friends said Tuesday. He had told his friends
for weeks that he would kill himself, then backed away from the
threats, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff had moved here a year ago and had a longer history of
emotional problems, school counselors said. He and Michael had
begun to hang around together about six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, workers cut down the spruce tree, after church
officials expressed concern that its presence would induce other
young people to commit copycat suicides. For now, the residents of
this rural town along the Connecticut River are trying to figure
out why, given the warnings, no one stopped the two boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't they say anything?'' said Eva Bunnell, who lives
across the street from the 6-inch stump where the spruce stood.
``If the kids made as many calls as people are saying, that almost
sounds like a cry for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell said her 16-year-old son knew Michael and Jeff, and her
13-year-old niece, Nicky, had been particularly good friends with
Michael, whom she described as an outgoing, playful and _ at least
outwardly _ well-adjusted boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did real kids' stuff together,'' Bunnell said. ``They'd
paint their feet and walk over the pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   She, like many other town residents interviewed Tuesday _ many
of whom declined to give their names _ knew Michael, a lifelong
resident of East Haddam, and was aware of the torment that had
haunted him since his brother died in November.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's emotional pain was more mysterious and entrenched, school
officials said. Both boys had been referred to professional
therapists by counselors at Nathan Hale-Ray Middle School, said
Cynthia Russo, a counselor there.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Mawson, 29, who stood outside her home near the middle
school Tuesday talking with four of its students, said Michael and
Jeff had been on the phone with one female friend of theirs as the
two boys barreled toward the spruce tree. ``They were on the phone
when they hit the tree,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first call Michael made in the hours before the crash was to
a 14-year-old classmate who spoke Tuesday on the condition that her
name not be printed. ``I picked up the phone and he's, like,
`Goodbye,''' the girl said Tuesday, standing among several friends.
``I said, `Where are you going?' and he said, `I love you.' And
then he hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not alert the police, she said, because Michael had made
her promise not to tell anyone.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other friends were quoted in The Hartford Courant on Tuesday as
saying that they tried to call the boys back, but could not get
through.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Durham, the superintendent of the East Haddam School
District, said he did not know ``why youngsters weren't more vocal
about what their friends were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the boys' suicide had left the town stunned, especially
after the November accident that killed Michael's brother and
another boy, Hunter Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four young people in six months is more than a community
should have to deal with,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. David Shaffer, a psychiatry and pediatrics professor at
Columbia University, said dramatic suicides of this type, performed
at the site where a loved one died or on the anniversary of such a
death, are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they told so many people and that they chose
that location and converted it into a kind of symbolic event,
clearly shows they were trying to make a statement of some kind,''
said Shaffer, who is president of the American Foundation of
Suicide Prevention. ``They didn't want their suicide to go
unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that they way the boys killed themselves seemed to
indicate that they had made up their minds. ``I don't think there's
much the other kids could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, he said, the two boys are part of a growing
demographic of youths who kill themselves. Suicides among children
10 to 14 years old increased by 109 percent between 1980 and 1997,
he said. For young people between the ages of 15 and 24, suicide is
the third-leading cause of death, behind unintentional injury and
homicide. Most are a result of mental illness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither boy's family could be reached for comment Tuesday.

 &HT;    Road beckons rudely to Rocker
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Braves have talked about potential
distractions because of the John Rocker situation, they mainly
referred to media attention and their trip to Shea Stadium in June.
</P>
<P>
   But as they learned Monday night, distractions can take many
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was greeted not only with the usual boos as he sprinted
onto the field in Dodger Stadium. Fans threw objects onto the
field, the public address announcer threatened arrests, fans were
getting rowdy, and one vocal Braves fan was escorted from the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the mooning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the funniest thing I've ever seen,'' Chipper Jones
told reporters afterward. ``I laughed my butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Players, fans and members of the media might have thought at
first that it was funny to watch the man sprint to the infield
dirt, turn around and drop his trousers to give Rocker a look at
his backside. By the time it settled in that he could have done
much worse, however, it wasn't as funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wakeup call,'' Chipper Jones said. ``We needed to be
prepared for the worst. To be honest, I don't think that will be
the worst we see this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker laughed at the incident. But he seemed to be thrown off
his rhythm on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The game situation was critical, with the Braves on the verge of
their modern-franchise record of 14 consecutive wins. The tying run
was at the plate with two out in the ninth of a 2-0 game. Rocker
gave up his first run of the season, on a single by Kevin Elster,
but pulled himself together to strike out Geronimo Berroa to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is one of the places we really worried
about,'' Kevin Millwood said. ``But John's a big enough man to
handle it. It takes a pretty big coward to throw something from the
stands at a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox said afterward that he hoped the ninth inning
would be as bad as it got. And this is Los Angeles, supposedly a
mellow baseball town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a little excessive,'' said Jones, who was
nearly hit by what appeared to be a paint pellet. ``I don't have a
problem with people voicing their opinion, yelling and booing, but
I do when it comes to putting people in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. was much more eventful than San Diego. One fan there was
ejected for throwing an object onto the field, but the games had no
other serious incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has been traveling with a security guard, who works for
Major League Baseball security, out of Atlanta. The guard has been
with Rocker off the field and at the ballpark, and he even has worn
a uniform and sat in the bullpen with him.
</P>
<P>
   But as the fan in L.A. proved Monday, once Rocker enters games,
security can't do everything.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Rocker still had a grin on his face as he walked past
reporters to say, ``Sorry,'' but he wasn't talking. If such fan
behavior continues, however, the situation could get tougher for
Rocker _ a lot of others.
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous behavior was applauded by an L.A. Times columnist
who wrote, ``In virtually every instance in this space, such
displays of trash-throwing and trespassing have been condemned as
dangerous and stupid. But just this once, you done good, Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   That columnist was greeted with at least 50 irate e-mail
responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made his own bed,'' Brian Jordan said of Rocker. ``Now
he's got to live with it.''

WITH CLOCK TICKING, CLINTON TRIES NEW APPROACH ON CHINA TRADE
BILL

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and his top aides, acknowledging that they
lack the votes to pass a decisive China trade measure later this
month, increased pressure on Congress on Tuesday by arguing that
the decision is as much about global leadership and the fate of
Chinese reformers as it is about the interest of American business.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on national security issues reflected a growing
feeling within the administration that the economic arguments in
favor of elevating trade ties with China, while strong, have proven
insufficient for wavering lawmakers. Labor unions have subjected
these lawmakers to an intensive campaign, as have other groups
opposed to granting China permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not,'' President Clinton told a group of independent insurance
agents meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote, National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger visited New York and gave a detailed
examination of the security issues at stake in the trade bill,
calling it the most important chance the United States has had in a
generation to shape China's future. He said a rejection would
threaten to set off a ``downward spiral'' in bilateral ties that he
likened, without using the exact words, to a second Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rejecting permanent normal trade relations would be the worst
possible blow to the best possible hope we have had in 30 years to
encourage positive change in China,'' Berger said during a lengthy
address at Columbia University. If the two sides start thinking of
each other as adversaries, he said, ``we will find ourselves
confronting each other across Asia and across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning comes as the Clinton administration begins a final
push to persuade undecided members of Congress to vote in favor of
granting China the new trade status, which would allow United
States companies to benefit fully from a market-opening trade
agreement that paves the way for China to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that President Clinton has
allotted a large block of his own schedule in coming weeks for
lobbying members of Congress to sacrifice their annual review of
China's trading rights and to treat that nation as it does most
other members of the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional supporters estimate
that they are still about 10 votes shy of the 218 votes needed for
majority approval in the House. Clinton and five members of his
cabinet have focused their lobbying efforts on about 30 lawmakers,
most of them Democrats, who they say will make the difference
between a narrow victory or defeat. Approval by the Senate appears
more certain.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, opposing sides both claimed that the momentum
was shifting their way after the two-week House recess. But there
were signs that both sides were nervous about the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican heading the House Ways
and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the China trade
bill, warned business leaders that the outcome remained in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned about getting a majority of votes today
than I was four weeks ago,'' Archer said. ``Failure to pass this
would create an unworkable trade environment that will slop over to
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In a boost for backers of the bill, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who
has opposed granting China trade privileges in the annual votes,
said on Tuesday that he would support permanent normal trading
status. Another Democrat who had been uncommitted, Lois Capps of
California, also declared her support.
</P>
<P>
   Over the recess, two supporters of the annual vote said they
would vote against the bill, Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., and Rep,
Bill Luther, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The president is planning a visit to a farm community to discuss
how the trade agreement might benefit farmers, perhaps by allowing
them to export more grain and meat. White House officials are also
considering inviting former presidents and cabinet secretaries to
the White House to highlight the fact that a bipartisan coalition
of former national leaders favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invited a dozen members of Congress to join him at the
White House on Tuesday night for a discussion on China, and
arranged for Martin Lee, a prominent Hong Kong opposition leader
who favors granting China the new trade privileges, to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But the president has so far declined to accede to Republican
demands that he arrange a prime-time nationwide television address
on China, a step Republican supporters of the trade measure argue
is necessary. Administration officials said privately that the
president does not wish to commit to such a speech unless the
national networks agree to put it on the air, a tough sell during
sweeps month, when the networks compete fiercely to attract the
biggest viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to granting China elevated trading rights is dogged.
Labor unions have argued that the trade agreement will encourage
United States companies to shift production to China, where, union
officials say, low wages and lax labor standards make for unfair
competition. About two-thirds of House Democrats are expected to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious, consumer and environmental groups have also
lobbied against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans, reflecting overwhelming business support, say
they will vote yes. But a minority of hard-liners in the party
accuse the Clinton administration of appeasing Beijing even as they
say the nation steps up repression at home and threatens to become
more belligerent abroad.
</P>
<P>
   China is likely to join the World Trade Organization, a
regulatory body based in Geneva, even if Congress decides not to
grant permanent normal trade relations. But United States companies
would not get many of the benefits unless Congress agrees to give
up its annual vote.

   Berger said that the agreement is so beneficial to U.S.
companies that want to do business in China _ and requires so many
concessions by China's Communist-party controlled bureaucracy _
that Beijing would view rejection of permanent normal trade
relations as a seismic shift in United States strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government and people simply will not believe we
rejected it for economic reasons,'' he said. ``They will suspect
that rejection is a strategic decision to pursue a course of
confrontation, contention and containment.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to pass the accord would rebound to the advantage of
numerous hard-liners in Beijing who have opposed China's WTO
concessions all along, Berger said. In such a scenario, he said, he
considers it likely that China, already mired in a high-level
debate about ties with the United States, would turn inward, become
more repressive and adopt a more militant stance toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   He also said rejection would be a slap in the face to America's
Asian allies, especially Japan and South Korea, both of which have
urged Congress to elevate trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the administration and its congressional
supporters need more inducements, Archer, the House Republican,
reversed his earlier position and said he would consider parallel
legislation to the trade bill. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House
majority leader, signaled he might support a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., has proposed creating an executive
body that would have powers to monitor and report on China
compliance with international labor and human rights standards, as
well as it adherence to trade agreements. Levin has said that such
a commission might persuade some Democrats that that would still
have some oversight over China policy even if they voted to
sacrifice their annual review of the nation's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had earlier been cool to the idea. On Tuesday,
Archer said that he would back it if it did not restrict trade and
provided that it would gain more congressional supporters than it
loses.

HALL OF FAME, ANOTHER FIRST FOR JULIE KRONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Calif., Ky.)  (EDS: Budgeted earlier as DERBY-KRONE) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Julie Krone became the first woman elected to
racing's Hall of Fame Tuesday and, reflecting on a career that
generated 3,545 trips to the winner's circle but also adversity on
the race track, said she now realized what she had accomplished
``as a girl in a man's sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old retired jockey was elected along with Neil
Drysdale, the trainer of A.P. Indy, the 1992 Horse of the Year, who
was scratched from the Kentucky Derby with a foot injury on the
morning of the race. But A.P. Indy also won election to the Hall of
Fame for contemporary male horses. Drysdale also trains Fusaichi
Pegasus, the solid favorite for this year's Derby, which will be
run Saturday at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Krone and Drysdale will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on
Aug. 7 at Saratoga along with A.P. Indy and two other horses:
Winning Colors, who in 1988 became the third filly to win the
Kentucky Derby, and Needles, who won the 1956 Derby and Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, born in England and based in California, sounded a
theme repeated by Krone when he said: ``I feel honored and
humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   But Krone tried to put her pioneering role into perspective,
saying: ``While you're doing your job, there is no gender factor.
Now that I'm retired, though, I'll read about the great horses and
think, `Wow, I rode them.' Adversity doesn't exist while you're
doing it. But now, I step back and still have no idea how I did all
those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``First woman in the Hall of Fame? Yeah, wow. I don't even have
to say it. I'm the first girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone became the most successful female rider in racing history
in a career that lasted 19 seasons before she retired last year.
She won 17 per cent of her races, including 119 stakes, and was the
only female jockey to win a Triple Crown race: the Belmont Stakes
in 1993 aboard Colonial Affair. She sustained several injuries when
her mounts fell, but left racing chiefly to care for her mother,
who died last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mom brought me to Churchill Downs when I was 15,'' she
related, wiping tears from her face. ``I remember her saying,
`Let's start your career as a jockey.' She had to add a year to my
age to get me into the track. I know that I learned how to overcome
adversity from her and her relentless spirit. My Mom taught me, if
the door is closed, there's always a window.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone, a 4-foot-11-inch sprite, now does racing commentary on
television ``in my squeaky voice,'' and still rides her pet jumping
horse, Peter Rabbit, but has no intention of making a comeback. She
won the jockeys' election over Earlie Fires and the late Jack
Westrope in voting conducted among 100 racing writers.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, a trainer for the last 26 years, has won 100 stakes,
including five Breeders' Cup races, and has trained five champions.
Through last year, he won 919 races from 4,595 starts and earned
purses worth $50 million. He outpolled Richard Mandella and Willard
Proctor in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've just won a race by a nose,'' he said. ``It's
not something that, when you start out as a trainer, you even think
about. I know that Wayne Lukas was elected to the Hall of Fame last
year and then won the Kentucky Derby a few days later. I hope
history repeats itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He also paid tribute to A.P. Indy, a son of Seattle Slew and
grandson of Secretariat, who was bought as a yearling for $2.9
million and then raced for Tomonori Tsuramaki of Tokyo. He won 8
times in 11 starts, capturing the Hollywood Futurity, Santa Anita
Derby and Peter Pan. After being scratched from the Kentucky Derby,
he was restored to health by Drysdale and won the Belmont Stakes
and the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   In the voting, he ran against Precisionist and Unbridled.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.P. Indy was a remarkable talent,'' Drysdale said. ``And I'm
happy that he's into his second career as a stallion.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning Colors, who won the voting among contemporary female
horses, withstood a challenge from Forty Niner to win the 1988
Kentucky Derby. She had also won the Santa Anita Derby and ran
third in the Preakness. She was raced by the late Gene Klein,
running 19 times with 8 victories and $1.5 million in earnings. She
outscored Mom's Command and Flawlessly in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Needles won the Sapling Stakes and the Hopeful at age 2 in 1955,
and the Flamingo, Florida Derby and Kentucky Derby at 3. He lost
the Preakness to Fabius, but rebounded to win the Belmont and was
named 3-year-old champion. He was owned by Jack Dudley and Bonnie
Heath, he sired 21 stakes winners and he lived to the age of 31.
</P>
<P>
   He won his Hall of Fame election over Bowl of Flowers and Cougar
II.

WOMEN PLAYING MORE, BUT COACHING LESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the average number of women's collegiate teams per school
is at a high, the percentage of women coaching them is the lowest
ever, a study of intercollegiate athletics released on Monday said.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-year period of 1999-2000, 205 new women's teams were
added, creating an average of 8.14 per school. In 1972, the number
was approximately two per school.
</P>
<P>
   The increase can be attributed to Title IX of the 1972
Educational Amendments, which prohibits sex discrimination at
institutions that receive federal funds. So, too, is the decrease
in female coaches, say R. Vivian Acosta and Linda Jean Carpenter,
the authors of the study.
</P>
<P>
   When Title IX was enacted, more than 90 percent of women's teams
were coached by women. Currently, 45.6 percent of the coaches of
women's teams are females, down from 47.4 in 1998. By 2000, there
were 7,771 head coaching jobs for women's teams, an increase of 534
from 1998. Yet, of the 534 new jobs in the last two years, women
have been hired in only 107.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is reflective of a generation expanding its
wings in athletics because its members grew up as beneficiaries of
Title IX,'' said Carpenter. ``On the other side of the coin, women
have a bigger menu of job choices than they had before Title IX and
so now, both on the college and professional levels, are taking
advantage of the opportunities there.''
</P>
<P>
   Acosta and Carpenter, both retired professors of physical
education at Brooklyn College, began studying the impact of Title
IX on women's collegiate athletics 23 years ago. An update of the
study, which is issued every two years, is based on questionnaires
sent to 1,000 schools in 1997-98. It has a 75 percent response
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the same five sports _ basketball,
volleyball, tennis, cross country, and softball _ continue to be
most popular among female athletes. But soccer has shown the
greatest growth of any sport in the last 23 years and is now
offered on 84 percent of college campuses. Lacrosse and golf have
grown exponentially in the past decade; gymnastics has declined
among women's programs and is being dropped by some men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found a percentage decline in female athletic
directors and administrators. In 1972, more than 90 percent of
women's programs were directed by a female head administrator.
Today, 17.8 percent of women's programs are directed by a female, a
decrease of 19.4 percent from 1998, and 23 percent of women's
athletic programs have no females anywhere in the athletic
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Of the study's many findings, Carpenter said she was most struck
by how the face of women's athletics has changed over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, there used to be more junior varsity teams
and much broader variety of sports offered; that's been
narrowing,'' said Carpenter, speaking by telephone from her home in
West Brookfield, Mass. She also noted that the sports with
sustained growth are the ``sweaty, grunty and aggressive sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells me that there is a sense of self-confidence among
women today,'' she said. ``They can participate in sports that
bring them joy and society doesn't insist that they can't show
aggressiveness or assertiveness.''  &QL;

CRACKED EASTERN SEABED MAY CAUSE HUGE WAVES, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.C.)  By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In waters off Virginia and North Carolina, scientists have found
cracks in the seabed that might set off a tsunami, they say,
sending waves as high as 20 feet speeding toward the mid-Atlantic
states.
</P>
<P>
   Neal W. Driscoll of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute,
Jeffrey K. Weissel of Columbia University and John A. Goff of the
University of Texas said in an article in the May issue of the
journal Geology that the recently discovered cracks could mean the
continental shelf was unstable and could slide down like an
avalanche, inducing the giant waves.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said they discovered the cracks about 60 miles
from shore along a 25-mile section of the continental shelf off the
Virginia and North Carolina coasts. If the seabed there gave way,
they said, the reaction could set off the giant waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a societal perspective, we need to evaluate the degree of
tsunami hazard that might be posed by a major submarine
landslide,'' the scientists wrote. And they plan to find out if the
cracks ``are fossil features or are active and likely to produce a
potentially disastrous, large submarine slide in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are leaving this weekend on a 14-day expedition
to gather more data to assess the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to sensationalize this,'' Driscoll said in an
interview. ``The risk associated with these cracks is finite.
First, we have to determine if they're geologically active, then
whether they're moving on human time sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The long fissures were found 325 to 650 feet beneath the waves
and lie perched close to the edge of the outer continental shelf,
where the seabed becomes gradually deeper and then quickly gives
way to the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Never before, the scientists said, have cracks so large been
seen, although hints of smaller ones have cropped up in undersea
data.
</P>
<P>
   If the danger of the cracks proves real, the scientists said,
coastal areas of North Carolina, southern Virginia and the lower
Chesapeake Bay would be at risk for wave heights similar to the
surge of a category 4 hurricane, which is characterized by top
sustained winds of 131 to 155 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that a tsunami can come with no warning.
</P>
<P>
   Such sudden events are not unknown. In 1929, a submarine
landslide associated with an earthquake on the Grand Banks set off
a tsunami that killed 51 people along the coast of Newfoundland.
The waves from that event were estimated to range in height from 3
to 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Tsunamis are often larger than predicted from the force of
earthquakes alone, suggesting that submarine landslides play an
important role in their generation, the scientists said. In 1998, a
tsunami in Papua New Guinea killed 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists plan to make images of the cracks with sonar
waves, and then take deep samples of the seabed to see if the
cracks are fresh or covered with layers of sediment. The latter
finding would suggest that the cracks were geologically inactive
and a low threat of producing giant waves.

SPANISH TELEPHONE COMPANY IN TALKS TO BUY ROYAL KPN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Illustrating the growing pressure on telecommunication
companies to merge in Europe, Spain's largest telephone operator,
Telefonica SA, is negotiating to acquire the Netherlands' largest
telephone company, Royal KPN, for about 60 billion euros, or $54.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have a market capitalization of 141
billion euros, or $128 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Telefonica and Royal KPN are just the latest round
in an effort by a number of once state-owned monopolies to create
pan-European networks with the scale to compete against the new
breed of telephone behemoths like Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions, according to executives close to the talks, are
in their final stages, though the companies may still decide to
abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement is not expected until at least the end of this week
or early next week, leaving a series of hurdles _ including
surprise bidders _ and enough time to derail a deal. Adding
complexity to the negotiations is a third possible partner, NTT
DoCoMo Inc., Japan's largest mobile phone operator, which has also
been in talks with KPN. Executives close to the talks said those
negotiations could lead to a separate alliance among all three
companies' mobile telephone operations.
</P>
<P>
   While the details are not completed, the executives said, the
deal would be structured as a merger with each side controlling
half of the seats on the board of the combined company. Neither
company is expected to be paid a premium, the executives said.
Based on the stock prices of each company on Tuesday, Telefonica is
worth 83 billion euros while KPN is worth 58 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the talks, if Telefonica and
KPN proceed with the merger, the combined company may also make a
bid for Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest mobile phone operator.
A combination would also help finance coming auctions for
third-generation mobile telephone licenses set to take place
throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors seemed enthusiastic about the possibility
of a merger, bidding up the shares of both companies. Shares of KPN
rose 3.5 euros, or 2.9 percent, to 125, after a 9.6 percent jump on
Monday. Shares of Telefonica increased 2.26 euros, or 9.2 percent,
to 26.74.

PUBLIC RELATIONS BATTLE WAS POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR GAME SHOWS AND SOAP
OPERAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DISNEY-TIMEWARNER) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER with JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Howard Rubenstein, the public relations impresario,
had planned the broad outlines of Walt Disney Co.'s public
relations strategy well before Time Warner Cable pulled the plug on
the Disney-owned ABC network at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So when the channels carrying ABC programming faded to blue,
except for the yellow letters that declared ``Disney has Taken ABC
Away From You,'' Rubenstein and his clients were ready with their
campaign to portray Time Warner as a rapacious monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing 36-hour all-fronts assault involved radio and
newspaper advertisements, in-person meetings between Preston Padden
_ Disney's chief lobbyist _ with media executives and an
early-morning call Tuesday from the Disney president, Robert Iger,
to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, when the 39-hour blackout of ABC
programming ended, the images of both media giants had been
muddied, but Disney appeared to have left a clearer message behind.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Dressler, the senior vice president for programming at Time
Warner Cable, said in an interview Tuesday that Disney hoped to use
the ABC blackout to make it appear that Time Warner was abusing its
power and to raise questions about the pending merger with America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were setting us up, that's the whole point,'' Dressler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dressler acknowledged that by removing ABC from its systems,
Time Warner gave Disney ammunition in its attempts to paint Time
Warner as an unyielding monopoly. Still, he said, Time Warner had
no choice but to do what it did. ``At some point, you have to put
your foot down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein said Tuesday that over the weekend, an ABC executive
``called me at home and said she thought Time Warner was going to
yank ABC off the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we started talking about our strategic plan,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney's appeals to the public began well before last week.
Two months ago, in the Houston area, Disney's ABC affiliate,
KTRK-TV, began trying to capture the hearts and minds of
Time-Warner's customers, and entice them to buy satellite dishes
and discard their cable company. The lure was a $99 rebate,
courtesy of the station.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, coming at a time when the station was broadcasting
constant warnings that its signal might disappear from the sets of
Time-Warner subscribers, led to a war of full-page advertisements
in The Houston Chronicle, with the ABC affiliate casting Time
Warner as the villain and Time Warner offering $99 worth of free
pay-per-view films to counter the ABC initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the two companies ran competing advertisements again,
with the ABC affiliate's beginning, ``When Time Warner illegally
dropped ABC 13, they violated your trust as a viewer.'' It
continued: ``They want to retaliate against ABC for raising
questions about their stranglehold over your television, cable and
Internet access. Only an arrogant monopolist would drop its most
popular channel to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's full-page ad, four pages further into the front
section of the newspaper, was more narrowly focused on the
satellite-dish rebate. It was headlined, ``Do the math before you
do the dish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina also was a
battleground. Anders Gyllenhaal, the executive editor of The News
and Observer in Charlotte, said Tuesday: ``ABC and Disney have done
a better job of formulating a message. They have said: this is a
view of the future when the communications roadways are controlled
by a few large companies. Time Warner has not been as vocal in this
market with their side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable, said in an
interview Tuesday that they considered public relations a
sidelight, marginally relevant to the main objective of concluding
its deal with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to get the deal done,'' he said. ``This was
never fundamentally a public relations battle. Like any difficult
deal it had a public relations component to it. And certainly how
well you do on the public relations front has an impact on the
outcome, but its not going to dictate the outcome. Under the
circumstances we were placed in, I would have expected things to
come out pretty much the way they did _ a wash.''
</P>
<P>
   Gyllenhaal said that interviews in his area found little
sympathy for either company. ``Most folks see this as a battle of
titans where the little folks are getting a raw deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Editorial boards in other areas began to weigh in Tuesday. The
New York Times editorial board, which met Monday with Padden in a
meeting planned the week before, and discussed the issue with Time
Warner spokesmen, published an editorial that said the threat to
Disney by a combined AOL and Time Warner was real. The Times and
ABC News are experimenting with jointly producing a daily Webcast
on politics and feature segments for ``20/20'' and ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Padden also met with the editorial board of The Orange County
Register in California. The Register planned to publish an
editorial Wednesday. The public thought it was a plague on both
companies, said Schumer, who talked with both Iger and Time
Warner's chief executive, Gerald Levin, Tuesday. ``People didn't
care about the internal machinations. They just wanted their TV,''
he said. &QL;

METALLICA TO TRY TO PREVENT FANS FROM DOWNLOADING RECORDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL and NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has
brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which
say copyrighted songs are being pirated. Wednesday the dispute is
expected to take a significant turn that will pit musicians
directly against their fans.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans
from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over
the Internet. A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by
their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available
for others to copy.
</P>
<P>
   Napster officials said Tuesday that under the law they would be
obliged to bar anyone shown to have infringed copyright from using
the service, though it was not clear what might prevent such users
from reregistering.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the move is a potential blow to the explosively
popular but embattled Napster, which was created last year and
already faces several lawsuits. The Metallica lawyer said that if
the tactic succeeded, he would encourage similar moves by other
musicians, thus potentially depriving Napster of thousands of
users.
</P>
<P>
   And with the musicians moving directly into the fray, the
dispute is no longer between faceless record labels and Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Already, tempers are flaring, with fans of Metallica, one of the
most popular heavy metal bands of the last two decades, asserting
the move may cause them to abandon a band they have followed with
dogged loyalty. ``There are going to be Metallica CD burnings if
they try this,'' said Rob Jones, founder of KNAC.com, a Web site
catering to heavy-metal fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Metallica sees the issue very differently, said its lawyer,
Howard King. He said Metallica spent millions of dollars to create
and market an album and did not want to have the music traded
freely online, depriving the band of the fruits of its investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The band would like to sell some albums,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``it is a lousy position to be in'' for Metallica
to be at odds with its fans. But he said that Napster has put
Metallica in the position and forced the band to ``take a stand.''
That stand entailed hiring a company to visit Napster to compile a
log of the online handles of Napster users who say they have
Metallica music to offer.
</P>
<P>
   King said he planned to hand over the list of names to Napster,
which is based in San Mateo, Calif., in a collection of documents
filling 30 cardboard boxes. His plans were reported Tuesday by
Cnet.com, an Internet news site.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users who download the Napster software can then use
the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers. By so
doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in
effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen
to or download music.
</P>
<P>
   Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy
because the music is not kept on the company's computers. Further,
they say their users must comply with copyright law. Elizabeth
Brooks, vice president for marketing at Napster, said the company
would expel users found to be ``legitimate infringers'' of
copyright.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company was obliged to take the step under the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which stipulates that an
online service is liable for copyright infringement if it is warned
that a user is infringing a copyright and fails to act.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the 335,000 fans represented less than 10 percent of
Napster's ``several million'' users. She declined to say how much
music is available for trading through the service.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued
Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged
primarily by the music companies' trade group, the Recording
Industry Association of America. On another front in the digital
music struggle, the industry won at least an initial victory last
week when a federal judge ruled that another online music database,
MP3.com, had violated copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Burnstein, one of Metallica's managers, said the band
decided it needed to join the fight to make it clear that the
dispute is not just about the interests of the record companies,
but about the bands themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the RIAA sued, they did it in a legalistic manner
that didn't bring a lot of coverage,'' he said. ``We though this
would bring the issue out more if we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be
particularly striking, since the band's initial popularity in the
early 1980s grew in part from a cassette demo tape, ``No Life Til
Leather,'' that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to
bootleg. It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes
in rock.
</P>
<P>
   Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free
then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its
current CDs. It now records for Elektra Records, a division of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing
the bands money by sharing music online. Rather, he said, those who
have routinely copied music for each other on cassette tapes, or
made illegal bootleg recordings at concerts, are merely taking the
practice to a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   He said Metallica had lost touch with its fans. ``They're the
No. 1 fan of George Washington,'' he said, referring to the the $1
bill. ``They're just being the man,'' he said.

   (NYT22) NEW YORK -- May 2, 2000 -- CHINA-U.S.-TRADE -- Just
three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, Samuel Berger, President
Clinton's National Security Advisor, visited New York's Columbia
University's East Asian Institute on Tuesday and gave a detailed
examination of the security issues at stake in the trade bill,
calling it the most important chance the United States has had to
shape China's future in a generation. President Clinton and his top
aides are arguing that the decision is as much about America's
global leadership and the fate of Chinese reformers as it is about
the economic interest of American business. (Edward Keating/The New

   (NYT21) SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- May 2, 2000 -- WINE BRATS -- Seven
years ago three twentysomething guys got together over beers at a
Sonoma pub to lament the sorry state of wine drinking in America.
The young men, all scions of prominent Sonoma Valley wine families,
were particularly disturbed about the wine-drinking habits of their
own generation. The common wisdom was that members of so-called
Generation X preferred margaritas to merlot and considered wine to
be elitist, boring and passe. The result was the founding of Wine
Brats. The founders, from left, Jeff Buncshu, Mike Sangiacomo and

   (NYT22) NEW YORK -- May 2, 2000 -- CHINA-U.S.-TRADE -- Just
three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, Samuel Berger, President
Clinton's National Security Advisor, visited New York's Columbia
University's East Asian Institute on Tuesday and gave a detailed
examination of the security issues at stake in the trade bill,
calling it the most important chance the United States has had to
shape China's future in a generation. President Clinton and his top
aides are arguing that the decision is as much about America's
global leadership and the fate of Chinese reformers as it is about
the economic interest of American business. (Edward Keating/The New

   (NYT21) SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- May 2, 2000 -- WINE BRATS -- Seven
years ago three twentysomething guys got together over beers at a
Sonoma pub to lament the sorry state of wine drinking in America.
The young men, all scions of prominent Sonoma Valley wine families,
were particularly disturbed about the wine-drinking habits of their
own generation. The common wisdom was that members of so-called
Generation X preferred margaritas to merlot and considered wine to
be elitist, boring and passe. The result was the founding of Wine
Brats. The founders, from left, Jeff Buncshu, Mike Sangiacomo and

BESTFOODS REJECTS $18 BILLION MERGER BID FROM UNILEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unilever PLC, the Dutch-English consumer products giant that
agreed to buy Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade and Slim Fast last month, made
an unsolicited bid on Tuesday to acquire Bestfoods for $18.4
billion in cash. Bestfoods, however, rejected the offer as
``financially inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Unilever dated May 2 rejecting the offer, Charles
R. Shoemate, the chairman and chief executive of Bestfoods, said
that Unilever first approached him on April 20, requesting in
writing that Bestfoods consider a cash offer of $61 to $64 a share.
Bestfoods released the letter late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That offer was to be considered at a Bestfoods board meeting
scheduled for Tuesday. On Monday, Unilever increased its offer to
$66 a share, Shoemate said, ``subject to certain conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to Antony Burgmans and Niall FitzGerald,
Unilever's chairmen, Shoemate called Unilever's interest a
``validation of Bestfoods' global strategy in the consumer foods
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the board had determined the bid was ``not in
the best interests of Bestfoods, its shareholders and other
constituents; and it is not opportune to consider a sale of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer is the second time in less than a year that Bestfoods'
name arose as a possible merger partner in an industry that
analysts say direly needs to consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall it was widely reported that Bestfoods, whose brands
include Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soups, was in talks with
H.J. Heinz. At the time, Bestfoods denied any conversations were in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, recently, Shoemate did not rule out the possibility of
a combination. In the company's 1999 annual report, which was
published in March, Shoemate addressed the topic first by saying he
would prefer to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, if we were to identify a partner with whom we could
truly create even stronger profit growth and enhanced value for our
shareholders, we would certainly be open to the opportunity,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual report was almost an invitation,'' said John M.
McMillin, a food analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Looking at the
success of Kraft/General Foods in North America, it is hard to
argue against the benefits of consolidation. The issue is what is
Bestfoods' worth?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey G. Kanter, who works with McMillin at Prudential, said
that on a cash flow basis the $66-a-share offer represented a
premium of ``about 33 percent'' over the average food industry
multiple. Over the last year investors have been unkind to food
stocks, discarding their predictable cash flows and earnings for
wild rides in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods had revenue of $8.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks have done a bit better recently. On the New York
Stock Exchange on Tuesday, Bestfoods closed at $50.56, down 75
cents a share. The stock has traded as high as $60 a share over the
last 52 weeks, and as low as $35.75.
</P>
<P>
   The $66-a-share offer, ``is a start,'' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said the combination would make a good fit for both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, which has Breyer's ice cream and Gorton's fish sticks
in its stable of food brands, as well as Lipton teas, has been
digging deep to augment and improve its offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the company spent about $2.6 billion to buy Slim Fast
and Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 Unilever had sales of $43.7 billion. About half of its
revenues come from food, McMillin said.
</P>
<P>
   A purchase of Bestfoods would make sense, the analysts said,
because of the strength of its brands and its global reach. The
company, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., has operations
in 65 countries and sells products in many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies overlap in a lot of emerging markets,''
McMillin said. ``At the end of the day, a Bestfoods takeover was
just a matter of time. It is the prettiest girl at the dance, and
it has a chief executive who is 60 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan predicted that Bestfoods would hold out for a higher
price. And he mentioned only one other company that might consider
making its own bid for Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the offer price gets into the $70-a-share range I don't
know how they can fight it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are not many companies that have as big a pocketbook
as Unilever. Only Nestle has one as large.''

three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, Samuel Berger, President
Clinton's National Security Advisor, visited New York's Columbia
University's East Asian Institute on Tuesday and gave a detailed
examination of the security issues at stake in the trade bill,
calling it the most important chance the United States has had to
shape China's future in a generation. President Clinton and his top
aides are arguing that the decision is as much about America's
global leadership and the fate of Chinese reformers as it is about
the economic interest of American business. (Edward Keating/The New

own generation. The common wisdom was that members of so-called
Generation X preferred margaritas to merlot and considered wine to

ACROSS THE ATLANTIC, MICROSOFT CASE ATTRACTS CURIOSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, England _ This university town has been transformed
in the last decade by the arrival of companies like Microsoft,
along with a bevy of start-ups hoping to follow in its footsteps.
Now it is watching intently to see whether Microsoft's path will be
divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, Microsoft is viewed as the archetypical high-tech
success story,'' said John Cornish, director of product marketing
for ARM Holdings, a designer of microchips for hand-held devices
based in Cambridge that itself has become a hometown success story.
``The antitrust issues are a function of antitrust laws based on
U.S. history, which differs very much from the U.K. and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain and on the Continent, the latest chapter in the
Microsoft tale _ the government's proposal last week to break the
company in two _ has received prominent attention in the media. The
French daily newspaper Liberation has even set up a forum on its
Web site for Parisian readers to weigh in with their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bit further removed, but I think there is as much
interest here as there is in the States,'' said Derek McAuley, the
assistant director of Microsoft's research lab in Cambridge,
Microsoft Research Ltd. ``When I talk to my friends at the pub,
there is an understanding of the principles of antitrust, but there
is some confusion as to why this litigation is being brought to
bear against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many of the new-economy start-ups in Europe,
Microsoft has served as the ultimate example of an entrepreneurial
success story. William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has achieved
a celebrity status in Europe that rivals the Spice Girls. And while
most Europeans have watched the breakup of state-owned monopolies
through deregulation, most have never seen the breakup of a
self-made company.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Commission, the executive unit of the European
Union, has kept a careful eye on Microsoft's practices, working
with the Justice Department in some instances to curb the software
giant's behavior. The Brussels-based commission is investigating
Microsoft's integration of certain server-related software
technology that has been integrated or bundled into Windows 2000.
The European Commission is also examining Microsoft's agreement to
acquire 29.7 percent of Telewest, the British cable TV operator,
from MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a competition between antitrust authorities,'' a
spokeswoman for the European Commission said. ``At this stage, we
trust the Justice Department. Obviously, the bottom line is that
we're talking about a global marketplace and whatever happens in
the U.S. will have an impact everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the European Commission and the U.S. Justice Department
cooperated in an antitrust investigation that Microsoft settled by
changing contracts with personal computer producers and eliminating
some restrictions on software makers.

   Today, neither party is willing to settle, and this time around
the stakes are much higher. And so is the attention the company is
getting across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has used its operating system as a marketing vehicle
to the disadvantage of the customers,'' said a column in the German
business daily Handelsblat. ``At a time when the trend goes toward
software that is integrated into servers on the Internet, a
voluntary or a forced split-up would offer the chance for a new
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers of Liberation have been posting messages to its Web site
about the Microsoft case all week. ``The dismantlement of Microsoft
is not a cure-all to break the monopoly of Windows, but at least it
sheds light on the general contempt for Microsoft's practices,''
wrote a user identified as Erion.
</P>
<P>
   Not many companies in Europe compete head-on with Microsoft.
More often than not, the high-tech companies in Europe that have
prospered have been allied with Microsoft. From computers to
hand-held devices to set-top boxes for digital television, it is
hard to find a European version of Sun Microsystems or Oracle, two
American companies that have lobbied hard for a breakup of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Even British Telecommunications PLC, the once state-owned
telephone monopoly, has several alliances with the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand it does seem strange to try to break them up
because they are the ultimate start-up made good,'' said Peter
Bonfield, chief executive of British Telecom. ``But who am I to
judge the Justice Department? In terms of a company, we deal with
them. We don't feel threatened by them at all.''

   (NYT22) NEW YORK -- May 2, 2000 -- CHINA-U.S.-TRADE -- Just
three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, Samuel Berger, President
Clinton's National Security Advisor, visited New York's Columbia
University's East Asian Institute on Tuesday and gave a detailed
examination of the security issues at stake in the trade bill,
calling it the most important chance the United States has had to
shape China's future in a generation. President Clinton and his top
aides are arguing that the decision is as much about America's
global leadership and the fate of Chinese reformers as it is about
the economic interest of American business. (Edward Keating/The New

   (NYT21) SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- May 2, 2000 -- WINE BRATS -- Seven
years ago three twentysomething guys got together over beers at a
Sonoma pub to lament the sorry state of wine drinking in America.
The young men, all scions of prominent Sonoma Valley wine families,
were particularly disturbed about the wine-drinking habits of their
own generation. The common wisdom was that members of so-called
Generation X preferred margaritas to merlot and considered wine to
be elitist, boring and passe. The result was the founding of Wine
Brats. The founders, from left, Jeff Buncshu, Mike Sangiacomo and

 &HT;    Big move: CD label chief heads to N.Y. after strong Atlanta run
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there is one reason Atlanta has been called the
Motown of the South, it is Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid.
</P>
<P>
   And he is headed north.
</P>
<P>
   Parent company BMG has announced that Reid, co-president of
Atlanta-based LaFace Records, will replace Clive Davis as president
of Arista Records in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 42, starts July 1 _ the same day 10-year-old LaFace
Records is expected to be out of its 15th-floor Atlanta offices
(the lease expires) and a major transition in this city's
still-burgeoning music industry will officially begin.
</P>
<P>
   When LaFace Records opened here in October 1989, Atlanta was a
place where musicians lived, not where they did business. That
happened in Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the success LaFace has had as a label _ finding, developing
and producing the best-selling female act in the country, TLC, and
doing the same for such multimillion-sellers as R&AMP;B singers Toni
Braxton and Usher _ has inspired other major artists (Madonna,
Elton John, Stevie Nicks) and labels (DreamWorks, Bad Boy) to
record in, draw talent from, move to and stay put in this city.
</P>
<P>
   And though no one knows what will happen to LaFace in the long
run, the departure of Atlanta's most influential music man is an
incredible loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our magnet,'' Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said of
LaFace, ``our selling point and a source of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reid believes his Arista promotion will only help
LaFace, his absence from its day-to-day operations might well cause
jockeying among the labels that have sprung up since LaFace
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that we have developed some really smart
executives and a very sophisticated music community in Atlanta,''
Reid said Tuesday from New York. ``There are some really talented
people there who will keep it going and keep it growing. And if it
doesn't continue to grow, it would mean that it was all weak in the
beginning. All built on quicksand. And forgive me for maybe
sounding immodest, but I think we established something real there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And whether it is (producer-Freeworld President) Dallas Austin
or whether it is (producer-artist-So So Def President) Jermaine
Dupri or whether it is (full-service record company) Noontime,
we're talking about some really talented musical teams there that I
believe with all my heart will keep things going.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they don't, Reid says, he'll be around to push them
along. He will maintain his Atlanta home and metro area businesses
(including the Fusebox restaurant and Hitco publishing company),
returning each weekend to them and his schoolteacher fiancee, Erica
Holton, whom he will marry June 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want somebody around there to think, `Aw, LaFace is
gone and L.A. is gone, now I'm going to take over,''' added Reid,
who has yet to find a home in New York. ``Forget about it. We will
still have a presence.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will hardly be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I think the music scene will be even better and
bigger,'' Dupri said Tuesday. ``I mean, now he will be in control
of all kinds of music, not just R&AMP;B and rap. And since people here
have such great relationships with him, that's going to mean more
work for us, in rock and whatever else. All this is a change for
the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The half of LaFace that Arista did not own when it struck its
joint venture deal has been sold to the label for an undisclosed
amount of money. Since rumors started surfacing in late 1999 that
Reid would replace Davis, a slow exodus began among LaFace's staff
of 60.
</P>
<P>
   And while LaFace's artists will remain under that brand, Reid
says only ``a handful'' of the label's senior level executives will
join him at Arista in New York. And ``about the same number, if not
less'' will remain at LaFace.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said he could not be specific about staff size because
``decisions are still being made, and I'm still in negotiations
with many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remain at LaFace when it moves to its
still-undetermined new Atlanta site will primarily find acts for
the label, not market them. That will now be Arista's job. As for
his replacement, Reid says he hasn't chosen a president and doesn't
plan to name one anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the right executive comes along, I'll do that,'' he said.
``But right now I'm still running it.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the label in an unclear position as the man who runs
its day-to-day operations prepares to step into the shoes ofDavis,
an executive soul queen Aretha Franklin calls ``one of the last few
music men left.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the label he founded 25 years ago is coming off perhaps
its strongest year _ highlighted by legendary guitarist Carlos
Santana's return to the top of the charts _ Davis's successor will
have his work cut out for him. Many high-profile pop artists
protested last year when rumors surfaced that BMG was pushing Davis
out _ but no one has publicly criticized Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible time to take the reins,'' Reid said. ``A
challenging time. But if (keeping up the momentum) wasn't a
challenge, I wouldn't want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, LaFace founding co-President Kenneth
``Babyface'' Edmonds is entering into a joint venture agreement
with Arista Records to form his own label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to continue my close working relationship with my
friend and colleague Antonio Reid, for whom I have the utmost
respect,'' the Los Angeles-based Edmonds said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The work he and Reid did as producers for such artists as
Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Paula Abdul and Sheena
Easton earned them 33 No. 1 singles and three Grammy Awards. And
the label they started together 11 years ago has sold more than 50
million albums worldwide.

an executive soul queen Aretha Franklin calls ``one of the last few
music men left.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the label he founded 25 years ago is coming off perhaps
its strongest year _ highlighted by legendary guitarist Carlos
Santana's return to the top of the charts _ Davis's successor will
have his work cut out for him. Many high-profile pop artists
protested last year when rumors surfaced that BMG was pushing Davis
out _ but no one has publicly criticized Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible time to take the reins,'' Reid said. ``A
challenging time. But if (keeping up the momentum) wasn't a
challenge, I wouldn't want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, LaFace founding co-President Kenneth
``Babyface'' Edmonds is entering into a joint venture agreement
with Arista Records to form his own label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to continue my close working relationship with my
friend and colleague Antonio Reid, for whom I have the utmost
respect,'' the Los Angeles-based Edmonds said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The work he and Reid did as producers for such artists as
Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Paula Abdul and Sheena
Easton earned them 33 No. 1 singles and three Grammy Awards. And
the label they started together 11 years ago has sold more than 50
million albums worldwide.

A GET-TOUGH GORE FOCUSES ON DRUG TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Texas)  (Eds.: With GORE-WORDS) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a speech pungent with tough talk about criminals,
drug abusers and his Republican rival for president, Vice President
Al Gore called Tuesday for a broad array of anticrime measures,
among them mandatory drug testing of all prisoners and parolees.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a Southern state as the backdrop for one of his most
conservative speeches of the presidential campaign, Gore proposed
federal spending of $500 million a year to help states test, treat
and counsel prisoners and parolees for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, inmates in state prisons _ mandatory drug
testing already applies in federal prisons _ would not be released
until they could pass drug tests. Further, parolees could be
returned to prison if they failed the tests, which would be
administered twice a week. Parolees would also be subjected to
stricter supervision, to ensure that they paid child support,
stayed off drugs and found jobs.
</P>
<P>
   `When inmates are sent back to the streets unrehabilitated,
unrepentant and unskilled, then they are just going to commit more
crime and go right back into prison,'' Gore said to a crowd filled
with uniformed police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As in all his recent policy speeches, the vice president used a
harsh tone to attack his apparent rival, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, this time for cutting state financing of drug treatment by
half.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of such policies, Gore said, Texas under Bush has
experienced a 25 percent increase in the number of former inmates
returned to prison for new crimes within three years of release.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not suggest that Bush had been soft on crime, a
position that would be hard to defend: in Bush's 5{ years as
governor, Texas has undertaken the nation's largest prison-building
program, executed a record number of criminals, lengthened
sentences for many crimes and incarcerated a rising number of
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president did say: ``I believe that we should
demand that criminals get clean before they get out of jail. Gov.
Bush seems content to keep pushing them out of the same revolving
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush disputed Gore's statistic on Texas recidivism and
said violent crime in the state had fallen 20 percent, to a 20-year
low, during the Bush administration. They also asserted that the
availability of drug treatment in federal prisons had declined
during the Clinton-Gore administration, even as drug use among
adolescents had risen (an assertion disputed in turn by the Gore
campaign).
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore is willing to attack Texas, where violent crime is
at a 20-year low and the largest prison drug-treatment program in
the country is located, we're also expecting attacks on Texans for
defending the Alamo,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush aide.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bush has tried to move toward the political center with
education and health care proposals, Gore's crime speech Tuesday
gave him an opportunity to reach out to centrist Republicans and
conservative Democrats. And he seized it with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Bible several times, illustrating the problem of
violence among young men by retelling the story of Cain and Abel.
He argued that no amount of anticrime legislation would work unless
people took greater responsibility for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   And he castigated both conservative Republicans and liberal
Democrats for failing to compromise on crime-fighting plans,
casting himself as the purveyor of a third way who could rise above
``old orthodoxies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go back to the finger-pointing and failed strategies
that led to that steep increase in crime in the Bush-Quayle
administration,'' he said. ``And we can't go back to the old
Democratic approach, which was tough on the causes of crime but not
tough enough on crime itself, again when people in both political
parties wanted us to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's effort to outflank Bush on crime recalls Bill Clinton's
drive in the 1992 campaign to neutralize what had been a potent
Republican issue by advocating tough anticrime measures, including
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's speech Tuesday, typifying the
administration's approach to policy making, offered a mixture of
ideas _ some new, some old, many small-bore. Several of the ideas
were first discussed by Gore in a crime speech last July in Boston,
where he called for longer sentences for all crimes committed with
guns and for requiring photo-bearing licenses for people who buy
new handguns.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Gore restated his support for a proposal that federal
money help local governments hire 50,000 new police officers in the
coming decade. The Clinton administration has already helped
finance the hiring of 60,000 new police officers, with 40,000 more
to be hired soon.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also proposed federal aid to help state and
local governments buy new computers for crime-fighting purposes,
hire new prosecutors and expand after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   And in addition to mandatory drug testing of prisoners and
parolees, he called for expanding drug treatment programs for
noncriminals, though he offered no details. ``I believe we should
build a country in which every single addict who finds the power to
reach out and say, `Now is the time I want help and I want
treatment' gets an immediate response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also jumped into what has become a contentious debate in
Congress by endorsing a proposal for a constitutional amendment
intended to expand the rights of crime victims. The amendment would
grant victims and their families the right to reasonable notice of
court proceedings involving their cases, the right to have a voice
in those proceedings, and the right to notice of an offender's
release or escape from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the amendment, including many Democrats, assert
that those rights can be ensured without amending the Constitution.
In addition, some liberals argue that the measure would violate the
civil rights of the accused.

GORE ON CRIME  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking Tuesday about crime in Atlanta, as recorded by The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I pledge to you that if I am entrusted with the presidency, I
will launch a sweeping anti-crime strategy to make our families
safe and secure. I will intensify the battle against crime, drugs
and disorder in our communities. If you give me the chance, I will
be a law enforcement president. ...
</P>
<P>
   As crime and fear grew, too many families became afraid to live
up to their own responsibilities and help take back their
communities from the thugs and the dealers. And too many criminals
saw the disorder on our streets as an invitation to further
lawlessness and violence. ...
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, we began to change all that. President Clinton
and I thought we needed a tougher and more comprehensive strategy
to fight crime on every single front. Smarter prevention to stop
crime before it even started. More police on our streets to thicken
the thin blue line between order and disorder. And tougher
punishments, including the death penalty for those who dared to
penalize the innocent.

12 COMPANIES TO BID FOR BILLIONS IN GERMAN WIRELESS LICENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ With barely any time to relax after
companies bid $35 billion for five new wireless communications
licenses in Britain, many of the same competitors lined up
Wednesday for a potentially bigger auction in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   German government officials announced that 12 companies,
including MCI WorldCom, have signed up for an auction of as many as
six licenses for so-called third-generation wireless voice and data
services. These licenses will be made available for an advanced new
series of high-speed services that could make it possible to
transmit video or surf the World Wide Web in full color using
mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the staggering amounts of money offered in the British
auction, which ended last week, have raised new worries among some
industry analysts about the billions of dollars many companies will
have to borrow if they bid for licenses across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Besides MCI, the list of bidders in Germany includes Deutsche
Telekom, which won a license in Britain through its British
wireless carrier One2One; Mannesmann AG, which is being acquired by
Vodafone AirTouch of Britain; E-Plus, a German mobile phone carrier
controlled by Royal KPN of the Netherlands and BellSouth of the
United States; and MobilCom AG, a fast-growing German rival to
Deutsche Telekom that has backing from France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   All European Union countries plan to issue similar new licenses
in the next year or so, but there is a growing debate about whether
the licenses should be auctioned to the highest bidders or awarded
free through what amounts to a beauty contest.
</P>
<P>
   The supercharged bidding in Britain, which reached levels seven
times those officials originally predicted, has strengthened the
arguments on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments, like Germany's, have been mesmerized by the
prospect of windfalls that would enable them to either reduce
budget deficits or shore up existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   But others are worried that the billions paid for licenses will
translate into higher costs for users and could destroy companies
that miscalculate the potential benefits and bid too much.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts now believe that the bidding for licenses in
Germany _ which with 82 million people is a significantly larger
market than Britain with 60 million _ could reach as high as $50
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is crucial for any company bent on providing services
across Europe. Companies like Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom,
Vodafone and KPN want to build up pan-European networks and acquire
licenses in at least the biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors appear to have more limited ambitions. Orange
PLC, the British carrier soon to be sold by Mannesmann, was a
successful bidder in Britain and has teamed up with Sonera Corp. of
Finland and Telefonica of Spain. The bidding strategies have
inevitably become intertwined with strategies for mergers and
acquisitions. Telefonica is now in talks to acquire KPN, and one of
the two would presumably drop out if they reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is in a particularly complex situation. Having won a
brutal takeover battle for Mannesmann, Germany's biggest wireless
carrier, it must raise billions just to pay for its British license
and additional billions for anything it wins in Germany or other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In order to gain antitrust approval for the takeover of
Mannesmann, Vodafone is disposing of Orange. It had been expected
to do that through taking Orange public, but it now appears to be
leaning toward an all-cash sale to another telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the UMTS Forum _ for Universal Mobile Telephone
Standard _ an industry association aimed at promoting the
third-generation services, declared that countries would be better
off awarding licenses through beauty contests rather than through
auctions that could send the costs of new services to prohibitive
levels.

EX-PROSECUTOR CHOSEN IN INQUIRY OF CHIEF JUDGE  
 BY NEIL A. LEWIS  
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ga., N.C.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former federal prosecutor has been chosen to
investigate why the chief trial judge in Washington assigned
several criminal cases involving associates of President Clinton to
judges appointed by the president, lawyers in the case said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The former prosecutor, Joe D. Whitley, an Atlanta lawyer who
served in two Republican administrations, will look into why the
chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, Norma Holloway Johnson, bypassed the usual
computer-operated random selection scheme and assigned a handful of
Clinton-related cases to four judges named to the bench by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley was chosen by a special five-member panel of federal
judges who are undertaking the investigation in response to
complaints by a conservative legal group and Rep. Howard Coble,
R-N.C., chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The cases being investigated involved Democratic Party
fund-raising and Whitewater. In one instance, Johnson, who was
herself appointed by a Democrat, President Jimmy Carter, urged
federal prosecutors to request a specific judge who had been
appointed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The cases include those involving Webster Hubbell, the former
Arkansas law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton and onetime
associate attorney general in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Last year The Associated Press disclosed special assignments in
the Hubbell case as well as a case involving Charlie Yah Lin Trie,
a Clinton fund-raiser. At the time, Johnson said in a letter that
her decision was intended simply to shift complex cases to judges
with open schedules.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to respond to telephone requests for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Judges at the local courthouse who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said Tuesday that they believed the investigation had
little chance of producing any new information.
</P>
<P>
   One judge noted that because the investigation involved
Johnson's motives, there was little an investigation could do to
challenge her assertion as to why she bypassed the random selection
system. Another judge, a Republican appointee, said he believed
that Johnson made the assignments to enliven the workload of some
judges she favored with interesting cases.
</P>
<P>
   The special panel is headed by Judge Stephen F. Williams of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Also on
the special panel are two other members of the appeals court,
Judges Judith W. Rogers and A. Raymond Randolph, as well as two
district court judges, Thomas F. Hogan and Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Hogan and Jackson were nominated by President Ronald
Reagan, Randolph was named by President George Bush and Rogers by
Clinton.

   NEW YORK _ President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia; Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran; and Foday Sankoh, the
Sierra Leone rebel leader, are among this year's ``Top 10 Enemies
of the Press,'' according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday, the New York-based watchdog
group said Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front rebels executed at
least eight journalists in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Khamenei has fostered a climate against reform that
has led to the closings of 16 publications in Iran in the last
week, and Milosevic, who is making his second appearance on the
list, has continued a concerted campaign to destroy his country's
independent media, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's list also includes President Nursultan
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of
Angola. Those listed for the second time are President Alberto
Fujimori of Peru and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia,
while President Zine el Abdine Ben Ali of Tunisia made his third
appearance. President Jiang Zemin of China appears for the fourth
time, and President Fidel Castro of Cuba makes his sixth
appearance. Castro has appeared on every list since it was
introduced in 1995.

PENELOPE FITZGERALD, NOVELIST, IS DEAD AT 83 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career
late in life with a series of understated novels written in
lilting, unassuming prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She
was 83 and lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ``The Blue Flower''
about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a
12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle
Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don
DeLillo.
</P>
<P>
   The writer A.S. Byatt once called Fitzgerald ``Jane Austen's
nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Fitzgerald published
her first novel, a mystery, ``The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she
was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband,
Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Fitzgerald wrote 13
books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving
humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's Booker
Prize for ``Offshore'' in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of
brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own
life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in
an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ``The Bookshop'' in
1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came
her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on
the Thames in ``Offshore.'' In ``Human Voices'' (1980) she used
material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ``At
Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult
circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them
``exterminatees,'' which she defined as ``likely to be stamped out
with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep
sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write
religious books, but she once described herself as religious.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an
intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was
beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty
keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916.
Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund
Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a
Catholic convert, a monsignor and a spokesman for the church.
Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who
helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle,
Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   It was a deeply competitive family, with Fitzgerald, her
brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their
uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote
a biography of her father and his brothers, ``The Knox Brothers,''
published in 1977. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the
first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was
sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that
devastated her. Then, when she was 18, her mother died.
</P>
<P>
   At Somerville, she studied with J.R.R. Tolkien and graduated
with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the
Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a
travel agent. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband
``didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family
income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of
Food. With her husband, she was editor of ``The World Review,'' a
small literary journal.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated
houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ``A lot
of people would have gone down, too,'' Fitzgerald's daughter Maria
told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ``My dad
was drinking a lot then. Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.''
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to public housing and Fitzgerald became its
main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another
daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of
Oxford, and nine grandchildren. Fitzgerald published her first
book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in
1975. Despite the difficulties of her life as a young married
woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her
obligations as a wife and mother. ``In all that time, I could have
written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ``I
think you can write at any time of your life.'' She was also
reticent about her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   There was a delicate, elusive quality about Fitzgerald. She had
an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength.
``She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A.S. Byatt told the
Times. ``But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle
scattiness.''
</P>
<P>
   In her later works, Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the
autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ``The
Beginning of Spring,'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia.
``The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based
loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in
historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.
``I hate writing,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ``You just welcome
any interruption that comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared
her recent books to Beethoven in his ``late period,'' he said,
``where everything is getting pared down but the content is more
concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week
she died. Her final book, ``The Means of Escape,'' a story
collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Fitzgerald
said in 1998. ``I mean to the courage of those who are born to be
defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of
misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my
best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear
it?'' l

   DRUG COSTS ARE ISSUE IN MONTANA: Brian Schweitzer, a Democratic
candidate for the Senate in Montana, has campaigned hard on the
high price of prescription drugs and the burden it puts on the
uninsured elderly. Schweitzer, who has taken retirees to Canada to
highlight the lower cost of drugs there, has exchanged television
fire with Citizens for Better Medicare, a lobbying coalition led by
the drug industry. Now the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, which believes Schweitzer has a good shot at winning one
of six seats the party needs to retake control of the Senate, has
produced a television spot urging voters to ``call the big drug
companies and tell them to get out of the way of Brian Schweitzer's
fair prices drug plan.'' Schweitzer, a farmer who has never held
elective office, is trying to unseat the Republican incumbent,
Conrad Burns.

   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   GOV. THOMPSON NAMED PLATFORM CHAIRMAN: Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of
Wisconsin has been named chairman of the committee that will draft
the Republican platform at the party's national convention this
summer, an appointment that abortion rights advocates regard as a
sign that George W. Bush, the presumed presidential nominee, will
not ease the party's staunch anti-abortion position. Two years ago,
Thompson signed legislation outlawing the procedure that opponents
call partial-birth abortion. Kate Michelman, president of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, said the selection showed
that Bush, despite his advocacy of inclusiveness, ``cares about
what the far right of his party wants.'' Thompson said after his
appointment on Monday that he looked forward to ``serving on the
committee to articulate our party's most innovative ideas, the
principles that bind us together and our vision for the future.''

   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   BUSH HOLDS NARROW LEAD: The latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup
presidential preference poll gives Gov. George W. Bush a 5-point
lead over Vice President Al Gore, 49 percent to 44 percent. The
poll also indicates that should Bush pick Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., as his running mate, he would widen his lead. Among all
voters, the poll found, two of three would not be more inclined to
vote for Bush if McCain were added to the ticket. But among
independents, two of five said they would be more inclined to vote
for Bush with McCain on the ticket. The poll, which surveyed 1,003
likely voters from April 28 to 30, has a margin of sampling error
of plus or minus 5 percentage points. In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup
poll taken three weeks earlier, Bush led Gore by 9 points.

FINANCIAL CAFE.COM IS LATEST TO OFFER FREE STOCK TRADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Internet, brokerage firms are starting to use stock
trades the way banks used to use pens and lollipops: they are
giving them away to lure people onto their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concern to forgo commissions on online purchases of
stock is the Financial Cafe.com, a start-up based in Seattle.
Despite being quite late to the electronic-brokerage party that
broke out a few years ago, Financial Cafe.com hopes to attract
customers to its other financial services by giving away trades
ordered at market prices.
</P>
<P>
   The venture is at least the third to offer free stock trades.
Last week, the Ameritrade Holding Corp., an established online
brokerage firm, introduced Freetrade.com, an all-electronic trading
service. Late last year, American Express started giving away
trades to certain investors. Those offers undercut the deep
discount brokers, including Ameritrade's flagship service and
FleetBoston Financial's SureTrade unit, that charge about $8 a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting that zero out there gets people's attention,'' said
Alex Stein, an executive vice president of Gomez Advisors in Boston
and an adviser to Financial Cafe.com. ``Once you get their
attention, the key is to offer a high-quality service to retain the
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein said the number of brokerage accounts at American Express
rose sharply after it introduced free trades for customers with at
least $25,000 in their accounts. The offer was so successful, it
seemed to overwhelm the company's systems, said Stein, whose
company tracks the responsiveness of e-commerce operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen their customer service go from stellar to one of
the worst, largely because they saw this fantastic influx of new
accounts,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Financial Cafe.com said they planned to emphasize
service by having a higher ratio of service representatives to
customers than established firms have. The industry average is
about one representative for every 1,200 to 1,500 accounts, Stein
said, and Financial Cafe.com plans to have about three
representative to serve that many accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M.D. Cross, chairman of Financial Cafe.com and former
chief executive of Yorkton Securities, a Canadian investment bank,
said the new venture would charge competitive rates for a range of
financial products, including bonds and mutual funds, and loans
against stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Koslow, the company's chief operating officer, insisted
that it would not treat no-cost stock trades as a loss leader. With
the deals the company has struck with its business partners, Koslow
said, it will need only a small number of accounts to become
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The most important alliance is with FreeShop.com, a Web site
that collects information about discounts and free trial offers
from a variety of merchants. In exchange for an undisclosed amount
of equity in Financial Cafe.com, FreeShop.com plans to promote the
new venture to its list of more than three million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our customers are online transactors and a majority of
them have made purchases online,'' said Tim Choate, chairman and
chief executive of FreeShop.com, which is also based in Seattle.
They are obviously attracted by free offers, but Choate said he did
not know how many of them already had accounts with online
brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, FreeShop.com will be the exclusive promoter of
Financial Cafe.com. Choate said the arrangement was the first of
what his company hoped would be a series of ``jump starts'' that it
would provide for nascent e-commerce companies. With the stock of
his company, which went public last year, now trading below its
initial offering price, Choate said the company's most valuable
asset was its status as one of the most heavily visited sites on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Pelino, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston, said
there was a potential liability in luring customers with an offer
that seems to good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offering free stock trades will draw traffic but is it the
traffic that you want?'' Pelino said. ``When you say something's
free, consumers tend to think you get what you pay for. That can
actually be a challenge in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking with officials of Financial Cafe.com, Pelino said
it was not clear to her how the company could avoid losing money on
each free trade.

ACT NETWORKS ACQUIRED BY NORTHERN RIVAL
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calabasas, Calif. - ACT Networks, a maker of products that bring
together voice, data and video on the same network, is being
acquired by a Redwood City company for an estimated $189 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Clarent Corp., which makes equipment that allows voice and data
transmission over the Internet, said it will issue 0.2546 shares of
its stock for each share of Calabasas-based ACT Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see numerous benefits resulting from this partnership,''
said Andre de Fusco, ACT's chief executive officer. ``Combined, we
believe that Clarent and ACT will be better equipped to take on the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's closing price, ACT shareholders would receive stock
worth $17.69 for each share they own. That represents a premium of
$3.44 per share at ACT's Tuesday close.
</P>
<P>
   ACT Networks' stock ended the day at a price of $14.25, an
increase of 37.5 cents per share. Clarent's stock was down $5 per
share to close at $69.50 following the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The combination will allow Clarent to better penetrate the
market both companies have been targeting, said Jerry Chang,
Clarent's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Heaps, Clarent's chief operating officer, said ACT's
customers are interested in migrating from their current technology
to the type of technology Clarent offers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of Clarent's customers could take
advantage of ACT's less costly products, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combination will enable the combined company to better
serve the needs of our existing customer base,'' Heaps said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition agreement contains a clause that sets a minimum
of $14 per share and a maximum of $18 per share Clarent will pay
for ACT.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said they expect the transaction to be completed
within 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   ACT Networks and its 220 employees will be brought in as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Clarent. The ACT Networks Division will
continue to be headquartered in Calabasas, the company said.

NUMERICAL SPARRING HIGHLIGHTS FISCAL FOCUS OF PRESIDENTIAL RACE
</HEADLINE>
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aides to Gov. George W. Bush fought back on Tuesday
against accusations that his fiscal proposals are risky, saying
that the growth in the economy over the past six months meant that
there would be enough money to accommodate comfortably the
governor's spending and tax cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers released a new analysis of his budget plans
after days in which Vice President Al Gore has sharply criticized
Bush on fiscal issues. Gore has asserted that Bush's large tax cut
proposal and plan to push for a portion of Social Security payroll
taxes to be put into private investment accounts would return the
nation to the era of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went on an advertising offensive on Monday against Bush,
the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, through a series
of interviews and television appearances, charging that Bush would
continue ``multitrillion-dollar debts.'' Campaigning on Tuesday,
Gore called Bush's Social Security proposal ``bad for America's
future and bad for America's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over numbers underscores how much the presidential
campaign _ the first one waged in the new era of federal surpluses
_ will be fought over economic policy and the related question of
how to shore up Social Security. The Gore campaign considers the
economic prosperity of the Clinton years one of its greatest
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The figures released by Bush's aides addressed a weakness in
earlier calculations. With the annual spending battle stepping up
on Capitol Hill, the Bush campaign stopped assuming Congress would
make large reductions in domestic spending, instead assuming
discretionary domestic spending would grow.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush's advisers argued that the growth in the
economy over the past six months means the federal surplus will be
larger than previously forecast. They said that under their new
calculations the estimated federal surplus across 10 years _ after
$2.2 trillion is set aside for Social Security _ will amount to
$1.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   That is roughly $1 trillion more than the Gore campaign
estimates and about $500 billion more than the Bush campaign's
earlier projections. Gore assumes a higher rate of spending and a
less robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said his cut would use 1.3 trillion surplus
dollars, allowing $512 billion for other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is clear,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush
campaign's chief economic adviser. ``Gov. Bush's plan takes care of
Social Security first, provides America's working families with a
tax break and does it all within the context of a balanced
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's new calculations were released less than 24
hours after Gore's aides held their own session with reporters and
released an array of numbers that they said showed that to
accommodate his tax cut, Bush either had to make ``cuts in core
areas of government that are unimaginable'' or risk a return to
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides were still critical after Bush's aides released the
new analysis..
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month he claimed that his tax cut and spending increases
were paid for,'' said Elaine Kamarck, Gore's policy adviser.
``Today, after finding more money, Bush still can't pay for his
promises for a huge tax cut, increased spending and privatization
of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said Bush was underestimating spending, and
Bush's advisers refused to disclose how much Bush's embrace of a
national missile defense system and prescription drug program would
cost, while saying the proposals fit in their spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious dispute between the two campaigns is the true
cost of Bush's tax-cut proposal. Bush's aides said the tax cut
would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years from 2001-2010. Over just
five years they said it would cost $460 billion, slightly less than
their original estimate of $483 billion. And they pointed to an
analysis from Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation backing them.
The committee is controlled by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign argued that it was more appropriate to examine
the tax cut through 2011, since the tax cut does not go into effect
until fiscal 2002. Gore's aides said that once that extra year is
added in, as well as lost interest costs, the tax cut costs $2
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Another looming battle is over debt reduction and Social
Security. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece
of his economic agenda. He says that Bush's proposal for putting
some Social Security money into individual retirement accounts will
carry a huge cost because it will require using part of the federal
surplus that would otherwise go toward eliminating the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides counter that by giving individual workers their own
retirement accounts, which can be invested in financial markets,
they decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits
out of tax revenues. This itself, they say, is a form of debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement system is projected to start paying out more in
benefits than it is taking in through payroll taxes starting in
2015.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chelsea Clinton was away at Stanford University on
Tuesday, finishing up her junior year, but her ears must have been
burning from a conversation that was occurring back at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, her mother was using her as Exhibit A in the
first-ever White House Conference on Teen-agers, a day-long session
that brought together academic experts, activists, parents and
young people to discuss the challenges of growing up in this age of
school shootings, body piercings and Internet pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I speak, of course, with great authority _
having just graduated from being the parents of a teen-ager to
being the parents of a 20-year-old and having survived it,'' said
Hillary Rodham Clinton as she began the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton called the event ``more than a trip down
memory lane or an exercise in nostalgia for us,'' she spoke from
personal experience as she talked about the challenges of balancing
work and family, and of the disconcerting feeling that parents face
when their teen-agers would rather spend time with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to hang around just in case they'll deign to say
something to you,'' said Mrs. Clinton, prompting the president,
whom she called the ``co-parent'' of the household, to roar in
laughter. The Clintons have been extremely protective of their only
child, who was 11 when they moved into the White House. But they
appear quite proud that she has emerged from an unusual childhood
into an accomplished young woman.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republican critics complained that the Clintons
were playing politics by convening the conference, an accusation
that White House aides shrugged off as politics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said it was in the small kitchen in the White House
residence where familial bonding occurred in the Clinton household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our daughter left for college, the three of us made it
a priority to share at least one meal together a day,'' said Mrs.
Clinton. ``With our hectic schedules, it wasn't always easy and,
occasionally, wasn't possible. But we sure tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton called those half-hour or hour-long meals ``my
favorite part of the day,'' and one of the most important, too. To
spread the word about the importance of sharing meals, or any time
at all, with teen-agers, she announced a new public education
campaign on the issue by the National Partnership for Women and
Families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and I were very convinced that we wanted to convey to our
daughter a simple message, one that we hoped she would carry away
to college: that whenever she does need someone to talk to or ask
for advice, or just wants to say hello, we will be available and
eager to listen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said what she knows as a parent is right in line
with new research from the National Institute of Mental Health that
shows teen-agers' brains go through a second wave of development,
not unlike the quick growth of the brains of toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the very wise advice I got from a friend of mine,
when my daughter was very small, and she was raising three
teen-agers,'' said Mrs. Clinton. ``And she said, you know, the two
times in a child's life that seem most similar to me are those
toddler years and the teen-age years. It's when we need to give so
much more attention to our children.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These days, giving that attention is tougher than ever for the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is busy campaigning in New York for a Senate seat.
President Clinton has a vigorous travel schedule of his own. For
her part, Chelsea, who has a boyfriend and a full load of classes,
is not exactly sitting by the phone waiting for a call from Mom and
Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with 3,000 miles between us, the three of us try to talk
on the phone as often as possible,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in a column
on being a parent in Newsweek magazine. ``Of course, it isn't quite
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their official travel schedules over the years, the
first couple effectively worked at home as they were raising
Chelsea, increasing the opportunity for interaction. And Bill
Clinton was the top boss, meaning if he decided to attend one of
her high school ballet recitals, the rest of the federal government
obliged.
</P>
<P>
   But the president, acknowledging that other federal workers face
tougher times, signed an executive order Tuesday barring
discrimination against parents in the federal workforce. ``The goal
of this order simply says, `no glass ceiling for parents,''' he
said. ``The job they're doing at home is more important, anyway.''

PANEL CLEARS PATAKI IN TRIPS INDIRECTLY FINANCED BY CORPORATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Ethics Commission has found that
Gov. George E. Pataki and his aides did not violate the law in
allowing a nonprofit trade group largely financed by companies
lobbying his office to pay for trips he took to Hungary in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded that the trips did raise ``ethical
concerns'' because the nonprofit group, the Hungarian-American
Chamber of Commerce USA, raised money from the companies
specifically for the trips.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is controlled by the governor's
appointees, said its inquiry had determined that the governor and
his aides were not aware that the group was soliciting money from
the companies, which included Philip Morris, Pepsico and two
pharmaceuticals giants, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence _ either from the witnesses interviewed
or the documents reviewed _ that anyone in the governor's office
(or elsewhere in state government) knew that HACC was soliciting
funds for the trips,'' the commission's executive director, Donald
P. Berens Jr., wrote in a letter released Tuesday in which it
announced its findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accordingly,'' the letter said, ``the commission has concluded
that neither the governor nor any state officer or employee
violated the state ethics law or sought to circumvent the law in
connection with HACC's funding of the governor's trips.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, which was sent to three advocacy groups that
filed a complaint about the trips, Berens noted that one of the
governor's aides had asked the commission before the first trip
whether the administration was required to examine the chamber's
finances, and the commission had responded that it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berens added, the commission would change its rules to
require that Pataki and his successors, when taking trips financed
by outside groups, ask whether the groups were raising funds for
the trips and from whom.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, Philip Morris and some of the other companies
indicated in interviews last fall that the donations to the chamber
were not tied to the trips. The commission said it had determined
that they were but had decided not to take action against the
chamber or the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under state ethics rules, companies with interests before the
governor are barred from paying for his travel. In this case, the
companies financed the trips, with donations of $5,000 to $20,000,
by funneling the money through the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had allowed the chamber to pay for the trips
because the chamber did not have business in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel opened its inquiry last fall after The New York
Times published several articles about the financing of the trips,
which were a combination of trade mission and family vacation. In
response to the commission's findings, Pataki's spokesman, Michael
McKeon, read a statement Tuesday: ``As we have said all along, what
we did was right and proper. The commission has now verified that
we followed the advice and guidance that they provided us, which
were the same practices used by the previous administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, one of the three advocacy groups that
filed the complaint, said that if the administration was to be
believed, it was startling that no Pataki aides had scrutinized the
chamber's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the administration was ethically tone deaf
when this deal was first being put together,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the trips last fall, the chamber's president,
Monika Szarka-Elling, said she did not know why Philip Morris and
the other corporations contributed to the chamber, which was
founded in 1992 and is based in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Szarka-Elling did not respond to two messages at her office.
Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, declined to
comment.

<P>
   Senior Pentagon officials have insisted that protesters be
removed from a bombing range on the island before training
exercises begin. Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, and other senior law enforcement officials have
warned of possible injuries, and even casualties, as federal agents
try to remove protesters from a range scattered with live
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeh's questions about the operation have largely been
answered, the officials said, especially with an agreement reached
Tuesday that the Justice Department will obtain an order from a
Federal District Court in Puerto Rico authorizing the arrest of
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days White House officials and Attorney General Janet
Reno agreed to mount the operation before the end of the week, top
law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Aguilar, the Washington representative of the governor
of Puerto Rico, said the protesters were failing to ``respect the
truth and respect the will of the majority of Puerto Ricans'' who
he said want the bombing range cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators are protesting an agreement reached on Jan. 31
between President Clinton and Gov. Pedro J. Rossello of Puerto
Rico. The plan allows the Navy to resume limited bombing practice
with dummy weapons on the Vieques range until a referendum is held.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum will allow residents of Vieques to choose between
letting the Navy resume full use of the range with live bombs and
ammunition or ordering the military to end all training by May 1,
2003.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the protesters said that they would refuse to
comply with the expected order to leave the military base but that
they would not actively resist arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters held workshops on Monday to practice nonviolent
resistance in expectation that agents would haul them off the range
on Tuesday, said Lilda Medina, of the Coordinating Committee for
Peace and Justice in Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they would come today,'' Medina said in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``Trucks have been moving in and out of the camp
since yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   This week two Navy ships carrying 1,000 marines and sailors
arrived in waters near Vieques to support the federal special
weapons and tactics teams who will remove the protesters from the
range, on the eastern end of the island. The marines will stand
guard around the edge of the range, help dispose of unexploded
bombs and provide medical help.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has described Vieques as the crown jewel of its
training ranges because it is the only site along the East Coast
where battle groups can use live ammunition during joint training
exercises that include amphibious landings of marines, shelling
from ships and aerial bombardment from fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Those exercises were suspended last year when a civilian Puerto
Rican security guard was killed in a bombing accident that touched
off widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also entered the Senate race in New York, which
has a large population of Puerto Ricans. On Tuesday, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, called again for a
permanent end to bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small, inhabited island should not be used for target
practice,'' Clinton said in a statement. ``Until such a referendum
occurs, I urge the Pentagon to negotiate a peaceful resolution to
this situation.''

A RUNNER WHO MADE HIS MOVE BEFORE THE TRIALS

<P>
   Even though the world's greatest marathon runner cleared the
last piece of government red tape to become a U.S. citizen Tuesday,
there is considerable uncertainty about whether he will ever cross
the tape at the finish line Oct. 1 at the Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Khannouchi, the Moroccan-born runner who is the world
record-holder in the marathon, left important questions unanswered
Tuesday as he was naturalized in a ceremony in Houston. It is still
not known whether he will compete in the Olympic trials on Sunday
in Pittsburgh, only three weeks after running the London Marathon,
whether he would have a realistic chance of qualifying for the
Sydney Games and whether he would subject himself to further injury
that could ruin his career.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, who lives in Ossining, N.Y., is expected to announce
his intentions Wednesday at a news conference in Manhattan. Some
running experts doubt that he will run, and his own trainer
cautioned against it after Khannouchi aggravated ankle and
hamstring injuries during the London Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   However, his wife, Sandra, who is also his agent, has given
conflicting statements about the seriousness of his injuries. And
it could be that Khannouchi feels obligated to compete, given the
cadre of people who have helped him gain his citizenship, and given
nationalistic pressures to win an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The marathoner qualified for naturalization under an immigration
rule, normally used by the military, that grants citizenship to
spouses of U.S. citizens working abroad for American companies.
Sandra Khannouchi recently took a job in Madrid with a San
Diego-based company called Elite Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Khannouchi came to the United States to compete in the
World University Games in 1993 and remained because he felt he was
being treated unfairly by Moroccan track officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy that my quest for U.S. citizenship has
been successful,'' Khannouchi said in a statement. ``I look forward
to competing in national and international championship events as
an American citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a news conference in a meeting room of the Houston
City Council, Khannouchi declined to reveal his plans for the
marathon trials, indicating he might do that Wednesday. Asked about
his physical condition, he admitted to being tired, but added:
``It's not only physical. It's also mental. I been through a lot of
problems, but what I want to say is it's over now. I don't want to
think about what happened in the past. I don't want to think about
the past. I just want to clear my mind. I want to take a long
vacation and think what's the next schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from whether Khannouchi will compete Sunday, an equally
important question is whether he should compete. Most elite
marathoners run no more than two marathons a year, much less two in
three weeks. If Khannouchi competes in the trials and the Olympic
marathon, he will have run four races of 26.2 miles in a period of
12 months, which would undoubtedly put a severe strain on his
muscles, joints and connective tissue. His Ireland-based trainer,
Gerard Hartmann, told NBC's Olympic Web site that ``Khalid has had
injuries that could curtail his career.'' Khannouchi told reporters
Tuesday that he would consult with Hartmann again before making a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell athletes you never, ever start a marathon injured,''
said David Martin, a professor of physiology at Georgia State
University, who coaches marathon runners and who is chairman of
sports science of USA Track and Field, the national governing body.
``At the elite level, the marathon is tragic in terms of what it
can do to destroy your career, particularly with injuries related
to motion. I hope whatever decision is made is good for Khalid's
career as an athlete and not for who is going to profit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Khannouchi said unequivocally that he
would not run both the London Marathon and the Olympic trials.
However, Sandra Khannouchi began saying before London that he might
consider both. Her statements followed a talk with Harry Gee,
Khannouchi's Houston-based attorney, who said he learned from a
reporter that Khannouchi was running London; he expressed
irritation that Khannouchi evidently did not plan to enter the
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a much more comprehensive discussion after that
occasion,'' Gee said in a recent interview. ``Our purpose of being
involved is to help the U.S. get a gold medal. If that wasn't his
purpose, certainly we would appreciate being made aware of those
circumstances.''

 UNDATED: those circumstances.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Khannouchi does not enter the trials, he could still make the
Olympic team at 10,000 meters at the national track and field
trials in July in Sacramento. In the 10,000, he would have only an
outside chance for a medal. In the marathon, a healthy Khannouchi
would be favored to win America's first gold medal since Frank
Shorter's victory at the 1972 Munich Olympics. And though he is a
Moroccan native, a victory would nevertheless be a boost to a bleak
American distance-running program. He set the world record of 2
hours 5 minutes 42 seconds last October at the Chicago Marathon.
His personal best is four minutes faster than the next American.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field's international governing body has said that
Khannouchi would not need permission from Morocco to compete for
the United States in Sydney. Even if he did need permission, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee, would probably intervene with the Moroccan federation,
given his stated determination to have the world's best athletes
compete in the Olympics. A healthy Khannouchi could essentially
match the other Americans with a ``jog in the park'' at the trials,
Martin said, but an injured Khannouchi ``comes back to the other
runners' level of fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   How hurt is Khannouchi? His wife has given contradictory
statements in recent days, telling reporters that her husband's
injuries were both potentially career threatening and relatively
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's probably going to run, but I think he's going to
have his work cut out to finish in the top three,'' said Mark
Coogan, a 1996 Olympian and one of the favorites on Sunday. ``We
may not run 2:08, but we're not bums.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, David Morris and Joe LeMay are the only three
Americans who have achieved the Olympic ``A'' qualifying standard
of 2:14. But even if Khannouchi runs, there may not be a large
margin for error in making the team. Complicating matters are a
hilly course in Pittsburgh and temperatures that could reach the
high 70s or 80. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He could best control his destiny by winning or finishing in the
top three. However, even a top-three finish may not guarantee an
Olympic berth under the complicated formula that determines
qualifiers. If the winner runs slower than 2:14 and is someone
other than Khannouchi, Morris and LeMay, only the winner would
qualify for Sydney. There are other possibilities in which
Khannouchi could finish in the middle of the pack, or even last,
and still qualify for the Olympics because he has already met the A
standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad for the guy; I think he's doing it for the right
reasons,'' Coogan said of Khannouchi's citizenship. ``It will be
interesting to see how well he does if he runs. If he kills
everyone, he might as well wear a cape and an `S' on his chest.''

 &HT;    Will the tradition continue?By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Eleven students, their arms around each
other in a tight circle, shared whispered prayers Tuesday, a few
yards from the piles of oak, hackberry, and elm logs that
symbolized Aggie pride less than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow crime scene tape still flapped from some of the twisted
trunks. A fence topped with barbed wire separated the students from
what is now the scene of Texas A&AMP;M's biggest tragedy and an
intensive investigation into why Bonfire fell, killing 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   Under slate gray skies Tuesday, students gathered around
televisions and packed Reed Arena, solemnly listening to the
bonfire commission's conclusions that the November collapse was the
result of years of ``organizational failure'' and unquestioned
adherence to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Across the tree-lined campus, where the wounds remain fresh and
painful, learning why Bonfire fell didn't answer students' most
urgent question: Will Bonfire continue?
</P>
<P>
   The decision is now in the hands of A&AMP;M's administration, and
the students know that the future of this sacred Aggie rite remains
in doubt. But across campus, the vast majority of the student body
seems poised to fight for Bonfire's future _ in whatever form is
necessary to preserve safety and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So they paused from the bustle of finals week to sign petitions
voicing their support for keeping Bonfire. They pulled on T-shirts
announcing their determination to see it burn again. They gathered
at the bell tower and marched to the arena en masse.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can forget that people died on the stack. And for
that reason, some students remain deeply torn over whether Bonfire
should serve as a tribute to those who died, or be halted to ensure
no one else will perish building the towering structure that has
become the burning symbol of Aggie pride.
</P>
<P>
   When bonfire commission Chairman Leo Linbeck Jr. called
Tuesday's meeting to order, a silence fell over the crowd. When the
commission showed a computer-generated simulation of the collapse,
some students took detailed notes while others struggled to hold
back the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Hill, a 19-year-old sophomore, wept during the
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to put it out of our minds and it brings everything
back. ... We tried to heal all the wounds in our heart and it
brought everything back up,'' said Hill, who helped build the 1999
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   In the cavernous lounge at the university's student center, more
than a hundred students watched the commission report on two
televisions. Afterward, Amie Jeffryes, 20, and Dennis Ellis, 21,
had mixed feelings about what should be done now.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the commission's report didn't seem to surprise
them. Jeffryes said she was glad the drinking and hazing that
accompanies bonfire construction was not found to be a factor in
the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved that it wasn't horseplay or alcohol or anything
like that,'' said Jeffryes, a sophomore from Mansfield. ``The
tunnel vision and cultural bias _ it was hard to have that slapped
in our faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't surprised by anything they said,'' she added.
``We all knew it, we knew Bonfire had problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jeffryes wants the bonfire to continue. Ellis, a junior
from Dallas, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could guarantee me that no Aggie would ever die
building (Bonfire), I'd say do it again,'' Ellis said. ``If it
goes, I won't be sad to see it go, because 12 people lost their
lives, and nothing is worth those lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bonfire is banished, Ellis said, students would find a
way to make sure the spirit of the event survives at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something greater than a pile of wood burning,''
he said. ``Those 12 people will never be forgotten. I guarantee you
something will happen on the polo fields next year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the polo fields were largely silent. Small groups of
students visited the remaining stacks of bonfire logs, bowing their
heads and grasping the chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   Most students seemed willing to compromise on the size or design
of the bonfire, even if that means handing over the planning to
professionals. For them, the important thing is that Bonfire lives
on as a student-built structure.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the investigating committee's presentation,
hundreds of students gathered at the university's bell tower and
walked to Reed Arena to hear the results in person. Some called it
a march to support keeping the bonfire tradition alive; others said
they came simply as a show of student unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep Bonfire and also show support for the people
who died,'' said Lacy Wilson, an 18-year-old student. ``We're
freshmen. We've never even seen the bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Kyle Wiesenborn, 18, said he would support whatever
the university decides. But he said he hopes to see Bonfire
continue. He wants to be a part of the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be out there in a second if they did it next year,''
Wiesenborn said. ``I feel like it would be some sort of tribute to
the people who died.''
</P>
<P>
   Further back in the procession, 22-year-old Becky Howard wore a
T-shirt emblazoned with what she believes is the majority opinion
on campus: ``Keep the fire burning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The students) really want it to continue, maybe not in the
same way,'' said Howard, a senior from Arkansas. ``A lot of people
were out there (when the bonfire collapsed) and saw it, and they
don't ever want that to happen again. I think they're willing to
compromise.''

25 YEARS AFTER WILLOWBROOK DECISION, CELEBRATION AND CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
  By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an unwieldy and not altogether happy reunion
of a very unusual class, the so-called Willowbrook Class.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the patients of the infamous Willowbrook
State School won a class-action lawsuit that led to the widespread
deinstitutionalization of the mentally retarded, lawyers, doctors,
administrators and some class members themselves gathered to
celebrate the settlement, called the Willowbrook Consent Judgment _
and to criticize its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and early '70s, the conditions at Willowbrook,
including feces-smeared walls, naked inhabitants and frequent,
violent deaths, were well documented, most notably by Geraldo
Rivera, whose 1972 television expose was the impetus for a federal
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey signed the consent decree, thus
committing the state to establish noninstitutional homes for people
with developmental disabilities. Gov. Carey, former Gov. Mario M.
Cuomo, and Gov. George E. Pataki were all honored Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, held on the campus of the College of Staten
Island, where the crowded, prisonlike wards of Willowbrook once
stood, was called ``Social Justice Has Prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 450 present said it had not: Some mentally
retarded people are still institutionalized; care still needs to be
improved, even in group homes; the state is not meeting the
promises it made in the settlement; and no reparations, or even
apologies, have been made.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The participants acknowledged that the decree had succeeded,
to a degree. Only 8 of the state's 20 mental institutions remain,
and the number of people in such institutions has decreased to
fewer than 1,000 from 25,000, according to the Office of Mental
Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, created after the
decree.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers who represent the 3,600 remaining members of the
Willowbrook Class said the case was technically still open, and
that they often had to threaten to get an injunction to ensure that
the state met its agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a continuous game of chicken,'' said Beth
Haroulas of the New York Civil Liberties Union, adding that she
still saw reports of abuse, neglect and inadequate medical care in
group homes.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, Willowbrook Class members are better off than
other mentally retarded people. Their case managers have lighter
loads _ 20 as opposed to 30 _ and the quality of their care is more
closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the conference panelists made a point of saying there
was room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   One with a particularly poignant story to tell was Bernard
Carabello, who entered Willowbrook when he was 3, and stayed for 18
years, despite the fact that he was not retarded. Carabello has
cerebral palsy, which does not impair mental functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Now a governor-appointed advocate for the developmentally
disabled, Carabello said the main problems in the field today
involved community relations: neighborhoods often do not welcome
group homes and those who live in them are often isolated from
their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Present problems aside, the gathering was, for some, an
emotional trip to the past. Several of the participants, including
William Bronston, one of the Willowbrook doctors who helped
organize the parents who filed the lawsuit, returned to the site
for the first time since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   During one panel discussion, he called for an apology to be
issued to those who suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents,'' he said privately during a lunchtime
presentation of awards and speeches, ``have never been acknowledged
as Holocaust survivors, American-style.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jose Rivera took the podium to remember his brother, who died
while staying at Willowbrook, the faces of many parents and
siblings grew quiet and drawn. Some of them had lost relatives.
Others said they were lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Nehbauer of Hastings, N.Y., whose son now lives in a group
home in nearby Scarsdale, told how she would make unannounced
visits to Willowbrook, where he was one of 90 children in a ward
with barely 12 inches of space between beds.
</P>
<P>
   Though she knew what the conditions were, she said, ``Our only
option was no option.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana McCourt, the wife of the writer Malachy McCourt, said her
daughter, Nina Galin, now lived in a group home in Harlem, where
she participated in a new one-on-one program that allowed her to
venture accompanied into the city.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered finding out what Willowbrook was like: ``I felt
totally enraged, totally terrified and also totally determined to
find like-minded people. I looked around to find the most radical
social worker by length of hair, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Though conditions have improved, she allowed, she bristled at
honoring the former governors for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing what they were paid to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she agreed with Dr. Bronston's call for an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's what establishes a human relationship between
people who provide services and those who receive them.''

 &HT;    Students find relief in findings
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The conclusion that a handful of
structural and ``behavioral'' problems caused last November's Aggie
Bonfire collapse clears the way for the 90-year-old tradition to
continue, many Texas A&AMP;M students and alumni said after a special
commission released its final report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Students and alumni said they were heartened by the findings _
even though investigators faulted university officials over the
years for allowing students to make engineering decisions they
weren't qualified to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think it was as harsh as I thought it was
going to be,'' said Julie Zimmerer, a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Land Commissioner and 1998 Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro, who graduated from A&AMP;M in 1970, said it was
time to ``go about the business of solving the problems and stop
pointing fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we did the report so that we would know that no
specific person in this bonfire cycle was responsible for the
deaths,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bonfire's worth a single student's life. But as far as what
I've read, these are things that can be corrected and we can
continue the bonfire tradition that's so important to all Aggies.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, several construction decisions resulted
in too much stress on a weakened structure. The report also said
university rules were not enforced and the rules came only as
reactive _ not proactive _ measures.
</P>
<P>
   Some students took umbrage at the commission's finding that the
students building the stack were poorly supervised by the
university and slipshod in their construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothered me the most is that it made A&AMP;M sound
irresponsible,'' said Sarah Pinter, a sophomore. ``They made it
sound like students couldn't build it by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission member Veronica Kastrin Callaghan said the collapse,
which killed 12 and injured 27, stemmed from physical failures
driven by decades of poor organization by faculty and students.
</P>
<P>
   She said the panel found safe bonfire construction was ``beyond
the capability of student leaders,'' and that hazing, alcohol use,
horseplay and minor accidents were ignored and tolerated throughout
the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Will Clark complained that the commission, which had
promised not to lay blame, blasted the university and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to hear causes and not to hear blame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M University President Ray Bowen said earlier he would
resign if investigators blamed school administrators for the
accident. But he did not directly answer questions about that
statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cantrell, a 1991 alumnus who sells high-tech equipment in
Austin, said Tuesday's results vindicate Bowen because they spread
the blame among numerous school officials and students over many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the findings that student leaders did not have the
knowledge or skills to make engineering and construction decisions,
Cantrell said the school was right to allow the students' autonomy
because student control of the bonfire is a critical component of
the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you had a professional group come in and build
bonfire, it would absolutely not be the same,'' Cantrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell's wife Dannielle, an Austin real estate agent who heads
the Capital City A&AMP;M Club, agreed that Bowen and his administration
weren't to blame, saying the collapse was ``many years in the
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell said Tuesday's report should mark the end of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why there would be any kind of criminal
investigation,'' said Dannielle Cantrell, who graduated in 1993.
``I'm not sure what else you would investigate. I'm not sure who
else you would bring in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Governor Rick Perry, who graduated in 1972, made it clear
that he, too, wants the bonfire to continue. But he sounded a more
cautious note, saying ``if Bonfire is to continue, significant
design, procedural, and cultural changes must be made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a former Texas A&AMP;M student myself, I want to see serious
safety and oversight measures put in place so that this unifying
tradition can continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who didn't attend A&AMP;M, also urged
university officials ``to review and act on the findings so that we
do everything we can to make sure such a tragedy never happens
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominant feeling in Aggieland on Tuesday may have been
relief _ because the report at least leaves open the possibility of
the continuation of the tradition. Bowen will make that
determination in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see taking away something that's so much of what we
are,'' said Amie Jeffryes, a 20-year-old sophomore at A&AMP;M.

TWO MEN CHARGED IN KILLING OF NEW JERSEY RABBI'S WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Two New Jersey men who the authorities said were
paid to kill the wife of a prominent rabbi in Cherry Hill were
formally charged Tuesdau and ordered held without bail, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that both men had confessed to their roles in
the murder of Carol Neulander, 52, who was bludgeoned to death in
her living room more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, 59, was the only suspect
charged in his wife's murder, a crime that has profoundly shaken
his former congregation, the largest in southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said they believe the rabbi wanted his wife
dead so he could continue his affair with a woman who had a radio
talk show in Philadelphia. The woman, Elaine Soncini, was
pressuring him to end his marriage, and prosecutors say he feared
divorce proceedings would bring out allegations of infidelity,
threatening his position as leader of M'Kor Shalom, the synagogue
he had founded 20 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the rabbi's lawyers said Tuesday that Neulander,
the owner of two local bakeries, was killed during a robbery, and
that their client was not connected to her death.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, who is free on $400,000 bail, had been facing trial
next month on murder and conspiracy charges. With the new
revelations, Dennis Wixted, one of Neulander's lawyers, said he
would ask the judge for more time.
</P>
<P>
   The two men arrested Tuesday, Leonard Jenoff, 54, of
Collingswood, and Paul M. Daniels, 26, of Pennsauken, are being
held at the Camden County Jail on charges of murder and conspiracy
to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   An unsparing confession by Jenoff, a friend of Neulander's,
added a new dimension to a crime already brimming with lurid
detail. An account of the confession was reported Tuesday by The
Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, who worked as a private investigator, said he believed
he was being paid to kill an anti-Israeli terrorist, according to
prosecutors. Neulander, Jenoff told them, had said that such a
crime would be forgiven by God. In addition to a promised payment
of $30,000, the rabbi, he said, offered to help find him a job with
Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. Only after hearing a news
account of the crime the next morning did he learn the true
identity of his victim, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although both men were charged with murder, Jenoff did not carry
out the crime as intended. At the last minute, paralyzed by fear,
he offered $7,500 to Daniels, his roommate at the time, to do the
deed.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's lawyer, Francis J. Hartman, said his client had
confessed because he was overwhelmed by feelings of guilt. ``He
knew the rabbi's trial was coming up and he was afraid he might be
acquitted, which he thought would be wrong,'' Hartman said. ``This
clearly was a spontaneous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hartman said he was disappointed that Jenoff failed to tell
him about his meeting Friday with the Camden County prosecutor, Lee
Solomon. ``He thought he was being given immunity, which was not
the case,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Reinert, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said that Jenoff
had never been promised leniency for his cooperation. ``Will he get
some consideration down the road? I have no idea,'' Jenoff said.
``It was a horrible crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, he added, has not ruled out seeking the death penalty
for all three defendants.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's arraignment, Daniels told Judge Linda Rosenzweig of
State Superior Court that he was unemployed, suffering from mental
illness and living on disability payments. Daniels, who did not
have a lawyer at the hearing, was ordered held on $400,000 bail.
Jenoff's bail was set at $200,000.

NEW YORK SENATE RACE: MAYOR IS ILL AND GOVERNOR IS COY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Where are those charred bits of zeppelin?
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Gov. George E. Pataki said, ``I would think
it's more likely that the Hindenburg would come back together than
I would step down as governor and become senator.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, he repeatedly refused to rule out entering the race
for U.S. Senate if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was forced, because of
his prostate cancer, to drop out. The governor stressed that he
expected the mayor to remain in the race, and beyond that, he said,
``I'm not going to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's ambiguous statements troubled some prominent
Republicans who said they worried that the remarks might detract
from the efforts made by Giuliani and his aides to present the
image of a campaign running full throttle and planning to stay that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, Michael McKeon, Pataki's press
secretary, called a reporter, clearly exercised at the idea that
the governor's comments might become the basis of a news article.
``This is not him playing games,'' he said. ``This is him having
belief and faith in Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Giuliani's campaign loudly trumpeted a new appointment
and the mayor and his advisers talked about their efforts to win
the endorsement of the Conservative Party. Bruce Teitelbaum, the
mayor's campaign manager, made the 2{-hour drive here from New York
City on Tuesday to announce that Brendan Quinn, executive director
of the state Republican Party, had been named Giuliani's statewide
field director.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, that would hardly be the stuff of a news conference.
But the race, which pits the mayor against Hillary Rodham Clinton,
has been no ordinary campaign, especially since the mayor disclosed
his illness last week.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum all but said that the appointment, which formalized a
role that Quinn had already been playing, signaled that Giuliani
was in the race to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, whose job description includes coordinating campaign
events with county chairmen and elected officials around the state,
is a natural choice to plug Giuliani into the resources of the
state party, and to quell the fears of Republicans upstate, who
complain that the mayor has not campaigned aggressively enough,
especially in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that he planned to meet with Michael R.
Long, chairman of the Conservative Party. Long has all but ruled
out nominating Giuliani, in large part because the mayor has
refused to drop his opposition to attempts to ban the abortion
procedure that opponents call partial birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to change my position but beyond that I am not
going to discuss the meeting,'' Giuliani said. He said the timing
of the meeting had nothing to do with his announcement last
Thursday that tests showed he had prostate cancer, or with Sunday's
disclosure statement by a former congressman, Joseph J. DioGuardi,
that he intended to pursue the Conservative nomination. Still, the
mayor's announcement on Monday that he, too, planned to pursue the
nomination, and his statement on Tuesday that he would meet with
Long, seemed aimed at reinforcing the impression that his is a
vigorous campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Republicans complained that the comments by Pataki,
whose relationship with the mayor has been strained, would undercut
that impression. Giuliani has said that until he decides on a
course of treatment over the next few weeks, he cannot say
definitively whether he will stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was asked Tuesday morning at a news conference here
whether he thought he might run for Senate, after all, given the
mayor's ill health. ``I believe that Mayor Giuliani's going to
run,'' he said, adding, ``I'm not going to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked three times if that meant he was ruling out a
campaign, but did not answer directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very strongly supportive of the mayor, and I'm hopeful
that the mayor will make the decision to stay in the race,'' he
said. ``I don't believe that he will find that there's any
impediment to his candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time around, he said: ``I love being governor. I want
to stay as governor. But I'm not going to speculate as to what may
or may not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later why Pataki did not just say no, he would not run _
and, while he was at it, scold reporters for asking inappropriate
questions _ Zenia Mucha, his chief political adviser, said: ``He
doesn't rule in or out anything. It's not in his nature.''

AD COLUMN: MERGER POINTS TO INCREASED USE OF MEDIA SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when Madison Avenue was looking for the latest merger
developments from Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., another giant agency
company, the B Com3 Group in Chicago, generated some merger news of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   B Com3 _ formed this year when the Leo Group and the MacManus
Group combined and then sold a 20 percent interest to Dentsu in
Tokyo _ said Tuesday that it would merge its media services
agencies, Starcom Worldwide and Mediavest Worldwide, to form a
media planning and buying behemoth named the Starcom Mediavest
Group. (The name may be prosaic, but at least it's not puzzling
like B Com3 ).
</P>
<P>
   Starcom Mediavest will handle media services for accounts with
billings estimated at $16.6 billion. That figure would place the
newly merged agency second among all media brands in worldwide
billings handled, behind only Mindshare, part of the WPP Group, at
$17 billion. Among the major multinational clients of Starcom
Mediavest are blue-chip marketers like Coca-Cola, General Motors,
Kellogg, Mars, Philip Morris and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The merger points to the intensified focus on media services as
a critical tool for agencies in trying to sell goods and services
to increasingly choosy consumers. Media planning and buying were
not so important in the days when the choice of big television
networks on which to run a commercial was limited to ABC, CBS and
NBC, and the choice of large national magazines in which to run an
advertisement was limited to Collier's, Life, Look and The Saturday
Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the right media, you won't get the message through,''
said Bob Brennan, 41, the chief operating officer at Starcom who
will hold that post at Starcom Mediavest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack and I often talk how we're on the verge of a nuclear arms
race among media agencies,'' Brennan said, referring to Jack Klues,
45, the chief executive at Starcom who will become chief executive
at Starcom Mediavest. ``This industry is going to consolidate
rapidly and war is going to begin. We want to go into the war with
as big an arsenal as we can find.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to a theater near you, will be ``Dr. Strangead or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Infomercial.''
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, the separate offices of Starcom, formed in
1997 by Leo, and Mediavest, formed by MacManus last year, will be
combined by Jan. 1, 2001, and operate under the Starcom moniker.
That has already taken place in Mexico. In others, including China
and Greece, joint ventures were formed to handle media duties for
P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   In some markets, however, Mediavest and Starcom will operate
separately, either because of conflicts preventing a merger or the
success of the individual media brands. In North America, for
instance, Mediavest will continue handling media for the Burger
King unit of Diageo and Continental Airlines, while Starcom will
continue handling media for McDonald's and Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   If those conflicts were ever to be resolved, ``we can instantly
consolidate,'' Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   And in markets like Britain, where ``there's tremendous
opportunity to grow the two brands,'' he added, ``we can always
consolidate systems and nonproprietary research.''
</P>
<P>
   Starcom Mediavest will be run by a chief executive team of
Klues, Brennan and Kevin Malloy, 36, the chief operating officer at
Mediavest. Malloy will become executive vice president for
international operations at Starcom Mediavest and the chief
executive at Mediavest North America.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moore, who had come out of retirement to lead Mediavest
after Irwin Gotlieb, its president, left to join Mindshare last
summer, will relinquish the reins again, as of July 1. Moore, 62,
will remain on the Starcom Mediavest board.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Mediavest and Starcom brings the Leo-MacManus saga
full circle. The two had initially met in 1998 to discuss merging
only their media agencies, but the talks bogged down primarily
because of disagreements between Gotlieb and his counterparts at
Starcom.
</P>
<P>
   After Gotlieb defected to Mindshare, Roger Haupt, the incoming
chief executive at Leo, contacted Roy J. Bostock, chairman and
chief executive at MacManus, to propose merging the holding
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things come to those who wait, I guess,'' Brennan said,
laughing, then pausing to add: ``And plan and fight and are
tenacious about their futures.''

U.S. TO ANNOUNCE STEPS TO TOUGHEN POLICY ON GENE-ALTERED FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plans to announce Wednesday that it
is strengthening its policy on regulating the safety of genetically
engineered foods, an administration official said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, biotechnology companies would be required to
talk to regulators at the Food and Drug Administration about the
safety of the foods before they are sold, the official said. Under
the current policy, that discussion is voluntary, leading critics
to say that regulators may not even know about all of the
genetically engineered foods being sold.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest food companies had asked for the change to
help calm growing consumer fears about the safety of such foods,
which are now included as ingredients in most processed foods sold
in American supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to increase consumer confidence in the food
supply,'' said the official, who would speak only on the condition
of not being named.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer groups criticized the plan Tuesday night,
saying it did not go far enough. The groups have demanded that such
foods be labeled and tested for safety before they are approved for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking is not testing,'' said Andrew Kimbrell, director of
the Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest trade group of food companies quickly
praised the administration's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the steps as they have been outlined to us are
appropriate and responsive to the discussions that we've been
having with FDA officials and other government officials,'' said
Gene Grabowski, vice president for communications at the trade
group, the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane E. Henney, the FDA's administrator, is expected to
announce the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also expected to ask for comments on new
guidelines for food companies that want to label their products as
being free of genetically engineered ingredients. Without those
guidelines, regulators can easily challenge companies that try to
label their foods.

`F' FOR KANSAS CITY SCHOOLS ADDS TO THE DISTRICT'S WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite spending more than $2 billion over two decades to
improve education and attract more white students, the Kansas City
School District has essentially been judged a failure by a state
education review board, which has denied it accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of state accreditation on Monday, public schools
in Kansas City, Mo., took another blow to its battered image.
Despite long and ambitious efforts stemming from a 1977
desegregation lawsuit, it remains a district where about 75 percent
of its students are members of racial minorities and where test
scores remain low.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Board of Education removed the status of
accreditation after the Kansas City schools failed to meet any of
11 performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Demps Jr., the superintendent of schools, vowed earlier
this week to aggressively win back accreditation, saying, ``We have
been preparing to face the challenge it brings.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the district had seen improvements in the attendance
rate lately and had already begun several new strategies at
improving education, including a move for more demanding standards
on literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the Kansas City schools, and the long court
remedies designed to improve education and more fully integrate the
schools, have long been a centerpiece in the national debate over
race, test scores and the competing notions of raising academic
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of accreditation means the district has two years to
raise test scores, improve graduation rates and make progress in
other areas or face the prospect of a takeover by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the state board also means that children in the
Kansas City School District can leave for suburban schools, and
that the Kansas City District would be forced to pay tuition and
transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of accreditation came as no surprise. The board decided
last fall to strip the status from the Kansas City District,
effective May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known this day was coming since last November,'' Demps
said on Monday, promising improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Grant, an executive vice president of the Urban League in
Kansas City, expressed concern that a ``panic environment'' would
lead many parents to withdraw their children from the city's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that serious problems endure in the district,
Grant said the state could have aggressively demanded improvements
without deeming the district a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that while the school district had spent lavishly on
new facilities and had instituted programs like those at a Greek
studies magnet school, designed largely to attract suburban
students, not enough attention has been paid to basic learning in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The district has used magnet schools since 1985, allowing
certain schools to concentrate on special disciplines, a system
that was intended to increase the number of suburban students
volunteering to attend the city schools. Of the 37,000 students in
the Kansas City District, about 2,000 live in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Adams, whose daughter will graduate from a Kansas City
high school this year, blamed the district for putting too much
emphasis on the racial makeup of the schools, rather than
concentrating on academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a lawyer who is black, said greater racial integration
would have come naturally if the district had focused more keenly
on making the schools better, regardless of the racial makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove accreditation, he said, is ``stigmatizing
and embarrassing to students and staff at the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a federal judge dismissed the desegregation suit,
saying the district had done all it could to end racial
segregation. But an appeals court reinstated the case in January,
noting enduring gaps between white and black students on test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The district failed each of 11 performance indicators, including
test scores, dropout rate and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Kansas City schools are failing. The district's
college preparatory school has some of the best test scores in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans in Missouri have long been critics of the
Kansas City School District, complaining that it was receiving a
disproportionate share of state money.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed bill in the Missouri Legislature would split the
district into five smaller units. Proponents of the measure say
smaller schools would be easier to manage.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Carson Ross, a Republican, noted that the two biggest
districts in the state, Kansas City and St. Louis, had the most
severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City District has also been forced to compete with a
growing number of charter schools, which are run independently.
Some 15 charter schools now operate in Kansas City, with requests
pending for two more in the next academic year.

   TV-SHELFLIFE (Undated) _ Maybe a short attention span is the

ALBANY ACCORD ON DEBT PLAN CLEARS WAY FOR PASSING BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and state legislative leaders
announced an agreement Tuesday to restrict the state's
much-maligned borrowing practices, clearing the way for final
passage of one of the timeliest state budgets in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had refused to sign off on a final budget deal until a
debt reform package was agreed on. The proposal hammered out
Tuesday would for the first time impose a cap on the amount of debt
that the state could carry at any one time. The deal on debt limits
means that the Legislature will be able to begin passing budget
bills in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The debt issue is critically important to Pataki, a Republican,
in large part because he has been facing sharp criticism from
conservative groups and independent budget analysts for expanding
the state's overall indebtedness, even as the state has amassed
multibillion-dollar budget surpluses from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   New York's debt has grown by more than 30 percent in the six
years since the governor took office, bringing the total to more
than $37 billion, the largest for any state in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The debt is one of the major reasons that the state's credit
rating on Wall Street is among the poorest in the nation. It is
also forcing the state to spend nearly $4 billion a year on debt
service.
</P>
<P>
   The budget that Pataki and the leaders agreed upon calls for
spending $77.5 billion to provide hefty spending increases for
education, health care, transportation, public colleges and
universities and other programs. The finished product reflects the
state's continued economic prosperity, relying heavily on the
surging tax revenues that are largely generated by huge profits on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also provides a bounty of new tax cuts that would
save New Yorkers $1.3 billion a year when fully phased in over the
next four years. The biggest part is $330 million to reduce a tax
on utility companies that is passed on to consumers each month. The
package also establishes tax deductions for college tuition costs,
provides tax credits for low-wage workers and gives new tax breaks
to married couples whose marital status raises their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Pataki said the budget struck a
balance between new spending and tax cuts. He also said the plan to
restrict the state's rapidly growing borrowing would help place the
state on firm financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget includes the most fundamental debt reform in the
history of New York State,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget was due on April 1, but for the 16th
consecutive year, the Legislature and the governor failed to meet
that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement reached Tuesday almost certainly means that
the governor and the leaders will complete their work this year
earlier than they have in recent memory. Last year, for example,
the budget was adopted on Aug. 4 _ 126 days overdue.
</P>
<P>
   To breach the gap between the deadline and this week's action,
the Legislature had to pass contingency budgets that kept spending
at last year's levels. While the delay does not cost the taxpayers
more, it does impose hardship on localities, particularly school
districts that need to know the amount of state money to plan their
own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides said the general fund budget, which consists of
revenues from state taxes and fees that are not committed to
specific purposes, would rise about 4.7 percent, or nearly $1.8
billion more than last year's $37 billion. The governor had
proposed a 2.3 percent, or nearly $1 billion, increase in general
fund spending.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's total state spending would increase by about
$4.1 billion, or 5.7 percent, to $77.5 billion, according to
another calculation. That calculation includes federal money that
passes through the state budget and other money that is not
included in the general fund. Pataki had proposed an increase of
5.5 percent, or $3.9 billion, in total state spending.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and the Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and
Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, predicted
that the entire budget would be passed as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest spending increase in the budget goes to education.
It provides a record $1.2 billion, or 8.7 percent, rise in state
aid to public school districts statewide, bringing the total amount
spent on education to about $13 billion. New York City is expected
to receive about $400 million of the total increase.

A FRACTIOUS SNUCK IN TO SKIP DERBY
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: fraction in final section spelled out _ 59 and two-fifths
seconds) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Snuck In was withdrawn from the Kentucky Derby
on Tuesday after a fast but unruly workout and, on the eve of the
post-position draw, the outside gates may be in demand for the
126th running of the race on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Asmussen, the trainer of Snuck In, the Arkansas Derby
runner-up, decided not to enter the colt following a swift
59-second breeze at five furlongs. The time was crisp, but Asmussen
was not pleased with how Snuck In repeatedly tossed his head and
fought his exercise rider, Krissie Knorr.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing it with the owners, Bob and Lee Ackerley of
Ackerley Brothers Farms, they decided to wait until the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work wasn't exactly what I wanted,'' Asmussen said of
Snuck In, who missed training time over the winter with an
abscessed hoof. ``We know he's fast. But the style he has now is
not the style to be successful in a race like the Kentucky Derby.
He needs to take a deep breath and relax. You don't see horses in
an argument early in the Derby who are there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The colt's withdrawal means Godolphin's China Visit will
probably make what is expected to be a full 20-horse field. With no
graded stakes earnings, the Dubai-based colt came here hoping for
defections. He has picked up two victories in his only official
starts, though he recently won a trial race in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very disappointing to come all the way here and
not get in,'' said China Visit's assistant trainer, Tom Albertrani,
who was here last year with Worldly Manner for Godolphin. ``It's
always exciting to be here and race and be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   POST-POSITION POKER
</P>
<P>
   When the post positions are drawn in a two-tiered system
intended to create television interest, look for trainers to send
their horses to the outside: three of the last five Kentucky Derby
winners have raced from the auxiliary gate, including the 1999
winner, Charismatic, who broke from post No.16. The trainers must
draw a low number to get an advantageous draft selection.
</P>
<P>
   In the first draw, for example, if the early favorite, Fusaichi
Pegasus, draws the No.1, then his trainer, Neil Drysdale, will
choose his post from the 20 spots.
</P>
<P>
   After a roughly ridden race in last year's full field and plenty
of speed going postward on Saturday, the trainer Todd Pletcher is
looking for middle-to-outside spots for his four horses _ More Than
Ready, Graeme Hall, Trippi and Impeachment. ``It looks like when
the gates spring, the momentum pinballs everyone inside,'' he said.
``You can get squeezed or roughed up pretty early. If you're
outside you have a better chance of staying clear.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas agrees. The trainer of Charismatic, last year's
Derby winner, is looking for his fifth Kentucky Derby winner and
believes his top colt and front-runner, High Yield, will be better
served from the outside, where he also won with Thunder Gulch from
post 16 in 1995 and Grindstone from post 15 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win it from anywhere,'' Lukas said. ``The one thing I
definitely don't want is a couple of young jockeys who aren't
proven in this race on either side of me.''
</P>
<P>
   BLINKERS OFF CAPTAIN STEVE
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, who won the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at
Churchill Downs last fall, continued to look better than his record
this year has indicated. The chestnut colt, owned and trained by
the team that won the 1998 Derby with Real Quiet _ Mike Pegram and
Bob Baffert _ skipped over the oval in an effortless 59 and
two-fifths seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time the colt, who has not won this year,
worked without blinkers, but this time by design. Last week,
Baffert forgot to put the equipment before a workout. Now Captain
Steve will abandon them altogether after seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked great,'' Baffert said. ``He worked today without
blinkers and he'll run Saturday without them. The last couple of
times he ran, the riders said he seemed to get edgy and a little
hot going to the gate. So we took the blinkers off for his workout
the other day and left them off again today. He's more focused now
with the racing experience he's had and I don't think he needs them
anymore.'' &QL;

NASCAR PUNISHES MAYFIELD TEAM FOR ILLEGAL FUEL AT TALLADEGA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield and his team were penalized Tuesday by Nascar
officials, receiving suspensions, fines and a loss of points for
using illegal fuel in a Winston Cup Series race in Talladega, Ala.,
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tough penalties, which included the second-largest fine in
Nascar history, came two days after Mayfield won the biggest race
of his career in the NAPA Auto Parts 500 in Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who drives a Ford Taurus, had 151 driver points taken
away, dropping him from 7th place to 14th in the Winston Cup
standing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kranefuss, who operates the team that he owns with Roger
Penske, was fined $50,000. He and the crew chief, Peter Sospenzo,
were suspended until June 6, or for three races.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, Nascar's chief operating officer, announced the
penalties from the association's Daytona Beach, Fla., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a routine postrace fuel sampling, we found a foreign
substance in the fuel of the No. 12 car following the race at
Talladega,'' he said in a statement. ``We took several fuel
samples, and the sample from the No. 12 car read considerably
different than the sample that was taken from our fuel source on
site.''
</P>
<P>
   An improper additive _ an oxygen enhancer that boosts horsepower
_ was discovered in the fuel tank of Mayfield's car, Nascar
officials said. Both Mayfield and Kranefuss issued apologetic
statements from their headquarters in Mooresville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all embarrassed, and we're all going to make sure
nothing like this happens again,'' Mayfield said. ``There were some
things that were done wrong. But we're going to work to get back to
where we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Kranefuss said that disciplinary action has been taken within
the team and he apologized to the team's fans, sponsors and
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made and there were certainly some errors in
judgment,'' he said. ``People make mistakes, but we have to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Kranefuss said the additive had been put in the gas tank by an
unidentified crew member.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield was unaware of what the crew member had done, Nascar
officials said.

L.A. FANS SEND THE RIGHT MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital) Today's I-love-L.A. edition of The Sporting Muse:
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   - The moonshot at Dodgers Stadium Monday was the prettiest I've
seen at a Dodgers game since 1959, when Wally Moon was sending
moonshots over the Chinese Wall at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing anyone should do is suggest that it is OK for a
fan to run on the field for any purpose. But as succinct messages
go, the 24-year-old fan who dropped trou and played Butthead to
John Rocker's Beavis couldn't have made his point better.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the overall reaction by fans in attendance to the
appearance of the loose-lipped Braves reliever was heartening. L.A.
stepped up and booed Rocker lustfully, letting him know what they
thought of his character assassination of a cross-section of
America in a December issue of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The mooning by Andrew Tellers of Bellflower was a much more
effective message than a rowdy chorus of ``Rocker sucks'' or any
other verbal epitath that fans shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Tellers was charged with a misdemeanor, delaying a sporting
event, and faces a court appearances May 22. But he'll likely have
no problem paying any fine.
</P>
<P>
   A friend seated in the same area as Tellers, in the field boxes
along first base, said fans in the area were passing bills to a
buddy of Tellers so he could make bail and pay his fine. ...
</P>
<P>
   -The down side of Monday's mooning is the prospect of other,
less discriminating fans deciding to play copycat. Since seeing
Monica Seles get stabbed by a fan, the sight of a fan running on a
field has an element of fear that needs to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And some fans do go overboard. Last week in San Diego, Braves
players caught some Padres fans throwing marbles at Rocker and
other players. When Rocker ran onto the field Monday, some Dodger
fans launched full bottles of water at him, water readily available
at some concession stands.
</P>
<P>
   If laid-back Southern California fans are found throwing marbles
and water bottles, one can only imagine the potential nightmare
when Rocker shows up in Philadelphia and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope that's as bad as it gets,'' Braves manager Bobby
Cox said. ...
</P>
<P>
   -JaRon Rush is a nice young man, and I wish the ex-Bruin well as
he attempts the jump to the NBA. His family concerns are as much a
reason for his departure as the NCAA's pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments Tuesday underscores the myopic view many young
athletes have about college.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking responsibility for accepting money from a
scumbag summer agent, and for having a child long before he's
capable of supporting him, he blamed things on NCAA rules that
doesn't put any money into the pockets of players.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the spartan life as a college student-athlete
on a full scholarship, Rush said ``You just sit around bored all
day long and don't have any money to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess the thought of killing time by attending classes, doing
homework and making progress toward a degree didn't come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA needs to consider stipends to stem the early flood of
players to the NBA and NFL and to address the galling disparity
between its TV revenue ($6 billion deal with CBS) and direct
athletic subsidies ($0).
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps a better solution would be eliminating athletic
scholarships altogether. Take away the free ride and force
student-athletes to qualify and show progress like any other
student and you eliminate a lot of student-athletes who could care
less about the student part. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Back to baseball: The game would be a lot more interesting if
more pitchers adopted the philosopy of Boston's Pedro Martinez and
drove batters off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was labeled a headhunter while in Montreal, but anyone
with the control he has knew exactly what he was doing this week
when he put a fastball under the chin of Cleveland's Einar Diaz. He
was informing the Indians that the plate was his. If there were
more pitchers like him, maybe we wouldn't be kvetching about
homermania. ...
</P>
<P>
   -There were 931 home runs hit in the month of April, 195 more
than last year and an all-time major league baseball record. Now
imagine what that total would be if there hadn't been so many
snowouts and rainouts. The all-time one-month record is 980, set
last May and destined to fall this May. ...
</P>
<P>
   -The rich get richer: The Yankees apparently hold the early lead
in trading for Minnesota Twins pitcher Brad Radke this June or
July. They have moved off their can't-touch position regarding
infielder Alfonso Soriano, a natural shortstop whose path in New
York is blocked until, say, 2015, by Derek Jeter. ...
</P>
<P>
   -The Angels Darin Erstad will win the A.L. batting title. Since
he's hitting .449, that's not exactly a wild prediction, but I have
always thought Erstad was the kind of hitter who wins batting
crowns. But I still think he would provide even more offense for
the Angels if he hit third rather than leadoff. ...
</P>
<P>
   -NBA scuttlebutt: Spies say Tim Duncan will likely stay in San
Antonio and spurn free agent offers. They also say ex-Laker Eddie
Jones will aggressively pursue a new home because he wants to play
on a team with a title in its future. Would it be greedy to wonder
if he'd consider a return to Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   Insiders also say that while Vince Carter is the truth, he isn't
6-7 as he's listed in the NBA Register and he doesn't come close to
soaring as high or as far as Michael Jordan. He can be fronted,
something no one dared do against Jordan unless he liked being
dunked on. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Tiger Woods went on strike this week and didn't shoot any
commercials, because he happens to be a member of the striking
Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which raises the question if athletes
aren't due some kind of residual benefit since they play on TV so
often.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they need the money, of course, but you know it's only
a matter of time. ...

 &HT;    Construction and organization blamed for Bonfire tragedy
 &HT;    By Mike Ward and Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Construction mistakes by Texas A&AMP;M
University students and design flaws undetected for decades caused
the Aggie bonfire to collapse last November like a barrel that had
lost its hoops, an investigation of the accident concluded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And while assigning no blame for the Nov. 18 accident that
killed 12 and injured 27, the 700-page report _ which cost an
estimated $1.8 million and took four months to complete _ contained
a blistering denunciation of the lack of supervision by A&AMP;M
officials of the student-run project, criticizing what it called
``tunnel vision in decision making'' and a cultural bias at Texas'
second-largest university that allowed safety problems to go
uncorrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no one person is responsible for the collapse, the
aggregate effect of actions and decisions by students and
university officials over many years created the physical
conditions that made the collapse possible,'' the report states.
``In the commission's view, the evidence of ongoing problems with
Bonfire is so overwhelming that collectively these problems should
have triggered a broader re-examination of Bonfire _ one that
included Bonfire design and construction. Unfortunately, that did
not occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Linbeck Jr., a Houston construction executive who headed the
five-member investigating panel, said he hopes the report will spur
change. The report contained no recommendation on whether the
bonfire should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas A&AMP;M continues this without change, it would do
violence to the tradition of A&AMP;M,'' he said, stressing that the
90-year tradition can be built safely if changes are made. ``Some
good can come from the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen, who sat solemnly as the report was
presented Tuesday to a crowd of 1,500 students and officials in
Reed Arena, the university's basketball stadium, promised a
decision within six weeks on whether the bonfire will continue.
University officials said more than 200 reporters from nearly 50
news outlets were covering the event, including representatives of
national news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do continue to have a bonfire it will be appropriate to
change the culture. That's essential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said his decision will be based on what is best for the
university, its students and families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not made up my mind. It may be that we will continue
the bonfire. It may be that we will not continue the bonfire,''
Bowen said. ``I've said in a number of forums, if I had to let my
heart make the decision, we'd have a bonfire. My heart will not
make the decision. My brain has to make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though Bowen was emphatic that no decision on bonfire
has been made, students in the audience during the presentation and
a press conference afterward made it clear _ shouting ``whoop''
when they agreed with speakers, hissing loudly when they disagreed
_ that they hope there is a bonfire next November. In fact, A&AMP;M's
campus paper, The Batallion, reported Tuesday that students have
begun organizing for the next bonfire, despite a ban imposed by A&AMP;M
officials on such activities.
</P>
<P>
   Held each November on the eve of Texas A&AMP;M's football game with
archrival University of Texas, the bonfire annually draws tens of
thousands of Aggie diehards to College Station in what is billed as
a demonstration of Aggie's school spirit and ``burning desire'' to
beat t.u. _ a derogatory Aggie reference to UT. Through the years,
the bonfire has grown from a small, impromptu trash fire into a
teepee of logs into a wedding-cake-shaped fire.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the deadly chain of events began
shortly after 2:30 a.m. when baling wire that was used to hold
together the first tier of logs on the unfinished, four-tier
bonfire began breaking apart.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that the student-builders had wedged too
many logs from the second tier into the top of the first _ a move
they thought would make the log stack more structurally stable,
since the logs were more crooked than usual.
</P>
<P>
   But what they did not realize was that the bonfire was built on
ground sloping slightly to the southeast, that the second stack was
built lopsided in that direction and that the whole bonfire was
being built more vertically than in some past years _ all factors
that, the report concluded, worked together to fuel the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds after the wires began snapping, logs began
falling away from the southeast side of the first tier. The second
tier shifted and began to fall. And the centerpole snapped between
those tiers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the whole bonfire began to fall to the southeast, snapping
one of the four ropes anchoring the top of the centerpole and
breaking the centerpole off at the ground. Within seconds, it broke
again as the log pile fell _ its top ending atop of the pile in the
opposite direction of the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the stack of logs weighed an estimated 2 million pounds
_ more than twice as much as a 747 jumbo jet, the report said. Most
of the victims were killed instantly, police said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This collapse happened very quickly,'' said commission member
Hugh Robinson, the chairman of a Dallas construction management
company. ``Eyewitnesses were stunned at how fast the stack fell to
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, steel cables had been wrapped around the first
tier. But the report disclosed that student construction leaders
decided not use them last fall because they thought using them
might cause the bonfire to burn faster. Using them, Linbeck said,
might have reduced, but not eliminated, the risk of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wiring itself was found to be a variety of strength, the
individual character itself was insufficient to stand the
stresses,'' he said. ``The lack of cabling around the stack on the
first level removed one of the factors of safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The report described the baling wire and cable as acting like
hoops on a barrel. Without the hoops, and with the pressure of the
second stack pressing down upon it, the first stack fell apart as
would a barrel's unrestrained wooden slats.
</P>
<P>
   The report ruled out as contributing factors the centerpole, the
soil beneath the bonfire, the guy ropes and an accident a few days
before the tragedy in which a crane hit a cross-tie on the
centerpole. It also ruled out sabotage and an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the report notes, the design of the bonfire
had changed gradually from a teepee of logs in the 1940s to a
multi-tiered teepee that, by 1969, had reached a record height of
more than 109 feet. By the late 1970s, the bonfires had begun to
more resemble a wedding cake _ six tiers high bound with wire, 60
to 80 feet tall and a two-part spliced centerpole.
</P>
<P>
   But the report states those changes were made with little
consideration of structural issues since there were no blueprints
or designs, most of the student-builders had no experience or
expertise and university officials ineffectively supervised the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical failure and casual factors were driven by an
organizational failure,'' the report states. ``This failure, which
had its roots in decisions and actions by both students and
university officials over many years, created an environment in
which a complex and dangerous structure was allowed to be built
without adequate physical or engineering controls.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the report notes, the bonfire project was plagued by
problems with hazing, harassment of workers, drinking by students,
fighting and other misbehavior _ conduct that the report said had
contributed to accidents and injuries that, between 1996 and 1998
alone, increased by 80 percent. ``In the experience of the
investigation team, Texas A&AMP;M is unique in allowing this level of
irresponsible behavior in and around a construction project of this
magnitude,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   And while those problems were ``not relevant to the collapse,''
the report states, they were part of a larger problem with Aggie
culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of a written bonfire design or construction
methodology,'' the report states, was an important protective step
that was not taken. It characterized the project as ``a world in
which design decisions are made with no written guidance, no formal
reviews and no knowledge of critical design factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Texas A&AMP;M's engineering school is among the top
ranked in the nation, its faculty never has been actively involved
in the bonfire construction. And in past years, the report says,
several ``clear warning signs about structural integrity'' were
missed by A&AMP;M officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tunnel vision in decision-making is due, in the
commission's view, to a cultural bias in which legitimate courses
of action outside past experience or contrary to the university's
pre-disposition are often not considered,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did no one consider the '69 stack as a potentially
hazardous, 10-story structure held together with bailing wire? Why
didn't anyone interpret the quick recent burn times as a problem
with wire strength?''
</P>
<P>
   An unfinished bonfire stack teetered and nearly fell over in
1994 in what university officials blamed on wet soil. On Tuesday,
commission consultant Tage Carlson said a new review of that
incident shows that it was more likely caused by wire failures much
like the 1999 collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting the university should have been more pro-active in
dealing with bonfire problems and issues, rather than reactive, the
report states that ``the evidence of ongoing bonfire problems is so
overwhelming that collectively these should have triggered a
broader overall re-examination of bonfire _ one that included
bonfire design and construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this did not occur,'' said Commission member
Veronica Kastrin Callaghan of El Paso. ``It's a true example of an
organizational accident with causes that existed for some time
before the event.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the panel found safe bonfire construction was ``beyond
the capability of student leaders and that there was no appropriate
formal design. Although investigators heard that the stack always
had been built the same way over the years, ``bonfire never was
built the same way twice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from the report, Callaghan said the ``skills and
knowledge inadequacy of student leaders cannot be easily
corrected.'' It would also be prohibitively expensive to try to
train students every year.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said that and other issues will weigh into his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central message is clear,'' Callaghan added. ``The
collapse was about physical failures driven by organizational
failures whose origins span decades of administrations, faculty and
students. No single factor caused the collapse, just as no single
change will ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again.''

BONFIRE REPORT FINDS DESIGN FLAWS, `TUNNEL VISION' 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The deadly Texas A&AMP;M University Bonfire
collapse was caused by poor design and construction methods that
were carried out for decades because of cultural myopia, which put
tradition over safety, a special commission reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally, the report pegged the causes of the accident that
killed 12 people last fall on weak wiring used to couple logs, no
steel cables to bind the lower tier of logs and crooked wood that
allowed second-stack timber to be wrongly wedged into the first. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the strongly worded 36-page report also lay blame on the
Aggie culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has a culture that instills bias and tunnel
vision in decision making. No credible source ever suspected or
thought to inquire about structural safety,'' the report said. ``No
one in the administration ever interpreted ongoing behavioral
problems as indications that safe Bonfire design and construction
was beyond the capabilities of student leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the report, at a cost of nearly $1.8 million _ funded
by interest earnings on university student fees and other non-tax
revenues _ &UR;  &LR; was applauded by both critics and friends of the
90-year-old Bonfire tradition. The five-member commission was
appointed by university President Ray Bowen immediately after the
Bonfire disaster and ordered to find the causes of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was not ordered to make recommendations, nor did it
specifically assign blame, responsibility or negligence for the
Nov. 18 tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next rests with Bowen, who plans to take at least
six weeks considering what action to take on the Bonfire after
seeking opinions from students, faculty and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   With about 3,000 people gathered in the school's Reed Arena, Leo
Linbeck Jr., the Houston construction executive who headed the
commission opened the presentation of the long-awaited report. He
got quickly to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This failure has roots in decisions and actions by both
students and university officials over many, many years. It created
an environment where a complex and dangerous structure was allowed
to be built without controls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a terse statement that kept the crowd spellbound for
more than 20 minutes, commission member Veronica Callaghan, an El
Paso businesswoman, repeatedly criticized the Aggie culture for
allowing the collapse to happen despite prior warning signals.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the 1999 Bonfire came as a total surprise to those
involved when it should not have. ``Again, this is a result of a
cultural bias and represents a management barrier failure relevant
to the collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission was especially harsh about the university's
failure to see the warning sign in 1994 when that year's structure
tilted under heavy rains and had to be pulled down. That failure
was wrongly written off simply to a rainy year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report showed that both students and university
leaders over the years did not employ the same type of safeguards
that eight other universities use for similar high-risk student
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the commission's view, the evidence of ongoing problems
with Bonfire is so overwhelming that collectively these problems
should have triggered a broader re-examination of Bonfire _ one
that included Bonfire design and construction,'' said Callaghan.
``Unfortunately, this did not occur.``
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference minutes after being told that the Aggie
culture was resistant to change and bucked criticism, hundreds of
spectators routinely hissed at reporters asking challenging
questions or let out the traditional ``whoop'' when it was
speculated Bonfire would continue.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was released during the meeting and on the
Internet, Gov. George W. Bush released a statement commending the
commission for finding answers to the tragedy, and offering
condolences to victims' families, friends and classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge university officials to review and act upon the
findings so that we do everything we can to make sure such a
tragedy never happens again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said he accepted the report and did not find fault with
any of its findings, including criticism of his and past
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept responsibility,'' said the president, an A&AMP;M
engineering graduate, who assumed his post shortly before the 1994
Bonfire failure.
</P>
<P>
   One university official who has had oversight of Bonfire, Bill
Kibler, predicted that Bonfire could continue after ``major changes
are made in the design.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can still be a student event, if the design
changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission chose five consultants who conducted 700
interviews with students, Bonfire consultants, critics and others,
as well as 250 student surveys. They also reviewed police reports,
photographs and 4,600 school documents.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants assessed the historical and current design of
Bonfire, and the historical and current cultural problems. The
result is a comprehensive document in easy-to-understand language,
which on the computer has computer-generated animation of how the
stack fell that largely satisfied even the harshest Bonfire
critics.
</P>
<P>
   The report illustrates how the design of the Bonfire changed
over the years, from a more stable Indian teepee style where timber
leaned toward the center into a more unstable wedding cake style
used since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes the construction of such a mammoth
structure by students without engineering backgrounds needed to
provide more scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the report absolves 1999 Bonfire student
leadership for blame, saying they accurately followed tradition as
they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Changes made to the 1999 Bonfire, including the increased
wedging and lack of cables, came about because the student leaders
incorrectly believed they would make it safer. Students thought
that wedging logs from the second stack into the first would
strengthen it and that not using cables would cause the fire to
burn quicker.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates that some of the preventable root causes
can be corrected. However, providing students with proper skills
may be impossible because of cost and the need to educate them
every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if they make changes, then Bonfire can continue,''
Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though alcohol abuse, hazing and other problems occurred
during construction of the 1999 Bonfire, including alcohol use the
night of the collapse, there was no evidence those factors played a
role in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, questions have been raised about the thoroughness
of a report paid for by the school. Some have criticized the
process as a way for the university to appear to have an unbiased
report, while at the same time, buying an investigation that can
later be used should the university be sued.
</P>
<P>
   None of the victims' parents have shown an inclination toward
suing the school. But that doesn't mean lawsuits won't be filed
against others involved, such as H.B. Zachry, the construction
company that provided a crane that ran into the Bonfire days before
it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck is head of Texans for Tort Reform, a group that included
Zachry officials and has been crucial in getting state laws changed
to make it harder for Texans to file punitive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Linbeck said he did not want to talk about negligence
in the Bonfire collapse saying ``negligence is a legal term.''
</P>
<P>
   However, A&AMP;M graduate and author Irwin A. Tang, whose recent
book criticizes the administration for allowing Bonfire to
collapse, said the report too conveniently spreads the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blame now lies with history,'' Tang said. ``To call it a
history of negligence on the part of the administrations makes the
negligence of this administration defensible and possibly
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be true that the university administration has only
followed tradition and allowed students to design and build the
Bonfire, but that doesn't free them from responsibility for safety
of students on their campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as proof that the A&AMP;M culture is hard to reign in,
Bowen was faced with a report in the campus newspaper that students
have started preparing for the 2000 Bonfire despite warnings not to
from university officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Battalion student paper reported that residence halls have
already selected crew chiefs and inducted them in a ceremony that
includes hazing. Bowen said he would investigate.

PAPA FOX RETURNS TO WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - Rick Fox was back with his Lakers teammates Tuesday
afternoon, having made a difficult departure for the second time in
three days.
</P>
<P>
   First, he had to leave his team in the wake of a demoralizing
Game 3 loss to be in New York with wife Vanessa Williams for the
birth of their daughter. Then he had to leave his wife and baby in
New York, less than a day after Sasha Gabriella's arrival, to make
it back for Game 4 against the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite an experience, coming from being mostly down and
drained after the loss here to the adrenaline all the way through
yesterday,'' said Fox, still wearing the hospital ID bracelet,
before Game 4. ``Both (were) similar feelings of leaving something
behind that is dear to you. This race for a championship is
something I've focused on in my life with this team now for three
years and falling short (two) years in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Williams' labor was quick, ``and she smiled through the
whole thing, which I don't know how she did.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby arrived at 1:22 EDT on Monday. By 7:30 a.m. Tuesday,
Fox was back on a plane, and he arrived in Sacramento around 4 p.m.
for the 7:30 game, hoping he could help the Lakers close out the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here is just an opportunity to, if needed, help in some
fashion,'' he said. ``I'm sure if I'm hurting us, (coach Phil
Jackson) will take me out. If I'm helping, he'll leave me in.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted the situation had him distracted, a fact evident in
Fox's brief and unproductive Game 3 performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I realized how much of it was weighing in the
back of my mind, and a lot of it, the concern of obviously having a
healthy wife and baby,'' Fox said. ``Once the baby is here and
hearing my wife say, `Look, I know it's important to you and the
Lakers and the city, besides we want to play you guys in the
finals' - she's a Knick fan - `you better get there if you can.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, her unselfishness as a wife and mother should be
recognized and made a point of, because she was the one that pushed
me out the door and wanted me to get here. Splitting your focus is
one thing but knowing that your family is most important.... But if
we don't win this game tonight, I would be pretty sick to watch it
on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Stupid radio tricks: The Kings' flagship radio station attempted
a lame stunt Tuesday morning, made even more lame by the fact it
didn't pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   The station sent someone to the Lakers' hotel at 6:15 a.m.,
trying to deliver a package to Shaquille O'Neal. The rip-roaring
hilarious contents? A free-throw shooting brochure and a children's
rhyming dictionary (to aid O'Neal's rap career). The messenger
pounded loudly on a few doors, waking up other hotel guests, but
never even made it to the right floor, much less O'Neal's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have beat them up if they knocked on my door at 6
a.m., harassing me,'' O'Neal said later. ``Quote me on that.''

NASSAU COUNTY VOTERS GIVE DEMOCRAT DECIDING SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. _ Democrats regained control of the Nassau
County Legislature on Tuesday night as Craig M. Johnson, a
Democrat, won a special election to succeed his mother, Barbara,
whose death in March had cost the party its first majority in 80
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were propelled into power in this overwhelmingly
Republican suburb in November, when concern about the county's
collapsing finances fueled a voter rebellion that ended decades of
one-party rule. But their majority was a slim one _ one vote _ and
they lost it when Ms. Johnson died of breast cancer on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   With the balance of power in Nassau County at stake, the special
election to fill her seat became a bitterly fought three-way
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Johnson, a 29-year-old bankruptcy lawyer, beat both a
Republican challenger, Linda H. Green, 52, a former North Hempstead
town clerk, and Benjamin L. Zwirn, 48, a former Democrat who ran an
insurgent campaign on the Green Party line.
</P>
<P>
   In unofficial results, with all precincts reporting, Johnson led
with 6,774 votes or 58 percent of the total, to 2,650 votes or 23
percent for Green and 2,278 votes or 19 percent for Zwirn, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank the voters of this district for having
the confidence in me, and the confidence in the Democratic Party,
as the party that can restore fiscal stability to Nassau County,''
Johnson said on Tuesday night. ``The people are tired of politics
as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Tuesday capped what can only be described as a
topsy-turvy year in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wealthy county that went broke in boom times, a
Republican stronghold that voted the Democrats into power, a place
where old alliances have been thrown out the window.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelmingly Republican county stunned the political
establishment last November, when an electorate that was angry over
the fiscal crisis, tax increases and a series of government
scandals ended decades of one-party rule in the county and gave the
Democrats a 10-to-9 majority in its legislative branch for the
first time in 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Ms. Johnson's death left the Legislature tied
9-to-9 as the county faced one of the worst fiscal crises in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, voters were still plenty angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm steamed,'' said Erika Sotiriou, 65, a registered
Republican from Strathmore who was so incensed by what she saw as
the mismanagement of the county, and her fears that further tax
increases would be required to set things right, that she voted
Democratic. ``I'm upset that thy let it go this far; now we're
going to get zonked.''
</P>
<P>
   The root of the political tumult is Nassau's financial crisis.
Years of generous labor contracts and providing high levels of
services to residents without raising taxes finally caught up with
Nassau last year when the county found itself spending more money
than it took in.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County managed to finish 1999 in the black only after
selling its hospital and using its share of the nation's settlement
with tobacco companies to plug its budget gap.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tax increase that the Republicans passed before losing
control of the Legislature in November, the county faces a $200
million budget gap this year. This has led to service cuts, fee
increases and threats to lay off county workers.
</P>
<P>
   And Nassau, which relies on bond sales to meet its expenses, has
seen its bonds downgraded to the level just above junk status,
making it the worst credit risk among wealthy suburban counties in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But putting Nassau back on its feet could entail a number of
politically risky options. Some political analysts wonder why any
party would want control of the Legislature now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans win, they get the chance to be blamed for
things a second time, and if the Democrats win, they are still
stuck with the problems,'' said Arthur J. Kremer, a former state
assemblyman, who practices law in Nassau. ``You've heard of win-win
situations? This one could be win-lose.''

SHOULDER INJURY PUTS LANGENBRUNNER ON SIDELINE

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif._ When Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner didn't
attend Monday's practice it was no big deal. It was optional.
</P>
<P>
   When he didn't last long at yesterday's morning skate, it became
a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good, but I don't know about my winger,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ``He took a hard hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the hit, given by Sharks winger Dave Lowry on
Langenbrunner shoulder in Game 2, was so hard that it prevented him
from playing in Game 3 last night. He is listed day-to-day with a
bruised shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through this all year,'' Stars winger Mike Keane
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Add Langenbrunner to the Stars' seemingly limitless ``Did Not
Play _ Injured'' list, forcing them to again shuffle their lines,
secure in the knowledge that they have skated on this patch nearly
all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to replace him,'' said Scott Thornton,
Langenbrunner's linemate. ``Hopefully it's a short term thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third period of Game 2, Langenbrunner had his
head down near the blue line when Lowry slammed into him.
Langenbrunner then retreated to the bench in obvious pain, and team
trainer Dave Surprenant attended to him.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Langenbrunner missed 11 games because of a pinched
nerve in his neck after a hit in Edmonton on Jan. 11 that caused
numbness in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effects of Lowry's hit did not prevent
Langenbrunner, who has one goal and two assists in the playoffs,
from returning later in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner was playing alongside Thornton and Nieuwendyk on
the second line, giving Nieuwendyk, the reigning Conn Smythe trophy
winner, reason to smile being paired with his close friend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, rookie and normal fourth-liner Roman Lyashenko, who was a
healthy scratch for in Games 1 or 2, is up on the second line.
</P>
<P>
   It also changes the special teams, where Langenbrunner saw
action on both the power play and penalty kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot of ways to play positionally in hockey. In that
sense, anybody can step in and do the job,'' Thornton said. ``I
don't think it's going to be that difficult to play with somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars should know. They've done it enough.

DRYSDALE DOESN'T PUSH HORSES, BUT HE GETS RESULTS

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Irony seems to gush through the life of Neil
Drysdale. The 52-year-old trainer has never run a horse in the
Kentucky Derby, but he has two horses, Fusaichi Pegasus and War
Chant, who figure to be among the Derby favorites this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday added to the irony when his election to the
Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame was announced. And possibly the
best compliment he received all day came from one of his Derby
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few trainers that I'd call a genius,'' said
Barry Irwin, the managing partner for the ownership group of The
Deputy. ``But in his own way, Neil's a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has firsthand knowledge because he has used Drysdale as a
trainer. Irwin and his partners owned Prized in 1989. The horse was
accomplished, good enough to win the Molson Million at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   That race was on dirt, and Prized never had raced on grass. That
didn't stop Drysdale from entering Prized into the Breeders' Cup
Turf. Packed into a race with the best grass horses in North
America and some of the best from Europe, horses that had spent
their careers running on turf, Prized won as a huge long shot.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to trainers D. Wayne Lukas or Bob Baffert, Drysdale
isn't as noticeable in the limelight. Though Drysdale has trained
five Eclipse Award winners, his style is less flashy than his
colleagues'. Irwin didn't send The Deputy to Drysdale because he
wanted a trainer who would be more demanding with the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Wayne's nature with his stable is to full-court press
all the time,'' said Todd Pletcher, a former assistant trainer to
Lukas who plans to run four horses in the Derby on Saturday. ``If
you want someone to train a horse like they're walking the ball up
the court, Wayne will tell you, `Don't come to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale is walking the ball up the court with Fusaichi Pegasus
and War Chant. In fact, it's almost like a four-corners offense.
Both colts are among the most lightly raced horses in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Baffert has put 11 races into Captain Steve and Lukas
has raced High Yield 12 times, Drysdale has put Fusaichi Pegasus
and War Chant through a combined nine races. No horse has won the
Derby off as few as four prep races since 1918. But Fusaichi
Pegasus has won four of his five races (he was second in the
other), and War Chant has won three of four (he, too, was second in
the other).
</P>
<P>
   So, Drysdale is unfazed by history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come here with talented horses,'' Drysdale said. ``If you
had to choose between experience and talent, I'd take talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin isn't the only owner who has had some edginess with
Drysdale's schedule. War Chant is owned by Marjorie and Irving
Cowan, who also sent War Chant's dam, Hollywood Wildcat, to
Drysdale. Hollywood Wildcat won the Breeders' Cup Distaff in 1993,
but Irving Cowan admits Drysdale's schedule frustrates him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does sometimes,'' Cowan said. ``You want to see your horse
run. I don't mean every week, but every three weeks maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue with his schedule, but you can't argue with the
results. He puts the horses first, not himself or the owners. I
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cowan knows Drysdale won't hesitate to take War Chant out of
the Derby if the colt isn't running as well as he can. He did a
similar thing in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he trained A.P. Indy, who had won the Santa Anita
Derby and figured to be the second favorite in the Kentucky Derby.
But A.P. Indy developed a small crack the size of a pinprick in his
hoof wall. Drysdale scratched A.P. Indy out of the Derby the
morning of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Drysdale brought A.P. Indy back in a prep race for
the Belmont Stakes. A.P. Indy won that, won the Belmont, won the
Breeders' Cup Classic and was named Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pattern Drysdale learned before he became a head trainer.
He was born and grew up in England. By 1970, he had come to
Southern California and started working as an assistant trainer to
Charlie Whittingham. A Hall of Famer, Whittingham won more major
races than any other trainer on the Southern California circuit,
and Drysdale was in his barn for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned masses from Charlie,'' Drysdale said. ``He was a
very good teacher, very articulate. The things that stood out were
patience and putting the horse first.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes _ every now and then, eventually _ it puts
Drysdale in first. / nn

RACING'S PLAN EARNS ENDORSEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- A plan to bring bettors back to tracks and
satellite betting outposts around the state got a ringing
endorsement from the state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.9 million plan presented Tuesday afternoon to the
California Horse Racing Board at its monthly meeting incorporates
direct marketing techniques and targeted advertising, according to
its author John Liebau.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the plan is an $800,000 database that will
track the attendance and betting habits of participating race fans.
The program is similar to those employed by Las Vegas casinos and
airlines that offer frequent flyer miles. ``By tracking our
customers and how (often) they come to the track, we're hoping we
can cause them to come more frequently than in the past,'' said
Liebau, a San Marino resident who is president of Bay Meadows
Racecourse in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success will be measured by increased attendance and
handle,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Liebau cautioned that tangible results might be a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long process,'' he said. ``The National Thoroughbred
Racing Association has been marketing our sport for three years now
and I still don't think we have the sport branded.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who praised the database was John Van de Kamp,
general counsel and chief executive for the Thoroughbred Owners of
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get the sense we are tracking our regular attendance,
this program will have statewide impact,'' Van de Kamp said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the $5.9 million will be spent on radio, television
and newspaper advertising In other business, the CHRB:
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Approved contracts for stewards and veterinarians through
2001;
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Agreed to extend for one year a drug testing agreement
with Truesdail Laboratories;
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Passed a resolution praising former CHRB chairman George
Nicholaw;
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Ordered stewards at Hollywood Park to investigate claims
by the Service Employees International Union Local 1877 that they
aren't receiving dues from assistant starters.

ARKANSAS EXECUTES A WOMAN; FIRST TIME IN EIGHT DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VARNER, Ark. _ The state of Arkansas put a woman to death on
Tuesday night for the first time since the state began performing
executions in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Christina Marie Riggs, 28, a former nurse, was put to
death by lethal injection for killing her two children, Justin, 5,
and Shelby Alexis, 2, in November 1997. Riggs admitted killing the
children, and explained that she was deeply depressed at the time.
She said she gave her son potassium chloride and morphine and when
that did not kill him, she smothered him with a pillow. Then she
smothered her daughter to death. She also tried to kill herself
with potassium chloride.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium chloride was one of the three drugs the state used in
executing Riggs on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The lethal injection was administered 9:18 p.m., CST, and Riggs
was pronounced dead at 9:28 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Before the injection was administered she made a statement that
began, ``No words can express just how sorry I am for taking the
lives of my babies. No way I can make up for or take away the pain
I have caused everyone who knew and loved them.'' After the
injection was administered, her last words were, ``I love you, my
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   At her 1998 trial, Riggs asked jurors to sentence her to death,
saying, ``I want to be with my babies. I want you to give me the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Riggs' children had become an inconvenience.
They said, for example, that she left them alone while she went to
karaoke contests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Riggs pursued appeal of her death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to beg her to file an appeal of the conviction,'' said
her lawyer, John Wesley Hall Jr. of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But she soon withdrew it. ``She just wanted to get it over
with,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs had the right to stop her execution at any time by
resuming the appeals process again, but she chose not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is virtually state-assisted suicide,'' Hall said.
``This all started with a suicide attempt, and that's how it
ended.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riggs was the only woman on death row in Arkansas, and only the
fifth woman to be executed in the United States since the death
penalty was reinstated in 1976. She is the 22nd death row inmate to
be executed in Arkansas since 1990 when the state carried out its
first execution after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death
penalty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union had
asked Gov. Mike Huckabee to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christina Riggs deserves compassion,'' said William F. Shultz,
executive director of Amnesty International USA, ``not the
executioner's needle. Her stated desire to die should only sharpen,
not absolve, the state of Arkansas's duty to show her that
compassion.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee, a Republican, could have granted Riggs a 30-day
reprieve, but he could not grant clemency, his office said, because
she had not asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a county judge ruled that Riggs was mentally
competent to make the decision to drop all her avenues of appeal.
The State Supreme Court affirmed that ruling, and the governor set
the date.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riggs' mother, Carol Thomas, as the family of both the prisoner
and the victims, had to choose between those roles and their
accompanying privileges under state law. Thomas could not both
witness the execution and visit Riggs before the execution. She
chose to visit her daughter and did not attend Tuesday night's
execution.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Hall was with Riggs in her final moments and witnessed
the execution. Afterward, he told reporters that she had told him
privately on Tuesday night, ``This is what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said he told her, ``I know.''

GOOD LUCK TO EX-BRUINS _ THEY'LL NEED IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA's storied past crossed paths with its
uncertain future Tuesday. Former Lakers superstar Magic Johnson,
toweling off in a corner of Pauley Pavilion after a pick-up game,
excused himself from a conversation with UCLA assistant coach
Michael Holton so he could address Jerome Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, along with Bruins teammate JaRon Rush, made official this
week what long has been considered a mere formality: The two
21-year-old sophomores are forgoing their final two years of
college to make themselves available for next month's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta congratulate this guy,'' Johnson said, clasping Moiso's
hand in his and flashing his patented high-voltage smile.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his back on the scene, Holton said under his breath, ``I
don't know if congratulations are in order.''
</P>
<P>
   We know exactly what Holton was saying, even if Moiso and Rush
haven't much of a clue.
</P>
<P>
   The two players would speak earnestly of working really, really
hard to prove to their critics that they can be aggressive night in
and night out (Moiso) and shoot and dribble with aplomb (Rush).
</P>
<P>
   You know, as if a little sweat is all it takes to succeed in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, as they'll surely find out, is professional
basketball isn't just an adventure, it's a job. A sometimes
thankless, occasionally dehumanizing one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson could be forgiven for glossing over the hardships with a
fraternal handshake. He came out after his sophomore year in
college, just like Moiso and Rush, and never had much reason to
look back. The difference was, Johnson stayed at Michigan State
long enough to lead his Spartans to an NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   An NCAA ring was within the reach of Moiso, Rush, point guard
Earl Watson and Co. Indeed, after advancing to the third round of
the NCAA Tournament this year, they were nicely positioned to grab
it next year.
</P>
<P>
   What a story that would have been, a worthy sequel to the
feel-good story of this year's senior-led Michigan State squad
reaching the summit last month in its third trip to the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and Rush were UCLA's answer to the Spartans' Mateen
Cleaves and Morris Peterson: Childhood friends bonded by their
shared history and goals for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Watson admitted he looked at the Spartans and saw a crystal
ball. ``That team grew together over the years,'' Watson said
Tuesday as he watched Rush and Moiso make their grand exits. ``They
took steps each year and built off them.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson's tone was unmistakably wistful. And unambiguously free
of acrimony. More than coach Steve Lavin, Watson had every reason
to resent the disappearance - poof! just like that - of the two
players that figured to be at the receiving end of most of his
passes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the complexion of his whole senior season just
changed for the worse. Watson gave Moiso and Rush his blessing.
Three years of college have taught Watson that life is what happens
while you're busily working on another script.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA would have you think its student-athletes have lives as
pure as their jump shots and handle all their responsibilities as
well as they do the basketball. The truth, of course, is murkier.
</P>
<P>
   Rush had reasons to leave school that had nothing to do with
Lavin's coaching, all those class requirements or individual greed.
</P>
<P>
   He has a 2-year-old son at home in Missouri to take care of and
the room-and-board covered by his scholarship wasn't cutting it.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe, as we do, that one of the purposes of college is
to turn imprudent kids into responsible adults, Rush's two years at
UCLA served him well. He stayed long enough to figure out the
score, on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Rush proved a quicker study than the NCAA,
which, when it isn't busy negotiating billion-dollar basketball
television contracts is putting forth the party line that a free
education is adequate remuneration for all those student-athletes
playing starring roles in its lavish productions.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, who sat out 24 games this year for accepting payments from
an AAU coach that amounted to roughly the cost of a year in the
UCLA dorms, considers himself proof that there is no such thing as
a free education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial situation the NCAA puts you in creates certain
situations (such as his),'' Rush said. ``You have players suffering
while the NCAA is making billions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush left Pauley Pavilion Tuesday with a book bag draped over
one shoulder. The backpack, of course, was but a prop; Rush hasn't
attended a class in days, since the first week of the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   We wish Rush and Moiso well but worry about that incomplete
they're taking on their college experience. It doesn't seem like a
big deal to them now. But it could prove quite a void down the
road.
