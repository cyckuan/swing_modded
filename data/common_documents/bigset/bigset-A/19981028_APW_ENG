Cambodia says soldiers killed by Thai troops were rescuing family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Four Cambodian soldiers killed this
week in a clash with Thai troops were attempting to rescue their
families from a Khmer Rouge-dominated refugee camp, Cambodia's
defense minister said Wednesday.
	   One Thai soldier was wounded in the Monday skirmish one
kilometer (0.6 mile) from the Cambodian border in Thailand's
northeastern Sisaket province. A refugee camp in the area contains
14,866 Cambodians, mostly family members of the nearly defunct
Khmer Rouge rebel movement.
	   Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh acknowledged the nighttime
battle took place on Thai soil and said the matter had been
discussed and settled between the two governments.
	   Contrary to reports from Thai border troops, Tea Banh said the
Cambodian soldiers were recent defectors from the Khmer Rouge whose
families had been forced over the border in March when the
government captured the rebels' last major base in Anlong Veng.
	   The former rebels had made contact with the refugee camp and
struck a deal to take their families back to Anlong Veng, Tea Banh
said, but when returning from the camp they mistook the Thai
soldiers for hard-line Khmer Rouge guerrillas and opened fire.
	   ``There was no intention whatsoever to attack Thai soldiers.
Their main purpose was to get their families out of the refugee
camps,'' Tea Banh told reporters before a meeting of the Cambodian
Cabinet.
	   The defense minister said some of the families were able to
return to Anlong Veng after the firefight.
	   A Thai soldier stationed on the border said after the fighting
ended that the Thai military believed the Cambodian government was
attempting to force refugees to return home.

Reports: Thailand's largest bank may seek government help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok Bank, the largest bank in
Thailand, may seek government help to recapitalize if its number of
nonperforming loans keeps mounting, local papers reported on
Wednesday.
	   ``If the nonperforming loans move higher, I cannot guarantee
that we will not increase capital,'' Bangkok Bank Chairman Chatri
Sophonpanich was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post.
	   About 30 percent of the bank's loans are considered
nonperforming, meaning the debtors are not repaying the bank. Some
analysts have predicted that nonperforming loans for Thailand's
banking sector could rise as high as 45 percent of all loans.
	   Bangkok Bank, however, was considered to be in solid enough
financial shape that it would not need government help.
	   The Thai government is currently instituting a restructuring
plan for the banking sector which has been hit hard by the
country's economic crisis.
	   Four of the country's 15 commercial banks have been taken over
by the government.
	   Since floating its currency, the baht, in July 1997, Thailand
has been battling economic hardships. Other countries in Asia were
also forced to devalue their currencies and have faced similar
economic problems.
	   The crisis has now spread to South America and Russia.
	   Thailand and some other Asian nations are receiving bailout
packages from the International Monetary Fund worth billions of
dollars.
	   The baht dropped more than 30 percent in value after it was
floated, inflating the cost of loans taken out in dollars by many
Thai businesses.
	   Consequently, they could not repay the Thai banks, which left
them on shaky ground. Furthermore, many banks also borrowed in
dollars and were caught in the squeeze when the baht sank in value.
	   Compounding the problem, some debtors who have the ability to
repay are refusing to do so, in the hopes they can force the banks
to give them better repayment terms on their loans.

Onetime Suharto ally, foreign minister now champions human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - He used to bristle at charges that
Indonesia's human rights record was poor. But on Wednesday, its
foreign minister shed the authoritarian past and delivered a
vigorous defense of free speech and other rights.
	   That Foreign Minister Ali Alatas would chair a human rights
workshop was a sign of how much Indonesia has changed since the
tumultuous resignation of former President Suharto in May.
	   Alatas was vilified for years by human rights activists because
he served loyally in the Cabinet of Suharto, who often snuffed out
dissent, throwing opponents in jail and banning critical media.
	   At a Jakarta hotel, many of those same activists listened
politely as Alatas warned that deepening poverty from East Asia's
financial meltdown poses the biggest threat to human rights.
	   ``It stirs up social and political turmoil, spreads inequities,
injustice and deprivation and could even trigger mass migrations
across borders,'' Alatas said. ``Under the yoke of poverty, the
inherent dignity of the human being cannot flourish.''
	   He spoke at a workshop organized by the Indonesian and British
governments, as well as the European Commission.
	   Under Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, Indonesia is
pursuing democratic reforms while trying to cope with an economic
crisis that has stripped millions of people of their jobs and sent
prices sky-high.
	   H.J. Princen, a human rights activist who was jailed several
times for opposing Suharto during his three decades in power, said
Alatas was hypocritical in his keynote speech.
	   ``He knows that the conduct of the Indonesian government in the
last 32 years has been entirely in contradiction of what he is
saying now,'' Princen said.
	   Alatas has often been associated with his defense of Indonesian
control of disputed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that
Suharto invaded in 1975. The United Nations is now sponsoring peace
talks between Indonesia and Portugal.
	   In his speech, Alatas echoed a Suharto-era theme that human
rights must respect the needs of the community, not only the
individual, as well as customs unique to Indonesia. The nation of
202 million people will not be dictated to, he said.
	   ``International cooperation on human rights can only work as a
partnership between equals,'' he said. ``No one sits in judgment.''

Anonymous HIV testing key to early treatment of AIDS, study finds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 7th graf, `The CDC ..' to CLARIFY that reference is to
`public clinics' in the six states. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Anonymous screening for the AIDS virus leads to
people getting tested and treated much earlier, a study found.
	   But where name-linked testing is required _ as it is now in 11
states _ public clinics have seen no significant decline in the
number of people tested, another study found.
	   In confidential testing, the person's name is linked to test
results in a medical chart and kept on file at health departments
to prevent cases from being tracked more than once. The names are
stripped before results are sent to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. In anonymous testing, only a number is recorded
with the test result, never a name.
	   Federal authorities favor the availability of both. They say
name reporting is the only way to track the epidemic, but anonymous
testing may help curb it by getting people into treatment earlier.
	   ``The history of this disease has been a little different than
... other diseases, because we haven't had a therapy until recently
that was highly effective,'' said Dr. Allyn K. Nakashima, lead
author of one study and a CDC medical epidemiologist.
	   Public reluctance to give names to public health officials for
testing has eased, since a person's anonymity disappears when he or
she becomes a patient, she said.
	   The CDC studied about 459,000 tests at health departments in six
states before and after public clinics implemented reporting of
names of people who tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS.
	   Name reporting did not appear to diminish the use of testing in
the states studied _ Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Jersey and Tennessee _ the CDC said in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
	   Name reporting has been required since 1981 in all states for
full-blown AIDS and has been routine even longer in all states for
other diseases ranging from tuberculosis to gonorrhea and
salmonella poisoning.
	   But only 11 states require name reporting of HIV-positive tests.
	   A separate study in JAMA found that where anonymous testing was
also offered as a publicly funded alternative _ as it is now in 39
states _ people who were eventually diagnosed with AIDS sought HIV
tests and HIV-related treatment much earlier than other patients.
	   HIV-related treatment averaged more than a year earlier in the
anonymous group, the study found.
	   ``That is one of the biggest (positive) effects of any public
health program anywhere,'' said the lead author, Dr. Andrew Bindman
of San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center.
	   Their study involved 835 patients in Arizona, Colorado,
Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. North
Carolina has since mandated name reporting of HIV tests.
	   Early testing and treatment not only prolongs patients lives but
allows them to take precautions to prevent spreading the disease,
the researchers noted.

Dissident's attorneys say he can't get fair trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for dissident Anwar
Ibrahim told a judge Wednesday that he could not get a fair trial
in Malaysia because its judiciary has been tainted by an
overwhelming government conspiracy against their client.
	   Anwar, scheduled to stand trial Monday on 10 counts of
corruption and homosexual activity, was arrested Sept. 20 under the
Internal Security Act after rallies during which he called for the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The Security Act allows indefinite detention without trial if
suspects are deemed a threat to national security.
	   Anwar has since been released from under the law and moved to a
regular prison. But his attorneys said that police did not follow
the proper procedures during his arrest so, in effect, he remains
detained under the Security Act.
	   ``Every possible law that can broken is being broken,'' defense
attorney Haji Sulaiman told the judge. ``Every possible authority
that can be misused has been misused.''
	   Prosecutors said that since Anwar is no longer being held under
the Act, the habeas corpus ruling on whether he was illegally
detained is moot and his criminal trial should go ahead as planned.
	   Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, after Mahathir deemed his deputy
morally unfit to lead the country.
	   Anwar was then jailed and charged with corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has pleaded innocent to all the charges, which
he says were trumped up by his political enemies to undermine his
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year leadership.
	   His defense attorneys told High Court Judge Wahab Patail that
the trial set to begin Monday is already tainted.
	   ``There has been a conspiracy right from the beginning,'' said
Sulaiman. ``The taint of illegality continues throughout.''
	   Sulaiman said police violated Anwar's constitutional rights by
not allowing him to speak to his attorneys after his arrest and by
not taking Anwar to court to be charged within 24 hours.
	   He said that Anwar's sacking, expulsion from the ruling party
and alleged sexual misconduct, described in affidavits and smeared
across the front pages of the government-backed newspapers, were
indications of a ``high-level conspiracy.''
	   He also said repeated comments by Mahathir about Anwar's case
would influence the outcome of the trial.
	   In another development, Judge Wahab said he needed to rule on
whether he himself is fit to hear the case, as his brother is a
prosecutor in the Anwar case.

Vietnamese government looks to shore up internally
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Prime Minister Phan Van Khai gave an
inward-looking vision Wednesday for Vietnam in 1999, saying it
needs to shore up its weaknesses and better exploit its strengths
in order to attract foreign investors.
	   Opening a monthlong National Assembly session, Khai focused on
improving agricultural production, slashing bureaucracy, improving
efficiency and productivity, mobilizing domestic savings and
battling poverty, corruption and waste.
	   There appeared to be little new in his speech to assuage
investor concerns. However, one Vietnamese analyst said Khai was
short on specifics because the regional economic crisis remains
volatile and the government wants flexibility in dealing with it.
	   Khai hinted at further restrictions on imports of goods that are
produced locally in order to increase consumption in the domestic
market. However, he said there would be no major changes as Vietnam
liberalizes trade as a member of APEC and ASEAN.
	   Khai said Vietnam has not been hit as hard by the Asian epidemic
as other countries because its currency, the dong, is not
convertible and its economy is small.
	   Despite the external factors, a major typhoon and the worst
drought in more than half a century, the government managed to trim
the budget and trade deficits this year, Khai said.
	   Still, economic growth and direct foreign investment have slowed
substantially, unemployment is rising and pressures on the exchange
rate remain high. For the first time since early this decade,
export volume did not increase.
	   ``We are proud of our achievements, but there is no way to feel
complacent,'' Khai said. ``The regional crisis threatens the
stability of our country. We must work out solutions to curb the
slowdown trend and must not allow contraction.''
	   President Tran Duc Luong later told reporters that
administrative reform will be important.
	   ``The government needs to improve its policies to create a
better environment for business development,'' he said. ``When the
situation gets better in the region, we have to be ready to take
advantage.''
	   The growth rate target for next year is 5 percent to 6 percent,
Khai said, down from 9 percent that originally was set for this
year before it was lowered to 6 percent in July.
	   Khai focused time after time on Vietnam's political stability
but said the government must do more to ensure that policy is
understood. Responsibilities of government agencies and personnel
must be clearly defined to avoid overlap, conflict and corruption.
	   ``Problems are unavoidable when you start so low and are in
transition,'' he said. ``People say the policies are right, but
they do not believe in how they are implemented. Corruption is
still serious. It reduces the confidence of the people and foreign
investors.''
	   Khai said some projects are being delayed or canceled, and that
infrastructure improvements should target rural areas and make
heavy use of cheap labor instead of machines, which are costly and
must be imported.
	   The government hopes to create 1 million to 1.2 million jobs
next year, leaning on small and medium enterprises and vocational
training.
	   Agricultural development has become a major topic in the wake of
the natural disasters, both in terms of food security and exports.
	   A source said the Communist Party Central Committee plenum that
preceded the National Assembly session called for doubling spending
on agriculture.
	   Khai said the debt-ridden banking system must be improved. No
major legislation is expected during the session, but the
government is still implementing two banking reform measures from
last year.
	   Former Communist Party head Do Muoi rejected suggestions that
the country's decade-old economic reforms are slowing.
	   ``We are speeding up,'' he said. ``We will reform forever.''
	   He urged Vietnamese to use some of their savings to invest in
domestic enterprises but added that the international community
also should do more to help poor countries like Vietnam.

IMF official: more bad news and volatility before crisis is over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ There will be more bad financial news and
foreign exchange volatility before the Asian economic crisis
bottoms out next year, a senior International Monetary Fund
executive warned Wednesday.
	   Because of severe caution by institutional investors, a credit
crunch in major and emerging markets ``may last some time,'' said
Flemming Larsen, the IMF's deputy director of research.
	   More interest rate reductions may be needed, especially in
Europe, he said.
	   ``We're likely to get more bad news on the real side, which will
give rise to further volatility on the financial markets before the
crisis is over,'' he told a news conference.
	   ``There is going to be very little financing available for many
emerging market countries in the period ahead,'' Larsen said.
	   Financing is just what is needed to help the restructuring Asian
economies recover. But investors were spooked by the Russian
devaluation and are now fleeing to quality investments and looking
to reduce debt and exposure, he said.
	   ``I don't know how long this (credit crunch) is going to last,''
he said. ``My suspicion is we have not quite seen the end of it.''
	   Nevertheless, he predicted, as other IMF officials have done,
that some of the Asian economies will start to turn around during
the course of next year, particularly Thailand and South Korea.
	   Larsen was hopeful that European central bankers would follow
the U.S. Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates to ease money
supply.
	   ``It is reasonable to interpret (European) central bank
statements as implying a certain awareness of the dangers that lie
ahead and readiness to ease funds,'' Larsen said.
	   Regarding the soon-to-be-introduced European currency, price
stability is in good shape, he said.
	   Capital inflows to emerging markets will continue to slow, he
said. ``The issue is how sharp a slowdown it is going to be and how
long it's going to last for Latin America and emerging markets. All
will get some reduction in economic growth,'' but it doesn't have
to be at crisis level, he said.
	   Larsen said positive economic signs include:
	   _Recent stabilization of foreign exchange rates.
	   _Dramatic turnarounds in trade balances of the crisis-hit
countries, mostly because of sharp reductions in imports.
	   _Consumer and investor confidence rising as governments proceed
with reforms of banks and other institutions.
	   _Expansionary fiscal policies by governments, including social
safety net spending.
	   _Signals that Japan will soon move to increase demand and
spending.

Exports of Japanese-made vehicles fall for fifth straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reflecting weak demand in neighboring Asian
nations, Japanese exports of cars, trucks and buses slid 3.3
percent in September for a fifth consecutive month of declines, an
industry group said Wednesday.
	   A total of 421,339 vehicles were exported last month, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
	   Passenger car shipments in September fell 0.1 percent compared
to the previous month to 338,925 vehicles, while truck exports
dropped 14.5 percent to 78,253 and bus exports skidded 16.7 percent
to 4,161, the association said.
	   Shipments to the U.S., the largest single market for Japanese
vehicles, rose 3.8 percent to 120,957. But exports to Asia plunged
50.1 percent to 28,459 vehicles, it said. Europe-bound exports
climbed 2.8 percent to 89,502.
	   Among leading manufacturers, Toyota Motor Corp. shipments
overseas in September fell 2.2 percent on the month to 129,892
vehicles and Honda Motor Co. exports slipped 11.8 percent to
47,948. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. shipments abroad fell 34.7 percent
to 41,368.
	   Nissan Motor Co. bucked the trend, exporting 13.5 percent more
vehicles in September than the previous month for a total of
69,899.

Indonesian students protest government plans for election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students demonstrated
Wednesday against an upcoming government assembly that will cast
guidelines for elections in 1999.
	   Next month, legislators and other delegates will gather at the
Parliament building in Jakarta to shape electoral laws in one of
Indonesia's most critical steps toward democracy.
	   However, student activists said most of the delegates are
holdovers from the authoritarian era of former President Suharto,
who quit in May after riots and protests. His successor, B.J.
Habibie, has pledged to open up the political system.
	   At a University of Indonesia campus, about 700 students rallied
against the People's Consultative Assembly, saying its members do
not represent Indonesia's 200 million people.
	   ``They're just busy with their own political interests,''
student Gede Puraka said.
	   Protesters also demanded that Suharto, who is accused of
siphoning off state wealth for his family's benefit, be put on
trial on charges of corruption. The 77-year-old former leader has
denied any wrongdoing.
	   About 100 students with the same agenda blocked part of a toll
road during a protest outside Parliament. Police monitored the
demonstration, but the rally was peaceful.

Hurricane Mitch roars off Honduran coast
</HEADLINE>

Bay Islands, elsewhere. At 0600 GMT, Mitch was centered near
latitude 16.5 north, longitude 85.6 west. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LA CEIBA, Honduras _ Spreading fear across hundreds of miles
(kilometers) of the western Caribbean, Hurricane Mitch stalled just
off Honduras on Wednesday, blasting trees, ripping off roofs and
dumping torrents of rain that forced tens of thousands to flee.
	   At least 12 people were reported killed.
	   At its peak early Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth strongest
Caribbean hurricane in this century, with 180 mph (285 kph) winds.
By 0600 GMT, the storm still packed a devastating punch, but winds
were down to 140 mph (220 kph).
	   At 0600 GMT, Mitch was 35 miles (55 kms) north of the Honduran
coast _ about 80 miles (130 kms) northeast of this coastal city,
according to the hurricane center.
	   Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles (100 kilometers)
from the center.
	   More deadly were downpours that flooded rivers in much of
Central America. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said
as much as 20 inches (50 cms) could fall on mountain areas.
	   More than 45,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
low-lying areas of Honduras, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel,
chief of the National Emergency Committee. Officials said many
towns were cut off by some 50 flooded rivers.
	   Mitch stalled almost directly Tuesday over the Bay Island of
Guanaja, 75 miles (120 kms) northeast of here, ripped zinc roofing
from many of the 2,000 houses and knocking out power and
telephones. Many residents took shelter on a larger nearby island.
	   ``It's raining hard and the winds are very strong,'' said Marta
Ondina, a worker at the Hong Kong restaurant on Roatan, an island
popular with tourists a few miles (kilometers) west of Guanaja.
	   ``They have taken people from the shore to churches and more
secure places,'' she said by telephone. ``the people are very
worried. There is no power.''
	   Mitch appeared to have stalled early Wednesday after moving
west-southwestward roughly parallel to the coast through Tuesday.
The hurricane center said it was expected to resume a slow,
generally westward movement later Wednesday, but forecasters said
its slow pace made its movements unpredictable.
	   Waves crashed against the walls of seafront discos here on
Tuesday and people waded through knee-deep water with furniture on
their backs to flee flooded houses.
	   Fireman Tomas Hayden said officials banned private cars in La
Ceiba, a city of 40,000, to ease emergency rescue work.
	   With gasoline stations running dry, the government of
neighboring Belize commandeered private buses to help people move
inland from coastal Belize City, which was almost destroyed by
Hurricane Hattie in 1961.
	   Mexico declared alerts throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from Caribbean
beaches and cutting back oil pumping from wells in the Gulf of
Mexico.
	   Port officials at Chetumal, Mexico, said Tuesday a wave kicked
up by Hurricane Mitch washed a Connecticut man off a catamaran
south of the Mexican resort of Cancun on Monday. Robert Gates, 55,
of Niantic, was presumed dead.
	   Honduras' government reported three deaths as of Wednesday _ one
in a collapsed house and two men electrocuted when they were blown
off a roof.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there due to flooding.
	   Early Tuesday, Mitch passed directly over Honduras' tiny Swan
Islands, used in the 1960s as a base for CIA radio broadcasts to
Cuba. Honduran officials said the military base lost its roof but
the five soldiers posted there were unhurt because they took refuge
in nearby caves.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   In Cancun, 375 miles (600 kms) north of here, tourists formed
long lines at the airport Tuesday trying to leave before the
storm's arrival. But as Mitch veered south, Cancun Mayor Rafael
Lara Lara canceled the city's emergency alert. State officials
earlier evacuated several thousand people from coastal zones
further south, near the Belize border.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Shanghai will spend 8.65 billion yuan
(dlrs 1 billion) to clean up the Suzhou River, a polluted, smelly
waterway that flows through the city, state media said Wednesday.
	   Treatment plants for sewage that dump directly into the river
will be built in the first stage of the three-year project, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.

Freed prisoner of war brings cat along with rebel permission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A Sri Lankan sailor freed by Tamil
Tiger rebels after being held for 15 months had an unusual
companion when he stepped out of the northern jungles _ a
white-and-brown striped cat.
	   Sujith Thenuwara, co-captain of a ferry, adopted Kitty when he
was in captivity to soothe the pain of not being able to see his
newborn son, The Midweek Mirror weekly reported Wednesday.
	   When the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam released him along
with other Sri Lankan prisoners last weekend, he insisted that the
cat be allowed to go with him. The rebels agreed, and Thenuwara
came home with Kitty on Sunday, the newspaper said.
	   Thenuwara was the co-captain of the ship Missen, which was
hijacked and destroyed by the LTTE in July 1997 when it was
anchored off Sri Lanka's northwestern coast. Thenuwara's wife gave
birth to a baby boy the following November.
	   Kitty and the Thenuwaras are now living in a Colombo suburb.

 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs; CORRECTS Nashville ended 3-game losing streak
 &UR; Islanders 1, Kings 0 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Tommy Salo stopped 20 shots for his
third shutout of the season and Joe Sacco scored in the third
period as the New York Islanders beat the Los Angeles Kings 1-0
Tuesday night.
	   Sacco's goal, his first of the season, came at 2:01 of the final
period. After taking two strides over the red line, Sacco fired a
slap shot toward Kings goalie Manny Legace. The puck bounced in
front of the crease and went through the goalie's pads.
	   Salo, who has played in all eight games for New York this
season, also has shutouts against Tampa Bay and St. Louis. He got a
break when an apparent tying goal was disallowed with 6:15 left in
the game because the net came loose before the puck crossed the
goal line.
 &UR; Rangers 0, Sabres 0 &QC; 
	   In New York, Dominik Hasek, with help from both his defense and
goal posts, extended his shutout streak against New York to four
games as the Buffalo Sabres and Rangers played to a scoreless tie.
	   Hasek and Rangers goaltender Mike Richter were both flawless,
but Hasek only had to face 16 shots while posting the 35th shutout
of his NHL career. Hasek also was lucky as three New York shots hit
the posts.
	   The Rangers squandered many good chances against Hasek, who has
held them scoreless since Wayne Gretzky scored at 6:14 of the third
period in a 3-3 tie at Buffalo on Nov. 28, 1997. Hasek extended his
shutout string against the Rangers to 263 minutes and 46 seconds.
	   Richter made several spectacular stops in gaining his 19th
career shutout and helping the Rangers extend their unbeaten streak
to five (2-0-3) after starting the season 0-4-0.
 &UR; Flyers 2, Blues 1 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Colin Forbes deflected a nonchalant shot by Dan
McGillis 28 seconds into the second period for the decisive goal,
and John Vanbiesbrouck made 30 saves as the Philadelphia Flyers
beat the St. Louis Blues.
	   The Atlantic-leading Flyers won for the first time in three
games after losing to New Jersey and tying the Rangers on Saturday.
Outshot for the first time this season and held to 1-for-9 on the
power play, they relied on a stellar performance by Vanbiesbrouck.
	   Forbes broke a 1-1 tie with his third goal of the season right
after a faceoff early in the third. His weight on the wrong foot,
McGillis casually dumped the puck toward the goal, and Forbes
tipped it through Jamie McLennan's pads for a 2-1 lead.
 &UR; Predators 5, Canucks 4 &QC; 
	   In Nashville Tennessee, Sergei Krivokrasov scored two goals,
including the game-winner with 1:26 left, as Nashville snapped a
three-game losing streak.
	   Krivokrasov, who also had an assist, pushed the rebound of Jamie
Heward's shot through goalie Garth Snow's legs on the power play to
snap a 4-4 tie.
	   Jeff Daniels, Tom Fitzgerald and Andrew Brunette also scored for
Nashville, which blew a two-goal lead in the third period for the
second straight game.
	   Vancouver's Bill Muckalt and Todd Bertuzzi scored goals 44
seconds apart early in the third period to tie it 4-4. Adrian
Aucoin and Mark Messier also scored for the Canucks.

	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan on Wednesday by the disgruntled airline
captain, who brought his wife on the flight as he tried to escape
an unhappy life, officials said.
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing to the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but it was diverted in the air and arrived safely under
military jet escort at Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17
a.m. (0317 GMT).
	   Taiwan Television showed the captain, whom officials identified
as Yuan Bin, in his uniformed white shirt with a suitcase, being
led out of the plane by policemen in helmets and bullet-proof
vests. His wife, who was not immediately identified by name, was
shown in a black coat.
	   No passengers were hurt, officials said.
	   Authorities said the captain diverted his own jet to Taiwan
because he apparently was unhappy with his job. In Beijing, the
official Xinhua News Agency confirmed the plane was hijacked with
95 passengers and an unspecified number of crew on board.
	   Chang Chia-ju, Taiwan's aeronautics chief, said the hijacker
would be detained to face trial in Taiwan. Authorities were
planning to let Air China's other pilots fly the jetliner back to
China with its passengers.
	   The airline had two pilots and two co-pilots aboard the Boeing
737 that was to have continued its flight from Kunming to Yangon,
Myanmar, Chang said.
	   Defense Ministry officials said the Air China jetliner was
escorted to the airport by four Taiwanese warplanes, which took off
after spotting the jet on radar.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew condemned Wednesday's
incident.
	   ``We've never agreed to such deeds,'' he told reporters _
although Taiwan in recent memory used to shower hijackers from
mainland China with gold and cash rewards. Taiwan began cracking
down on the hijackers after long-standing tensions with the
mainland began easing in the 1980s.
	   The 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed for
up to 10 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to China.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

Report: Two Thai army generals suspected of drug smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai army has put two generals
under surveillance because police suspect they are part of a
drug-smuggling ring, the Bangkok Post reported on Wednesday.
	   The surveillance was initiated after a meeting between deputy
police chief Gen. Noppadol Somboonsap and Gen. Mongkol Ampornpisit,
the supreme commander of the Thai military, the paper said. It did
not report the suspect generals' names.
	   Thailand's police and military have begun working together to
catch lawbreakers within their ranks. Police and military personnel
have been caught working as enforcers for criminal gangs, running
extortion rings and smuggling weapons.
	   Earlier this year, a captain attached to the Supreme Command was
arrested and charged with murder. It was later learned he had been
readmitted to the Thai army after having spent time in an
Australian jail for smuggling heroin.
	   The Post reported that the two generals under surveillance are
suspected of working for Surachai ``Bang Ron'' Ngernthongfoo, an
alleged heroin kingpin wanted by Thai police. Police believe he has
fled to neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma, where he is being
sheltered by the Wa ethnic group.
	   The Wa are heavily involved in producing heroin and
amphetamines. Myanmar is one of the world's largest producers of
heroin.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Wattanachai Wutthisiri was quoted in the
Post as saying the police should speed up their investigation and
produce whatever evidence they have as soon as possible.
	   ``A photograph showing military officers with Bang Ron is not
good enough,'' he said. ``More evidence is needed to prove the
connections.''
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who also serves as defense
minister, has been working to clean up the military and police and
has appointed a reform-minded general to head the army.
	   The Defense Ministry refused to comment on the report.

Israel delays Cabinet approval of Mideast accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has postponed
a crucial Cabinet meeting that was to approve the U.S.-brokered
Israel-Palestinian peace agreement, a move move could disrupt the
timetable of Israel's West Bank pullback.
	   In a statement Tuesday evening, Netanyahu blamed the delay on
the Palestinians, saying they had failed to present a detailed plan
for stopping extremist attacks against Israel.
	   However, Israeli media reported Wednesday that Netanyahu
postponed the Cabinet meeting because he is having trouble assuring
a majority in favor of the agreement in his Cabinet.
	   Several Cabinet ministers who initially said they were undecided
have announced in recent days that they would vote against the
agreement. Netanyahu said Tuesday that if his Cabinet fails to
approve the withdrawal deal, it would not be carried out.
	   The most vocal opposition to Netanyahu comes from erstwhile
supporters, Jewish settlers who fear a troop pullback will endanger
them and turn several settlements into isolated enclaves in
Palestinian areas.
	   In recent protests against Netanyahu, demonstrators have shouted
``traitor, traitor.'' Such cries were common in the weeks leading
up to the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist Jew in November 1995, and there was growing
concern in Israel that Netanyahu could also be targeted by
extremists.
	   Security for Netanyahu has been increased in recent days. Israel
radio said that as part of the changes, the prime minister will cut
down on appearances in large crowds and travel to the West Bank and
Gaza Strip only by helicopter.
	   Under the peace accord signed last week in Washington, Israel
would hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was expecting clarifications from
the United States about the Palestinian security work plan. He said
the United States promised the clarifications by Friday.
	   The government statement said that once the Palestinian plan is
submitted, the Cabinet will convene to ratify the accord.
	   The Palestinians said the delays is technical, because the head
of Palestinian security in Gaza, Mohammed Dahlan, is in Europe.
	   Israel's chief demand of the Palestinians, in return for handing
over territory, is a comprehensive plan to combat extremist
organizations responsible for attacks against Israel.
	   In the accord, the Palestinian Authority, headed by Yasser
Arafat, pledges to move against the extremists, confiscate illegal
weapons and stop incitement against Israel.
	   Netanyahu said Israel will check Palestinian progress according
to a strict timetable. If they do not stick to it, he insisted,
``They will not get anything.''

Habibie warns serial killings are jeopardizing reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A wave of mysterious killings and a
vigilante backlash have jeopardized Indonesia's move toward
democratic reform, President B.J. Habibie said Wednesday.
	   The violence at the eastern end of the main island of Java, in
which more than 150 people have been killed since August, has
spread terror and suspicion in many towns.
	   Assassins, said to dress in ninja-like black clothing, have
targeted suspected black magic sorcerers and mobs have set upon and
lynched people believed to be the killers. On Monday, vigilantes
beat to death four suspected murderers.
	   Habibie, who is managing Indonesia's transition to democracy,
said he had ordered the military to restore order and aggressively
pursue those responsible for the unrest.
	   ``I call on people of all levels in society to step up their
alertness and cooperate with the security forces to prevent these
crimes from continuing to disturb the reform process,'' Habibie
said in a speech at a military training school in Cimahi, 100 miles
(160 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Jakarta.
	   Indonesia, mired in an economic crisis, is in a delicate phase.
Poverty and unemployment are widespread as the nation of 200
million stumbles through an often chaotic experiment with democracy
in the wake of the May ouster of former President Suharto.
	   Officials fear the violence in eastern Java could exacerbate
social tensions, although there is no indication that the
systematic killings have spread elsewhere.
	   Muslim clerics have been among the victims. In a sign of how
much public order has unraveled, Indonesia's largest Muslim group
warned it might deploy its own patrols if the military cannot
provide security.
	   ``Don't blame us if we use our own ways to resolve the problem
we face,'' said Achmad Bagdja, secretary-general of Nahdlatul
Ulama, which has formed a political party to run in general
elections next year.
	   The government has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama leader
Abdurahman Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind
the killings.

Cambodian ruling party says it's ready to deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen's party
urged the main opposition Wednesday to return to negotiations,
saying it was willing to make an ``appropriate concession'' to
break a deadlock over forming a new government.
	   Hun Sen's ruling party won a narrow majority in July's
parliamentary elections, but the two-party opposition so far has
denied it the votes it needs for the two-thirds majority to approve
a new government.
	   The president of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, Chea Sim,
said in a statement that it could not address the opposition's
allegations of intimidation and fraud during the election. Polling
officials and Cambodia's highest court had already rejected the
claims, he said.
	   But because Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party had
compromised with the CPP after it won the 1993 election _ polls
that the CPP claimed, with little evidence, were also marred by
fraud _ Chea Sim suggested the favor would be returned now that the
parties' situations were reversed.
	   ``The Cambodian People's Party is prepared to make an
appropriate concession to the FUNCINPEC,'' Chea Sim stated. ``Up to
this day, the Cambodian People's Party nurses no ambition for
exclusive power.''
	   FUNCINPEC conceded the presidency of parliament and agreed to
share the premiership and several key ministries with the CPP in
1993 after elements of Hun Sen's party threatened to reject the
election results by force.
	   Negotiations to form a government after this year's polls broke
down earlier this month as the two parties bickered over the
presidency. Hun Sen offered a compromise last week to have
co-presidents share the position, but FUNCINPEC rejected the
proposal.
	   Chea Sim, president of the previous parliament, did not offer
the position to FUNCINPEC in his statement, but he hinted the
ruling party's concession related to the legislature.
	   ``The CPP is prepared to offer appropriate honor and meaningful
roles to the opposition parties in the National Assembly,'' he
said.
	   The absence of Ranariddh and junior opposition party leader Sam
Rainsy from Cambodia has further complicated a resumption of the
talks.
	   The two party leaders led an exodus of opposition lawmakers to
Bangkok after the parliament was ceremonially opened in late
September. They have refused to return, saying threats of arrest
from Hun Sen have made it impossible for them to negotiate freely
in Cambodia.
	   Last week, the ruling party guaranteed the safety of opposition
politicians if they returned for more talks, and Chea Sim urged
FUNCINPEC again Wednesday to hammer out an agreement with the CPP.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, which the ruling party has repeatedly
suggested should be shut out of the negotiations, said in a
statement released late Tuesday that it was willing to allow a
representative to attend talks inside Cambodia, but that its leader
and lawmakers would remain outside the country.
	   ``We see no significant obstacle to a meeting outside Cambodia,
except that it would deprive the ruling party of the opportunity to
make hostages of us,'' said the Sam Rainsy Party, which placed a
distant third in the election.

Yeltsin checks into rest home for open-ended stay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with new DeBakey comments. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Boris Yeltsin retreated to a rest home
outside Moscow, suffering from exhaustion and high blood pressure,
his prime minister filled in for the Russian president at a summit
with European Union officials.
	   Russia, meanwhile, was left guessing yet again about the exact
nature of Yeltsin's illness.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has played only a marginal role in dealing with the
country's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the
country is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who has been in office less than two months.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at the EU summit. Yeltsin called off the trip Monday due to
his illness, the latest in a string of maladies that have dogged
him for years. He checked into the Barvikha sanitarium Tuesday for
an open-ended stay.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has put in few full days at the Kremlin since the
spring, and now his doctors say he must rest to recover from
extreme fatigue and high blood pressure.
	   The president did not look visibly ill in television footage of
him meeting with Primakov on Tuesday, before the prime minister
left for Vienna and the president moved to the sanitarium.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, an American cardiologist who consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after his 1996 heart surgery,
predicted Tuesday it would take Yeltsin at least a week to bounce
back.
	   But ``he'll recover from all this and he'll be back at work,''
DeBakey told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   DeBakey was quoted Wednesday as telling the Komsomolskaya Pravda
newspaper that Yeltsin's unstable blood pressure was not a serious
problem. He said that Russian heart surgeon Renat Akchurin, who
performed Yeltsin's quintuple bypass surgery, is no longer on the
team of doctors monitoring the president because his expertise is
not needed.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin would
undergo ``a course of restoration treatment.'' The length of his
stay depends on the treatment, he said, without elaborating.
	   Despite reassurances by the president and his doctors that
Yeltsin has no crippling illness and will serve out his term, which
lasts until the middle of 2000, few in Russia believe that Yeltsin
will ever again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was
during his early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996
presidential elections, said Tuesday that Yeltsin's aides were
``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president wasn't seriously
ill.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the
results to be made public.
	   Yeltsin's aides have often provided only partial information
about Yeltsin's ailments, contributing to a general mood of
skepticism and speculation that his condition is worse than
announced.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign, Primakov would succeed him on an
interim basis, and new elections would be called within three
months.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Yeltsin's illness should not hamper decisions on economic policy
because Primakov was in already handling them.
	   Yeltsin postponed a meeting with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman scheduled for next week in Moscow, Tudjman's spokesman said
Tuesday. Yeltsin has also put off a trip to Malaysia next month,
though his aides insist he will still go to India in December.

Myanmar military says detained opposition member died of cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A member of Myanmar's main opposition
party, detained by the government in a recent crackdown, has died
of cancer, the military government said Wednesday.
	   ``The government of Myanmar regrets to report that Aung Min, a
member of the National League for Democracy, passed away in Defense
Services Hospital in Mandalay on Oct. 21, with cancer of the lymph
glands (malignant lymphoma) spreading all over the body,'' a
government press release said.
	   The National League for Democracy, led by Nobel Peace Prize
winner Aung San Suu Kyi, could not be reached for comment. The
government restricts access to NLD leaders.
	   ``The government regrets this sad and unexpected event, and has
expressed its sincere condolences to the family. The government has
been contributing toward the family's welfare,'' the press release
said.
	   Aung Min was detained with nearly a thousand other NLD members
in September to prevent the party from convening the parliament
elected in 1990. The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the
assembly, but the military refused to honor the vote.
	   The government has said it has detained no one, but instead
invited the NLD members to stay at military guest houses for an
exchange of views about parliament.
	   The government said it sent 15 NLD members home Wednesday,
bringing the total number of party members permitted to leave the
guest houses to 293.

Israel delays Cabinet approval of Mideast accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has postponed
a crucial Cabinet meeting that was to approve the U.S.-brokered
Israel-Palestinian peace agreement. The move could disrupt the
timetable of Israel's West Bank pullback.
	   In a statement Tuesday evening, Netanyahu blamed the delay on
the Palestinians, saying they failed to present a detailed plan for
stopping extremist attacks against Israel.
	   However, Israeli media reported Wednesday that Netanyahu
postponed the Cabinet meeting because he is having trouble assuring
a majority in favor of the agreement.
	   Several Cabinet ministers who initially said they were undecided
have announced in recent days that they would vote against the
agreement. Netanyahu said Tuesday that if his Cabinet fails to
approve the withdrawal deal, it would not be carried out.
	   The most vocal opposition to Netanyahu comes from erstwhile
supporters, Jewish settlers who fear a troop pullback will endanger
them and turn several settlements into isolated enclaves in
Palestinian areas.
	   In recent protests against Netanyahu, demonstrators have shouted
``traitor, traitor.'' Such cries were common in the weeks leading
up to the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist Jew in November 1995, and there was growing
concern in Israel that Netanyahu could also be targeted by
extremists.
	   Security for Netanyahu has been increased in recent days. Israel
radio said that as part of the changes, he will cut down on
appearances in large crowds and travel to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip only by helicopter.
	   Under the peace accord signed last week in Washington, Israel
would hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was expecting clarifications from
the United States about the Palestinian security work plan. He said
the United States promised the clarifications by Friday.
	   The government statement said that once the Palestinian plan is
submitted, the Cabinet will convene to ratify the accord.
	   The Palestinians said the delays is technical, because the head
of Palestinian security in Gaza, Mohammed Dahlan, is in Europe.
	   Israel's chief demand of the Palestinians, in return for handing
over territory, is a comprehensive plan to combat extremist
organizations responsible for attacks against Israel.
	   In the accord, the Palestinian Authority, headed by Yasser
Arafat, pledges to move against the extremists, confiscate illegal
weapons and stop incitement against Israel.
	   Netanyahu said Israel will check Palestinian progress according
to a strict timetable. If they do not stick to it, he insisted,
``They will not get anything.''

Twenty killed in Sri Lanka's civil war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan troops killed 16 separatist
Tamil Tigers and lost four soldiers in several clashes in the
north, the defense ministry said Wednesday.
	   Military spokesman Major Kumara Dewage said two soldiers were
also wounded in the fighting Tuesday in the Paranthan area, close
to Kilinochchi, a rebel-held town about 275 kilometers (170 miles)
north of Colombo.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the defense ministry's
statement as the government bars reporters from the area.
	   Kilinochchi, which the rebels captured last month after a fierce
battle, is the last major town on the northern stretch of a highway
that the government has been trying to take for the past year.
	   The road is the only overland supply line from Colombo, the
capital, to government-held Jaffna Peninsula on the northern tip of
this Indian Ocean island.
	   The rebels are fighting to carve out an independent homeland for
Tamils, 3.3 million of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million people. They allege
Tamils are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who
control the government and the military. The government denies the
charge.
	   More than 55,000 people have died in 15 years of fighting.

Unable to find money, burglars take onions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Burglars made off with a sack of onions
_ so costly that some in India compare them to gold _ when they
could not find any money in the house they broke into, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Two men armed with rods and a third with a knife broke into a
house in New Delhi's posh Greater Kailash neighborhood late Tuesday
and overpowered the security guard. When they did not find any
cash, they took away five kilograms (11 pounds) of onions, The
Times of India reported.
	   Several parts of India are facing the worst onion shortage in
decades due to poor crops and hoarding. Since late August, onion
prices in many parts India have jumped from eight rupees (20 cents)
a kilogram to about 60 rupees (dlrs 1.40).
	   The onion issue has provoked street protests, rioting, newspaper
editorials and political speeches across the country, as angry
citizens scramble for a vegetable that is key to many favorite
dishes. Police said some grocers' trucks transporting onions were
ambushed and looted by rioters.
	   Onion traders said Wednesday normal supply was likely to resume
only in January, despite the government's promises that stocks were
being replenished.

Dollar falls, Japanese stocks sink for fourth day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, midafternoon bond and currency
prices; ADDS trader quotes in 3rd, 15th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices sank for a fourth consecutive
session Wednesday amid growing worries about the global economy and
the impact on corporate profits. The U.S. dollar fell against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose briefly into
positive territory in early trading, but closed down 304.61 points,
or 2.20 percent, at 13,516.07. On Tuesday, it had lost 22.78
points, or 0.16 percent.
	   ``Uncertainty over the world economy sent export-oriented blue
chip shares such as Sony down,'' said Takeshi Kubota, general
manager of stock information at Meiko Securities Co.
	   Sony fell 6.20 percent to 8,010 yen (dlrs 67.86) after Morgan
Stanley downgraded the company's stock from ``strong buy'' to the
slightly less desirable ``outperform.''
	   After the close of trading, Sony reported its group net profit
for the latest six months had fallen 5.4 percent from a year
earlier to 86.05 billion yen (dlrs 728.99 million).
	   As worry about earnings mounted, many investors held back to
await more details about a new government economic stimulus package
due out next month.
	   The head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's panel on tax
policy, Yoshiro Hayashi, told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday that
new tax cuts should total more than 7 trillion yen (dlrs 59.30
billion).
	   Yet any hopes aggressive government efforts will jump start an
anemic economy were overshadowed by the latest batch of gloomy
statistics.
	   Though the Japanese trade ministry reported Wednesday that
industrial production rose 2.5 percent last month from August, it
expects output to fall in October and November. Meanwhile, retail
sales in September slid for a fifth consecutive month.
	   A sharp decline in the Nikkei average near the close of trading
may have been triggered, in part, by data transmission problems
that apparently pushed down stock future prices, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 14.37 points, or 1.37 percent, to 1,028.61.
It had lost 5.76 points, or 0.55 percent, the previous day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 118.04 yen in
midafternoon, down 1.32 yen from late Tuesday but above its late
New York rate of 117.75 yen overnight.
	   The dollar was weighed down by speculation that Brazil's
currency may be devalued, even though Brazilian officials and U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin denied plans for such a move.
	   It was also weakened by bouts of selling by players anxious to
dump part of their large dollar positions, traders said.
	   ``The consensus now is that when the dollar approaches 120 yen,
Japanese exporters, U.S. hedge funds and others would sell dollars
to hedge,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign exchange manager at
Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.870 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.900 percent,
driving its price up to 108.26 yen from 107.98 yen.

Myanmar authorities seize 3 million speed pills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar authorities seized nearly 3
million amphetamine tablets near the city of Lashio in northeastern
Shan State, a government press release said Wednesday.
	   The 2.89 million pills were confiscated during a car search at a
checkpoint and two men were arrested by a team of local police,
military intelligence and customs officials acting on a tip, the
government said.
	   Myanmar, already one of the world's largest heroin producers,
has become a major source of amphetamines. Most are trafficked into
Thailand, which borders Shan State.

Dissident's attorneys say he can't get fair trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with judge throwing out appeal &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A judge on Wednesday threw out an
appeal claiming a government conspiracy against jailed dissident
Anwar Ibrahim, calling it ``sensational.''
	   The ruling paved the way for Anwar's criminal trial to begin as
scheduled Monday.
	   Lawyers for Anwar told High Court Judge Wahab Patail that Anwar
was arrested and detained illegally and that he could not get a
fair trial as the judiciary had been tainted by a high-level
government conspiracy against their client.
	   Wahab dismissed the habeas corpus appeal, calling it ``plainly
and obviously frivolous.''
	   He said the claims of a government conspiracy against Anwar were
``far-reaching and scandalous allegations'' that were as absurd
``as being told an alien spaceship has landed in Merdeka Square.''
	   Merdeka, or Independence, Square, where Malaysia celebrated its
freedom from British rule in 1957, has been the site of several
anti-government protests by Anwar supporters.
	   Anwar, scheduled to stand trial on 10 counts alleging corruption
and homosexual activity, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal
Security Act after rallies at which he called for the resignation
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The ISA allows indefinite detention without trial if suspects
are deemed a threat to national security.
	   Anwar has since been released from under the law and moved to a
regular prison. But his attorneys say that police did not carry out
proper procedure in his arrest, so in effect, he remains detained
under the ISA.
	   Wahab ruled that since Anwar had been released from the ISA and
moved to a prison, the hearing was moot and that his criminal trial
would go ahead as planned.
	   In an affidavit filed in court by Anwar's wife Wednesday, Anwar
called his release from the ISA a joke.
	   ``My release from ISA detention is Mahathir's gimmick because of
his fear of the people's wrath and the reaction of the
international community,'' Anwar said in the document dated Oct.
17. ``The plan was to get me out of ISA detention before APEC
begins.''
	   The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade forum will be held
in the Malaysian capital in two weeks. Twenty world leaders,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, were expected to attend;
some have said they will bring up the Anwar case.
	   Anwar was sacked Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the
Southeast Asian country.
	   Anwar was then jailed and charged with corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has pleaded innocent to the charges, which he
says were trumped up by his political enemies to undermine his
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year leadership.
	   His defense attorneys told Wahab, the brother of one of the
prosecutors in the Anwar case, the trial was already tainted.
	   ``There has been a conspiracy right from the beginning,'' said
Haji Sulaiman. ``The taint of illegality continues throughout.''
	   Sulaiman said police violated Anwar's constitutional rights by
not allowing him to speak to his attorneys after his arrest and not
taking Anwar to court to be charged within 24 hours.
	   He said that Anwar's sacking, expulsion from the ruling party
and the sexual allegations released through affidavits and smeared
on the front pages of the government-backed newspapers were
indicators of a ``high-level conspiracy.''
	   He also said repeated comments by Mahathir about Anwar's case
would influence the outcome of the trial.

Villagers confront despair, confusion after police withdrawal

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A pile of bones, identified by the
watch and clothes of the victim. Nervous guerrilla fighters eyeing
a grenade booby trap set by their Serb enemies. The charred,
ransacked shell of a family home.
	   Tuesday was filled with images of despair and confusion for
people returning to this central Kosovo village for the first time
since Serb police overran it three months ago.
	   There was no joy, or even relief, at finally coming back _ even
if just for a few hours _ after most police in the region, 25 miles
(40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina, the provincial capital,
withdrew Monday.
	   Instead, the ethnic Albanian villagers came with a grim
expectation of destruction by the Serb occupiers. Their worst fears
were realized.
	   ``How can a guy feel when he sees his house in this condition?
You can't feel good when everything is destroyed,'' said Osman
Mazreku, standing in the burned-out second floor of his house.
	   Mazreku last saw his house on July 28, the day the Serb
offensive began. He took his mother, his wife and three children
and walked the three miles (five kilometers) down a dirt road to
the next village.
	   His father, Ramiz, stayed behind, saying the Serbs would never
harm an old man _ he was 54. According to information that reached
Mazreku, his father was arrested three days later.
	   Mazreku has no illusions _ he's sure his father is dead.
	   ``I was afraid something like this would happen,'' he said.
``But he was determined.''
	   Now he must clean the blackened soot off the walls and floors,
clear away the scattered clothing, papers and broken furniture, and
try to rebuild the comfortable life his family enjoyed before the
fighting.
	   ``It will take two weeks, if you have enough money, to make
minimal conditions for living here,'' he said. But even a clean,
repaired house won't be enough.
	   ``As long as the police forces are here, I won't bring my family
here,'' he said.
	   On the northern fringe of town, a sandbag bunker and armed,
uniformed guards showed that the building along the main road was
still occupied by Serb police. In the village center, hundreds of
people peered through broken windows of shops and homes or
recovered the few undamaged items they could find.
	   When a small convoy of police vehicles _ blue armored personnel
carriers and a red water truck _ arrived in the late morning, a
brief burst of automatic weapon fire erupted.
	   It was unclear who pulled the trigger, but the effect was
obvious. Almost instantly, the town center emptied, with villagers
disappearing between buildings and down backroads.
	   Two miles (three kilometers) away on the main road, Albanian
separatist guerrillas occupied a police checkpoint that Serbs had
abandoned Monday.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army fighters appeared nervous, diving for
cover when the small police convoy passed and aiming their weapons
at an approaching car even though it was clearly marked as a
journalists' vehicle.
	   They found a booby trap left by the Serbs _ a grenade tied to a
tree at knee-level, with a piece of wire attached to the pin and
strung across to another tree six feet (two meters) away.
	   Later in the day, a similar booby trap exploded behind another
abandoned police checkpoint at Dragobilje, a few miles (kilometers)
down the road, killing one person and injuring two others.
	   In the late afternoon, a woman showed journalists a pile of
bones she said were the remains of her father in her family's house
outside Malisevo.
	   Shqipe Krasniqi last saw the house and her father, Jashar, on
July 28 when the Serbs swept in. She then joined a group of KLA
rebels in the woods and only came back Tuesday.
	   It was then she found Jashar's remains, yellow-brown bones along
with his watch, clothes and shoes.

Indonesian students protest government plans for election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to raise number of student protesters near Parliament
to more than 2,000 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 2,000 students demonstrated
near Parliament Wednesday against an upcoming government assembly
that will cast guidelines for elections in 1999.
	   Next month, legislators and other delegates will gather at the
Parliament building in Jakarta to shape electoral laws in one of
Indonesia's most critical steps toward democracy.
	   However, student activists said most of the delegates are
holdovers from the authoritarian era of former President Suharto,
who quit in May after riots and protests. His successor, B.J.
Habibie, has pledged to open up the political system.
	   Police blocked protesters from marching to the gates of
Parliament. So the activists gathered nearby, partly blocking a
toll road that leads to the international airport.
	   They raised banners demanding that Suharto, who is accused of
siphoning off state wealth for his family's benefit, be put on
trial on charges of corruption. The 77-year-old former leader has
denied any wrongdoing.
	   At a rally earlier in the day, about 700 students at a
University of Indonesia campus shouted slogans against the People's
Consultative Assembly, which will debate the laws for the general
election.
	   Protesters said the 1,000 assembly members, many of whom were
appointed by Suharto, do not represent Indonesia's 200 million
people.
	   ``They're just busy with their own political interests,''
student Gede Puraka said.

Japanese central bank decides to keep interest rates steady
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Bank of Japan's chief policy-making board
announced Wednesday that it has left a key lending rate unchanged
at a record low.
	   A majority of the central bank's nine-member board, which meets
every two weeks, voted to keep the overnight call money rate at
around 0.25 percent, the BOJ said.
	   Last month, the central bank guided the overnight call rate down
to that level from around 0.5 percent in an effort to prevent Japan
from falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   The move marked the first change in monetary policy since
September 1995, when the BOJ cut its official discount rate, the
rate at which it lends to commercial banks, to a record low 0.5
percent and led the overnight call rate slightly below that level.

police officer shot himself in the head, allegedly because his
superiors had pressured him to demand bribes from motorists.
	   Noppadol Ketawandi committed suicide Tuesday in front of about
50 people waiting at a bus stop near Bangkok International Airport,
a police spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The policeman's relatives were quoted Wednesday in the newspaper
The Nation as saying he had cracked under pressure from
higher-ranking officers to garner bribes from motorists and pass
them on to his commanders.
	   His wife said he had threatened suicide Monday, but she talked
him out of it.
	   ``He pointed the gun at his head but I calmed him down, telling
him to have pity on our children who are still very young,'' said
his wife, Buaban, quoted in The Nation. ``I thought I had convinced
him to give up the idea of suicide.''
	   Thai police have come under heavy criticism from the media and
the public in recent months for demanding bribes from motorists. A
local television caught several policeman on videotape extorting
money from drivers.
	   Corruption among Thailand's police is believed to be rampant,
fostered by low pay for officers and feudal culture prevalent among
high-ranking officers.

U.N. envoy meets top official of Myanmar junta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A U.N. envoy met Wednesday with a top
member of the country's ruling junta, one day after meeting the
government's most outspoken critic, opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi.
	   Alvaro de Soto, a special representative of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, arrived Tuesday to discuss political
and human rights issues.
	   Diplomats said de Soto was seeking to persuade the government
and the opposition to open talks to ease political tensions.
	   Details of his talks have not been made public.
	   De Soto, an assistant secretary-general, last visited Myanmar in
January in a failed effort to facilitate a dialogue between the
junta and Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy.
	   De Soto met Suu Kyi during his January visit, as well as the
ruling junta's chairman, Gen. Than Shwe, and other government
leaders.
	   Relations between the government and the opposition have
deteriorated sharply since then, with the military increasing its
repression of the pro-democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party
increasing its challenges to the government's legitimacy.
	   In the past few months, almost 1,000 members of Suu Kyi's party
have been detained in an effort to block its activities.
	   De Soto, on his fifth visit as a U.N. envoy since 1995, met
Wednesday with the influential secretary-one of the junta, Lt. Gen.
Khin Nyunt, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   De Soto was expected to meet with Suu Kyi again Thursday to
convey the gist of his talks with Khin Nyunt, they said.
	   On Tuesday, he had met Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw and Minister of
the Chairman's Office Brig. Gen. David Abel.
	   In August, Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ rejected
Secretary-General Annan's candidate to look into the military
regime's treatment of Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace
Prize.
	   Annan had asked that Razali Ismail of Malaysia, former president
of the General Assembly, be allowed to make a quick trip after the
Myanmar government had repeatedly blocked Suu Kyi's attempts to
travel outside the capital to meet with members of her political
party.
	   Myanmar said there was no need for such a rushed trip.
	   On Tuesday, the government announced the release from detention
of 34 members of Suu Kyi's party, saying they ``have returned home
... after a successful exchange of view on safeguarding national
security.'' Several dozen detainees have apparently been released
in the past week or so.
	   At the same time, the government announced the latest in a
series of mass rallies it has been staging to support its position
against the opposition.
	   It said 21,000 people in Chin State held a meeting Monday in
which they ``unanimously passed two motions calling for
safeguarding and maintaining national development and ensuring
food, clothing and shelter needs of the people, maintaining and
safeguarding the stability of the state which has already been
achieved.''
	   Such jargon is commonly used to imply that the opposition would
endanger the country's stability and development.
	   The junta seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing
pro-democracy demonstrations. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide
victory in 1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused
to yield power.
	   Western nations, including the United States, and private groups
such as Amnesty International say the junta is responsible for
substantial human rights abuses. The U.N. Human Rights Commission
also has reported abuses and sought to encourage governmental
reforms in Myanmar.

Charges filed against Philippine policemen accused of killing

suspects &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Investigators filed murder charges
Wednesday against a group of special police accused of killing
three men riding in a taxi two weeks ago, in a case Philippine
newspapers have labeled a police cover-up.
	   Criminal investigation chief Lucas Managuelod said an
investigation showed inconsistencies in two police accounts of the
Oct. 13 deaths.
	   Indicted were Inspector David Pascual, chief of the Manila
police Special Weapons and Tactics team, and three SWAT team
members.
	   In an initial report, Pascual said a SWAT team member stopped a
passing taxi to question the men, who shot and killed him. Pascual
said other policemen then shot at the men, killing all three.
	   That version was disputed by local newspapers, which printed
photographs of the SWAT team arresting two of the men and placing
them in a police van. They said the third man was killed in an
earlier encounter in which a police officer was also killed.
	   Pascual then revised his report, saying two of the men were
arrested after the initial encounter. They later tried to escape
and were shot by police in a running gunbattle, he said.
	   Managuelod said empty shells were found at the scene of the
clash in a single pile, which would be inconsistent with a running
gunbattle. One of the slain suspects also had stab wounds, which
would not have occurred in a shootout, he said.
	   The suspects ``were shot at close range and there were
indications that there was no running gunbattle,'' Managuelod said.
	   Manila Police chief Col. Virtus Gil, who backed the earlier
police accounts, relieved the three policemen and their commander
from duty.
	   Philippine police have frequently been accused of summarily
executing suspected criminals.
	   In a prominent case, police general Panfilo Lacson, leader of
the Presidential Anti-Crime Task Force, and 25 other policemen were
charged in the deaths of 13 suspected members of a robbery gang in
1995.
	   The case is still pending in court.

Death and disappearance strike Serb and Albanian families alike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NERODIMLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ All of Muharem Sejdija's sons were
rebellious. He sent two of them to Switzerland. But a third, Sejdi,
joined the Kosovo Liberation Army. He died for his trouble.
	   Sejdi detested his father. He sent a message home saying that
when the fight for the independence of this southern province of
Serbia was over, he would come back, tie his father to a car and
drag him until he died.
	   The father's sin? He got along with the Serbs.
	   Even those who try to find a middle ground in Kosovo find
themselves swept up in violence they have tried to avoid since
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
secessionist rebels in February.
	   Hundreds have been killed, and hundreds of thousands driven from
their homes. Many are afraid to return to the province in southern
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Sejdija and his wife, Hajrije, live in this mixed village of 400
families, about half of whom are ethnic Albanians.
	   The couple fled to Macedonia for a time during the worst of the
fighting this summer, but they are back now and can't understand
why everyone doesn't return. There is nothing to fear, he assures a
visitor in his comfortable parlor.
	   Perhaps that's true. But Sejdija is decidedly nervous as a Serb
major, captain and lieutenant listen in on his conversation with a
foreign journalist. His wife, too, is tense. She speaks in a
strong, confident voice, but her hands are unsteady as she serves
coffee and brandy.
	   The Sejdijas are a prominent family in this community 35 miles
(55 kilometers) south of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. In normal
times, it numbers about 2,000 inhabitants.
	   ``The problems came from the `forest people,''' said Sejdija,
unwilling to use the term KLA when referring to the rebel fighters
in the forests and mountains around the village. ``One of my Serb
neighbors, Dragan Milic, was killed in July. We don't hear much
shooting now.''
	   Police insisted on escorting a reporter to the upper part of the
village, however, where pockmarked and charred houses testify to
the intensity of the conflict.
	   ``Down here, in the lower village, there are no problems,'' said
Mrs. Sejdija, pouring another round of brandy. ``Serbs and
Albanians live together as we always have. No forest people come
here.''
	   Adds her husband: ``I can't explain why the people don't come
back.''
	   He glances at the policemen.
	   ``They are afraid of the forest people,'' he says. ``I believe
the people will come back. I really don't know why they left.''
	   Last month, Sejdija was called in to identify the body of his
son. He could barely recognize the bearded, unkempt corpse before
him. It was a sad day, a sad end for a rebellious son, one of the
forest people.
	   Tragedy has struck Serb villagers, too. In at least one case,
however, there is hope.
	   Simja Lukic, an electrician with eight children, was kidnapped
from here three months ago.
	   ``We were sitting in the house about 6 p.m., when he said I have
to go chop some wood,'' said Mrs. Lukic, recounting her story on a
rough village bench, bundled up in two homemade sweaters.
	   He never came back.
	   On Oct. 12, Lukic's sister, who lives in Sweden, was taping
television news about Kosovo from the Euro News channel when she
saw her brother. On the film he was stacking cornstalks in a field
with a KLA soldier standing near him. Mrs. Lukic recognized some of
the other Albanians.
	   ``I know that Albanian family,'' she said. ``Maybe they are
keeping the KLA from killing him. He used to work with one of them.
If he is with that family, he is OK.''
	   There has been no message, however. And Mrs. Lukic can't
understand why her husband isn't allowed to come home.
	   ``It's been 99 days,'' she sobbed. Her daughter held her hand.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks sink for fourth day
</HEADLINE>

ADDS aggregate stock trading statistics, dollar-yen range, other

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Wednesday on
worries that Brazil might unsettle U.S. financial markets by
devaluing its currency. Tokyo stocks fell for a fourth straight
trading day.
	   The dollar bought 117.88 yen in late trading, down 1.48 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but slightly above its late New York rate of
117.75 yen overnight.
	   It was weighed down in Tokyo by speculation about a sudden
devaluation in Brazil's currency, even though Brazilian officials
and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin denied there were any
plans for such a move.
	   Traders were wary that a currency crisis in Brazil might trigger
a sell-off on U.S. financial markets that could, in turn, weaken
the dollar. The U.S. currency was also hurt by bouts of selling by
players anxious to dump part of their large dollar positions, they
said.
	   ``The consensus now is that when the dollar approaches 120 yen,
Japanese exporters, U.S. hedge funds and others would sell dollars
to hedge,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign exchange manager at
Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   The dollar ranged between 117.65 yen and 118.48 yen in Tokyo
trading.
	   The Bank of Japan's decision Wednesday to leave a key lending
rate at a record low had little impact on the foreign exchange
market, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average rose briefly into positive territory in early
trading, but closed down 304.61 points, or 2.20 percent, at
13,516.07. On Tuesday, it had lost 22.78 points, or 0.16 percent.
	   ``Uncertainty over the world economy sent export-oriented blue
chip shares such as Sony down,'' said Takeshi Kubota, general
manager of stock information at Meiko Securities Co.
	   Sony fell 6.20 percent to 8,010 yen (dlrs 67.86) after Morgan
Stanley downgraded the company's stock from ``strong buy'' to the
slightly less desirable ``outperform.''
	   After the close of trading, Sony reported its group net profit
for the latest six months had fallen 5.4 percent from a year
earlier to 86.05 billion yen (dlrs 728.99 million).
	   As worry about earnings mounted, many investors held back to
await more details about a new government economic stimulus package
due out next month.
	   The head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's panel on tax
policy, Yoshiro Hayashi, told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday that
new tax cuts should total more than 7 trillion yen (dlrs 59.30
billion).
	   Yet any hopes aggressive government efforts will jump start an
anemic economy were overshadowed by the latest batch of gloomy
statistics.
	   Though the Japanese trade ministry reported Wednesday that
industrial production rose 2.5 percent last month from August, it
expects output to fall in October and November. Meanwhile, retail
sales in September slid for a fifth consecutive month.
	   A sharp decline in the Nikkei average near the close of trading
may have been triggered, in part, by data transmission problems
that apparently pushed down stock future prices, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 14.37 points, or 1.37 percent, to 1,028.61.
It had lost 5.76 points, or 0.55 percent, the previous day.
	   Declines exceeded advances 740 to 337 on the first section, with

Israel lifts closure, curfew in Hebron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli army on Wednesday removed
travel restrictions imposed on Palestinians in Hebron earlier this
week after a Jewish settler was killed in the tense town.
	   Troops lifted a curfew that had been imposed Monday in the
downtown Hebron area controlled by Israel, confining 30,000
Palestinians to their homes.
	   The army also removed roadblocks it had set up around the city,
barring Palestinians from entering or leaving Hebron.
	   The decision was made after Palestinian security forces arrested
two suspects in the killing of the settler, 29-year-old Danny
Vargas from the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   The arrests were a sign of new security cooperation between
Israelis and Palestinians, an apparent result of the new Mideast
peace accord signed last week in Washington.
	   ``We hope they will continue taking restrictions off us and we
can have normal lives,'' said Wael Dandis, a Palestinian resident
of Hebron.
	   The residents of downtown Hebron have been under curfew twice
for extended periods since August, for a total of more than three
weeks.

Indonesian students protest government plans for election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to raise number of student protesters near Parliament
to 8,000 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 8,000 students demonstrated near
Parliament Wednesday against an upcoming government assembly that
will cast guidelines for elections in 1999.
	   Some protesters tore down part of a toll road fence, but there
were no reports of arrests.
	   Next month, legislators and other delegates will gather at the
Parliament building in Jakarta to shape electoral laws in one of
Indonesia's most critical steps toward democracy.
	   However, student activists said most of the delegates are
holdovers from the authoritarian era of former President Suharto,
who quit in May after riots and protests. His successor, B.J.
Habibie, has pledged to open up the political system.
	   Police blocked protesters from marching to the gates of
Parliament. So the activists gathered nearby, partly blocking a
toll road that leads to the international airport.
	   They tore down part of a fence but police did not move in.
	   The protesters raised banners demanding that Suharto, who is
accused of siphoning off state wealth for his family's benefit, be
put on trial on charges of corruption. The 77-year-old former
leader has denied any wrongdoing.
	   Meanwhile, hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri gathered at a University of Indonesia campus. They
also shouted slogans against the People's Consultative Assembly,
which will debate the laws for the general election.
	   Protesters said the 1,000 assembly members, many of whom were
appointed by Suharto, do not represent Indonesia's 200 million
people.

U.N. official confirms meeting blocked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The U.N. special rapporteur on religious
intolerance confirmed Wednesday that he had been prevented from
meeting with a top official of the banned Unified Buddhist Church
of Vietnam.
	   ``It's a fact,'' Abdelfattah Amor told reporters in Hanoi before
wrapping up a 10-day visit to assess religious freedom in the
communist country, which strictly regulates church activities.
	   He did not elaborate on the incident.
	   Thich Quang Do, secretary-general of the Unified Buddhist
Church, said by telephone Tuesday that Amor and other U.N.
officials were turned away by plainclothes police at the gate of
the Thanh Minh Zen monastery in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday.
	   Do, released from prison last month after nearly four years as
part of a general amnesty for more than 5,000 inmates, had asked to
meet with Amor.
	   The Vietnamese government denied Tuesday that restrictions had
been placed on the U.N. official.
	   ``The schedule of Mr. Amor ... is being carried out according to
the agreement of both sides,'' the Foreign Ministry's Press
Department said. ``There is no such prevention of his activities in
Vietnam as reported.''
	   Amor, a Tunisian, first asked to visit Vietnam three years ago.
The government finally gave him approval in July.
	   Buddhism is Vietnam's primary religion. Any religion not
sanctioned by the government is considered superstition that must
be eliminated. That includes the Unified Buddhist Church of
Vietnam, which is separate from the approved Buddhist church.
	   Human rights groups say church leaders have been jailed in the
past because of their religious practices. Officials deny they hold
any religious prisoners, just people who have broken the law.
	   The U.S. Congress has included Vietnam on a list of 36 countries
that practice religious suppression. Vietnam responded by calling
that a distortion and suggested Congress should reconsider an ``old
and meaningless story.''
	   Communist Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu said in June that
Vietnam ``truly respects religious freedom,'' but that religious
activities must follow the country's laws and policies.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In an emotional ceremony, officials and old
soldiers gathered Wednesday to honor 115 Chinese who died fighting
for Hong Kong in World War II but were ignored for decades by
British colonial rulers because they were called into action by the
communists.
	   ``Only after Hong Kong's return to the motherland could we get
this honor,'' said Cheung King Fai, 71, a veteran of the
Independent Battalion. It was formed by China's Communist army to
fight the Japanese occupation that ended in 1945 after three years
and eight months of hardship for Hong Kong people.
	   The government chose the Chung Yeung Festival, one of two days
each year when Hong Kong Chinese honor their ancestors by sweeping
and cleaning their graves, to add the names of the dead soldiers to
an official war shrine.
	   ``Better late than never,'' Cheung said.
	   A police band played sad tunes as Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa and Law Aw-fung, head of a group of former battalion
members, brought a bound volume of the names to the memorial.
	   Veterans, many donning war medals, bowed their heads for two
minutes of silence. Then a police rifle squad fired a salute and
the band played China's national anthem.
	   ``The dead can now rest in peace. The families of those who died
can now be comforted,'' Law said. Some relatives of the dead
warriors traveled to Hong Kong from mainland China to see them
officially recognized, more than five decades after the war.
	   The Independent Battalion fought to liberate Hong Kong from
Japanese occupation, but its fallen members were previously
excluded from the war memorial because of their ties to Chinese
communists, who organized the 1,000-member battalion after Britain
surrendered Hong Kong to the Japanese.
	   About 400 of the veterans survive, half living in Hong Kong,
which last year reverted from British to Chinese rule.
	   Jack Edwards, 80, a Briton who was a war prisoner during the
Japanese occupation, laid a wreath and bowed three times, a
traditional Chinese tribute to the deceased.
	   ``I bowed today,'' Edwards said. ``I swore after the war I would
never bow to anyone again because I bowed to the Japanese.''
	   No Japanese representatives were invited. Edwards said all war
dead should be remembered, but he does not support inviting
Japanese officials to such ceremonies unless the government in
Tokyo offers a full apology for wartime atrocities.
	   Hong Kong's top official, Tung, said that someday the Japanese
might be welcome.
	   ``We need to learn lessons of the past,'' Tung told reporters.
``But we also need to bury the past and not be the slaves of the
past.''

Uranium mine may threaten archaeological sites, U.N. delegations
</HEADLINE>
told &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ Archaeological sites that show humans
lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a
uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a
high-level U.N. committee was told Wednesday.
	   The Australian branch of the International Council on Monuments
and Sites said the impact on archaeological and rock art sites in
the region of the mine had not been properly assessed.
	   In a submission to the U.N. team, which is investigating whether
the mine threatens the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu,
the council said it was particularly concerned about the
Malakunanja 2 archaeological site, just 1.2 miles (2 kilometers)
from the mine entrance.
	   ``Malakunanja 2 is acknowledged as currently offering the oldest
dated evidence of human occupation in Australia, dating some
50,000-60,000 years ago based on thermoluminescence dating of
buried sands,'' the submission said.
	   The council was ``not convinced that the archaeological evidence
of Malakunanja 2 will retain its integrity given the pressures of
the proposed mine.''
	   Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. has begun construction of the
Jabiluka mine, which lies on a lease within the boundaries of
Kakadu but technically not part of the park. Environmental groups
and local Aborigines oppose the mine.
	   ``It is not certain what impacts noise, vibration, dust and
changes to the water table might have on the natural processes of
deterioration (of the site) and whether any acceleration of
deterioration will occur,'' the council said.
	   It called on the delegation to declare Kakadu a world heritage
area that is ``in danger'' unless Jabiluka is stopped.
	   The delegation will recommend whether to list Kakadu as the 26th
``in danger'' site of the 552 sites recognized by the United
Nations' World Heritage Bureau for environmental and cultural
values. The decision will be made at the bureau's meeting in Kyoto,
Japan, in December.
	   ERA and Australia's government claim Jabiluka will not hurt the
park.
	   If listed as in danger, Kakadu would join the likes of the old
city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, and the war-torn
cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of
Mali.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Bank of Japan's chief policy-making board
announced Wednesday that it has left a key lending rate unchanged
at a record low.
	   A majority of the central bank's nine-member board, which meets
every two weeks, voted to keep the overnight call money rate at
around 0.25 percent, the BOJ said.
	   Last month, the central bank guided the overnight call rate down
to that level from around 0.5 percent in an effort to prevent Japan
from falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   The move marked the first change in monetary policy since
September 1995, when the BOJ cut its official discount rate, the
rate at which it lends to commercial banks, to a record low 0.5
percent and led the overnight call rate slightly below that level.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Coca-Cola Co. has opened a dlrs 25 million
bottling plant in north-central China that will make Coca-Cola,
Fanta and Sprite available to 31 million more Chinese, the company
announced Wednesday.
	   The plant, Taiyuan Coca-Cola Beverage Co., will employ 400
people in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province. It is a joint
venture between Kerry Beverages, Cofco Industries Development Co.
and Xishan Coal and Electricity Co., Coca-Cola said in a press
release.
	   The joint venture is Coca-Cola's 22nd plant in China.
	   Kerry Beverages plans to open bottling plants in Chengdu and
Kunming by mid-1999. By then, Coca-Cola will have invested about
dlrs 800 million in China, the company said.
	   ___ TOKYO (AP) _ Reflecting weak demand in neighboring Asian
nations, Japanese exports of cars, trucks and buses slid 3.3
percent in September for a fifth consecutive month of declines, an
industry group said Wednesday.
	   A total of 421,339 vehicles were exported last month, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
	   Passenger car shipments in September fell 0.1 percent compared
to the previous month to 338,925 vehicles, while truck exports
dropped 14.5 percent to 78,253 and bus exports skidded 16.7 percent
to 4,161, the association said.
	   Shipments to the U.S., the largest single market for Japanese
vehicles, rose 3.8 percent to 120,957. But exports to Asia plunged
50.1 percent to 28,459 vehicles, it said. Europe-bound exports
climbed 2.8 percent to 89,502.
	   Among leading manufacturers, Toyota Motor Corp. shipments
overseas in September fell 2.2 percent on the month to 129,892
vehicles and Honda Motor Co. exports slipped 11.8 percent to
47,948. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. shipments abroad fell 34.7 percent
to 41,368.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The closure of 22 Philippine banks
since the start of Asia's financial crisis does not indicate that
serious problems are appearing in the country's banking system,
central bank Gov. Gabriel Singson said.
	   ``I think we should be careful to distinguish between the
failure of individual banks and systemic failure,'' Singson said,
noting that the combined deposits of all the 22 failed banks
amounted to less than one third of 1 percent of the total deposits
in the banking system.
	   ``This is far too insignificant to put the entire banking system
at risk unless people panic,'' he said.
	   Singson's comments were part of a speech that was to have been
delivered earlier this week. Although the speech wasn't made, the
text was released Wednesday.
	   Most of the banks that have failed over the past 16 months have
been small rural thrift and savings banks. So far, only one
commercial bank _ a small one _ has been placed into receivership.
	   The central bank has taken numerous measures to strengthen the
capital of banks and tighten prudential standards since the
regional crisis started.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and Exxon Corp. of the
United States will jointly develop automotive systems designed to
reduce emissions and improve efficiency, Toyota said Wednesday.
	   The two companies will develop internal combustion engines and
hybrid gas-electric engines, and also the fuels and lubricants that
the new engines will require, Toyota said in a release.
	   ``In the short term, our goal is to reduce emissions. Our
long-term goal is to develop more efficient, next-generation power
sources,'' said Toyota's Vice Executive President Akihiro Wada.
	   Bill Innes, President of Exxon Research and Engineering company,
said improving the ``performance of hydrocarbons in low emission
vehicles is one of our key business priorities.''
	   ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok Bank, the largest bank in
Thailand, may seek government help to recapitalize if its number of
nonperforming loans keeps mounting, local papers reported on
Wednesday.
	   ``If the nonperforming loans move higher, I cannot guarantee
that we will not increase capital,'' Bangkok Bank Chairman Chatri
Sophonpanich was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post.
	   About 30 percent of the bank's loans are considered
nonperforming, meaning the debtors are not repaying the bank. Some
analysts have predicted that nonperforming loans for Thailand's
banking sector could rise as high as 45 percent of all loans.
	   Bangkok Bank, however, was considered to be in solid enough
financial shape that it would not need government help.
	   The Thai government is currently instituting a restructuring
plan for the banking sector which has been hit hard by the
country's economic crisis.
	   Four of the country's 15 commercial banks have been taken over
by the government.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government's science
organization and British Aerospace Wednesday signed a Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 12 million) research agreement which they claim
will put Australia at the forefront of the global aircraft industry
into the next century.
	   The research will involve the development of tougher composite
materials for building lighter aircraft structures and will help
devise more effective and environmentally-friendly ways to monitor
and extend the life of aerospace parts, officials said.
	   Colin Adam, deputy chief executive of the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said the agreement
was a great step forward for the industry in Australia.
	   ``This is a move that will keep Australia at the cutting edge of
international aerospace science into the 21st Century,'' Adam said.
	   Three of the five projects will be carried out in collaboration
with the Australian government's Defense Science and Technology
Organization.
	   Aviation technology has been one of Australia's fastest-growing
high-tech export industries over the past 10 years, with the value
of overseas sales rising from Australian dollars 340 million (U.S.
dlrs 207 million) in 1988-89 to Australian dollars 769 million
(U.S. dlrs 470 million) in 1996-97.

Koreans on Sakhalin Island seeking to go home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Koreans deported by the Japanese military to
Sakhalin Island more than 50 years ago may be able to return to
their native country, the Interfax news agency said Wednesday.
	   Japan seized the southern part of the island off Russia's
Pacific coast in 1905, and the Soviet Union did not recapture it
until 1945. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910-1945, and
deported 1,300 Koreans to Sakhalin between 1943 and 1945.
	   Representatives of the South Korean Foreign Ministry and the Red
Cross arrived in Sakhalin on Wednesday, Interfax said. They were
scheduled to hold talks Thursday with those who want to return to
their birthplace, it said.
	   Interfax said 500 Koreans have returned home over the past five
years.

electronics products such as computer monitors and cellular phones,
the company said Wednesday.
	   The consumer electronics giant also substantially lowered its
profit forecast for the full year, citing the yen's rapid rise
against the dollar and expected fallout from the global financial
crisis.
	   Sony's group net profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 was
86.05 billion yen (dlrs 731 million), down from 90.93 billion yen
(dlrs 773 million) in the same period a year earlier, the company
said.
	   Sales climbed 9.8 percent to 3.37 trillion yen (dlrs 28.6
billion) from the previous year's 3.07 trillion yen (dlrs 26.1
billion).
	   Best known for TVs and its Walkman stereos, Sony has branched
out in recent years and now makes computers, cellular phones and
semiconductors. Its subsidiaries make the PlayStation video game
machine, produce music CDs and sell insurance.
	   Profits dropped in three areas for Sony: electronics, music and
insurance.
	   Sony's electronics business slumped due to intense price
competition and sluggish sales in Asia, Russia and Latin America _
areas hurt especially hard by the global financial crisis.
	   The company's failure to produce hit records by Japanese
musicians dragged down profits at its recording subsidiary while
the insurance business was hurt by market declines.
	   The brightest spot was profit in Sony's game division, which
raced ahead thanks to strong sales of its PlayStation game console
in Europe and the United States.
	   For the full year ending next March, Sony forecast net profit
would slump 23 percent to 170 billion yen (dlrs 1.4 billion) from
222.07 billion yen (dlrs 1.9 billion) last year. The company
previously had forecast 215 billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) for the
year.
	   Sony said it expected sales to decline further in Asia, Russia,
Latin America and Eastern Europe due to the economic crisis
gripping those regions. The yen's recent gain against the dollar
would also hurt profits by making Sony's goods more expensive, and
thus less competitive, in overseas markets.

Banks exercise option to issue more Swisscom shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The banks coordinating the initial
share offer in telephone company Swisscom said Wednesday they have
exercised an option to issue 3.3 million more shares.
	   The government-controlled Swisscom, formerly the
telecommunications arm of Switzerland's postal service, began
selling shares to the public with an initial offering of about 30
percent of the firm's share capital earlier this month.
	   Warburg Dillon Read and J.P. Morgan said the additional shares
will bring the Swiss government another 1.1 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 810 million). They bring to 34.5 percent the total of the
firm's share capital sold.
	   The original offer of some 22 million shares raised around 7.5
billion francs (dlrs 5.5 billion), making it the largest European
share offer so far this year.
	   The Swiss government decided to go ahead with the sale, the
country's biggest privatization yet, despite turmoil in global
markets.
	   Swisscom said the issue was three-times oversubscribed.

India's onion crisis spills over to Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ India's onion crisis has set off a
chain reaction in neighboring Sri Lanka, yanking up prices and
forcing the government to look to other countries for supplies,
trade officials said Wednesday.
	   But diehard Sri Lankan gourmets insist on getting Indian onions,
which they insist are more pungent than those from other countries.
	   Sri Lanka imports about 10,000 tons of onions each month from
India. Heavy rains destroyed crops in India's ``onion bowl'' state
of Maharashtra, which accounts for 27 percent of the country's
annual production of 5 million tons.
	   ``After being convinced that India will not be able to give us
any onions we are looking at markets in Holland, Iran, Pakistan and
even Iraq,'' said Anthony Ratnayake, a director at Sri Lanka's
state-run Cooperative Wholesale Establishment.
	   ``It looks like we will have to do with non-Indian onions. It is
painful, but we have no option,'' he told The Associated Press. To
start with, Ratnayake has placed a small order of 500 tons from
Holland.
	   The Indian onions left on Sri Lankan market shelves are fetching
high prices with one kilogram (2.2 pounds) costing between 70 to 80
Sri Lankan rupees (dlrs 1.06 to dlrs 1.22), up from 30 to 35 Sri
Lankan rupees (45 to 53 cents.)
	   Several parts of India are facing the worst onion shortage in
decades with prices jumping from eight Indian rupees (20 cents) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) to about 60 Indian rupees (dlrs 1.40).

Slovak government formed after weeks of protracted negotiations

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ More than a month after elections
ended the rule of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, leaders of a
four-party coalition announced Wednesday they had agreed on
formation of a new government.
	   Party leaders are to sign the pact later in the day after
agreeing on the distribution of Cabinet posts.
	   In balloting last month, the coalition won 93 of the 150 seats
in the Slovak parliament. Meciar's government will resign Thursday,
when the new parliament convenes for the first time.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, the leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
is expected to succeed Meciar as prime minister.
	   The Democratic Coalition party will receive eight other posts,
including the foreign ministry. The second largest member of the
coalition, the Democratic Left, will get six ministries.
	   Three will go to the Hungarian Coalition party, which represents
the country's ethnic Hungarian minority. The smallest member, the
Party of Civic Understanding, ended up with two posts.
	   The coalition parties also agreed to support the chairman of the
Civic Understanding party, Rudolf Schuster, for Slovakia's mostly
figurehead president.
	   Schuster, mayor of Slovakia's second largest city Kosice and a
former ambassador to Canada, was one of two candidates nominated
for the presidency to fill a position vacant since March, when
Michal Kovac's term expired.
	   Kovac is the second presidential candidate.
	   The negotiations lasted until the early hours Wednesday, after
two exhausting days of discussions. The turning point came when the
Hungarians gave up their demand for the agriculture ministry, which
went to the Party of the Democratic Left.
	   The biggest stumbling block had been the initial refusal by the
Party of the Democratic Left to participate in a government with
the Hungarian Coalition party. This was resolved at the party's
congress last Saturday.
	   Meciar had ruled with near-autocratic power since 1993, and
there had been widespread speculation he would refuse to step down,
even if he lost the election.

	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan Wednesday by its disgruntled captain, who
allegedly told authorities he did it because he was angered over
pay and working conditions.
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing for the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but was diverted in the air and arrived safely under
military jet escort at Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17
a.m. (0317 GMT). No passengers were hurt, officials said.
	   The captain, identified as Yuan Bin, brought his wife along and
some media reports suggested he had been seeking to escape an
unhappy life, although officials did not confirm this motive.
	   Taiwan Television showed the captain in his uniform white shirt,
carrying a suitcase as he was led out of the plane by policemen in
helmets and bulletproof vests. His wife, identified as Xu Mei, was
shown in a black coat.
	   Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said Yuan admitted he diverted
the Boeing 737 to Taiwan because he was displeased with Air China's
policies and his pay. It was not immediately clear what Yuan hoped
to accomplish.
	   ``There was no political motive,'' Huang said.
	   Chang Chia-ju, Taiwan's aeronautics chief, said Yuan would be
detained to face trial in Taiwan. Authorities were planning to let
Air China's other pilots fly the jetliner and its 95 passengers and
eight remaining crew members back to China.
	   Hours after the hijacking, the airplane was still on the runway,
guarded by police.
	   Air China, the main airline run by the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, had two pilots and two co-pilots aboard
the flight, which was scheduled to have continued its flight from
Kunming to Yangon, Myanmar, Chang said.
	   Defense Ministry officials said the Air China jetliner was
escorted to the airport by four Taiwanese warplanes, which took off
after spotting the jet on radar.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew condemned Wednesday's
incident.
	   ``We've never agreed to such deeds,'' he told reporters _
although Taiwan in recent memory used to shower hijackers from
mainland China with gold and cash rewards. Taiwan began cracking
down on the hijackers after longstanding tensions with the mainland
began easing in the 1980s.
	   The 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed for
up to 10 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to China.
	   China has demanded that Taiwan send all the hijackers back. The
two sides were near reaching an agreement about repatriation in
1995 when China broke off the talks in anger over a Taiwanese drive
to gain diplomatic recognition.
	   In recent months, the two sides have slowly approached each
other to restore the long-stalled dialogue.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

Dissident's attorneys say he can't get fair trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar's adopted brother appealing his conviction,
last 3 grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A judge on Wednesday threw out an
appeal claiming a government conspiracy against jailed dissident
Anwar Ibrahim, calling it ``sensational.''
	   The ruling paved the way for Anwar's criminal trial to begin as
scheduled Monday.
	   Lawyers for Anwar told High Court Judge Wahab Patail that Anwar
was arrested and detained illegally and that he could not get a
fair trial as the judiciary had been tainted by a high-level
government conspiracy against their client.
	   Wahab dismissed the habeas corpus appeal, calling it ``plainly
and obviously frivolous.''
	   He said the claims of a government conspiracy against Anwar were
``far-reaching and scandalous allegations'' that were as absurd
``as being told an alien spaceship has landed in Merdeka Square.''
	   Merdeka, or Independence, Square, where Malaysia celebrated its
freedom from British rule in 1957, has been the site of several
anti-government protests by Anwar supporters.
	   Anwar, scheduled to stand trial on 10 counts alleging corruption
and homosexual activity, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal
Security Act after rallies at which he called for the resignation
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The ISA allows indefinite detention without trial if suspects
are deemed a threat to national security.
	   Anwar has since been released from under the law and moved to a
regular prison. But his attorneys say that police did not carry out
proper procedure in his arrest, so in effect, he remains detained
under the ISA.
	   Wahab ruled that since Anwar had been released from the ISA and
moved to a prison, the hearing was moot and that his criminal trial
would go ahead as planned.
	   In an affidavit filed in court by Anwar's wife Wednesday, Anwar
called his release from the ISA a joke.
	   ``My release from ISA detention is Mahathir's gimmick because of
his fear of the people's wrath and the reaction of the
international community,'' Anwar said in the document dated Oct.
17. ``The plan was to get me out of ISA detention before APEC
begins.''
	   The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade forum will be held
in the Malaysian capital in two weeks. Twenty world leaders,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, were expected to attend;
some have said they will bring up the Anwar case.
	   Anwar was sacked Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the
Southeast Asian country.
	   Anwar was then jailed and charged with corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He has pleaded innocent to the charges, which he
says were trumped up by his political enemies to undermine his
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year leadership.
	   His defense attorneys told Wahab, the brother of one of the
prosecutors in the Anwar case, the trial was already tainted.
	   ``There has been a conspiracy right from the beginning,'' said
Haji Sulaiman. ``The taint of illegality continues throughout.''
	   Sulaiman said police violated Anwar's constitutional rights by
not allowing him to speak to his attorneys after his arrest and not
taking Anwar to court to be charged within 24 hours.
	   He said that Anwar's sacking, expulsion from the ruling party
and the sexual allegations released through affidavits and smeared
on the front pages of the government-backed newspapers were
indicators of a ``high-level conspiracy.''
	   He also said repeated comments by Mahathir about Anwar's case
would influence the outcome of the trial.
	   Meanwhile, Sukma Dermawan, a potential key government witness
who was convicted for sexual relations with Anwar, filed a petition
seeking his release and questioning his conviction, The Star
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The petition filed Tuesday claims Sukma, who is Anwar's adopted
brother, should have been tried by an Islamic court since he is
Muslim. A High Court sentenced him Sept. 19 to six months in jail.
The High Court will hear the appeal Nov. 2, alongside the opening
of Anwar's trial.
	   On Saturday, Munawar Aness, Anwar's former speech writer, who
was jailed along with Sukma, appealed his conviction. He said
police coerced him into confessing to sex with Anwar.

Philippine police rescue six kidnap victims, arrest five suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine police rescued four
children, their maid and a driver who were kidnapped in a Manila
suburb at the same time that President Joseph Estrada was
announcing the arrest of a separate group of suspected kidnappers,
police said Wednesday.
	   Panfilo Lacson, chief of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime
Task Force, said the six victims were returning home from school
when they were abducted Monday in Quezon City, where the national
police headquarters is located.
	   While they were being kidnapped, Estrada was announcing at a
news conference the capture of eight kidnapping suspects and the
rescue of four victims. It was the first major victory in Estrada's
high-profile campaign against rampant kidnappings in the Manila
area and in the southern Philippines.
	   The parents of the children reported the kidnapping to police
and authorities monitored discussions of the ransom demand, Lacson
said.
	   He said police arrested five of the kidnappers as they received
the 1.15 million pesos (dlrs 28,000) in ransom Tuesday outside the
University of Santo Tomas in Manila. The children, the maid and the
driver were found in a vehicle parked nearby.
	   The kidnappers had initially demanded 20 million pesos (dlrs
487,800) in ransom, Lacson said.
	   Police seized two pistols, four cellular phones, police uniforms
and several passports from the suspects, he said.
	   The group is believed to have been involved in at least six
other kidnappings in the Manila area.
	   Kidnapping is a thriving criminal activity in the Manila area
and in the southern Philippines. Most of the kidnappings in Manila
are carried out by criminal groups, some with police connections,
while most in the south are by suspected Muslim rebels.
	   Estrada promised in June to end the kidnappings within six
months.

Ward murder case makes its way slowly through Kenyan justice
</HEADLINE>
system &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The second trial for the murder of a
British tourist in a famous game reserve a decade ago moved a step
closer to opening arguments Wednesday when a judge referred the
case to the chief justice to name a judge and set a date.
	   ``Case is to be mentioned before the chief justice for purposes
of appropriate directions on Nov. 3, 1998,'' Judge Otieno Onyango
said.
	   Former game warden Simon Ole Makallah has pleaded not guilty to
charges that he murdered Julie Ward in the Maasai Mara game reserve
between Sept. 6 and 13, 1988.
	   Makallah, 49, is currently assistant director of the Kenya
Wildlife Service. He was a game warden in the Maasai Mara at the
time of Ward's death and served as a witness for the prosecution in
the first murder trial that ended in aquittal of two men charged
with the death.
	   Chief Justice Zachaeus Chesoni is expected to fix a date and
appoint a judge who will hear the case on a daily basis, according
to one of Makallah's attorneys, Keriako Tobiko.
	   Last week both the prosecution and the defense requested that
the case be heard on a daily basis. Many trials in Kenya are
conducted only once a week.
	   The prosecution has said it would need about a month to call the
43 witnesses it has assembled.
	   In June 1992 after the aquittal of two park rangers, Justice
Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a flawed
investigation.
	   Makallah's attorneys said they will call 12 witnesses.
	   Makallah was arrested July 17 in connection with the slaying of
the 28-year-old Ward, whose mutilated and charred remains were
found Sept. 13, 1988 in the reserve near the Tanzanian border.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals.
	   Although Attorney General Amos Wako told a news conference with
Ward's father, John, a day after the arrest that there was
sufficient evidence to hold Makallah, he was not formally charged
until two months later and was denied bail.

report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due

	   Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said
the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,

King despondent over Cambodia's political and economic woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk's 76th
birthday Saturday will be an unhappy one, if his newly published
comments on Cambodia's political and economic woes are anything to
judge by.
	   Although the latest edition of Sihanouk's monthly bulletin,
released Wednesday, is filled with birthday wishes of good health
and luck for the king and his country from foreign heads of state,
the king's own writings are roundly pessimistic.
	   Copies of newspaper clippings on Cambodia with handwritten
comments by the king are a featured section of his monthly
bulletin.
	   ``Our little people are becoming more impoverished every day,
more miserable,'' Sihanouk lamented in the margins of a reprinted
newspaper report on poverty.
	   ``Our politicians only think about tearing at each other. Our
country has become one of the most impoverished and underdeveloped
in the world,'' the monarch wrote.
	   A peaceful July election gave a glimmer of hope that Cambodia
was on the verge of ending a yearlong political crisis, but three
months later the nation's bickering political parties have been
unable to come to terms on the formation of a new government.
	   Aid donors have warned that the continuing instability and the
current government's lack of international legitimacy are
magnifying the effects of a regional economic crisis and widespread
poverty inside Cambodia.
	   ``Our country has become a nation of thieves, gangsters,
assassins. It's very sad,'' the king wrote next to a story on a
recent crime surge in Phnom Penh.
	   Next to another article about illegal logging and deforestation,
Sihanouk wrote: ``One of the greatest misfortunes of our country.
Along with our other misfortunes, we are walking toward the death
of our nation in the 21st century.''
	   The three parties that won seats in parliament have called on
Sihanouk to chair a summit of top political leaders in hopes the
monarch's influence can break the political deadlock, but
disagreement on where the meeting should be held has delayed the
talks.
	   Two weeks ago, Sihanouk abandoned hopes that he could help solve
the impasse and announced plans to fly to Beijing next month to
receive medical treatment from his Chinese doctors.
	   But after a meeting with a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry
official last weekend, the king expressed renewed interest in
leading a summit in Phnom Penh before his departure.

Turkey delays maneuvers on Syrian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has decided to postpone military
maneuvers on the border with Syria in a goodwill gesture to allow
Damascus time to implement an agreement to crack down on Kurdish
rebels, Turkish news reports said Wednesday.
	   The exercises, planned for the first week of November, had been
designed as a sharp warning to Syria, which Turkey accused of
supporting autonomy-seeking rebels.
	   But at a National Security Council meeting Tuesday, the
military's top brass and the government decided to delay the
exercises by at least one month, the daily Hurriyet said.
	   Under the deal struck last week, Syria agreed to brand the
Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, a ``terrorist'' group and to clamp
down its activity in Syria. Weeks of tension over the Turkish
accusations of Syrian support for rebels had raised fears of a
regional conflict.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin confirmed late Tuesday that the
exercises could be delayed, but would not elaborate.
	   ``The exercises will take place but the time has to be
arranged,'' Sezgin said. ``They can be postponed for technical
reasons.''
	   Hurriyet said the Council agreed that the exercises could still
be rescheduled for November if Syria failed to live up to its
promises.
	   In the past Syria denied it supported the PKK. In a first step
in implementing the agreement, Syria called the autonomy-seeking
Kurdish group an ``illegal and unlicensed party.''
	   Turkey boast the second largest armed forces within NATO after
the United States.

Hostages freed during crackdown in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two people were freed and seven people arrested
during the first hours of a crackdown on hostage-takers in the
breakaway region of Chechnya, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The offensive by Chechen law enforcement officials began Monday
when they beefed up police checkpoints around the region and
threatened harsher punishment for hostage-takers. Relatives of the
hostages are also helping to look for the kidnappers.
	   The two released hostages had been held for more than six months
and a large ransom had been demanded, Chechen Security Minister
Aslanbek Arsayev told Interfax.
	   The seven people arrested were involved in their kidnapping, he
said. He gave no details about the hostages.
	   Kidnappings and other crimes have become common in Chechnya
since the end of its 1994-96 war with Russia. Chechen officials say
103 people are still being held, including three Britons, a New
Zealander and a Turk.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Philippine peso hits four-month high on strong dollar inflows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso hit a four-month
high against the dollar in heavy trading Wednesday, buoyed by
strong dollar inflows from stock investors, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 40.790 pesos for the day, down from
Tuesday's 41.220 pesos. The peso reached a high of 40.680 pesos per
dollar, its strongest level since 40.500 pesos on June 19.
	   Traders said remittances from Filipinos working overseas also
helped boost the peso.
	   ``Funds are still pouring into the stock market and it doesn't
look like it's about to end,'' a trader said.
	   Stocks closed slightly higher despite profit-taking, with the
market underpinned by the stronger peso and the softening of
domestic interest rates, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 9.73 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 1,602.23, extending a 6.10-point gain Tuesday.
The broader All Shares Index rose 2.53 points to 520.22.
	   Gainers outnumbered decliners 60 to 38, with 42 issues
unchanged.
	   Dealers said profit-taking in selected stocks wasn't
sufficiently strong to damp the overall market.
	   ``The general sentiment is still positive, helping us shake off
bouts of profit-taking,'' said Nicholas Ty, analyst for Capital One
Securities Inc.
	   The stock market has risen sharply over the past five trading
days on bargain-hunting and a general improvement in investor
sentiment. The stronger peso in recent days has also provided
considerable support to the stock market.
	   Oil refiner Petron, which reported its preliminary results for
the first nine months, was the day's most actively traded stock.
Its share price closed unchanged at 3.80 pesos, with analysts
unimpressed by a surge in net profit from a low level a year
earlier.
	   Metro Pacific rose 14 centavos, or 11 percent, to 1.36 pesos on
speculation that its parent company, Hong Kong's First Pacific, is
poised to acquire a substantial stake in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone, the country's largest telecommunications company. The
rumor was bolstered by PLDT's announcement Tuesday that it has
shelved a shareholder rights plan aimed at deterring a hostile
takeover.
	   Despite signs that profit-taking is spreading, Ty said stocks
are likely to continue to rise in coming days as long as the peso
remains stable.
	   ``There seems to be a minor resistance (for the index) at 1,630,
but reaching the 1,700 mark looks like a big possibility,'' he
said.
	   Ricardo Puig, research director at Kim Eng Securities, said
softening interest rates appear to be diverting some cash to stocks
from fixed-income instruments.
	   The rate on the benchmark 91-day treasury bill, the basis for
bank lending rates, is at 13.475 percent, down from 13.489 percent
last week.
	   ``There seems to be a lot of liquidity,'' he said.

Palestinian leader returns to carefully orchestrated welcome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Nearly a week after signing a new peace
agreement with Israel, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat returned
home Wednesday to a carefully orchestrated welcome by flag-waving
school students lining the streets of this border town.
	   Many Palestinians have been indifferent to the accord or
skeptical about whether Israel would keep its promise to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian
security guarantees.
	   Addressing those concerns Wednesday, Arafat said he was certain
Israel would carry out the agreement despite Tuesday's decision by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to postpone indefinitely an
Israeli Cabinet meeting that would approve the deal.
	   ``I think that what has been signed will be implemented
accurately,'' Arafat said after arriving at the Rafah border
crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' Arafat said. ``The signing was at the White
House ... in the presence of President Clinton.''
	   Netanyahu has said he would not carry out the withdrawal if his
Cabinet failed to approve the agreement or if the Palestinians did
not live up to their promise to wage a tough campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   Trying to convey a message of broad support for the agreement,
the Palestinian Authority had Palestinian school students line the
road Arafat took from the border crossing to his headquarters in
Gaza City. The children waved Palestinian flags and waved banners
reading ``Yes to those who free the land, no to those who sell
slogan,'' the latter a reference to Arafat's Islamic militant
opposition.

	   In its report, the commission had been expected to say that
although de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently came
to know about the roles of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok and Johan van der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but
failed to report the information to police.
	   The finding could have paved the way for de Klerk's prosecution
because he did not seek amnesty in connection with the bombings of
the buildings, which housed anti-apartheid groups.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, Vlok
and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for
amnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report the matter
to the police.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty to those who fully
confess to politically motivated crimes committed during apartheid.

Research deal signed on aircraft construction technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government's science
organization and British Aerospace signed a 20 million Australian
dollar (U.S. dlrs 12 million) research agreement Wednesday that
they say will put Australia at the forefront of the global aircraft
industry into the next century.
	   The research will involve the development of tougher composite
materials for building lighter aircraft structures and will help
devise more effective and environmentally friendly ways to monitor
and extend the life of aerospace parts, officials said.
	   Colin Adam, deputy chief executive of the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said the agreement
was a great step forward for the industry in Australia.
	   ``This is a move that will keep Australia at the cutting edge of
international aerospace science into the 21st century,'' Adam said.
	   ``The first five research contracts under this agreement are due
to commence this month and will be completed over the coming three
to four years.''
	   Barry Murphy, operations director for British Aerospace
Australia, said the deal would help build valuable expertise for
the long-term development of the high-technology industry in
Australia.
	   ``We believe these research contracts will play an important
role in developing Australia's competitive technological edge
within the aerospace and defense industry,'' he said.
	   Three of the five projects will be carried out in collaboration
with the Australian government's Defense Science and Technology
Organization.
	   Aviation technology has been one of Australia's fastest-growing
high-tech export industries over the past 10 years, with the value
of overseas sales rising from 340 million Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 207 million) in 1988-89 to 769 million Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 470 million) in 1996-97.

Russian envoy to Japan to prepare for meeting with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian envoy flew to Tokyo on Wednesday to help
prepare for the Japanese prime minister's visit to Moscow, news
agencies said.
	   Both ITAR-Tass and Interfax quoted President Boris Yeltsin's
press service as denying speculation the Nov. 10-13 visit by Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi would be canceled or postponed.
	   Yeltsin has canceled two of his own foreign trips because of bad
health, and has checked himself into a sanitarium for unspecified
treatment for high blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin flew to Tokyo to
continue preparations for Obuchi's visit, the news agencies said.
	   ``The possibility of postponing the visit is not considered,''
ITAR-Tass quoted Yeltsin's press service as saying.

Report: Chinese authorities freeze funds for Tiananmen victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities have frozen 11,620 German marks (dlrs
7,000) collected by Chinese students studying in Germany to help
victims of the 1989 military suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrations, a rights group said Wednesday.
	   Ding Zilin, a retired professor whose 17-year-old son died in
the crackdown, said in an open letter that bank officials in Wuxi,
eastern Jiangsu province, where she lives, did not allow her to
cash a check entrusted to her for the victims.
	   Bank officials said Monday the money was frozen for six months
on orders from the State Security Bureau, according to a copy of
the letter released by New York-based Human Rights in China.
	   Ding has led efforts by families of victims to ask the
government to re-examine the June 4, 1989, assault on demonstrators
and account for those who died. The government maintains the
demonstrations were an anti-Communist Party rebellion that needed
to be crushed to safeguard stability. The government has refused to
give a full account of the hundreds, possibly thousands, killed in
the crackdown.
	   Ding said the money was intended for people who suffered
injuries in the attack or families of those killed. She called on
the government to release the money, saying those it was meant for
are in dire need.
	   In her letter, Ding condemned the government's ``odious methods
of being condescending toward human rights and human feelings.''
	   Human Rights in China said it was the first time police had
confiscated donations for families of victims of the crackdown.

Warne has strong workout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's star leg-spinner Shane
Warne had an encouraging workout Wednesday as he continued to push
for selection in the Ashes series against England.
	   As Warne's coach Terry Jenner looked on, the injured Warne sent
down 40 deliveries at the MCG nets, in a major step in his recovery
from shoulder surgery in April.
	   He began tentatively but later increased the speed and improved
his line.
	   ``He would need to be pleased with that effort,'' Jenner said.
``The last over was terrific because he bowled the leg-stump line
that we know he is capable of.
	   ``It was somewhat slower than what he has bowled before, but
this is to only test his shoulder and not see how well he can
bowl.''
	   Warne said he would play for district cricket side St. Kilda
again this weekend after scoring a century last Saturday.
	   Whether he bowls will depend on how his shoulder responds
Thursday after Wednesday's session.
	   Warne was adamant he would not rush his return.
	   ``The real test is how I pull up tomorrow,'' Warne said. ``I
will ice it, see the physio and see how much strength I've got and
then have another bowl.
	   ``I won't be doing anything that is going to rush it, if it
means I have to wait two months or a month or whatever it takes, I
will wait until there is no stiffness and I pull up okay before I
actually play.''

Deutsche Telekom to cut prices to regain customers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Telekom AG reported a 22 percent
rise in net profit for the first nine months Wednesday, but
conceded it was losing customers to cheaper private competitors.
	   The former state-owned monopoly blamed growing market erosion
for stagnant sales of only 16.76 billion marks (dlrs 10.5 billion)
in the third quarter _ at the lower end of analysts expectations.
	   To regain market share, Deutsche Telekom said it will move
earlier than planned to implement ``aggressive price reductions''
in the next few weeks.
	   Telekom didn't announce by how much, but company sources said
rates for long-distance calls within Germany would drop by more
than half. Pending regulatory approval, the rates would fall Jan. 1
for customers with digital ISDN lines and later in the year for
those with older analog phones.
	   The company's nine-month preliminary net profit of 3 billion
marks (dlrs 1.9 billion) came in at the higher end of analysts'
expectations. Telekom said it was helped by ``positive developments
in our subsidiaries and associated companies,'' including a 36
percent growth in its mobile phone customer base.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In one of the biggest protests in
recent months, about 8,000 students demonstrated outside
Indonesia's Parliament Wednesday against an upcoming government
assembly that will cast guidelines for elections in 1999.
	   The protesters also demanded that President B.J. Habibie quit.
Some tore down part of a toll road fence, but there were no reports
of arrests or injuries.
	   Next month, legislators and other delegates will gather at the
Parliament building in Jakarta to shape electoral laws in one of
Indonesia's most critical steps toward democracy.
	   However, student activists said most of the delegates are
holdovers from the authoritarian era of former President Suharto,
who quit in May after riots and protests.
	   His successor Habibie, a close friend and former ally of
Suharto, has pledged to open up the political system.
	   However, critics, including student activists, say he is moving
too slowly or is trying to reshape the political landscape to help
him retain power when a president is elected next year.
	   Police stopped protesters from marching to the gates of
Parliament. So the activists gathered nearby, spilling over several
lanes of a busy toll road that leads to the international airport.
	   They tore down part of a fence and traffic was blocked for
several kilometers (miles).
	   More than 800 police and troops guarded the Parliament, but did
not move in.
	   Water cannon trucks and police horses were on standby within the
Parliament grounds.
	   The protesters raised banners demanding that Suharto, who is
accused of siphoning off state wealth for his family's benefit, be
put on trial on charges of corruption. The 77-year-old former
leader has denied any wrongdoing.
	   Meanwhile, hundreds of supporters of opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri gathered at a University of Indonesia campus. They
also shouted slogans against the People's Consultative Assembly,
which will debate the laws for the general election.
	   Protesters said the 1,000 assembly members, many of whom were
appointed by Suharto, do not represent Indonesia's 202 million
people.
	   Wednesday's protests coincide with the anniversary of the
founding of a nationalist movement by Indonesian youth activists in
1928 against Dutch colonial rule, which finally ended after World
War II.

China hands life sentence to South Korean retiree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A retired South Korean seaman has been sentenced
to life imprisonment in China for manufacturing and peddling 11.2
kilograms (24.6 pounds) of the synthetic narcotic methamphetamine,
state media said Wednesday.
	   The 60-year-old retiree was arrested in September 1996 in the
northeastern port city of Qinhuangdao, Hebei province, and
sentenced recently by the provincial Higher People's Court, the
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Xinhua identified the man by a Chinese name, Jin Zhenming.
	   As a seaman, he plied routes between China and South Korea,
Xinhua said. On his retirement, he came back to China in August
1994, ostensibly for medical treatment, and began manufacturing
methamphetamine, it said.
	   He said another South Korean taught him how to make the drug,
which is also known as ``ice,'' Xinhua added. Police arrested the
other South Korean, whom Xinhua identified as Li Xiurong, in the
Inner Mongolia region of China.
	   He was wanted by South Korean police for alleged drug offenses
and is being tried separately, along with seven others, Xinhua
said.

NATO keeps up guard in Kosovo as some refugees return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO decision, bitter disappointment from

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO is keeping more than 400
warplanes on alert as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
continues to withdraw forces from Kosovo and allows tens of
thousands of refugees to return home.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military alliance
did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one
expired Tuesday. That bitterly disappointed Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian politicians who hoped the Alliance would deliver a
devastating air blow to Milosevic's war machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet Hamiti of the League of
Democratic Kosovo said Wednesday. ``NATO has been frightening
itself for too long.''
	   But by warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hopes to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
residents are ethnic Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo
is a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana told a news conference after a 2
1-2-hour meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium, on
Tuesday.
	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' he said. ``I urge both sides
to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward.''
	   In an Oct. 12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
demanded that Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in
Kosovo to the levels of last February, when Milosevic began his
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have
died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters that NATO would move quickly to use force against
Yugoslavia if Milosevic sends troops and special police back to
Kosovo.
	   Albright said the NATO allies were preparing to organize a
rapid-reaction force based in the neighboring former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia that could intervene quickly and to protect
the 2,000 unarmed personnel who will verify that Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   A spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is overseeing the verification mission, said
Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was due in the Kosovo's capital
Pristina on Thursday to take charge of the operation.
	   The spokesman, Mons Nyberg, said he ``hoped'' some of the
verification personnel would arrive by the end of the week.
	   International officials hope the continued pressure will
encourage many refugees to return to their homes. Hugh Parmer of
the U.S. Agency for International Development visited a number of
Kosovo villages and towns.
	   ``The biggest difference is the hope I saw in the peoples' eyes
now compared to the fear I saw seven weeks ago,'' he said. ``It is
still a difficult situation, but if these people go home we will
have a manageable humanitarian situation. There should be no deaths
in the winter.''
	   Many of the displaced people are camping in the woods and hills.
	   In the village of Ostrozub, southwest of Pristina, Avdullah
Krasniqi loaded up his farm wagon with his wife, kids and household
goods and headed home Tuesday. The ethnic Albanian made his
decision less out of confidence that NATO had forced an end to the
crisis than the fact that it was getting colder in his mountain
refuge, where he and his family have spent three months.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, noting that
his next-door neighbor was shot and killed on his doorstep.

Horan in doubt for European tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Wallaby center Tim Horan will find
out Friday if he can make the rugby tour of France and England next
month as he struggles to overcome a knee injury.
	   Australia is already missing about six leading players,
including backline stars Matthew Burke, Ben Tune and Damien Smith,
for the three-match tour which includes tests against France on
Nov. 14 and England on Nov. 21.
	   ``It'll be a close one with Tim,'' said Wallaby doctor John Best
after inspecting Horan on Wednesday. ``We don't want to make the
wrong decision. You don't want to push it too hard. We're in a
difficult situation.''
	   Best said he would wait to see how Horan recovered after some
running exercises Thursday and Friday before making a final
decision.
	   ``Tim has progressed well since the surgery and he's started
running and we'll be able to build on that,'' Best said. ``But the
question is whether there's enough time between now and when he has
to play again.''
	   If Horan is unable to take his place in the touring squad, New
South Wales youngster Scott Staniforth will step in.
	   Best said Willie Ofahengaue had recovered well from an Achilles
problem and was a near certainty to be passed fit on Friday. The
only other injury worry, former Argentine prop Patricio Noriega,
was cleared earlier this week of an elbow problem.

Indonesian central bank governors says inflation slowing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's runaway inflation is
easing and would be ``close to or below'' zero in October, the head
of the central bank said Wednesday.
	   Bank Indonesia Gov. Sjahril Sabirin told reporters that the
first three weeks of October showed the economy was in deflation.
	   ``Based on my prediction, the inflation rate for this month
should be close to or below zero,'' he said.
	   Sjahril said there had been a steady decline in prices of basic
foods. Dramatic price increases in past months have triggered
unrest in some parts of Indonesia, which is grappling with its
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Inflation for the year is expected to top 80 percent, but
monthly increases in consumer prices have slowed steadily recently.
	   Sjahril said a recent rise in the value of the rupiah would also
slow inflation.
	   The central bank has said it will gradually lower interest rates
as the rupiah stabilizes.
	   The rupiah has strengthened by more than 40 percent against the
dollar since the end of last month.
	   A dramatic dive in its value last year triggered the present
economic crisis.
	   The rupiah was trading at about 7,700 rupiah to the dollar late
Wednesday.

Hostages freed during crackdown in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police on alert on border, more details of
crackdown. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two people were freed and seven people arrested
during the first hours of a crackdown on hostage-takers in the
breakaway region of Chechnya, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The offensive by Chechen law enforcement officials began Monday
when they beefed up police checkpoints around the region and
threatened harsher punishment for hostage-takers. Relatives of the
hostages are also helping to look for the kidnappers.
	   The two released hostages had been held for more than six months
and a large ransom had been demanded, Chechen Security Minister
Aslanbek Arsayev told Interfax.
	   The seven people arrested were involved in their kidnapping, he
said. He gave no details about the hostages.
	   Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said authorities
were willing to assign 1,000 men to the anti-kidnapping effort, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Kidnappings and other crimes have become common in Chechnya
since the end of its 1994-96 war with Russia. Chechen officials say
103 people are still being held, including three Britons, a New
Zealander and a Turk.
	   Separate car bomb attacks this week killed Chechnya's top
anti-kidnapping official and slightly injured a Muslim cleric.
	   The violence has sometimes spilled over into neighboring regions
and one of them, Dagestan, said Wednesday it had put border police
on alert, fearing reprisal attacks because of the hostage
crackdown.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel investigating
apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate the
last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abuses
after he threatened a court challenge.
	   De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited final
report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due
for release Thursday.
	   The man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a
finding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation.
	   Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said
the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,
and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid
delaying its release.
	   ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been
engaged in a vendetta against him.
	   ``But we must and will respect the courts and his rights under
the constitution. We fought hard for those rights and we can be
proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares in them.''
	   De Klerk was in London and could not immediately be located for
comment.
	   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by
laying bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the
country for more than two years, listening to victims and
perpetrators seeking amnesty.
	   The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone a
milestone for South Africa's transformation from white minority
rule to democracy.
	   De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism
prompted by leaks of the report. The African National Congress, the
liberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the
country, on Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was
guilty of human rights violations in its armed struggle.
	   The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South
Africa's human rights history, from 1964 to 1994, when all-race
elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral
condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions.
	   Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals
being named as rights violators than planned, The Star of
Johannesburg reported Wednesday.
	   The report also rejected barring perpetrators from holding
public office or denying pensions to those who were state
employees, the newspaper said. But involvement in rights violations
should be taken into account if someone is up for public office.
	   The Truth Commission also named perpetrators of crimes committed
outside of South Africa, but did not suggest any action.
	   In its report, the commission had been expected to say that
although de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently came
to know about the roles of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok and Johan van der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but
failed to report the information to police.
	   The finding could have paved the way for de Klerk's prosecution
because he did not seek amnesty in connection with the bombings of
the buildings, which housed anti-apartheid groups.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, Vlok
and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for
amnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report the matter
to the police.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty to those who fully
confess to politically motivated crimes committed during apartheid.

Yeltsin checks into rest home for open-ended stay

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Boris Yeltsin retreated to a rest home
outside Moscow, suffering from exhaustion and high blood pressure,
his prime minister filled in for the Russian president at a summit
with European Union officials.
	   Russia, meanwhile, was left guessing yet again about the exact
nature of Yeltsin's illness.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has played only a marginal role in dealing with the
country's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the
country is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who has been in office less than two months.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at the EU summit. Yeltsin called off the trip Monday due to
his illness, the latest in a string of maladies that have dogged
him for years. He checked into the Barvikha sanitarium Tuesday for
an open-ended stay.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has put in few full days at the Kremlin since the
spring, and now his doctors say he must rest to recover from
extreme fatigue and high blood pressure.
	   The president did not look visibly ill in television footage of
him meeting with Primakov on Tuesday, before the prime minister
left for Vienna and the president moved to the sanitarium.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, an American cardiologist who consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after his 1996 heart surgery,
predicted Tuesday it would take Yeltsin at least a week to bounce
back.
	   But ``he'll recover from all this and he'll be back at work,''
DeBakey told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   DeBakey was quoted Wednesday as telling the Komsomolskaya Pravda
newspaper that Yeltsin's unstable blood pressure was not a serious
problem. He said that Russian heart surgeon Renat Akchurin, who
performed Yeltsin's quintuple bypass surgery, is no longer on the
team of doctors monitoring the president because his expertise is
not needed.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin would
undergo ``a course of restoration treatment.'' The length of his
stay depends on the treatment, he said, without elaborating.
	   Despite reassurances by the president and his doctors that
Yeltsin has no crippling illness and will serve out his term, which
lasts until the middle of 2000, few in Russia believe that Yeltsin
will ever again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was
during his early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996
presidential elections, said Tuesday that Yeltsin's aides were
``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president wasn't seriously
ill.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the
results to be made public.
	   Yeltsin's aides have often provided only partial information
about Yeltsin's ailments, contributing to a general mood of
skepticism and speculation that his condition is worse than
announced.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign, Primakov would succeed him on an
interim basis, and new elections would be called within three
months.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Yeltsin's illness should not hamper decisions on economic policy
because Primakov was in already handling them.
	   Yeltsin postponed a meeting with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman scheduled for next week in Moscow, Tudjman's spokesman said
Tuesday. Yeltsin has also put off a trip to Malaysia next month,
though his aides insist he will still go to India in December.
	   Yeltsin's press service on Wednesday denied speculation that a
Nov. 10-13 visit by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would be
canceled or postponed. A Russian envoy flew to Tokyo on Wednesday
to continue preparations for the visit.

22,000 rescue workers on standby for La Nina flooding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anticipating La Nina-induced
flooding, the government has placed 22,000 rescue workers on
standby in several Malaysian states, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Selamat Dahlan, deputy director-general of the Civil Defense
Department, said 180 boats and other vehicles were on hand for
rescue and evacuation exercises.
	   The government allotted an extra 3 million ringgit (dlrs
790,000) for the department to buy rescue equipment, Selamat was
quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency.
	   Heavy rainfall has already caused minor flooding in parts of
Malaysia. More serious floods are expected by the end of the year,
when the La Nina weather phenomenon reaches Malaysia.
	   The states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang on peninsular
Malaysia and Sabah and Sarawak states on Borneo Island are expected
to be among the worst hit.

Two seals die five months after capture in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two seals that were believed to have made
their way to Vietnam from the North Pole five months ago have died
five days apart, an Institute of Oceanology official said
Wednesday.
	   Dao Tan Ho said one of the seals died last Wednesday and the
other on Monday. Neither ate during the previous day.
	   Autopsies found that both suffered from serious lung infections,
Ho said, but could not determine the cause of the deaths.
	   He said it was the first time that the institute, in the central
coastal city of Nha Trang, had tried to raise seals.
	   The institute bought the seals from local fishermen who caught
them off the coast of the central provinces of Quang Ngai and Quang
Binh in May.
	   Ho said the seals, which had fattened up to 25 kilograms (55
pounds) each, compared with 15 kilograms (33 pounds) when they were
brought in, might have been driven to Vietnam by strong currents
from the Sea of Japan.
	   The seals have been stuffed so visitors can see them in the
institute museum.

Japan says it will appeal WTO ruling over apples
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Japan will appeal a World Trade Organization panel
ruling backing a U.S. claim that its quarantine practices for
imports of apples and other farm produce are an illegal trade
barrier, a Japanese trade official said Wednesday.
	   ``We are very disappointed,'' the official from the Japanese
mission to the WTO in Geneva said on condition of anonymity. ``We
will take this to the (WTO's) appellate body.''
	   ``This is a win on our part and we are pleased with it,'' a
spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva said.
	   The WTO dispute settlement panel agreed with a U.S. contention
that there is inadequate scientific evidence to justify Japan's
practice of testing imports of varieties of apples, cherries,
nectarines and walnuts before allowing them into the country.
	   It said there are alternative measures Japan could take to
achieve its desired level of protection that would be less
restrictive than the current practice.
	   Japan mandates repeated testing of quarantine treatments each
time a country attempts to export a new variety of an approved
commodity. Japanese officials say the goal is to protect the health
of its plants from the codling moth.
	   The United States claimed Japan was using the rule to block
access of competing U.S. products. The testing, which takes at
least two years, is costly to the government and producers, the
Clinton administration said.
	   Japan has 30 days to formally appeal or comply with the terms of
the decision, which asks that Japan bring its rules into conformity
with trade agreements on testing requirements.

Player banned for 7 weeks for smearing opponent in blood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ An Australian Rules football player was
banned for seven weeks Wednesday after being found guilty of
smearing blood into an opponent's face.
	   John Darling was suspended for smearing his blood into the face
of rival player Rod Hoare during a Northern Territory Football
League (NTFL) reserves game on Oct. 18.
	   NTFL general manager Greg Trappett said Darling's sentence
appeared to be light but said there had been evidence that he had
been concussed at the time of the incident.
	   ``If he had been fully conscious at the time he did it I would
have expected a much tougher sentence _ between one and two
years,'' Trappett said Wednesday. ``I mean what he did was
disgusting and it raised all sorts of questions because I don't
think this sort of thing has happened in any code of football in
Australia.''
	   A spokeswoman for the Northern Territory branch of the
Australian Medical Association, Robyn Cahill, suggested that
Darling, who plays for the suburban Wanderers club, should be
forced to take a compulsory first aid course as part of his
sentence.
	   ``It's no good just giving him a rap over the knuckles. He, and
all footballers for that matter, must be educated as to the risks
involved with transferring of bodily fluids such as blood,'' Cahill
said.
	   ``Although I don't know all the circumstances but it seems a
terrible thing that he did. There is always the risk, although
small, of transferring of Hepatitis and HIV AIDS like this.''

NATO keeps up guard in Kosovo as some refugees return

``steps in right direction,'' compliance not yet complete &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO is keeping more than 400
warplanes on alert to make sure that President Slobodan Milosevic
continues to withdraw forces from Kosovo and allows tens of
thousands of refugees to return home.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said Wednesday
that the drawdown of Serb forces is not complete but moves so far
represent a ``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling the
demands.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military alliance
did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one
expired Tuesday. That was a bitter disappointment to Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian politicians, who had been hoping the Alliance would
deliver a devastating air blow to the Yugoslav president's war
machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet Hamiti of the Leage of
Democratic Kosovo said Wednesday. ``NATO has been frightening
itself for too long.''
	   But by warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana told a news conference after a 2
1-2-hour meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' he added. ``I urge both sides
to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward.''
	   In an Oct. 12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
demanded that Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in
Kosovo to the levels of last February, when Milosevic began his
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have
died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo is a province in
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In an interview Wednesday with Radio Germany, Gen. Naumann said
Serb police had still not pulled out of one of eight locations they
had agreed to leave. He said NATO would keep up the pressure to
make sure there was no backsliding on Milosevic's part.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters in
Washington that NATO would move quickly to use force against
Yugoslavia if Milosevic sends troops and special police back to
Kosovo.
	   Albright said the NATO allies were preparing to organize a
rapid-reaction force based in the neighboring former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia that could intervene quickly and to protect
-- if necessary -- the 2,000 unarmed personnel who will verify that
Milosevic keeps his promises.
	   A spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is overseeing the verification mission, said
Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was due in Pristina on Thursday to take
charge of the operation.
	   The spokesman, Mons Nyberg, said he ``hoped'' some of the
verification personnel would arrive by the end of the week.
	   International officials hope the continued pressure will
encourage many refugees to return to the homes they were forced to
flee when fighting between rebels and Serb security forces
escalated earlier this year.
	   Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency for International Development
visited a number of Kosovo villages and towns.
	   ``The biggest difference is the hope I saw in the peoples' eyes
now compared to the fear I saw seven weeks ago,'' he said. ``It is
still a difficult situation, but if these people go home we will
have a manageable humanitarian situation. There should be no deaths
in the winter.''
	   Many of the displaced people are camping in the woods and hills,
fearful that Serb police will shoot at them if they tried to go
back.
	   In the village of Ostrozub, southwest of Pristina, Avdullah
Krasniqi loaded up his farm wagon with his wife, kids and household
goods and headed home Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Albanian made his decision less out of confidence
that NATO had forced an end to the crisis than the fact that it was
getting colder by the day in his mountain refuge.
	   ``We spent three months in the mountains,'' Krasniqi said as
family members in a wagon sat on a huge pile of carpets, kitchen
utensils and other household goods, all pulled by the family
tractor. ``It's very cold.''
	   The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but they are still
wary.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, licking his
thick dark mustache, and noting that his next-door neighbor was
shot and killed on his doorstep.

Report: ETA preparing permanent truce in Basque conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA will
shortly announce a definitive truce to end its 30-year campaign for
independence, a leading Basque newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings, is planning a
statement in response to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's demand
for more proof of peaceful intentions, the Bilbao daily El Correo
Espanyol reported without citing sources.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18,
five weeks before last weekend's regional elections.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
before the elections, two hooded members of ETA claimed the
cease-fire was ``solid and serious.''
	   The truce is believed to be directly responsible for the boost
in votes for the pro-independence Euskal Herritarrok coalition,
which obtained 14 seats in the 75-seat regional legislature, its
highest showing in six regional elections.
	   The cease-fire on Sept. 18 resulted from months of talks between
the moderate pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party, which
topped the polls, and Herri Batasuna, the ETA political link and
founder of Euskal Herritarrok.
	   Sunday's elections resulted in no clear winner and demonstrated
how sharply divided the northern region is over independence. Three
separatist parties gained a total of 41 seats while four groups
opposed to breaking up Spain notched up 34.
	   Although Aznar has said he is not yet convinced by ETA,
government insiders indicated this week he will not insist on an
immediate hand-over of arms.
	   They added that talks over ETA demands that its jailed
accomplices be transferred to Basque prisons were also possible.
	   The chief ETA demand has been the right to self-determination
for the Basque country, including the three Basque provinces of
northern Spain and parts of neighboring Navarra and southwestern
France.
	   Many Basques, including independence advocates, see armed
violence as unnecessary, considering the high level of autonomy the
region has enjoyed for two decades.
	   ETA has faced a tough government anti-terrorist policy, as well
as a groundswell of public condemnation over the killing of unarmed
municipal officials belonging to Aznar's governing Popular Party.

	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' he said. ``I urge both sides
to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward.''
	   In an Oct. 12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
demanded that Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in
Kosovo to the levels of last February, when Milosevic began his
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have
died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes.
	   In an interview Wednesday with Radio Germany, Naumann said Serb
police had still not pulled out of one of eight locations they
agreed to leave. He said NATO would keep up the pressure to make
sure there was no backsliding on Milosevic's part.

Asian stock markets close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday,
with Tokyo prices falling for a fourth consecutive session. Some
exchanges finished higher on hopes of interest rate cuts.
	   Tokyo blue chips plunged amid worries about corporate earnings
and the direction of emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia,
traders said.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down
304.61 points, or 2.20 percent, at 13,516.07. On Tuesday, the
Nikkei had shed 22.78 points, or 0.16 percent.
	   ``Uncertainty over the world economy sent export-oriented blue
chip shares such as Sony down,'' said Takeshi Kubota, general
manager of stock information at Meiko Securities.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.88 yen in late
trading, down 1.48 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but slightly
above its late New York rate of 117.75 yen overnight.
	   Singapore shares closed sharply higher on anticipation of more
interest rate cuts and soon-to-be-unveiled corporate
restructurings, dealers said.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index closed up 26.62 points, or 2.3
percent, at 1,180.22.
	   Singapore's major banks lowered their prime lending rate by a
quarter point to 7 percent a few weeks ago, the second round of
cuts in less than a month.
	   In Indonesia, a huge student rally at the Parliament dampened
sentiment on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. The Composite Index fell
by 5.811 points, or 1.8 percent, to 312.290.
	   About 8,000 students demonstrated, demanding President B.J.
Habibie's resignation. They chanted their opposition to an upcoming
government assembly that will set guidelines for elections in 1999.
	   Markets in Hong Kong were closed for a public holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed sharply lower. The Taiwan market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 74.54 points, or 1.05 percent,
to 6,962.09.
	   SEOUL: Shares ended higher on a rebound and a stronger yen. The
Korean Composite Stock Price Index closed up 3.48 points, or 1
percent, at 363.91.
	   SYDNEY: Australian prices closed higher on hopes of an interest
rate cut, following confirmation of encouraging inflation figures.
The All Ordinaries Index rose 32.3 points, or 1.3 percent, to
2,615.2.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed marginally higher.
The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 0.89 point, closing at 1,871.26.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed slightly higher on the stronger
peso and softening trend of domestic interest rates. The 30-share
Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 9.73 points, or 0.6 percent,
closing at 1,602.23.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian prices closed lower as local
institutional players disposed of selective blue-chip stocks and as
the 1999 budget failed to spark buying interest. The benchmark
Composite Index fell 5.47 points, or 1.3 percent, to 410.49 points.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher as local investors
bought heavily in finance and banking stocks in a bid for
short-term profits, dealers said. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
index gained 11.22 points, or 3.5 percent, closing at 330.45.

Russia warns NATO against ``automatic'' use of force in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has strategic interests in all of the
Balkans, not just Serbia, the foreign minister said in an interview
published Wednesday, underlining Moscow's firm opposition to NATO
airstrikes.
	   ``The Balkans have always been a zone of special strategic
interest for Russia due to obvious reasons _ the territorial
closeness and access to the Mediterranean,'' Igor Ivanov was quoted
as telling Izvestia.
	   ``We are linked with that region not only by sentimental
feelings, but broad economic perspectives.''
	   Russia has staunchly opposed the use of force against Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, for its crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province. Russia and Serbia share Slavic and
Orthodox religious roots.
	   Ivanov also claimed Russia played a decisive role in averting
NATO airstrikes so far, by coming up with the idea to deploy 2,000
observers from the Organizations for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to Kosovo.
	   ``The idea to set up the OSCE mission belongs to us,'' he said.
	   NATO said Tuesday that the Kosovo conflict is far from over
despite the withdrawal of thousands of Serb police from the
province and decided to keep more than 400 warplanes on alert.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO would move
quickly to use force against Yugoslavia if Serb President Slobodan
Milosevic sends troops and special police back to Kosovo to
threaten ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   Ivanov said that any military action should be approved by the
United Nations Security Council. He had earlier said that Russia
would veto such a move.
	   The OSCE observers in Kosovo, including 200 Russians, should be
properly protected, but ``there can be no talk about NATO's
automatic right for military operations,'' Ivanov said.
	   ``We don't like the word `automatic,' because there is a
temptation to interpret it too loosely,'' he added.
	   Ivanov emphasized that the main threat to the peaceful
settlement in Kosovo comes from the ethnic Albanian militants who
struggle for Kosovo's secession from Serbia.
	   ``Our diplomats keep telling our Western partners: we know how
to force Belgrade to account for its action, but no one knows what
to do with the other side,'' he said.
	   ``Meanwhile, everyone understands that Kosovo's secession from
Yugoslavia would entail terrible consequences for the rest of
Europe.''
	   Ivanov also repeated Russia's opposition to the eastward
expansion of NATO.
	   ``NATO means collective security for a group of nations,'' he
said. ``Why should Russia feel safe along with them? As of now, the
North Atlantic Treaty is a military machine aimed in a direction
that is quite clear.''
	   Ivanov ruled out Russia joining NATO or the European Union some
day.
	   ``Our country is far too big, the Russian scale is far too
grandiose,'' he said. ``These organizations would be unable to
remain what they are, if Russia joined them.''

Akzo's profit hit by financial crisis in Asia and Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel NV
said Wednesday its third-quarter net profit fell 5 percent to 430
million guilders (dlrs 231 million), marred by financial crises in
Asia, Russia and Latin America.
	   The company reported a net profit of 455 million guilders (dlrs
244 million) a year ago for the same period ending Sept. 30.
	   For the full year, the company expects a ``slightly higher
full-year net income, excluding non-recurring items.''
	   Akzo shares fell sharply following the disappointing results. By
midmorning its stock was trading down 8.4 percent.
	   Akzo Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Fritz Frohlich
said developments in Southeast Asia, Russia and Latin America and
the strengthening of European currencies all had a negative impact
on growth.
	   He said the contribution from British chemical group Courtaulds
PLC, which Akzo bought earlier this year for 6.1 billion guilders
(dlrs 3.2 billion), was ``slightly negative.''
	   Akzo hinted that Courtaulds' integration and its withdrawal from
the fibers business may lead to job losses.

Report: ETA preparing permanent truce in Basque conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA will
shortly announce a definitive truce to end its 30-year campaign for
independence, a leading Basque newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings, is planning a
statement in response to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's demand
for more proof of peaceful intentions, the Bilbao daily El Correo
Espanyol reported without citing sources.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18,
five weeks before last weekend's regional elections.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
before the elections, two hooded members of ETA claimed the
cease-fire was ``solid and serious.''
	   The truce is believed to be directly responsible for the boost
in votes for the pro-independence Euskal Herritarrok coalition,
which obtained 14 seats in the 75-seat regional legislature, its
highest showing in six regional elections.
	   The cease-fire resulted from months of talks between the
moderate pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party, which topped
the polls, and Herri Batasuna, the ETA political link and founder
of Euskal Herritarrok.
	   Sunday's elections resulted in no clear winner and demonstrated
how sharply divided the northern region is over independence. Three
separatist parties gained a total of 41 seats while four groups
opposed to breaking up Spain notched up 34.
	   Although Aznar has said he is not yet convinced by ETA,
government insiders indicated this week he will not insist on an
immediate hand-over of arms. They added that talks over ETA demands
that its jailed accomplices be transferred to Basque prisons were
also possible.
	   The chief ETA demand has been the right to self-determination
for the Basque country, including the three Basque provinces of
northern Spain and parts of neighboring Navarra and southwestern
France.
	   Many Basques, including independence advocates, see armed
violence as unnecessary, considering the high level of autonomy the
region has enjoyed for two decades.
	   ETA has faced a tough government anti-terrorist policy, as well
as a groundswell of public condemnation over the killing of unarmed
municipal officials belonging to Aznar's governing Popular Party.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In Yugoslavia, a prisoner helps his
jailer escape. Convicts line up to wash brains under a tap in
China. A Gypsy fortune teller in Romania is reading the palm of a
man _ but he has a hook instead of a hand.
	   Jokes with a bitter twist are on display in drawing form at the
international black humor festival in Bucharest, home to some of
the darkest laughs known to modern man.
	   Cartoons from countries where freedoms are curbed -- China, Iran
and Yugoslavia -- shine in this week-long fest. Cartoonists from
the West pale in comparison, trying to be too clever or focusing on
the frivolous.
	   Black humor, say aficionados, combines intelligence, wit and a
sense of cruelty. Its object is horror.
	   ``It's a superior form of optimism. You go beyond (the
horror),'' said theater director Alexandru Tocilescu visiting the
exhibition of 250 drawings.
	   Horia Patapievici, a Romanian philosopher and head of the
nine-member jury which judged the 2,000 paintings and drawings
submitted from 29 countries said: ``Either you identify with horror
or, in black humor, you put a distance between you and it.''
	   Countries such as Iran, Ukraine and Russia have a closer
relationship to tragedy which is why their jokes pack a punch.
Western countries haven't known any real horror since the Nazi era,
he said.
	   Painted in somber tones, the winning cartoon created by
Bulgarian artist Stefan Despodov depicts a man reading a newspaper
being punched by a man in a photograph on the front page.
	   ``The cartoon represents the aggression in the press of the
ordinary citizen,'' said Patapievici. ``In Bulgaria, like Romania,
the language of journalists is violent and cruel,'' he said.
	   In the first two days, some 6,000 people flocked to see
exhibition and one of the four plays staged for the festival which
aims to make light of the darker aspects of life. The exhibition
opened Monday in Bucharest's Bulandra theater.
	   The capital of a land that gave the world Dracula and vampires
is a fitting venue for an exhibition on cruelty and humor. Under
the late Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, there was even
rumored to be a special department in the Securitate secret police
responsible creating and spreading the dark humor jokes.
	   Sponsored by a mobile phone company, the main theme of the
exhibition is communication. While there are plenty of entries
featuring mobile phones, the joke was also on the sponsor.
	   Asked details about the exhibition, an employee at the theater
where the exhibition is being held said: ``You'll have to speak to
the sponsors. They don't talk to us much.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nippon Oil Co. and Mitsubishi Oil Co., two of
Japan's largest petroleum distributors and refiners, said Wednesday
they will merge next April to create Japan's largest oil company.
	   Encouraged by recent deregulation that has eroded profits
throughout the industry, the partnership is designed to trim costs
and improve competitiveness.
	   The new company, to be called Nisseki Mitsubishi Co., will boast
sales of 3 trillion yen (dlrs 25.45 billion), an industry-leading
24 percent share of the domestic fuel market and more than a
quarter of Japan's total refining capacity.
	   Nippon Oil now is Japan's second-largest petroleum distributor,
while Mitsubishi Oil ranks sixth. The current leader, privately
held Idemitsu Kosan Co., has a 16 percent market share.
	   Within five years of the merger, the company expects to save 70
billion yen (dlrs 593.82 million) by combining its two parent
corporations' administrative, distribution and refining operations.
	   But no immediate job cuts were planned, the companies said.
	   Many Japanese oil companies have been hard hit by lower demand
due to a recessionary economy and a plunge in retail gasoline
prices following the lifting of a ban on imported fuel in early
1996.
	   These changes have led industry analysts to expect further moves
toward consolidation among Japan's oil distributors and refiners.
	   Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil, which had begun joint
distribution of some products as early as 1985, said they began
serious discussions about a merger in July this year.
	   Nippon Oil president Hidejiro Ohsawa will become the president
of the new company while Mitsubishi Oil president Yoshihiko
Izumitani will be the chairman.
	   The official merger contract was expected to be signed by the
end of this year and submitted to shareholders for approval. One
Mitsubishi Oil share will be exchanged for 0.525 share of Nippon
Oil.
	   Investors' initial reaction to the merger signaled
disappointment.
	   Shares of Nippon Oil Co. fell 1.23 percent to 402 yen (dlrs
3.41) and Mitsubishi Oil Co. shares lost 2.05 percent to 199 yen
(dlrs 1.69).
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange had suspended trading in the two
companies' stocks during the morning session, but allowed trading
to resume in the afternoon after the official announcement of the
merger.
	   After the close of trading, Nippon Oil Co. reported a 62 percent
drop in net profit to 1.45 billion yen (dlrs 12.3 million) for the
first six months of the fiscal year, citing a sharp fall in fuel
prices.
	   Mitsubishi Oil, which has posted losses over the last two fiscal
years, was expected to report more red ink for the current fiscal
year ending in March.

New search for author's plane after fisherman finds bracelet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEAN-MARC MATALON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Salvage crews are searching a new swath
of the Mediterranean for the lost plane of Antoine de
Saint-Exupery, after a fisherman found his bracelet near Marseille,
officials said Wednesday.
	   The author of ``The Little Prince'' mysteriously vanished in his
warplane while flying near the French coast on July 31, 1944, as
the Allies were pushing Nazi troops through Provence.
	   Repeated searches near Nice failed to turn up Saint-Ex's
Lockheed P-38 Lightning, and theories have ranged from hostile
gunfire to mechanical problems to suicide.
	   But late last month, fisherman Jean-Claude Bianco found the
author's silver chain bracelet in near-perfect condition off the
coast of Marseille, 190 kms (115 miles) due west, while looking for
sole and mullet in a rocky inlet near the Planier lighthouse.
	   Entwined in seaweed and sand, the bracelet was also stuck to a
piece of fabric believed to be that of Saint-Exupery's flight suit.
	   The bracelet was authenticated, since it carried the name of
Saint-Exupery's wife Consuelo and the names Reynal and Hitchcock,
publishers of The Little Prince.
	   Two days later, on Sept. 28, the marine salvage company Comex
launched a two-month search.
	   The Minbibiex and the Remora 2000, two mini-submarines, were
combing an area of up to 100 square kilometers (38 square miles)
around where Bianco found the bracelet, said Comex chief
Henri-Germain Deloze.
	   Several pieces of plane wreckage were located by sonar, but so
far nothing was found that confirmed they found the P-38,
Henri-Germain said.
	   But Henri-Germain said he was still convinced Saint-Exupery
crashed near Marseille after taking off from Bastia-Borgo Airport
on the island of Corsica, shortly before 9 a.m. on July 31, 1944.
	   If Saint-Exupery did crash near Marseille, it appeared unlikely
he was hit by German gunfire, since the Germans had been chased out
of the region by then, expert Patrick Ehrhardt told the regional
daily La Provence.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel investigating
apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate the
last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abuses
after he threatened a court challenge.
	   De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited final
report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due
for release Thursday.
	   The man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a
finding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation.
	   Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said
the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,
and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid
delaying its release.
	   ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been
engaged in a vendetta against him.
	   ``But we must and will respect the courts and his rights under
the constitution. We fought hard for those rights and we can be
proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares in them,'' he
said in a statement.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appear
after all the hoo-ha has died down.''
	   De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment before
speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts.
	   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by
laying bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the
country for more than two years, listening to victims and
perpetrators seeking amnesty.
	   The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone for
South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to
democracy.
	   De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism
prompted by leaks of the report. The African National Congress, the
liberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the
country, on Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was
guilty of human rights violations in its armed struggle.
	   The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South
Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race
elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral
condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions.
	   Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals
being named as rights violators than planned, The Star of
Johannesburg reported Wednesday.
	   In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more than
400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give them
a chance to respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out of
the report, he said.

Doctors perform Japan's first lung transplant from living donor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with transplant completed, details on lung
capacity, patients awaiting lung transplants &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Doctors at Okayama University Hospital in western
Japan carried out the country's first lung transplant from living
donors Wednesday.
	   Organ transplants have been extremely rare in Japan because of a
previous law that recognized death only after a patient's heart
stopped beating. But at that point organs such as hearts and lungs
are usually unsuitable for transplant.
	   A year ago, a new law was passed to recognize brain death.
Still, the idea of removing organs still meets tremendous
resistance because of a widespread distrust toward doctors as well
as cultural superstition about cutting into corpses. Not a single
transplant has been performed in Japan from brain-dead donors.
	   In Wednesday's surgery, a 24-year-old woman with an incurable
lung disease received half of her 48-year-old mother's left lung
and one-third of her 21-year-old sister's right lung.
	   All three, whom the hospital did not identify, were in stable
condition after the nine-hour surgery by a team of 20 doctors led
by Dr. Nobuyoshi Shimizu, said a hospital official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The lung capacity for the recipient was expected to recover to
about 52 percent, the newspaper Yomiuri said in its Wednesday
editions. In the last month before surgery, an artificial r
spirator was helping her breathe.
	   The donors' lung functions will be reduced by about 20 percent,
but they will be able to lead regular lives, the paper said.
	   A 1996 medical study found that Japanese doctors discovered
about 400 patients requiring lung transplants during a two-year
period, with as many as 3,000 patients now awaiting lung
transplants, the Yomiuri said.
	   Doctors here have performed lung transplants before but never
using organs from a living donor. The most common organ transplants
from dead donors carried out in Japan are kidney and cornea
transplants.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In Yugoslavia, a prisoner helps his
jailer escape. Convicts line up to wash brains under a tap in
China. A Gypsy fortune teller in Romania is reading the palm of a
man _ but he has a hook instead of a hand.
	   Cartoons with a bitter twist from 29 countries where freedoms
are curbed _ China, Iran and Yugoslavia _ are on display at the
week-long international black humor festival in Bucharest, home to
some of the darkest laughs known to modern man.
	   Cartoonists from the West pale in comparison, trying to be too
clever or focusing on the frivolous. Black humor, say aficionados,
combines intelligence, wit and a sense of cruelty. Its object is
horror.
	   ``It's a superior form of optimism. You go beyond (the
horror),'' said theater director Alexandru Tocilescu visiting the
exhibition of 250 drawings that opened Monday in Bucharest's
Bulandra theater.
	   Horia Patapievici, a Romanian philosopher and head of the
nine-member jury which judged the 2,000 paintings and drawings,
said: ``Either you identify with horror or, in black humor, you put
a distance between you and it.''
	   Countries such as Iran, Ukraine and Russia have a closer
relationship to tragedy, which is why their jokes pack a punch.
Western countries haven't known any real horror since the Nazi era,
he said.
	   Painted in somber tones, the winning cartoon created by
Bulgarian artist Stefan Despodov depicts a man reading a newspaper
being punched by a man in a photograph on the front page.
	   ``The cartoon represents the aggression in the press of the
ordinary citizen,'' said Patapievici. ``In Bulgaria, like Romania,
the language of journalists is violent and cruel.''

Georgia's former security minister appointed to security council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The former security minister of Georgia, who
resigned earlier this week, has been appointed deputy secretary of
the National Security Council in the former Soviet republic,
ITAR-Tass said Wednesday.
	   Dzhemal Gakhokidze resigned from the Cabinet on Monday, a week
after mutinous soldiers staged a one-day revolt against President
Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Gakhokidze said he resigned because financial shortages made it
impossible to carry out key reforms in the country's security
system, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Under Gakhokidze's leadership, the security ministry failed to
head off a number of violent incidents, including a rocket attack
on Shevardnadze, the hostage-taking of four U.N. observers, and the
Oct. 19 revolt.
	   Thirty-one people have been arrested in connection with the
revolt, although the leader, Akakiy Eliava, remains at large.
	   Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when
it gained independence in 1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought
a short war in a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994.

	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan Wednesday by its disgruntled captain, who
allegedly told authorities he did it because he was angered over
pay and working conditions.
	   ``I feel relaxed,'' Yuan Bin said in a brief exchange with
reporters, after prosecutors questioned him at the airport before
taking him to court. ``I shall have no regret whatever happens to
me.''
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing for the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but was diverted in the air and arrived safely under
military jet escort at Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17
a.m. (0317 GMT).
	   The official Central News Agency said another pilot tried to
stop Yuan from flying to Taiwan, but Yuan told him not to
interfere, saying he was prepared to die if necessary. The report
quoted officials who had questioned Yuan, but it did not identify
them.
	   No passengers were hurt and the Boeing 737's two other pilots
were allowed to take off from Taiwan six hours later, flying the 94
remaining passengers and six crew members back to China. China's
Xinhua News Agency said 20 foreigners were aboard, but it did not
give their nationalities.
	   No itinerary was given for the return flight.
	   Yuan was accompanied on the hijacked flight by his wife,
identified as Xu Mei, who also was detained by Taiwanese
authorities. Some early media reports suggested Yuan had been
seeking to escape an unhappy life, although officials did not
confirm this motive.
	   Taiwan Television showed the captain in his uniform white shirt,
carrying a suitcase as he was led out of the plane by policemen in
helmets and bulletproof vests. His wife was shown in a black coat.
	   Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said Yuan admitted he diverted
the jet to Taiwan because he was displeased with Air China's
policies and his pay. It was not immediately clear what Yuan hoped
to accomplish.
	   ``There was no political motive,'' Huang said.
	   Chang Chia-ju, Taiwan's aeronautics chief, said Yuan would face
trial in Taiwan. China sought his return to the mainland.
	   The flight by Air China, the main airline run by the Civil
Aviation Administration of China, was originally scheduled to stop
in Kunming, then continue to Yangon, Myanmar, Chang said.
	   Defense Ministry officials said the Air China jetliner was
escorted to the airport by four Taiwanese warplanes, which took off
after spotting the jet on radar.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew condemned Wednesday's
incident.
	   ``We've never agreed to such deeds,'' he told reporters _
although Taiwan in recent memory used to shower hijackers from
mainland China with gold and cash rewards. Taiwan began cracking
down on the hijackers after longstanding tensions with the mainland
began easing in the 1980s.
	   The 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed for
up to 12 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to China.
	   China has demanded that Taiwan send all the hijackers back. The
two sides were near reaching an agreement about repatriation in
1995 when China broke off the talks in anger over a Taiwanese drive
to gain diplomatic recognition.
	   In recent months, the two sides have slowly approached each
other to restore the long-stalled dialogue.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

Kosovo Albanian goes on trial in Germany for people smuggling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A Kosovo Albanian charged with sneaking hundreds
of refugees into Germany went on trial Wednesday in another sign of
German determination to crack down on smugglers and slow a growing
tide of illegal immigration.
	   The trial of the 28-year-old suspect, who was not identified,
opened in Goerlitz, on the German-Polish border, amid tight
security. Court officials said he had threatened to kill every
police officer and prosecutor involved in the case if he is
convicted.
	   The man, who was not identified, was charged with smuggling 360
foreigners _ mainly fellow ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province _ into Germany in 12 transports early in 1994.
	   The preferred route went from the Czech Republic to Poland and
then into Germany at the Bad Muskau border crossing.
	   He operated his smuggling operation for four years from the
Czech Republic until being arrested last year in Prague and
extradited to Germany, the Bild newspaper reported.
	   Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, Germany has become a magnet
for refugees from the east, who often travel thousands of
kilometers (miles) in search of a better life.
	   Despite a tightening of asylum laws and stepped up border
patrols, the flood continues and has even increased in recent
months due to the recent violence in Kosovo.
	   German officials reported last week they had snared 35,205
foreigners seeking to enter the country illegally last year _ 30
percent more than 1996 _ and that statistics for 1998 so far were
running almost 14 percent higher than last year.
	   Most _ 23,089 _ were caught on Germany's eastern border with
Poland and the Czech Republic.
	   Of those caught last year, 8,288 were smuggled into Germany by
criminal gangs, compared with 7,364 in 1996.
	   Just Tuesday, 59 Afghans were caught crossing the Czech border
into Germany, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Dresden,
customs officials said. The refugees, including children, were
hidden on a truck loaded with sheet metal.
	   Also Tuesday, a Pakistani man, Azhar Mahmordizz, went on trial
in another border town, Frankfurt an der Oder, on people smuggling
charges. The 33-year-old is accused of masterminding a ring that
smuggled 263 people foreigners into Germany in 23 separate groups
from 1994 to 1996.
	   The people _ from Pakistan, India, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Jamaica,
Afghanistan, Turkey, Lebanon and Bangladesh _ paid dlrs 600 each
and traveled via Uzbekistan, Belarus, Russia, Lithuania and Poland,
often suffering cramped living and transport quarters on the way,
prosecutors said.

Palermo-Milan train derails outside Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An overnight, Milan-bound train derailed early
Wednesday near the small town of Capena, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
north of Rome, injuring a railway worker who was working on a track
nearby.
	   The 420 passengers aboard the train, which began in Palermo,
Sicily, were unhurt, the state railways said.
	   According to investigators, the train failed to switch tracks as
it was traveling at 120 kilometers (74 miles) an hour, double the
speed allowed in the stretch where the accident occurred, Italian
news reports said.
	   A rash of derailments and other accidents have plagued the
Italian state railways for more than a year.

Greens Minister Fischer begins first foreign trip in Paris

	   PARIS (AP) _ As a hitchhiking German teen, he drew Jesus on
Marseille sidewalks to make money. As a Greens lawmaker, he wore
jeans and sneakers. On Wednesday, Joschka Fischer makes his first
trip as foreign minister beginning with Paris, and wearing a suit.
	   The trip, the day after he was sworn in, aims to reassure
European partners the new German government will stress continuity,
including the Franco-German engine behind the European Union and
its euro single currency.
	   After all, the two countries are each other's biggest trading
partners, something Germany's reformed and moderate Greens party
has learned to accept under their leader Fischer.
	   But Fischer's next stops, in Britain and Poland, also aim to
show Germany doesn't see the Paris-Bonn link as exclusive. ``Europe
is a polygon,'' the 50-year-old Fischer has said.
	   French officials insist it doesn't bother them. ``Let's not
pretend we're scaring ourselves!'' Socialist Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine, who was scheduled to meet Fischer for the first
time, said in Wednesday's edition of Le Figaro.
	   ``Germany doesn't hesitate anymore at defending its national
interests. So what?'' he told the conservative daily. The
Franco-German engine is ``not enough, and it must be widened with
close relations with each of our other EU members.''
	   Fischer was also meeting Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin,
Greens Environment Minister Dominique Voynet and the Socialist head
of the National Assembly's foreign affairs committee, Jack Lang.
	   Fischer has sought to demonstrate that Europe's most
economically powerful and populous nation, even with a Greens
foreign minister, will continue to support European unification.
	   ``There is no green foreign policy, but a German foreign
policy,'' he told the leftist Paris daily Liberation in its Monday
edition.
	   ``But we will add new accents: the human rights question,
durable development, the democratization of Europe, the relaunch of
disarmament,'' he said.
	   Among issues causing friction between Paris and Bonn are the
financing of the EU and the new German government's decision to
wean the country off nuclear power _ which will deal a blow to
France's nuclear power industry.
	   Fischer's insistence on human rights could chafe with France's
dealings with former African colonies ruled by strongmen. Meanwhile
cooperation is growing between British and German defense
industries and stock markets, bypassing a France that is slow to
privatize and liberalize.
	   Fischer has a London stopover Wednesday night, then travels to
Warsaw, a gesture meant to underline Germany's continuing
commitment to forging a special bond with Poland since World War
II. He flies home Thursday night.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stanisic's comment; moves against remaining
independent media. Eliminates typo in the lead, minor editing.
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite bowing to NATO demands over
Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic is reinforcing his grip on
power by firing his secret service chief and refusing to budge on
his purge of Serbia's independent media.
	   On Tuesday, the government announced that secret service chief
Jovica Stanisic had been fired and replaced by police Gen. Radomir
Markovic.
	   Staniscic, until recently considered one of the main pillars of
Milosevic's rule, was purportedly critical of Milosevic's crackdown
in Kosovo and his alliance with ultranationalist extremists.
	   His removal indicated that hard-liners are gaining ground
against moderates within the Yugoslav government. Milosevic has
used a threat of NATO attacks against military targets in
Yugoslavia to clamp down on his opponents at home.
	   NATO said Tuesday that Milosevic had withdrawn enough forces
from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes. But the alliance reserved the
right to attack if he resumes his crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said Stanisic's replacement was
``worrying'' and reminded him of Communist purges in former
Yugoslavia.
	   Another opposition leader, Vuk Obradovic, said Stanisic was a
``professional'' and a ``reasonable'' man. He said he expected more
key figures in Serbia to resign or be replaced.
	   Stanisic was quoted Wednesday by the independent Glas Javnosti
daily as saying he had rejected offers for another job, and added
that he would issue an official statement on his sacking.
	   At the same time, Milosevic shows no sign of easing up on his
crackdown on independent Serbian media. In a meeting Tuesday with
editors and broadcasters, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill promised he
would again push the issue with the autocratic president.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law severely
restricting press freedom and instituting severe fines for those
publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   ``You cannot wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said.
	   ``It is a 19th century means, not worthy even of the Ottoman
empire,'' Hill said, referring to Serbia's ancient enemy, the
Ottoman Turks.
	   Also Tuesday, independent daily NT Plus halted publication after
telephone threats to its chief editor, Momcilo Djogovic.
	   ``The new media law has turned into a widespread lynching of
journalists,'' Djogovic said.
	   On Monday, two Serbian independent daily newspapers, Nasa Borba
and Danas, which were briefly banned by the government earlier this
month, stopped publishing in protest after police raided the office
of another non-government newspaper, confiscated property and fined
the paper for alleged anti-state activity.
	   Independent B 92 radio reported Wednesday moves against Glas
Javnosti, for allegedly slandering a state official in an article.
	   Monday night, police raided the apartment of Ivan Tadic, manager
of DT-press publishing company, which publishes the weekly
Evropljanin, or European. All Tadic's belongings were taken away
except his baby's crib and clothes.
	   Over the weekend, a Belgrade court fined his weekly dlrs 246,000
for publishing an article that accused Milosevic of introducing
``dictatorship'' and ethnic Albanian secessionists have been
battling Yugoslav troops.

Government decides to issue summary of gold report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government said Wednesday it
will issue an easily readable summary of a report on the country's
gold dealings with Nazi Germany to bring the study to ``the widest
cross-section of the population.''
	   ``Reappraisal of Switzerland's history during the World War II
era should not be left to a small circle of experts,'' the ruling
coalition cabinet said in a statement. The free summary will be
available by mail on demand.
	   The 200-page study by an independent panel of historians,
released in May, said the Swiss National Bank, the country's
central bank, bought 1.2 billion Swiss francs (then dlrs 284
million) worth of gold from Germany during the war. That is about
three-quarters of all the gold shipped by wartime Germany.
	   It also said that the bank received 119.5 kilograms (263.4
pounds) of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration
camp victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank
knew the source of that gold.
	   Surrounded by Germany and Nazi allies, neutral Switzerland
needed increasing amounts of gold in the face of demand for the
franc, the only internationally acceptable currency on the European
continent.
	   The summary will be prepared under the panel's supervision, the
government said. No date was set for publication.
	   Swiss authorities will be responsible for distributing the
brochure, which will be printed in Switzerland's four official
languages as well as in English.
	   The government-appointed panel of historians based in
Switzerland, the United States and Israel is to study other aspects
of Switzerland's wartime past. It aims to produce a final report on
all its investigations in the year 2001.
	   Further studies will also be released in summary form, the
government said.
	   Next spring, the panel will publish a report on Switzerland's
wartime refugee policy.

	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Nearly a week after signing a new peace
agreement with Israel, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat returned
home Wednesday to a carefully orchestrated welcome by flag-waving
school students lining the streets of this border town.
	   Many Palestinians have been indifferent to the accord or
skeptical about whether Israel would keep its promise to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian
security guarantees.
	   Addressing those concerns Wednesday, Arafat said he was certain
Israel would carry out the agreement despite Tuesday's decision by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to postpone indefinitely an
Israeli Cabinet meeting that would approve the deal.
	   ``I think that what has been signed will be implemented
accurately,'' Arafat said after arriving at the Rafah border
crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' Arafat said. ``The signing was at the White
House ... in the presence of President (Bill) Clinton.''
	   Netanyahu has said he would not carry out the withdrawal if his
Cabinet failed to approve the agreement or if the Palestinians did
not live up to their promise to wage a tough campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   Trying to convey a message of broad support for the agreement,
the Palestinian Authority had Palestinian school students line the
road Arafat took from the border crossing to his headquarters in
Gaza City. The children waved Palestinian flags and waved banners
reading ``Yes to those who free the land, no to those who sell
slogans,'' the latter a reference to Arafat's Islamic militant
opposition.

Chinese authorities tell Tibetan monks to retire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities have told 49 monks over age
60 to retire from a Tibetan monastery to trim its population, an
official confirmed Wednesday.
	   The retirements are unusual because senior monks usually play a
key role in the transmission of Buddhist teachings.
	   The government in recent years has sought to control the
population of Tibetan monasteries and purge monks and nuns who
support independence and refuse to renounce the Dalai Lama, Tibet's
exiled spiritual leader.
	   The government accuses the Dalai Lama of trying to split Tibet
from China and using religion as a cloak for political activities.
The Dalai Lama says he wants cultural autonomy for Tibet.
	   A state-run Chinese newspaper said the recent retirements were
the work of a team of officials sent to make the Youning monastery
in Qinghai province, which borders Tibet, conform to regulations.
	   The Qinghai Daily said the monastery was the first in its area
to complete a rectification campaign. The team was sent in because
the monastery's management was ``chaotic,'' the newspaper reported
on Oct. 5.
	   The report said a government official would be assigned to the
monastery to inspect and guide its operations and ``understand and
control developments in the monks' thinking and lives.''
	   The Tibet Information Network, a London-based monitoring group,
quoted a former monk as saying the older monks' retirement ``is
very damaging for the monastery.''
	   ``Senior monks, well versed in the traditions of the religion,
are the ones who officiate at the rituals and they are the
custodians of the rich oral knowledge of Tibetan Buddhism,'' TIN
quoted Thubten Jinpa, now a research fellow at Cambridge
University, as saying.
	   The secretary-general of Qinghai's Buddhism Association, who
gave only his surname, Jin, confirmed Wednesday in a telephone
interview that the monks retired, but said they were not forced
out.
	   The monks chose to leave because they were too infirm to
participate in religious ceremonies, Jin said. But Jin also said
the monks were asked to leave so the monastery could conform to
rules limiting its population.
	   The Qinghai Daily said the 49 retirees were among 52 monks over
the age of 60 at the monastery. Another 16 monks under age 15 were
sent home for compulsory education and 12 monks aged 16 and 17 were
sent home to work, it said.
	   The monastery also was ordered to keep its population at 192,
the report said.

British Airways, Emirates sign code-sharing agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways and Emirates, the airline of the
United Arab Emirates, said Wednesday they have signed a
code-sharing agreement on some routes that will allow each to sell
seats on the other's flights.
	   The agreement will take effect Dec. 1 if regulatory authorities
give their approval, the airlines said in a statement.
	   The agreement applies to British Airways' flights between
London's Heathrow Airport and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates
and Emirates' services between Manchester and Dubai.
	   ``This is excellent news for air travelers flying between Europe
and the Middle East, offering them greater flexibility across the
unmatched networks of two leading airlines,'' said David Noyes,
British Airways' regional director for the United Kingdom, the
Middle East and Africa.
	   Under a code-sharing agreement, each airline sells seats on the
other's flights as if they were its own, and the airlines'
schedules and services are linked. Flights carry the designator
codes of both airlines _ BA and EK in this case.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Parliament voted unanimously Wednesday
to send observers and an AN-30 non-combat airplane to the
international mission to verify compliance with the Kosovo peace
agreement.
	   The decision, recommended by the Supreme Defense Council on
Sunday, is seen as a way to show Romania's willingness to
contribute to stability in the Balkan region.
	   Observers and the plane will be available for 90 days,
parliament voted. The number of observers will be settled after
negotiations between the foreign ministry and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is organizing the mission
	   Two weeks ago, Romania said that NATO could use its airspace in
emergency situations if airstrikes were launched against
Yugoslavia.

EU Commission propopes ban on Portuguese beef because of mad cow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday to ban the export of beef from Portugal for nine months
and to ban the export of cattle for at least 18 months from the
country, EU officials said.
	   The proposed ban on cattle exports would be reviewed after 18
months, they added.
	   The proposals by the EU executive Commission must be endorsed by
a majority of EU countries. They are expected to decide on the
proposal Friday.
	   The proposals result from a sharp rise in the number of cases of
``mad cow disease'' - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - in
Portugal this year. BSE in beef has been linked to a fatal brain
ailment in humans.
	   The Commission has claimed that Portugal was not enforcing an EU
ban on the use of the remains of bovine animals in feed for bovine
animals.
	   It has also said that Portugal was not enforcing EU rules on the
treatment of bovine animal remains used in feed for pigs and
poultry. BSE is believed to have spread in Europe through animal
feed.

	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan Wednesday by its disgruntled captain, who
allegedly told authorities he did it because he was angered over
pay and working conditions.
	   ``I feel relaxed,'' Yuan Bin said in a brief exchange with
reporters, after prosecutors questioned him at the airport before
taking him to court. ``I shall have no regret whatever happens to
me.''
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing FOR the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but was diverted in the air and arrived safely under
military jet escort at Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17
a.m. (0317 GMT).
	   Yuan was accompanied on the flight by his wife, identified as Xu
Mei, who also was detained by Taiwanese authorities.
	   ``He was determined to come to Taiwan, live or die,'' Chang
Kuo-cheng, director of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, told a
news conference. ``He said the company had treated him badly.''
	   Yuan's co-pilot, Wen Fei, did not try to physically stop the
captain, for fear a fight in the cockpit could endanger the
passengers, Chang said.
	   Nobody was hurt and the Boeing 737's two other pilots were
allowed to take off from Taiwan six hours later, flying 94
remaining passengers and six crew members back to China. China's
Xinhua News Agency said 20 foreigners were aboard, but it did not
give their nationalities.
	   No itinerary was given for the return flight.
	   Taiwan Television showed the captain in his uniform white shirt,
carrying a suitcase as he was led out of the plane by policemen in
helmets and bulletproof vests. His wife was shown in a black coat.
	   Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said Yuan admitted he diverted
the jet to Taiwan because he was displeased with Air China's
policies and his pay. It was not immediately clear what Yuan hoped
to accomplish.
	   ``There was no political motive,'' Huang said.
	   Chang said Yuan would face trial in Taiwan, although no
information on the precise charges was immediately released.
	   The flight by Air China, the main airline run by the Civil
Aviation Administration of China, was scheduled originally to stop
in Kunming, then continue to Yangon, Myanmar, Chang said.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew condemned Wednesday's
incident.
	   ``We've never agreed to such deeds,'' he told reporters _
although Taiwan in recent memory used to shower hijackers from
mainland China with gold and cash rewards. Taiwan began cracking
down on the hijackers after longstanding tensions with the mainland
began easing in the 1980s.
	   The 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed for
up to 12 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to China.
	   China has demanded that Taiwan send all the hijackers back. The
two sides were near reaching an agreement about repatriation in
1995 when China broke off the talks in anger over a Taiwanese drive
to gain diplomatic recognition.
	   In recent months, the two sides have slowly approached each
other to restore the long-stalled dialogue.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

Former Dutch Olympic chief cleared of calling crown prince `Judas'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A former chairman of the Dutch
Olympic Committee was effectively cleared Wednesday of calling the
heir to the Dutch throne ``Judas'' and ``a saboteur.''
	   Wouter Huibregtsen was quoted as making the comments by the
respected daily De Volkskrant during the last Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan.
	   In a civil case Huibregtsen brought against the newspaper, a
panel of judges at Amsterdam District Court ruled the story was
``unjust'' and ordered the paper to pay Huibregtsen's court costs
of 3,949 guilders (dlrs 2,123).
	   The ruling effectively clears Huibregtsen of making the
comments, although the offending comments were not mentioned in the
brief written ruling.
	   In a front-page article published Feb. 10, De Volkskrant
reported that Huibregtsen was enraged that Crown Prince Willem
Alexander had been chosen instead of him for a seat on the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Huibregtsen resigned in the scandal that followed but maintained
that he had not insulted the sports-loving prince.
	   De Volkskrant claimed Huibregtsen made the comments during a
telephone interview with one of its reporters.
	   In his resignation letter, Huibregtsen claimed that De
Volkskrant ``paraphrased my input and sometimes totally invented''
comments.

Churches, castles for sale at historic restoration conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Small castles, old military barracks,
train stations and churches are some of the items for sale this
week in Leipzig at an international convention on historic
restoration.
	   In total, 555 real estate properties are for sale or rent,
according to organizers of the four-day convention that opened
Wednesday.
	   The oldest item on offer is a cloister in Saxony-Anhalt state
built between 1059 and 1093. The most expensive: an old U.S.
military barracks in Berlin, with a price tag of 30 million marks
(dlrs 18.75 million).
	   Also for sale is a medical clinic in the town of Beelitz that
was used by former communist East German leader Erich Honecker.
``There's a lot of interest in this one,'' said Juergen Kramp, a
convention official.
	   Potential buyers include local governments, private
organizations and investors with money to spend on restoring a
historic property.
	   Lectures at the conference are focused more on the nitty-gritty
of restoration itself, with topics such as how to clean old stone
walls.

Little by little, the euro becomes a European reality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY113 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORDESILLAS, Spain (AP) _ At Hotel Los Toreros, the cuisine is
resolutely Spanish. But the prices of the Galician-style octopus
and vinegar-soaked partridge herald the start of a pan-European
financial revolution.
	   ``We were the first in the province to give our prices in
euros,'' said Jesus Ramon Fernandez, who runs Los Toreros with his
brothers. ``Everybody is talking about it and everybody accepts
it.''
	   After years of planning, the euro becomes the common currency of
11 European Union nations on Jan. 1.
	   But even before, French supermarkets, Belgian banks and Viennese
coffee houses are marking their prices in euros _ a sure sign the
currency once dismissed as a pipe dream of bureaucrats is becoming
a reality for millions of Europeans.
	   ``It's so people can see it already, so customers can get used
to it and those of us working here can learn about it,'' said
Jochen Granetz, head waiter at the trendy Kunsthaus Cafe in the
Austrian capital. A bottle of tangy Czech beer costs 3.45 euros,
calculated at a rate of 13.9 Austrian schillings to the euro.
	   Fernandez, in this little town on the plains of central Spain,
prices his cuisine at 164.8 pesetas to the euro.
	   Actually, such prices are something of a gimmick.
	   No one can pay in euros yet, and its exact value won't be known
until New Year's Eve, when finance ministers from euro-bloc nations
fix the rates at which their currencies are absorbed into the new
money.
	   However, barring some last-minute upset, the euro will be worth
about 6.6 French francs, 14 Austrian schillings and 2 German marks.
A dollar will be worth about 80 euro-cents.
	   But nobody will be able to buy any euros over the bank counter
until 2002, when euro coins and bank notes will begin circulating.
For three years, the euro will exist only as a sort of virtual
money alongside existing currencies.
	   It will trade on international markets against the dollar and
other currencies. Stock and bond prices will be set in euros.
Workers at multinational companies will receive paychecks
denominated in euros. Banks will let clients open euro accounts.
And governments will allow residents to pay taxes in euros.
	   Consumers will be able to pay in euros by credit or debit card,
or by check, but only at those retailers that chose to switch
early.
	   Peter Warner, euro program coordinator at Europay International,
which represents Mastercard in Europe, estimates only 10 percent of
transactions will be handled in euros during the first months of
the switch.
	   Most of the euro-zone's 270 million citizens will be able to
ignore, for the most part, the euro until 2002 and carry on
shopping with Spanish pesetas, Italian lire, French francs and the
rest.
	   To try to avoid the immense potential for confusion during the
transition, governments and private institutions have launched
information campaigns with radio, television and newspaper
advertising.
	   ``The idea is really to reassure people,'' said Annette Connolly
of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. ``It won't impact on their
daily lives until 2002 ... they will have plenty of time to get
used to the new currency.''
	   The message isn't getting through everywhere.
	   Con artists roving remote villages of Portugal are exploiting
ignorance about the euro to try to cheat the elderly out of their
savings. Posing as bank employees, swindlers tell intended victims
their escudos, the Portuguese currency, will soon be worthless and
they must hand them over for new euros.
	   Teachers are trying to ensure that younger Europeans are better
informed.
	   At the Bois de la Cambre elementary school in suburban Brussels,
classrooms are decorated with posters showing the boldly colored
euro notes with their images of bridges and gateways.
	   ``We'll have the euro in our purses in 2002,'' said Mo-Linh Le,
who will be 12 then. ``We created the euro so we won't have to
change money when we go to other European Union nations.''
	   Once-skeptical citizens seem to be getting used to the idea that
the new money will eventually make life easier and will help
business by eradicating exchange costs and currency fluctuations
within the euro-bloc.
	   An EU poll in September found almost two-thirds of citizens in
the 11 euro-zone nations favor the euro, a sharp rise from previous
surveys.

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from U.S. official, Albright
calling, Netanyahu quotes
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time next week, officials said Wednesday.
	   As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon earlier this week.
	   ``All sides must begin implementation next Monday night,'' said
Larry Schwartz, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of a
delay when he announced Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely
postponing a Cabinet meeting that was to have approved the deal.
	   Netanyahu insisted Wednesday that he needed Cabinet backing and
that he would not start the pullback until he did.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   However, U.S. officials and Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Cabinet approval was not a prerequisite for
Netanyahu to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's office said in a statement the Cabinet meeting was
postponed because the Palestinians had not yet submitted a detailed
security plan to the United States as they had promised.
	   However, Israeli media said the main reason for the delay was
Netanyahu's concern that he would not get a majority in his Cabinet
for the troop withdrawal.
	   Several Israeli Cabinet ministers who initially said they were
undecided have announced in recent days that they would vote
against the agreement.
	   A Palestinian official said the Palestinians would present only
a partial security plan to the Americans by Monday, the deadline
specified in the peace agreement.
	   An American official who spoke on condition of anonymity,
pointed out that the Palestinians have until Monday to present
their plan and that no one has violated the agreement yet.
	   However, U.S. diplomats met Wednesday with Palestinian officials
in an attempt to prevent any delays in implementation.
	   Bar-Illan noted that in the first week of the 12-week process,
the steps to be taken must come from the Palestinian side and that
Israel does not have to taken any action during that time.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he was
confident both sides would keep their promises and that he was not
concerned about the postponing of the Israeli Cabinet meeting.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Albright called the
Palestinian leader on Monday evening, while Arafat was visiting
Saudi Arabia. Asked what the two discussed, Abourdeneh said that
``the Americans are keen on implementing the agreement.''
	   The dispute over the security plan is only the latest bump on
the road to carrying out the peace accord. On the last day of the
Mideast summit, Netanyahu linked the signing of the agreement to
the release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard from a U.S. jail. The
demand held up the signing ceremony for several hours.
	   In related developments Wednesday, Israeli media said security
for Netanyahu has been increased in recent days in response to the
vociferous street protests against the West Bank withdrawal.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu will cut down on appearances in
large crowds and travel to the West Bank and Gaza Strip only by
helicopter.
	   In recent demonstrations against Netanyahu, demonstrators have
shouted ``traitor, traitor.'' Such cries were common in the weeks
leading up to the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin by an ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.

Foreign shareholders to buy out ex-leader's daughter from power
</HEADLINE>
company &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ U.S. and Australian companies, the two
major shareholders of private Indonesian power company PT Energi
Sengkang, plan to buy a stake currently held by a daughter of
ex-President Suharto, an official of one said Wednesday.
	   The official of the Texas-based El Paso Energy International Co.
said the move to buy out Suharto's eldest daughter, Siti ``Tutut''
Hardiyanti Rukmana, is designed to quash allegations of corruption
and collusion.
	   The other major shareholder is Australia's Energy Equity Corp.
	   ``We'd better remove her from the venture, otherwise people will
keep charging us with being involved in collusive business,'' the
official, who asked not to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   El Paso and Energy Equity each hold 47.5 percent of Energi
Sengkang, while the remaining 5 percent is held by PT Triharsa
Sarana Jaya Purnama, which is controlled by Tutut.
	   The executive said the two foreign companies will set up an
Indonesian company with Indonesian state-owned electricity company
PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara. The yet-to-be established company
will buy Triharsa's 5 percent stake in Energi Sengkang, he added.
	   Hard hit by the currency crisis, PLN is operating at a loss and
is cash-strapped. The El Paso official said, however, that PLN's
cash shortage isn't posing a problem to the plan.
	   ``There's always a way to get around the problem,'' he said.
	   Energi Sengkang operates a 132-megawatt power plant in South
Sulawesi.
	   Suharto ended 32 years in power in May when a wave of protests
and violence forced the authoritarian president to quit.
	   Since then he has been at the center of a corruption inquiry.
	   Critics accuse him of misusing his office to enrich his family
and friends. He has denied any wrongdoing.
	   Nevertheless, many companies and the government have canceled
contracts with companies linked to Suharto's six wealthy children.

Education minister tries to head off new protest with quick action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Hoping to take the wind out of another nationwide
student protest planned next week, France's education minister
promised quick measures to relieve classroom overcrowding, in an
interview published Wednesday.
	   But Claude Allegre's own sharp tongue could sabotage his
efforts.
	   Hundreds of thousands of students turned out repeatedly this
month and plan another protest Nov. 5, demanding the leftist
government spend more money on education. They've shrugged off new
measures as insufficient.
	   ``Maybe I expressed myself badly. The high schoolers did not
understand that there will be many new teachers in their schools,''
Allegre told Le Parisien.
	   ``I will take teachers from the waiting lists of teachers who
have already passed the national education exam,'' he said.
	   But Allegre, who has been criticized in the past for lacking
tact, appeared to chafe at his young critics, who have periodically
taken to the streets to demand more aid.
	   ``Young people are impatient in a society where everyone wants
everything immediately. Every four years, high school students
develop a fever,'' he said.
	   Allegre has promised thousands more hirings, though he has not
given specific numbers of teachers, as students are demanding. He
did say the hirings would include 14,000 monitors to ensure school
order and security.
	   ``All high schools have different needs,'' Allegre said. ``In
certain troubled high schools, there will be 15 to 20 new
monitors.''
	   Already France's biggest budget item, education funding is
limited by the leftist government's desire to remain qualified for
the euro single currency that debuts at the end of the year.
	   The euro requires that a country keep its budget deficit below 3
percent of its gross domestic product.

	   The agreement signed Monday with South Korea's Buhae Industrial
Corp. covers an area of 107.07 square kilometers (42.8 square
miles) in the province of Bokeo, it said.
	   Exploration and other preparatory work on the project are

Afghan opposition leader says Bin Laden harms Islam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, the man
accused of bombing U.S. embassies in Africa, is harming Islam and
bringing ``endless problems'' to Afghanistan, an Afghan opposition
leader said in remarks published Wednesday.
	   Ahmed Shah Massood, the military leader of forces fighting
Afghanistan's Taliban militia, said that bombs planted at the U.S.
embassies in August killed hundreds of Muslims as well as
Americans.
	   ``Is this holy war?'' he asked in an interview with the
London-based newspaper Al-Hayat.
	   Massood criticized his opponents for giving a free hand to bin
Laden. The Saudi dissident, who has called for holy war against the
United States, runs a training camp in southern Afghanistan that
was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles Aug. 20.
	   The strike retaliated for the car bombs outside U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12
Americans.
	   ``How is it in our (Afghan) interest when Osama bin Laden uses
our territory to create endless problems for us,'' said Massood,
who was defense minister in the government that the Taliban ousted
in 1996.
	   ``We cannot bring down America by these actions. This behavior
harms Islam's reputation.'' Massood said at his base in Panjshir
Valley, northern Afghanistan.
	   Asked what he would do if bin Laden was in parts of Afghanistan
under his control, Massood said he would try to reconcile such
exiles with their home governments.
	   ``I would ask their governments not to imprison or kill them but
let them live in their countries.''
	   Those Arabs who wanted to fight for God, ``we would guide them
to the right way and there are several ways in which Islam can be
served and defended without doing harm to its reputation.''
	   Massood, whose forces have been squeezed into about 10 percent
of Afghanistan, said he wanted a negotiated solution to the Afghan
civil war.
	   ``We want to sit (with the Taliban) and talk to find a
solution.''
	   Massood said that despite the Taliban's recent tensions with
Iran over the killing of eight Iranian diplomats, the Taliban was
still concentrating its forces against the Afghan opposition.
	   He maintained that troops sent to the Iran-Afghan border to face
about 200,000 Iranian troops on the other side were not Taliban
forces but soldiers from the Pakistani army and a Pakistani
militia.

New search for author's plane after fisherman finds bracelet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fisherman's and search head's quotes
 &UR; By JEAN-MARC MATALON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Salvage crews are searching a new swath
of the Mediterranean for the lost plane of Antoine de
Saint-Exupery, after a fisherman found his bracelet near Marseille,
officials said Wednesday.
	   The author of ``The Little Prince'' mysteriously vanished in his
warplane while flying near the French coast on July 31, 1944, as
the Allies were pushing Nazi troops through Provence.
	   Repeated searches near Nice failed to turn up Saint-Ex's
Lockheed P-38 Lightning, and theories have ranged from hostile
gunfire to mechanical problems to suicide.
	   But late last month, fisherman Jean-Claude Bianco found the
author's silver chain bracelet in near-perfect condition off the
coast of Marseille, 190 kms (115 miles) due west, while looking for
sole and mullet in a rocky inlet near the Planier lighthouse.
	   Entwined in seaweed and sand, the bracelet was also stuck to a
piece of fabric believed to be that of Saint-Exupery's flight suit.
	   ``I told myself, you're dreaming, you're dreaming,'' Jean-Claude
Bianco, the fisherman, told the LCI television station. ``The sea
is vast, and the bracelet was so small.''
	   The bracelet was authenticated, since it carried the name of
Saint-Exupery's wife Consuelo and the names Reynal and Hitchcock,
publishers of The Little Prince.
	   Two days later, on Sept. 28, the marine salvage company Comex
launched a two-month search.
	   The Minbibiex and the Remora 2000, two mini-submarines, were
combing an area of up to 100 square kilometers (38 square miles)
around where Bianco found the bracelet, said Comex chief
Henri-Germain Deloze.
	   ``We've done only a small part of the work,'' Deloze said. ``The
depth of the water varies from 600 to 300 meters (720 to 360
yards), and Jean-Claude Bianco couldn't relocate the exact site of
discovery.''
	   Several pieces of plane wreckage were located by sonar, but so
far nothing was found that confirmed they found the P-38, Deloze
said.
	   But Deloze said he was still convinced Saint-Exupery crashed
near Marseille after taking off from Bastia-Borgo Airport on the
island of Corsica, shortly before 9 a.m. on July 31, 1944.
	   If Saint-Exupery did crash near Marseille, it appeared unlikely
he was hit by German gunfire, since the Germans had been chased out
of the region by then, expert Patrick Ehrhardt told the regional
daily La Provence.

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from U.S. official, Albright
calling, Netanyahu quotes. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time next week, officials said Wednesday.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   ``All sides must begin implementation next Monday night,'' said
Larry Schwartz, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of a
delay when he announced Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely
postponing a Cabinet meeting that was to have approved the deal.
Netanyahu insisted Wednesday that he needed Cabinet backing.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   However, U.S. officials and Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Cabinet approval was not a prerequisite for
Netanyahu to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's office said in a statement the Cabinet meeting was
postponed because the Palestinians had not yet submitted a detailed
security plan to the United States as promised.
	   However, Israeli media said the main reason for the delay was
Netanyahu's concern that he would not get a majority in his
Cabinet, where several Israeli ministers who initially said they
were undecided have announced in recent days that they would vote
against the agreement.
	   A Palestinian official said the Palestinians would present only
a partial security plan to the Americans by Monday, the deadline
specified in the peace agreement.
	   Bar-Illan noted that in the first week of the 12-week process,
the Palestinians must make the first step and that Israel does not
have to take any action at that time.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said he was confident both
sides would keep their promises and that he was not concerned about
the postponing of the Israeli Cabinet meeting.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Albright called Monday
evening, while Arafat was visiting Saudi Arabia. Asked what the two
discussed, Abourdeneh said ``the Americans are keen on implementing
the agreement.''
	   The dispute over the security plan is the latest bump on the
road to carrying out the peace accord. On the last day of the
Mideast summit, Netanyahu linked the signing of the agreement to
the release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard from a U.S. jail. The
demand held up the signing ceremony for several hours.
	   Also Wednesday, Israeli media said security for Netanyahu was
increased in recent days in response to the vociferous street
protests against the West Bank withdrawal.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu will cut down on appearances in
large crowds and travel to the West Bank and Gaza Strip only by
helicopter.
	   In recent demonstrations against Netanyahu, demonstrators have
shouted ``traitor, traitor.'' Such cries were common in the weeks
leading up to the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin by an ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.

 &UR; Pro-government lawmaker proposes re-establishing vice-presidency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of the pro-government faction in
parliament proposed Wednesday restoring the post of vice president
to stabilize Russia's political situation, shaken by President
Boris Yeltsin's frequent illnesses.
	   ``The introduction of the post of vice president would allow us
to avoid early elections,'' said Alexander Shokhin, leader of the
moderate Our Home Is Russia faction.
	   Restoring the vice president's job has been suggested recently
by other Russian politicians, including Alexander Lebed, a former
general-turned- provincial governor, who is a leading potential
contender for the presidency.
	   The position of vice president was abolished when Russia revised
its constitution in 1993. The last vice president, Alexander
Rutskoi, led an armed rebellion against Yeltsin in the fall of that
year that failed and prompted the constitutional changes.
	   Under the current law, the prime minister would step in if the
president died or resigned before the end of his term, and would be
required to call new elections within three months.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no crippling illness and will serve out
the rest of his term, which ends in the summer of 2000.

Singapore man jailed and fined for torching 56 cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A man who said he heard voices telling him to
torch luxury cars was sentenced Wednesday to 7 1/2 years in prison
and ordered to pay 720,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 444,000) in
damages, Singapore national television reported.
	   Kee Keng Seng, 66, pleaded guilty to torching 56 cars, most of
them luxury automobiles like Mercedes Benzes and BMWs.
	   Over five months before police caught him in August, Kee started
the fires at night by placing lit candles tied with match sticks on
the vehicles' tires, the report said.
	   A news report after his arrest said he was believed to have been
a former patient in a mental institution.
	   Kee's lawyers offered as mitigation their client's mental state,
though the report did not mention whether the judge reduced his
sentence accordingly.

Mighty winds, downpours wreak havoc in the Netherlands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Torrential rain and howling winds
raged through the Netherlands again Wednesday, triggering hundreds
of kilometers (miles) of traffic jams. People in low-lying areas
scrambled to fortify sodden dikes with sandbags.
	   Flooding was reported in the northern and eastern Netherlands,
while bulging puddles cut off roads around the country, but no
weather-related deaths were reported.
	   The country has been pelted by stronger-than-usual showers and
storms in recent days, and hopes of a reprieve were quickly dashed
as the Dutch braced for more wet and windy weather.
	   In the eastern Dutch province of Drenthe, up to 89 millimeters
(3.56 inches) of rain fell overnight.
	   The month of October is expected to end with a total of up to
140 millimeters (5.6 inches) of rain, overshooting its normal
average of 70 millimeters (2.8 inches), according to the Royal
Netherlands Meteorological Institute.
	   ``October is a pretty wet month, but this is extreme,'' said
institute spokesman Harry Geurts. He was at a loss to explain the
cause.
	   The institute, which seldom issue warnings in this soggy country
prone to bad weather, has warned of more rain and has been
reminding motorists of the dangers of driving on wet pavement.
	   Gusts registering up to 100 kilometers (60 miles) per hour also
swept through central Netherlands.
	   Up to 200 kilometers (125 miles) of traffic jams were reported
around the country during the Wednesday morning rush hour,
resulting in several accidents involving minor injuries, officials
said.

Afghan opposition leader says Bin Laden harms Islam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, the man
accused of bombing U.S. embassies in Africa, is harming Islam and
bringing ``endless problems'' to Afghanistan, an Afghan opposition
leader said in remarks published Wednesday.
	   Ahmed Shah Massood, the military leader of the minority forces
fighting Afghanistan's Taliban militia, said bombs planted at the
U.S. embassies in August killed hundreds of Muslims as well as
Americans.
	   ``Is this holy war?'' he asked in an interview with the
London-based newspaper Al-Hayat.
	   Massood criticized his opponents for giving a free hand to bin
Laden, who has called for holy war against the United States and
runs a training camp in southern Afghanistan that was attacked by
U.S. cruise missiles Aug. 20.
	   The strike followed near simultaneous car bomb explosions
outside U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed
224 people, including 12 Americans.
	   ``How is it in our (Afghan) interest when Osama bin Laden uses
our territory to create endless problems for us,'' said Massood,
who was defense minister in the government that the extremist
Islamic Taliban ousted in 1996.
	   ``We cannot bring down America by these actions. This behavior
harms Islam's reputation.'' Massood said at his base in Panjshir
Valley, northern Afghanistan.
	   Asked what he would do if bin Laden were in parts of Afghanistan
under his control, Massood said he would try to reconcile such
exiles with their home governments.
	   ``I would ask their governments not to imprison or kill them but
let them live in their countries,'' he said.
	   Those Arabs who wanted to fight for God, ``we would guide them
to the right way and there are several ways in which Islam can be
served and defended without doing harm to its reputation,'' he
said.
	   Massood, whose forces have been squeezed into about 10 percent
of Afghanistan, said he wanted a negotiated solution to the Afghan
civil war.
	   ``We want to sit (with the Taliban) and talk to find a
solution,'' he said.
	   Despite the Taliban's recent tensions with Iran over the killing
of eight Iranian diplomats, the Taliban was still concentrating its
forces against the Afghan opposition, Massood said.
	   He maintained that troops sent to the Iran-Afghan border to face
about 200,000 Iranian troops on the other side were not Taliban
forces, but soldiers from the army and a militia from neighboring
Pakistan.

Greeks commemorate rejection of Italian ultimatum, WWII entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greeks on Wednesday commemorated the day
in 1940 that they rejected Italy's ultimatum for unconditional
surrender, resulting in an invasion and Greece's entry into World
War II.
	   President Costis Stephanopoulos took the salute at a military
parade in the northern port city of Salonica, while school children
took part in parades around the country.
	   The national holiday is officially known as ``No'' day, after
the single word used by the then leader of Greece to turn down
Italy's ultimatum.
	   Italian troops then invaded the country through Albania, but in
a horrific winter battle outnumbered Greek troops pushed the
Italian army back to the Albanian port of Vlora.
	   Italy's defeat in the campaign forced Nazi German forces to
invade through Bulgaria, resulting in a brutal occupation of Greece
until late 1944.

Mandela meets Namibian president on Congo issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ A day after inconclusive peace talks on
Congo, South African President Nelson Mandela continued mediation
efforts with Namibian President Sam Nujoma on Wednesday.
	   Meeting in the Namibian capital, the two leaders said they would
discuss the proliferating crisis in Congo and other issues.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad have sent troops and weapons
to help defend Congolese President Laurent Kabila from a growing
rebel threat. Kabila claims the rebels are backed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   After his Namibian meeting, Mandela was expected to meet
Congolese rebel leader Wamba dia Wamba in Pretoria.
	   On Tuesday, 12 African ministers and United Nations officials
ended two days of inconclusive Congo talks in Zambia, agreeing on a
cease-fire proposal that Congolese rebels refused to endorse.
	   Since the rebel offensive began in early August, African leaders
have been trying to negotiate a settlement of the Congolese
dispute, which threatens security throughout central Africa.
	   Last week, Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe agreed to step up their
troop commitments to Kabila.
	   Namibia over the weekend sent another battalion of 800 soldiers
to join at least 600 troops that are reportedly already there,
sources in the Namibian military who spoke on condition of
anonymity said.
	   Zimbabwe has committed a total of 5,000 troops and Angola has
sent 1,000 troops, and warplanes and weaponry, past reports said.
	   Mandela was expected to meet with Kabila, Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. It was
not clear when those meetings were scheduled.

Argentine president arrives in Britain for reconciliation visit

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a simple ceremony of reconciliation, Argentine
President Carlos Menem on Wednesday laid a wreath at St. Paul's
Cathedral to honor the dead of the 1982 war over the still-disputed
Falkland Islands.
	   Menem, the first Argentine president to visit Britain officially
since the war, placed the wreath of blue-and-white flowers before a
plaque listing the 255 British soldiers slain in the 74-day
conflict.
	   He made the sign of the cross and stood in silence, head bowed,
for a minute. His daughter, Zulema, 28, wept by his side, brushing
tears away from under her dark glasses.
	   Most of the 970 soldiers killed were Argentineans, many of them
young conscripts sent to the windswept south Atlantic archipelago
by the then-military junta.
	   Prince Andrew, who flew combat missions as a helicopter pilot
during the war, saluted during the ceremony, leading a group of
military officers and veterans at the service in the crypt of St.
Paul's.
	   The wreath-laying was intended to deflect from the dispute over
the Falklands, whose 2,200-strong population is of British descent.
	   During Menem's six-day visit, officials hope to focus on booming
trade and generally good relations with Argentine's democratically
elected government.
	   ``We can agree to disagree,'' Argentine Foreign Minister Guido
Di Tella said before the service, referring to the Falklands.
``This idea of agreeing to disagree is a very British idea.''
	   Earlier, Menem, who brought 100 business leaders with him, met
British industry chiefs for breakfast.
	   ``The time has come for both nations to leave behind us
misunderstandings and mistrust that have separated us for years,''
he told the gathering.
	   In a letter to a British tabloid Friday, the Argentine president
stopped short of an apology, but said he deeply regretted the war
and that it ``should never have happened.''
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook noted Tuesday that Menem was a
prisoner of the military junta in 1982, was held for five years and
tortured.
	   ``The fact that he is the president of Argentina shows how far
it has come,'' Cook said.
	   Menem is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Queen Elizabeth II during his visit.

Afghan rivals agree to a one-week truce, free prisoners

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's warring factions have
agreed to a one-week cease-fire while they try to negotiate a peace
agreement, a Taliban and opposition spokesmen said Wednesday.
	   As a gesture of good will, the two sides exchanged prisoners
Wednesday. Each side released 50 prisoners in an exchange on the
front line, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of the beleaguered
Afghan capital of Kabul.
	   ``We have agreed to a week-long truce with the opposition,''
said a Taliban spokesman who gave his name only as Jehangirwal.
	   The cease-fire and prisoner exchange was the result of a shuttle
diplomacy conducted by Said Jalal, 28, a close confident of Saudi
Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   Saudi Arabia is one of only three countries to recognize the
Taliban army. The others are Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
	   It was not immediately clear when the cease-fire would take
effect, but it was agreed upon to allow Jalal an opportunity to
press ahead with peace negotiations to end the protracted civil war
ravaging Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban religious army rules roughly 90 percent of the
country, while the northern-based opposition alliance the remaining
10 percent. The two sides are locked in a bitter battle on several
fronts most of them in northern Afghanistan.
	   An opposition spokesman, who gave his name as Arif, said
opposition leader Ahmed Shah Massood agreed to the temporary truce
and prisoner exchange. Massood was a defense minister in the ousted
government of president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
	   The Taliban sweep through the country suffered a setback earlier
this month when Massood's soldiers retook the northern Takhar
provincial capital of Taloqan.
	   The Taliban are Sunni Muslims and are mostly Pashtuns _ the
majority ethnic group in Afghanistan _ while the opposition
comprise of religious and ethnic minorities including Shiites,
Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.
	   The Taliban follows a strict version of Islam that bars women
from work and education, forces men to wear beards and bans all
kinds of light entertainment, including music.

Detained Ukrainian gang suspected of notorious contract killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Members of a large gang of criminals
detained in Crimea earlier this month are suspected of carrying out
a series of contract killings, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The 23 people, whose detention was announced in mid-October,
allegedly were involved in a large number of crimes in 1994-98,
which also included robberies and extortion, the daily Segodnya
said.
	   Police are also investigating their involvement in the slayings
of several prominent businessmen and regional government officials
in the southern Ukrainian peninsula.
	   The victims included Crimea's first deputy prime minister,
deputy tourism minister and State Property Fund chairman, the
newspaper said.
	   ``The bandits fulfilled the orders of those who paid them,''
Crimean police chief Hennady Moskal told Segodnya.
	   He said members in the gang were ``previously unknown young
people who somebody has taught how to kill.''
	   But Segodnya said some of the gang's alleged crimes were highly
professional and that former security experts may have been among
its members or those who assisted them.

Social discontent casts wider shadow of Algeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Social discontent was moving toward a new peak
Wednesday, with women's groups and others expressing solidarity
with seven striking newspapers, university teachers continuing
their walkout and steelworkers threatening a strike.
	   The walkouts have added to the already charged atmosphere in the
runup to early presidential elections announced last month by
President Liamine Zeroual, sparking a power struggle within the
military-backed government.
	   Algeria's four main women's rights organizations backed the
newspapers in their 11th day of a strike. They called on ``those
who believe in the values of a modern, democratic and just
Algeria'' to support the journalists of seven privately-owned
newspapers.
	   The papers are on strike to protest a demand by state-owned
printers for four of the papers to pay back debts or be shut down,
criticized as a politically motivated move to pressure the
independent media.
	   ``The public should know that those who took this decision hide,
in a pitiful manner, behind commercial arguments,'' the director of
Le Matin, Mohamed Benchicou, was quoted as saying in another paper,
Le Jeune Independant.
	   Le Matin is among the four that owes back debts to the printers.
	   On Tuesday, the state-run radio shortened its newscast in a sign
of solidarity with the newspapers.
	   Meanwhile, a teacher's strike that began haltingly had reached
all 17 of the nation's universities by Wednesday. The teachers are
demanding higher pay and housing.
	   And on Tuesday, a metallurgists' union organized a sit-in Nov.
17 in front of the Palais du Gouvernment where the parliament
meets.
	   Union sources, speaking on condition they not be identified by
name, said the sit-in would be a ``warning'' before an eventual
unlimited strike. Such a strike could effect up to 200,000 workers
at 11 state-run companies.
	   The workers are demanding that plans to close down some units
``be liquidated.''
	   Algerian judges protesting an article last month in El Watan
that referred to them as ``incapable'' were in their final day of a
three-day strike.
	   The strikes come on the heels of a two-week walkout at
state-owned Air Algeria.
	   Zeroual in September announced plans to cut short his term, set
to end in the year 2000, and hold elections before the end of
February.
	   The move was seen as the result of a power struggle in which
military hardliners opposed Zeroual's overtures to Islamic leaders.
A nearly 7-year-old Islamic insurgency has left at least 75,000
people dead.

Afghan opposition leader says Bin Laden harms Islam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS Massood government gave bin Laden asylum, graf 7; no
pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, the man
accused of bombing U.S. embassies in Africa, is harming Islam and
bringing ``endless problems'' to Afghanistan, an Afghan opposition
leader said in remarks published Wednesday.
	   Ahmed Shah Massood, the military leader of forces fighting
Afghanistan's Taliban militia, said that bombs planted at the U.S.
embassies in August killed hundreds of Muslims as well as
Americans.
	   ``Is this holy war?'' he asked in an interview with the
London-based newspaper Al-Hayat.
	   Massood criticized his opponents for giving a free hand to bin
Laden. The Saudi dissident, who has called for holy war against the
United States, runs a training camp in southern Afghanistan that
was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles Aug. 20.
	   The strike retaliated for the car bombs outside U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12
Americans.
	   ``How is it in our (Afghan) interest when Osama bin Laden uses
our territory to create endless problems for us,'' said Massood.
	   Ironically, Massood was defense minister in the government of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani that gave asylum to bin Laden. The
Taliban ousted that government in 1996.
	   ``We cannot bring down America by these actions. This behavior
harms Islam's reputation.'' Massood said at his base in Panjshir
Valley, northern Afghanistan.
	   Asked what he would do if bin Laden was in parts of Afghanistan
under his control, Massood said he would try to reconcile such
exiles with their home governments.
	   ``I would ask their governments not to imprison or kill them but
let them live in their countries.''
	   Those Arabs who wanted to fight for God, ``we would guide them
to the right way and there are several ways in which Islam can be
served and defended without doing harm to its reputation.''
	   Massood, whose forces have been squeezed into about 10 percent
of Afghanistan, said he wanted a negotiated solution to the Afghan
civil war.
	   ``We want to sit (with the Taliban) and talk to find a
solution.''
	   Massood said that despite the Taliban's recent tensions with
Iran over the killing of eight Iranian diplomats, the Taliban was
still concentrating its forces against the Afghan opposition.
	   He maintained that troops sent to the Iran-Afghan border to face
about 200,000 Iranian troops on the other side were not Taliban
forces but soldiers from the Pakistani army and a Pakistani
militia.

Police in Kaliningrad report large seizure counterfeit money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police in the western Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad said they made their largest seizure of counterfeit
money in 10 years, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Wednesday.
	   Police found 18 500-ruble notes _ the equivalent of about dlrs
530 _ ITAR-Tass said. It said the money was made with a color
printer, probably from abroad.
	   The notes were confiscated from a bank where they had been
deposited by someone from a local cattle farm, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The circulation of counterfeit money has recently increased to
Kaliningrad, which is separated from the rest of Russia by Belarus
and Lithuania.
	   ITAR-Tass said 572 fake bills, including 434 foreign ones, have
been seized so far this year.

Japan decides to appeal WTO ruling on agricultural testing

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will appeal the ruling by the World Trade
Organization that its tests for imported apples, cherries and other
produce are an illegal trade barrier, the Ministry of Agriculture
said Wednesday.
	   A WTO dispute settlement panel found Tuesday that Japan's
testing, which takes a minimum of two years, wasn't justified by
adequate scientific evidence. The ruling covered eight farm
products _ apples, cherries, peaches, walnuts, plums, pears,
apricots and quinces _ a kind of yellow apple-shaped fruit.
	   The United States has accused Tokyo of trying to block American
food imports by setting up the tests.
	   ``We will appeal the ruling because it is not acceptable,'' said
Ministry of Agriculture official Takeo Kocha. ``We are confident
the tests are scientifically sound.''
	   After decades of wrangling, Japan finally approved American
apple imports in 1994, with the first shipments arriving the
following year.
	   But for more than a year now, American apples have not been sold
in Japan because their sales have not grown enough to make the
business profitable, said Jimmy Uehara, Japan representative of the
Washington Apple Commission in Tokyo.
	   The Japanese government approval only covered Red Delicious and
Golden Delicious apples _ which were popular both in the United
States and Japan when the U.S. side initially applied 20 years ago
but since then have become less popular.
	   Washington-grown Granny Smith and Fuji apples are expected to
sell better in the Japanese market, but unless Japanese accept the
tests for the previous imports, those varieties will have to
undergo additional testing.
	   ``We think we've already proved the apples are safe. We don't
understand the Japanese government view at all,'' Uehara said.
	   Japan requires repeated testing each time a country attempts to
export a new variety of an approved commodity. Kocha, the Japanese
official, said it is not safe to assume that one variety of apple
will be safe just because another passed the tests.
	   Japanese fruit is notoriously expensive, with gourmet apples
going for about 400 yen each (dlrs 3.40) or more. When they were
still sold, American apples at Japanese supermarkets were far
cheaper, at about 70 yen (60 cents) each.
	   But some Japanese say they prefer homegrown because they fear
U.S. apples may contain harmful pesticides and they like the taste
of Japanese apples.
	   In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
praised the WTO ruling.
	   ``This case shows the WTO distinguishes between legitimate
science-based testing versus thinly veiled protectionist
measures,'' she said Tuesday.
	   Japanese farmers make up a powerful lobby. For decades, they
have been the backbone of voter support for the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.

Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday,
with Tokyo prices falling for a fourth consecutive session. Some
exchanges finished higher on hopes of interest rate cuts. Tokyo
blue chips plunged amid worries about corporate earnings and the
direction of emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia, traders
said. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down
304.61 points, or 2.20 percent, at 13,516.07. Meanwhile, the U.S.
dollar was quoted at 117.88 yen in late trading, down 1.48 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but slightly above its late New York rate of
117.75 yen overnight. Singapore shares closed sharply higher on
anticipation of more interest rate cuts and soon-to-be-unveiled
corporate restructurings, dealers said. The benchmark Straits Times
Index closed up 26.62 points, or 2.3 percent, at 1,180.22. In
Indonesia, a huge student rally at the Parliament dampened
sentiment on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. The Composite Index fell
by 5.811 points, or 1.8 percent, to 312.290. Markets in Hong Kong
were closed for a holiday. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
presented the broad outlines of his long-awaited economic austerity
package, asking the Brazilian people to support a plan that spreads
the pain ``with an eye towards protecting the poorest.'' Cardoso
said Tuesday night that he would ask Congress to slash dlrs 7.3
billion from the 1999 budget, calling it an unprecedented cut. The
former economy minister used a pointer and charts to explain how
key reforms to the social security system and civil service that
have languished in Congress were necessary to cut a ballooning
deficit, though he did not go into detail. He also talked of
raising certain taxes for companies, civil servants and a tax on
financial transactions. The government will release specifics
Wedensday about the package to attack a budget deficit of dlrs 65
billion, or 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product, and
shore up a reeling economy. The package is seen generally as a
prerequisite to an estimated dlrs 30 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund. (BRAZIL ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nippon Oil Co. and Mitsubishi Oil Co., two of
Japan's largest petroleum distributors and refiners, said Wednesday
they will merge in April to create Japan's largest oil company.
Encouraged by recent deregulation that has eroded profits
throughout the industry, the partnership is designed to trim costs
and improve competitiveness. The new company, to be called Nisseki
Mitsubishi Co., will boast sales of 3 trillion yen (dlrs 25.45
billion), an industry-leading 24 percent share of the domestic fuel
market and more than a quarter of Japan's total refining capacity.
Nippon Oil now is Japan's second-largest petroleum distributor,
while Mitsubishi Oil ranks sixth. Within five years of the merger,
the company expects to save 70 billion yen (dlrs 593.82 million) by
combining its two parent corporations' administrative, distribution
and refining operations. Many Japanese oil companies have been hard
hit by lower demand due to a recessionary economy and a plunge in
retail gasoline prices following the lifting of a ban on imported
fuel in early 1996. (JAPAN-OIL MERGER)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade ministry said Wednesday that
industrial output at the country's factories and mines climbed a
seasonally-adjusted 2.5 percent in September on the month, marking
a slight improvement which beat many economists' expectations. In
its assessment of the latest industrial production figures, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said output was
``stagnant,'' an improvement from the ``downtrend'' which had
characterized the previous six months. Economists surveyed by Dow
Jones Newswires estimated industrial production would grow only 2.1
percent in September compared to the previous month. The Ministry
forecast an end to the surge, with a 1.1 percent decline in
industrial production this month followed by a 0.3 percent drop in
November. Also Wednesday, the Bank of Japan reported wholesale
prices dropped 1.3 percent during the second 10 days of October
compared to the previous 10-day period. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Several major corporations, including General
Motors, pledged Tuesday to take voluntary actions to ``reduce the
risk'' of global warming, although stopping short of endorsing the
controversial Kyoto climate treaty. Executives of General Motors,
Monsanto and British Petroleum agreed to take steps to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide, the leading so-called ``greenhouse''
gas that many scientists say may lead to a serious warming of the
earth. British Petroleum previously has accepted global warming as
a potentially serious environmental problem. But automakers,
including General Motors, long have scoffed at concerns about
climate change. A growing number of leading corporations in recent
months have publicly called for actions _ though usually voluntary
_ to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the coming decade,
inlcuding Shell Oil and Boeing Technologies. ``These are companies
that are willing to get on with it and demonstrate that we don't
need to be immobilized by the political process,'' said Jonathan
Lash, president of the World Resources Institutem an environmental
think tank. (US-GLOBAL WARMING)

category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO is keeping more than 400
warplanes on alert as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
continues to withdraw forces from Kosovo and lets tens of thousands
of refugees return home. A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of
Germany, said Wednesday that the withdrawal of Serb forces is
incomplete but moves so far represent a ``considerable step in the
direction of fulfilling the demands.'' With Yugoslav forces drawing
back, the Western military alliance did not set any new deadlines
for airstrikes after the previous one expired Tuesday. That
bitterly disappointed Kosovo's ethnic Albanian politicians who
hoped the Alliance would deliver a devastating air blow to
Milosevic's war machine. But by warning that the threat of attack
remains, NATO hopes to guarantee the safety of 300,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees who are terrified of returning home unless
government troops and Serb police are held back.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has postponed
a crucial Cabinet meeting that was to approve the U.S.-brokered
Israel-Palestinian peace agreement. The move could disrupt the
timetable of Israel's West Bank pullback. In a statement Tuesday
evening, Netanyahu blamed the delay on the Palestinians, saying
they failed to present a detailed plan for stopping extremist
attacks against Israel. However, Israeli media reported Wednesday
that Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet meeting because he is having
trouble assuring majority support. Several Cabinet ministers who
initially said they were undecided have announced in recent days
that they would vote against the agreement. The most vocal
opposition to Netanyahu comes from erstwhile supporters, Jewish
settlers who fear a troop pullback will endanger them and turn
several settlements into isolated enclaves in Palestinian areas.

	   LONDON _ Three British judges rule Wednesday on former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet's application to have his arrest on
charges of murder, torture and kidnapping declared illegal. Britain
has advised its citizens to avoid nonessential travel to Chile,
warning they could become targets of violence there in the wake of
the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet. British authorities arrested the 82-year-old Pinochet
Oct. 16 on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking his
extradition to face charges of murder, torture and kidnappings
during his 17-year rule. Prosecutors say Pinochet was responsible
for up to 4,000 murders and sent agents to Spain to ``seek out and
kill'' political opponents there. Lawyers for prosecutors and
Pinochet argued Monday and Tuesday that 82-year-old Pinochet
contended that the Spanish warrant was illegal both because former
heads of state cannot be prosecuted for actions committed in their
``official capacity'' and because he is not Spanish.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras _ Spreading fear across hundreds of miles
(kilometers) of the western Caribbean, Hurricane Mitch stalled just
off Honduras on Wednesday, blasting trees, ripping off roofs and
dumping torrents of rain that forced tens of thousands to flee. At
least 12 people were reported killed. At its peak Tuesday, Mitch
was the fourth strongest Caribbean hurricane in this century, with
180 mph (285 kph) winds. By Wednesday morning, the storm still
packed a devastating punch, but winds were down to 140 mph (220
kph). At 0600 GMT, Mitch was 35 miles (55 kilometers) north of the
Honduran coast _ about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of this
coastal city, according to the hurricane center. Hurricane-force
winds extended up to 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the center.
More deadly were downpours that flooded rivers in much of Central
America. (HURRICANE MITCH)
	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan Wednesday by its disgruntled captain, who
allegedly told authorities he did it because he was angered over
pay and working conditions. ``I feel relaxed,'' Yuan Bin said in a
brief exchange with reporters, after prosecutors questioned him at
the airport before taking him to court. ``I shall have no regret
whatever happens to me.'' Flight CA905 took off from Beijing FOR
the southern Chinese city of Kunming, but was diverted in the air
and arrived safely under military jet escort at Taiwan's main
international airport at 11:17 a.m. (0317 GMT). Yuan was
accompanied on the flight by his wife, who also was detained by
Taiwanese authorities. ``He was determined to come to Taiwan, live
or die,'' said Chang Kuo-cheng, director of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration. ``He said the company had treated him badly.''

EU Commission proposes ban on Portuguese beef because of mad cow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday to ban the export of beef from Portugal for nine months
and to ban the export of live cattle for at least 18 months from
the country.
	   EU spokesman Gerry Kiely said both bans could be lifted earlier
if there are clear signs that Portugal is doing more to monitor and
prevent the spread of mad cow disease.
	   Otherwise, the proposed ban on beef exports will automatically
expire after nine months and the proposed ban on cattle exports
will be reviewed after 18 months, Kiely added.
	   The two proposals by the EU executive Commission must be
endorsed by a majority of EU countries. An EU veterinary committee
is expected to vote on the issue Friday.
	   The EU sent two monitoring missions to Portugal this year. They
found that between May and October the number of cases of mad cow
disease had doubled, from 30 to almost 60.
	   ``The trend is bad,'' Kiely said. He said the number of cases of
mad cow disease - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - in Portugal
is now at 67. BSE in beef has been linked to a fatal brain ailment
in humans.
	   ``There is a higher, increasing incidence of BSE, as well as a
weakness in controls, protective measures,'' Kiely said.
	   The Commission claims Portugal was not enforcing an EU ban on
the use of the remains of bovine animals in feed for bovine
animals.
	   It has also said that Portugal was not enforcing EU rules on the
treatment of bovine animal remains used in feed for pigs and
poultry. BSE is believed to have spread in Europe through animal
feed.

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Castles, churches, old military barracks
and a hospital where former communist East German leader Erich
Honecker was a patient are up for sale this week at an
international convention on historic restoration.
	   In total, 555 real estate properties are for sale or rent,
according to organizers of the four-day convention that opened
Wednesday.
	   The oldest item on offer is a cloister in Saxony-Anhalt state
built between 1059 and 1093. The most expensive: an old U.S.
military barracks in Berlin, with a price tag of 30 million marks
(dlrs 18.75 million).
	   One of the most popular properties is the hospital and home for
the elderly in the town of Beelitz where the ousted Honecker was
treated for liver cancer before his exile to Chile in 1993.
	   ``There's a lot of interest in this one,'' said Juergen Kramp, a
convention official.
	   Potential buyers include local governments, private
organizations and investors with money to spend on restoring a
historic property. Lectures at the conference are focused more on
the nitty-gritty of restoration itself, with topics such as how to
clean old stone walls.

Storms cause widespread flooding, disruptions in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Heavy rains across much of Germany
closed rail lines, blocked roads and stranded farm animals in
flooded fields in some of the worst-hit areas Wednesday. At least
one storm-related death was reported.
	   Authorities said a truck driver was killed when a tree fell on
his cab in eastern Thuringia state.
	   Police in northern Schleswig-Holstein state, where the heaviest
rains fell, sent radio appeals to farmers to care for their
livestock after citizens clogged their lines with calls reporting
animals up to their necks in water.
	   The weight of the rain collapsed the roof of a supermarket roof
in the northern town of Itzehoe, causing 3 million to 4 million
marks (dlrs 1.8 million to 2.4 million) in damages. Roads in the
town were submerged under a meter (yard) of water.
	   Berlin has received more rain in the last 24 hours than is
normal for entire month of October. In Hamburg, the fire department
responded to some 200 calls to pump drains.
	   In central Germany, heavy rain and wind felled trees, disrupting
some power supplies.
	   Fallen trees also blocked roads and a rail line connecting small
towns and cities in Thuringia state. And the German Railway said
train service was disrupted between the eastern German cities of
Halle and Magdeburg, and Dresden and Leipzig.
	   The rising Fulda and Sieg rivers in Hesse and North
Rhine-Westphalia states passed the high water marks, but officials
said there was no immediate flood danger along Germany's major
Rhine and Main rivers, despite the arrival of a new storm system
Wednesday.

Japanese central bank decides to keep interest rates steady

 &UR; Eds: ADDS explanation of call money, 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Bank of Japan's chief policy-making board
announced Wednesday that it has left a key lending rate unchanged
at a record low.
	   A majority of the central bank's nine-member board, which meets
every two weeks, voted to keep the overnight call money rate at
around 0.25 percent, the BOJ said. The rate is what banks charge
each other for overnight lending without collateral.
	   Last month, the central bank guided the overnight call rate down
to that level from around 0.5 percent in an effort to prevent Japan
from falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   The move marked the first change in monetary policy since
September 1995, when the BOJ cut its official discount rate, the
rate at which it lends to commercial banks, to a record low 0.5
percent and led the overnight call rate slightly below that level.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian Airlines has began its
first scheduled flight from Addis Ababa to New York City, the
second American destination by the national carrier, an airline
official said Wednesday.
	   Bayu Tadesse, the airline's public relations officer, said the
inaugural flight for twice a week service, via Rome, left Tuesday
night.
	   Last June, the airline inaugurated a flight to Washington D.C.,
also via Rome. The new service means the flight to Washington would
include New York City.
	   Addis Ababa is the seat of the U.N. Economic Commission for
Africa and the Organization of African Unity and there is regular
traffic of officials of Western bilateral and multilateral
political and economic organizations.
	   Last Sunday, the airline resumed twice a week flights to Beirut,
Lebanon, via Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
	   The flights were suspended in 1996 after Ethiopia accused
Sudanese intelligence of participating in the attempted
assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.

	   ZANZIBAR, Tanzania (AP) _ Cholera, which killed 200 people
between last December and March this year in Zanzibar, has
resurfaced, the government-owned Daily News newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   It said 13 victims of the intestinal disease have been admitted
to two government hospitals, one of them designated as a camp for
cholera victims.
	   The newspaper said journalists were barred by medical
authorities from interviewing the patients but quoted unidentified
nurses as saying they had enough medicine.
	   At the height of the outbreak last December, 60 people died of
the disease and 400 were hospitalized in the islands. The disease
is spread through infected water and food.
	   The World Health Organization said 2,600 people died and 61,534
were hospitalized in eastern Africa during the cholera outbreak
from last December and early this year.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At least 36 people were killed and several
others injured when attackers struck at a village in northeastern
Kenya, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The attackers struck on Sunday in Bagala region about 200
kilometers west of Wajir, the East African Standard said. Wajir,
the main town in Northeastern Province, is 500 kilometers northeast
of Nairobi.
	   District police spokesman Polycarp Etyang confirmed the report
of the attack but said the number of dead was not yet determined.
	   The daily said local leaders claimed the attack was the work of
the Oromo Liberation Front, an Ethiopian rebel group.
	   The local leaders claim the fighters were hired by members of
the Borana community to intimidate and kill members of the rival
Degodia clan.
	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Police reported a total of 504 killings
of adults in Zimbabwe in the first eight months of this year, the
state Central Statistical Office said.
	   In a statistical review Wednesday, the office said in the same
period there were 608 culpable homicide cases and 136 child
killings.
	   The review said the death toll was ``relatively low'' in a
nation of 12.5 million people though police reported sharp
increases in non-violent and petty crimes as economic hardships
worsened.
	   Most of the slayings were committed with knives or farm tools,
with men as the main victims. Women jilted by lovers committed most
infanticide cases.
	   Weapons are not easily available in Zimbabwe, though armed
crimes have increased in areas bordering Mozambique and South
Africa, sources of guns.
	   The statistics office said most of those killings this year were
the result of disputes between family members or couples who
accused each other of infidelity.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The Swedish king, Carl Gustaf XVI, and
Queen Silvia are to visit Mozambique in early November to observe
recent political and economic progress.
	   Mozambique suffered much destruction in the long years of civil
war that ended in 1992.
	   Friendly relations between Mozambique and Sweden date back to
when the Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo) was fighting the
Portuguese colonial power in the 1960s and 1970s.
	   Swedish politicians gave Frelimo political and moral support.
	   The Swedish Foreign Ministry says that Mozambique is the largest
single recipient of Swedish aid, which reached 410 million crowns
(dlrs 53 million) in 1997.
	   The figure is expected to reach 470 million crowns in 1998.
	   Swedish cooperation with Mozambique covers education, roads,
agriculture, energy, culture, public administration, and now also
includes support for private economic activity.

New German leader to visit Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, will visit Poland on Nov. 5 to meet its leaders,
officials announced Wednesday.
	   Schroeder scheduled talks in Warsaw with President Aleksander
Kwasniewski and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.
	   Schroeder's swift trip to the nation's biggest eastern neighbor
is intended to show the importance of German-Polish ties, which
have only recently recovered from decades of enmity over World War
II. Poland is Germany's biggest business partner in eastern Europe
and in line to join NATO and the European Union.
	   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who handed over power to
Schroeder on Tuesday, had stressed the relationship with Poland in
his drive for European unity.
	   Before his Poland trip, Schroeder is meeting British Prime
Minister Tony Blair in London on Monday. He expects to visit Moscow
later next month.
	   Germany's new foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, will meet with
the Polish leaders as well as his counterpart, Bronislaw Geremek,
on Thursday.

Westwood nurses rib injury into European finale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Tiger Woods may have ruined Lee Westwood's
bid to win the European money title.
	   Westwood, 25, trails Colin Montgomerie by 45,265 pounds (dlrs
76,045) going into Thursday's season-ending Volvo Masters _ the
richest four days in European golf.
	   Two weeks ago in the World Match Play Championship, Westwood
tried to out-hit Woods _ the game's biggest hitter _ in a match
Woods eventually won 5 and 4.
	   The Englishman tore a muscle on his right side in the attempt
and will wear a corset-like garment as he plays the par-72,
7,058-yard Montecastillo layout in southern Spain.
	   ``I decided to go after one on the 12th,'' Westwood said. ``I
thought it might be nice to be only 60 yards behind him (Woods)
instead of 100. But I felt the muscle go there and then.''
	   Westwood said he left the injury untreated until early this
week, hoping it would disappear.
	   ``I tried to forget it,'' he said. ``I suppose I'm young and
reckless and thought a few days' rest would cure it.''
	   Going into the final event, Montgomerie leads the PGA European
Tour money list with winnings of 760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929). Westwood
is No. 2 at 714,812 (dlrs 1,200,884) followed by Darren Clarke of
Northern Ireland at 616,867 (dlrs 1,036,337).
	   Montgomerie, 35, has won an unprecedented five consecutive money
titles and a sixth would once again confirm him as Europe's top
player.
	   This season-ending tournament is two events in one.
	   The winner of the tournament picks up 166,000 pounds (dlrs
278,880). In addition, there is a bonus payout for the top 15
finishers on the European money list _ beginning with 170,000
pounds (dlrs 285,600) for No. 1, 120,000 (dlrs 201,600) for No. 2
and so on.
	   If Montgomerie or Westwood win the final event, they would also
claim the overall money title.
	   For Clarke to top the money list, he must win the tournament and
hope that Westwood finishes no better than third and Montgomerie no
higher than ninth.
	   Montgomerie, Westwood or Clarke could all break the European
Tour season money record of 875,146 pounds (dlrs 1,470,245) set by
Montgomerie in 1996.

	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan Wednesday by its disgruntled captain, who
allegedly told authorities he did it because he was angered over
pay and working conditions.
	   ``I feel relaxed,'' Yuan Bin said in a brief exchange with
reporters, after prosecutors questioned him at the airport before
taking him to court. ``I shall have no regret whatever happens to
me.''
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing FOR the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but was diverted in the air and arrived safely under
military jet escort at Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17
a.m. (0317 GMT).
	   Yuan, 30, was accompanied on the flight by his wife, identified
as Xu Mei, 27. She also was detained by Taiwanese authorities, who
were not immediately sure whether to consider her a suspect.
	   ``He was determined to come to Taiwan, live or die,'' Chang
Kuo-cheng, director of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, told a
news conference. ``He said the company had treated him badly.''
	   Yuan's co-pilot, Wen Fei, did not try to physically stop the
captain, for fear a fight in the cockpit could endanger the
passengers, Chang said.
	   Nobody was hurt and the Boeing 737's two other pilots were
allowed to take off from Taiwan six hours later, flying 94
remaining passengers and six crew members back to China. China's
Xinhua News Agency said 20 foreigners were aboard, but it did not
give their nationalities.
	   The plane finally landed in Xiamen, in China's southeastern
Fujian province, according to Hong Kong officials who had been
monitoring its progress.
	   Taiwan Television showed the captain in his uniform white shirt,
carrying a suitcase as he was led out of the plane by policemen in
helmets and bulletproof vests. His wife was shown in a black coat.
	   Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said Yuan admitted he diverted
the jet to Taiwan because he was displeased with Air China's
policies and his pay. It was not immediately clear what Yuan hoped
to accomplish.
	   ``There was no political motive,'' Huang said.
	   Chang said Yuan would face trial in Taiwan, although no
information on the precise charges was immediately released.
	   The flight by Air China, the main airline run by the Civil
Aviation Administration of China, was scheduled originally to stop
in Kunming, then continue to Yangon, Myanmar, Chang said.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew condemned Wednesday's
incident.
	   ``We've never agreed to such deeds,'' he told reporters _
although Taiwan in recent memory used to shower hijackers from
mainland China with gold and cash rewards. Taiwan began cracking
down on the hijackers after longstanding tensions with the mainland
began easing in the 1980s.
	   The 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed for
up to 12 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to China.
	   China has demanded that Taiwan send all the hijackers back. The
two sides were near reaching an agreement about repatriation in
1995 when China broke off the talks in anger over a Taiwanese drive
to gain diplomatic recognition.
	   In recent months, the two sides have slowly approached each
other to restore the long-stalled dialogue.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Spreading fear across the western
Caribbean on Wednesday, one of the century's most powerful
hurricanes forced tens of thousands to flee, dumped torrents of
rain, blasted down trees and damaged homes. At least 12 people were
reported killed.
	   Hurricane Mitch hovered Wednesday morning just off the coast of
Honduras, bringing downpours that caused rivers to flood across
Honduras, Belize and elsewhere in Central America.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said as much as 20
inches (50 centimeters) of rain could fall on mountain areas.
	   More than 45,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
low-lying areas of Honduras, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel,
chief of the National Emergency Committee. Many towns were cut off
by some 50 flooded rivers.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts like Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on pumping
oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 people in Belize City
fled inland in cars and government buses.
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180 mph (290 kph) winds.
	   By 4 a.m. EST (0900 GMT) Wednesday, the 350-mile (560-kilometer)
wide storm still packed a devastating punch, but its winds were
down to 135 mph (215 kph). It was centered 30 miles (50 kilometers)
north of the Honduran coast, according to the hurricane center.
	   Port officials at Chetumal, Mexico, said a wave kicked up by
Hurricane Mitch washed a Connecticut man off a catamaran south of
Cancun on Monday and he was presumed dead. He was identified
Tuesday as Robert Gates, 55, of Niantic.
	   Honduras reported three deaths from Mitch _ one in a collapsed
house and two men electrocuted when they were blown off a roof.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains.
	   On Tuesday, Mitch blasted the Honduran island of Guanaja, 75
miles (120 kilometers) northeast of here, ripping the metal roofing
off hundreds of houses and knocking out power and telephones. Many
residents took shelter on larger nearby islands.
	   ``It's raining hard and the winds are very strong,'' said Marta
Ondina, a worker at the Hong Kong restaurant on Roatan, an island a
few miles (kilometers) west of Guanaja.
	   ``They have taken people from the shore to churches and more
secure places,'' she said by telephone. ``The people are very
worried. There is no power.''
	   The weather service said ham radio reports indicated extensive
damage on Guanaja and Roatan.
	   Mitch appeared nearly stalled early Wednesday over Guanaja,
moving very slowing toward Honduras' coast. The hurricane center
said it was expected to head west later in the day, but the storm's
slow pace made its movements unpredictable.
	   Waves crashed against the walls of seafront discos in La Cieba
on Tuesday and people waded through knee-deep water with furniture
on their backs to flee flooded houses.
	   Fireman Tomas Hayden said officials had banned private cars in
La Ceiba, a city of 40,000, to ease emergency rescue work.
	   With gasoline stations running dry, the government of
neighboring Belize commandeered private buses to help people move
inland from coastal Belize City, which was almost destroyed by
Hurricane Hattie in 1961.
	   Early Tuesday, Mitch passed directly over Honduras' tiny Swan
Islands, used in the 1960s as a base for CIA radio broadcasts to
Cuba. The military base lost its roof but the five soldiers posted
there were unhurt because they hid in nearby caves.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   In the Mexican resort of Cancun, 375 miles (600 kilometers)
north of here, tourists formed long lines at the airport Tuesday
trying to leave before the storm's arrival.
	   But as Mitch veered south, Cancun Mayor Rafael Lara Lara
canceled the city's emergency alert. State officials earlier had
evacuated several thousand people from coastal zones further south,
near the Belize border.

EU Commission proposes ban on Portuguese beef because of mad cow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Azores Islands being excluded from the ban &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday to ban the export of beef from Portugal for nine months
and to ban the export of live cattle for at least 18 months from
the country.
	   EU spokesman Gerry Kiely said the proposed ban on beef exports
will automatically expire after nine months unless there is still
evidence of meat safety problems in Portugal.
	   The proposed ban on cattle exports will be reviewed after 18
months, Kiely added.
	   The two proposals by the EU executive Commission must be
endorsed by a majority of EU countries. An EU veterinary committee
is expected to vote on the issue Friday.
	   The two proposals do not affect exports from Portugal's Azores
Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean, Kiely said.
	   The EU sent two monitoring missions to Portugal this year. They
found that between May and October the number of cases of mad cow
disease had doubled, from 30 to almost 60.
	   ``The trend is bad,'' Kiely said. He said the number of cases of
mad cow disease - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - in Portugal
is now at 67. BSE in beef has been linked to a fatal brain ailment
in humans.
	   ``There is a higher, increasing incidence of BSE, as well as a
weakness in controls, protective measures,'' Kiely said.
	   The Commission claims Portugal was not enforcing an EU ban on
the use of the remains of bovine animals in feed for bovine
animals.
	   It has also said that Portugal was not enforcing EU rules on the
treatment of bovine animal remains used in feed for pigs and
poultry. BSE is believed to have spread in Europe through animal
feed.

Protection increased for Netanyahu as protests grow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Security around Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was tightened Wednesday in response to calls by Jewish
extremists to ``take down'' the leader following his agreement to
hand West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   In a front-page photo, the daily Maariv showed Netanyahu
surrounded by six bodyguards as he walked into parliament, one of
the most secure buildings in Israel.
	   Netanyahu has said he was aware of the possible dangers, but
that he tried to ignore them when making decisions. ``The minute
leaders ... make their policies based on personal risk of any kind,
they are completely immobilized,'' he told CNN earlier this week.
	   The prime minister also said he felt that the Islamic militant
group Hamas posed more of a threat to his safety than Jewish
extremists. He said Hamas had put a price on his head.
	   Israeli police began investigating two ultranationalist Jews,
Noam Federman and Rabbi Moshe Levinger, on suspicion they incited
to violence against the prime minister.
	   Delivering a eulogy Tuesday for a Jewish settler killed by
Palestinian militants in the West Bank town of Hebron, Federman
held Netanyahu and his land-for-peace policy responsible.
	   ``We need to take down a man like this,'' Federman told the
mourners of Danny Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron.
	   As part of the new security arrangement, Netanyahu has been
asked by the Shin Bet security service to stay away from large
crowds, Israeli radio stations said.
	   From now on, Netanyahu will travel in helicopters when visiting
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a major road near his home may be
closed to restrict access, the reports sad.
	   Netanyahu's office would not comment on the security
arrangements.
	   Concern in Israel over renewed political violence grew after
hundreds of Jewish settlers gathered outside Netanyahu's home on
Monday evening, several hours after the slaying of Vargas.
	   Some in the crowd chanted ``traitor, traitor.''
	   Demonstrators also held up a large drawing showing Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shake blood-stained hands.
	   The protests came as Israelis prepared for the third anniversary
of the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist Jews. The assailant, Yigal Amir, said he killed
the prime minister because he wanted to stop the handover of land.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 8,000 students demonstrated
outside Indonesia's Parliament Wednesday in the biggest protest in
the capital since violent unrest forced former President Suharto to
quit in May.
	   The protesters, from dozens of colleges, marched from two
directions toward the legislature, demanding that Suharto's
successor, President B.J. Habibie, quit over continuing political
turmoil and the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Stopped by about 1,000 riot police and troops, they staged a
sit-in, blocking an adjacent toll road that leads to Jakarta's main
airport and causing rush-hour traffic chaos before dispersing
peacefully.
	   The students urged the government to abandon plans to convene a
special session of the People's Consultative Assembly, which is to
cast guidelines next month for elections in 1999.
	   Student leaders claim the assembly won't push for real change
and threatened to organized bigger protests, raising the specter of
more political instability despite a government warning that 30,000
security personnel will protect the assembly.
	   Earlier, in a speech in West Java province just outside Jakarta,
Habibie called on Indonesians to support the assembly's aim of
bringing reform for all layers of society.
	   Wednesday's demonstration, held on National Youth Day, was
noisy, but peaceful. Some protesters tore down part of a fence on
the toll road.
	   Water cannon trucks and police horses were on standby within the
parliamentary grounds, but there were no reports of arrests or
injuries.
	   Legislators and other government-appointed delegates will gather
at the Parliament building in Jakarta on Nov. 10 to shape electoral
laws in one of Indonesia's most critical steps toward democracy.
	   However, student activists said most of the assembly's members
are holdovers from Suharto's authoritarian era and have no desire
to end rampant corruption or to deliver true democracy.
	   Habibie, a close friend and a former ally of Suharto, has
pledged to open up the political system.
	   However, critics say he is moving too slowly or is trying to
reshape the political landscape so he retain power when a president
is elected next year.
	   ``There is no chance for Habibie to create a good and clean
government. He has to quit,'' said a former political prisoner and
politician, Sri Bintang Pamungkas.
	   The protesters raised banners demanding that Suharto, who is
accused of siphoning off state wealth for his family's benefit, be
put on trial for corruption. The 77-year-old former leader has
denied any wrongdoing.
	   More than 1,200 people died when protests and riots swept
Jakarta in May before Suharto stepped down. At the height of that
unrest, thousands of students occupied and vandalized the
Parliament building for days before being evicted by security
forces.
	   Hundreds of supporters of Habibie's main rival, opposition
figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, gathered at a University of Indonesia
campus Wednesday for a similar demonstration.
	   On the tourist island of Bali, at least 100,000 Hindus staged a
peaceful and colorful protest demanding the resignation of a Muslim
Cabinet minister they accuse of insulting their religion, witnesses
said.
	   Media reports have quoted Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin as saying
Megawati should not be elected president of predominantly Muslim
Indonesia because she is a ``Hindu.''
	   Megawati is the popular daughter of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno. She is, in fact, a Muslim, although her
grandmother was from Hindu Bali.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Marking the 80th anniversary of
the founding of Czechoslovakia, Prime Minister Milos Zeman called
Wednesday on Czechs to cultivate their culture and maintain their
self-esteem.
	   Speaking to an assembly in the National Museum in Prague, Zeman
said that many Czechs were willing to show support for Nazi Germany
during the World War II occupation and the Soviet domination in the
post-war years because it was easier than resistance.
	   He warned against self-indulgence that could lead to the loss of
national culture.
	   ``It is easy to get rid of our national culture and adopt a
culture of hamburgers and stupid television series,'' Zeman said in
a nationally televised address.
	   ``Let's make an effort that this nation keep its self-esteem and
pride, stemming from its history, that it become a dignified
partner to other nations,'' Zeman said.
	   He praised Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, Czechoslovakia's first
president, for his efforts to liberate Czechs from the
Austro-Hungarian empire 80 years ago.
	   ``At 65, when most people retire, Masaryk left for exile to
fight for the independence of his nation,'' Zeman said.
	   Before the foundation of Czechoslovakia on Oct. 28, 1918, Czechs
and Slovaks were part of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   Three years after the collapse of communism in late 1989, the
Slovak desire for independence prevailed over decades of common
history and Czechoslovakia split in two independent states on Jan.
1, 1993.
	   Unlike the Czech Republic, Slovakia does not mark Oct. 28 as a
national holiday.
	   The celebrations are to continue later in the day, when
President Vaclav Havel is scheduled to award more than 80 state
orders at the Prague Castle.

Mayor arrested over strange church occurrences
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The mayor of a small town in eastern France has
been arrested after townspeople reported exploding vases and flying
candlesticks in a church, radio reported Wednesday.
	   Delain Mayor Thierry Marceaux was detained Tuesday and was to go
before a court on allegations he was behind the mysterious
occurrences, Europe 1 radio reported.
	   About 50 people said they saw the strange events earlier this
month as townspeople were re-arranging the church for an orchestra
concert, which some thought had angered the spirits there.
	   Moving the altar a few inches seemed to trigger the flotation
and explosion of holy objects, witnesses said.
	   An exorcist was even called in to try to figure out the
goings-on.
	   ``Believe me, I'm not someone who's really interested in the
supernatural,'' Marceaux told The Associated Press last week. ``But
when you see it in front of you ...''
	   Marceaux had said young pranksters ``would have to be pretty
talented'' if they had pulled off a Halloween prank.

Priest to be defrocked for affair with strip tease dancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Greek Orthodox priest who left his
family for a Romanian strip-tease dancer ``will definitely be
defrocked,'' the head of the Cypriot church, Archbishop
Chrysostomos, said Wednesday.
	   The archbishop said the Holy Synod of the Cyprus Church will
punish the priest and a colleague who were photographed leaving a
brothel in black cassocks. The synod is to meet Thursday.
	   The affair is the latest scandal to hit the church following
allegations that its bishop of Limassol was involved in fraud
running to millions of dollars.
	   When a television channel broadcast last week a photograph of
two bearded priests leaving a brothel in the western town of
Paphos, it provoked an uproar in the press and calls for discipline
in the church.
	   A church investigation revealed the photograph had been taken
several months ago when one of the two priests, Father Papayiannis
of Chandria, was visiting his girlfriend, a Romanian strip tease
dancer.
	   Papayiannis had left his wife and four children for the
stripper. He has since returned to his family.
	   ``It is certain that Papayiannis will be defrocked by the Holy
Synod when it meets tomorrow, particularly since there are other
charges outstanding against him,'' Archbishop Chrysostomos told
reporters.
	   He said the second priest in the photograph would be
reprimanded.
	   The second priest has claimed he went to a little hotel to pick
up Papayiannis and drive back to their village with him.
	   The Holy Synod is also expected to consider a report by a
committee of three bishops who have investigated the fraud
allegations against Bishop Chrysanthos of Limassol.
	   The police are also investigating the fraud case.

Thousands of Bali Hindus protest against Muslim Cabinet minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 100,000 Hindus on the
Indonesian tourist island of Bali staged a peaceful protest
Wednesday, demanding the resignation of a Muslim Cabinet minister
they accuse of insulting their religion, witnesses said.
	   Thousands, many in colorful traditional costumes, marched down
the main street of Bali's provincial capital, Denpasar, and staged
a rally at the city's Niti Mandala Renon field.
	   Speakers at the gathering, which also included Christians,
Buddhists and Muslims, urged Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to
fire Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin.
	   Some local media claimed as many as 250,000 people took part in
the day of protest.
	   Media reports have quoted Saefuddin as saying opposition faction
leader Megawati Sukarnoputri should not be elected president of
predominantly Muslim Indonesia because she is a ``Hindu.''
	   The comments triggered outrage among Hindus, particularly those
on economically important Bali.
	   Some Hindus there have threatened to stage a mass strike unless
Habibie fires Saefuddin within one month. They also want the
minister prosecuted.
	   Megawati, one of Habibie's main political rivals, is the popular
daughter of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno. She is, in
fact, a Muslim, although her grandmother was Balinese.
	   Earlier this month, Saefuddin downplayed Megawati's chances of
being elected president when he reportedly asked: ``Are the
Indonesian people willing to have a Hindu president?''
	   He later apologized, saying he had no intention of insulting any
religion.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. Religious
tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy and constitution.
	   Indonesia plans to stage parliamentary elections in May under
promised democratic reforms. Legislators will then select a new
president. Saefuddin, Megawati and Habibie, who is also Muslim, are
among those expected to stand for the presidency.
	   Wednesday's protest on Bali coincided with a big student
demonstration against Habibie outside the Parliament in the
national capital, Jakarta, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) to
the west.

Yeltsin stays in rest home for ``regular'' open-ended treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top four grafs with Kremlin spokesman saying that
Yeltsin is undergoing a regular course of recuperative treatment.
TRIMS thereafter. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin underwent ``a regular
course of treatment'' Wednesday at a government rest house where he
is recovering from exhaustion and high blood pressure, his
spokesman said.
	   Dmitry Yakushkin did not indicate how long Yeltsin would stay at
the sanitarium, or elaborate on the Russian leader's condition. Nor
did he say what kind of treatment Yeltsin was receiving in his
comments to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yeltsin entered the Barvikha sanitarium on Tuesday, the day
after doctors ordered him to cancel a one-day trip to Austria. He
has stayed at the center several times before, often for weeks at a
time.
	   Yakushkin said the team of doctors treating Yeltsin did not meet
Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss his condition. The sanitarium has
extensive medical facilities, but it is not a hospital.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has played only a marginal role in dealing with
Russia's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the country
is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has
been in office less than two months.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at a European Union.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has put in few full days at the Kremlin since the
spring, and now his doctors say he must rest to recover from
extreme fatigue and high blood pressure.
	   Yeltsin did not look visibly ill in television footage of him
meeting with Primakov on Tuesday, before the president moved to the
sanitarium.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, an American cardiologist who consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after his 1996 heart bypass surgery,
predicted Tuesday it would take Yeltsin at least a week to bounce
back.
	   But ``he'll recover from all this and he'll be back at work,''
DeBakey told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   DeBakey was quoted Wednesday as telling the Komsomolskaya Pravda
newspaper that Yeltsin's unstable blood pressure was not a serious
problem. He said that Russian heart surgeon Renat Akchurin, who
performed Yeltsin's quintuple bypass surgery, is no longer on the
team of doctors monitoring the president because his expertise is
not needed.
	   Despite reassurances by the president and his doctors that
Yeltsin has no crippling illness and will serve out his term, which
lasts until the middle of 2000, few in Russia believe that Yeltsin
will ever again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was
during his early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996
presidential elections, said Tuesday that Yeltsin's aides were
``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president wasn't seriously
ill.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the
results to be made public.
	   Yeltsin's aides have often provided only partial information
about Yeltsin's ailments, contributing to a general mood of
skepticism and speculation that his condition is worse than
announced.
	   Yeltsin postponed a meeting with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman scheduled for next week in Moscow, Tudjman's spokesman said
Tuesday. Yeltsin has also put off a trip to Malaysia next month,
though his aides insist he will still go to India in December.
	   Yeltsin's press service on Wednesday denied speculation that a
Nov. 10-13 visit by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would be
canceled or postponed. A Russian envoy flew to Tokyo on Wednesday
to continue preparations for the visit.

Truth Commission spares de Klerk in final report on apartheid
</HEADLINE>

spokesman's comments; picks up
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel investigating
apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate the
last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abuses
after he filed a court challenge.
	   De Klerk sued to block the long-awaited final report of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release
Thursday.
	   The man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a
finding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation.
	   Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said
the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,
and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid
delaying its release.
	   ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been
engaged in a vendetta against him.
	   ``But we must and will respect the courts and his rights under
the constitution. We fought hard for those rights and we can be
proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares in them,'' he
said in a statement.
	   A court hearing was scheduled for March 4.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appear
after all the hoo-ha has died down.''
	   De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment before
speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts.
	   ``In effect, he has achieved his primary purpose,'' said de
Klerk's spokesman, Dave Steward, in Cape Town.

EU to keep pressure on Myanmar despite meeting compromise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The European Union has agreed to allow
Myanmar to join in an upcoming meeting with Southeast Asian
countries but will continue to push its military government to
improve its human rights record, an EU official said Wednesday.
	   The decision to allow Myanmar a presence at the Joint Committee
meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations was made
Monday by the EU general affairs council in Luxembourg.
	   Activities between the two regional groupings have been made
difficult by the EU's refusal to include Myanmar, which joined
ASEAN last year.
	   Meanwhile, the EU council toughened its stance on Myanmar's
military government by extending a visa ban to include transit
visas for members of the country's ruling junta and their families.
	   The visa ban was also extended to include officials in the
tourism sector, according to an EU press statement, which said the
move was a consequence of the Myanmar government's failure to
respond to repeated calls to move toward the promotion of democracy
and human rights.
	   It said that under these circumstances, the EU will continue to
resist letting Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ accede to the
ASEAN-EU Agreement governing cooperation between the two regional
bodies.
	   The move to allow Myanmar to take part in the next meeting _ due
before the end of the year in Bangkok _ was based on a formula from
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan. He proposed that the meeting
be treated as one between two regional groupings, rather than
individual countries, said an EU spokesman in Bangkok.
	   There will be no Myanmar flag at the meeting as all the
participating countries will unite under the banners of the EU or
ASEAN, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The move will not set a precedent and the two sides will
consider Myanmar's participation in any other events on a
case-by-case basis, he said.
	   Myanmar must be complimented for its ``flexibility, sacrifice
and understanding'' in accepting the arrangement, said a press
statement from the Thai Foreign Ministry received Wednesday.
	   It said it also appreciated that the ``EU has given importance
to the EU-ASEAN relationship.''

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Spreading fear across the western
Caribbean Tuesday, one of the century's most powerful hurricanes
forced tens of thousands to flee, dumped torrents of rain, mowed
down trees and damaged homes. At least 12 people were reported
killed.
	   Hurricane Mitch hovered 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the coast
of Honduras on Wednesday morning, its downpours causing rivers to
flood across Honduras, Belize and elsewhere in Central America.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said up to 20 inches
(50 centimeters) of rain could fall on mountain areas.
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180 mph (290 kph) winds. By 7 a.m.
EST (1100 GMT) Wednesday, the 350-mile (565-kilometer) wide storm
still packed a punch, but its winds were down to 120 mph (190 kph),
with higher gusts.
	   More than 45,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
low-lying areas of Honduras, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel,
chief of the National Emergency Committee. Many towns were cut off
by some 50 flooded rivers.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts like Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on pumping
oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Belize, most of the 75,000 people in Belize City fled inland
in cars and government buses.

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian negotiator saying the security plan
will be presented to the Americans &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time next week, officials said Wednesday.
	   As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon earlier this week.
	   ``All sides must begin implementation next Monday night,'' said
Larry Schwartz, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of a
delay when he announced Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely
postponing a Cabinet meeting that was to have approved the deal.
	   Netanyahu insisted Wednesday that he needed Cabinet backing and
that he would not start the pullback until he did.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   However, U.S. officials and Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Cabinet approval was not a prerequisite for
Netanyahu to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's office said in a statement the Cabinet meeting was
postponed because the Palestinians had not yet submitted a detailed
security plan to the United States as they had promised.
	   However, Israeli media said the main reason for the delay was
Netanyahu's concern that he would not get a majority in his Cabinet
for the troop withdrawal.
	   Several Israeli Cabinet ministers who initially said they were
undecided have announced in recent days that they would vote
against the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians were
aware of Monday's deadline and would present their security plan to
the Americans by then. He said the presentation would be verbal,
not in writing.

Asian Games organizers promise most sophisticated drug testing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The upcoming Asian Games will be the
first major sporting event to use a sophisticated new technology to
test athletes for drugs, a spokesman for the organizers said
Wednesday.
	   The games' doping control center will use a carbon isotope ratio
mass spectrometer, said Torpong Sewatarmra.
	   The high-tech apparatus was tested at the Winter Olympics in
Japan, said a news release from the Bangkok Games Organizing
Committee.
	   ``This is the most sophisticated instrument to test athletes for
drugs,'' said Torpong. ``The technology has the ability to detect
forbidden drugs even at a very low quantity.''
	   Despite the high cost of such equipment, the organizing
committee believes it will help make the games fair and clean for
all participants, the news release quoted Ruangsak Siripol, the
committee's chairman, as saying.
	   A list of forbidden substances will be given to the heads of all
43 participating national teams and they will be reminded not to
let athletes use medications containing banned substances, it
added.
	   Earlier this month, Thailand began random drug tests on its own

Yeltsin stays in rest home for ``regular'' open-ended treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Yakushkin saying Yeltsin
mostly resting. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin rested and underwent ``a
regular course of treatment'' Wednesday at a government rest house
where he is recovering from exhaustion and high blood pressure, his
spokesman said.
	   Dmitry Yakushkin did not indicate how long Yeltsin would stay at
the sanitarium, or elaborate on the Russian leader's condition. Nor
did he say what kind of treatment Yeltsin was receiving.
	   Yeltsin entered the Barvikha sanitarium on Tuesday, the day
after doctors ordered him to cancel a one-day trip to Austria. He
has stayed at the center several times before, often for weeks at a
time.
	   Yakushkin said the team of doctors treating Yeltsin did not meet
Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss his condition. The sanitarium has
extensive medical facilities, but it is not a hospital.
	   In comments to Russian news agencies, Yakushkin said that
Yeltsin was taking walks, but most of the time he was resting.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has played only a marginal role in dealing with
Russia's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the country
is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has
been in office less than two months.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at a European Union.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has put in few full days at the Kremlin since the
spring, and now his doctors say he must rest to recover from
extreme fatigue and high blood pressure.
	   Yeltsin did not look visibly ill in television footage of him
meeting with Primakov on Tuesday, before the president moved to the
sanitarium.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, an American cardiologist who consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after his 1996 heart bypass surgery,
predicted Tuesday it would take Yeltsin at least a week to bounce
back.
	   But ``he'll recover from all this and he'll be back at work,''
DeBakey told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   DeBakey was quoted Wednesday as telling the Komsomolskaya Pravda
newspaper that Yeltsin's unstable blood pressure was not a serious
problem. He said that Russian heart surgeon Renat Akchurin, who
performed Yeltsin's quintuple bypass surgery, is no longer on the
team of doctors monitoring the president because his expertise is
not needed.
	   Despite reassurances by the president and his doctors that
Yeltsin has no crippling illness and will serve out his term, which
lasts until the middle of 2000, few in Russia believe that Yeltsin
will ever again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was
during his early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996
presidential elections, said Tuesday that Yeltsin's aides were
``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president wasn't seriously
ill.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the
results to be made public.
	   Yeltsin's aides have often provided only partial information
about Yeltsin's ailments, contributing to a general mood of
skepticism and speculation that his condition is worse than
announced.
	   Yeltsin postponed a meeting with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman scheduled for next week in Moscow, Tudjman's spokesman said
Tuesday. Yeltsin has also put off a trip to Malaysia next month,
though his aides insist he will still go to India in December.
	   Yeltsin's press service on Wednesday denied speculation that a
Nov. 10-13 visit by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would be
canceled or postponed. A Russian envoy flew to Tokyo on Wednesday
to continue preparations for the visit.

Last colonial governor has low-key return to Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The territory's last British colonial governor,
Chris Patten, returned to Hong Kong Wednesday for the first time
since the 1997 handover to China, and dismissed suggestions he was
to blame for the recession that set in not long after he left.
	   Patten said there were ``inhibitions on the amount of innovation
that one could show in policy-making,'' as he started a four-day
visit that was low-key and in stark contrast to the emotions that
surrounded Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1,
1997.
	   Patten is busy touting a new book, ``East and West,'' which has
drawn sharp criticism from pro-Beijing parties in Hong Kong. He
told a news conference that he is at ``home'' in Hong Kong and
coming back was ``the most exciting thing I've done since I left.''
	   Unlike Patten's departure, Wednesday's arrival had little
fanfare.
	   No senior officials greeted him at the airport. Even his former
political allies, some of whom he would be meeting, have appeared
aloof.
	   Patten had a turbulent relationship with Chinese Communist
leaders for much of his five years in Hong Kong, mostly over his
uncompromising push for more democracy by opening up the
legislature to freer elections.
	   Patten said his experience in Hong Kong had made him ``more
passionate about liberal values,'' but he praised Hong Kong and
Beijing for their efforts in preserving civil liberties.
	   ``Hong Kong is still a free society under the rule of law.
People of Hong Kong have shown considerable self-confidence in the
past 15 months in standing up for freedom and for common decency,''
he said.
	   He said China ``deserves credit for standing back and giving
Hong Kong breathing space to get on with its own life.''
	   Patten will meet with Beijing's handpicked chief executive, Tung
Chee-hwa, a former shipping magnate and a political conservative,
who was one of his close advisers.
	   Many Hong Kong people have said they thought Patten could have
done a better job than Tung in handling the territory's economy,
which has spiraled into recession with the rest of Asia.
	   Patten refused to comment on the leadership of Tung, whose
popularity has slid considerably along with Hong Kong's economic
fortunes. Patten also declined to offer any advice on how Tung
should run Hong Kong.
	   On a lighter note, Patten, affectionately dubbed ``Fat Pang''
for his passion for food, said he would visit his favorite
restaurants and bakeries for egg tarts, a Chinese dessert, between
book signings, speeches and meetings.
	   Patten was harsh in his book, criticizing the United States and
European nations for turning a blind eye on China's human rights
abuse so as to gain warmer trade ties with the vast country.
	   He called China ``the last evil empire ... rapidly becoming a
threat to world peace as well as an affront to our civilized
conscience and an unfair competitor in global markets.''
	   Patten was shunned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch's publishing
house Harper Collins, which dropped the book, reportedly out of
fear of upsetting Beijing. At least one local bookstore also
dropped a scheduled book signing.
	   A recent commentary in the China Daily, the Communists'
mouthpiece, called Patten's book ``a portrait of a narrow-minded,
retired politician who vents his spleen over those who opposed his
perverse actions.''

Basque party warns of split with government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's minority
government was weakened Wednesday as a Basque party said it would
no longer guarantee its support in the national parliament.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party said it could no longer be
considered an associate of the Aznar's governing Popular Party and
gave a taste of what that meant by opposing the government in a
preliminary vote on next year's budget draft.
	   Aznar's party won 156 seats in the 350-seat parliament in 1996
and formed a minority government with the support from regional
parties such as the Basques, who have six seats, a Catalan party
which has 16 and a Canary Island group with four.
	   The government will now be more heavily reliant on both the
Catalan coalition, Convergence and Union and the Canary Coalition
to remain in office. For the moment, the votes of both groups
ensure passage for the budget.
	   The government ``has lost our support and things in parliament
could get complicated for it,'' said Inaki Anasagasti, a spokesman
for the Basque party.
	   The rupture stems from disagreements and mudslinging between
Aznar's party and the nationalists in the run-up to last weekend's
regional elections in the northern Basque region.
	   Aznar and his follower has hit out sharply at the nationalists'
negotiation with a radical Basque separatist group that led to a
cease-fire on behalf of the armed group ETA.
	   Aznar's party has also condemned the Basque party's claim that
the Spanish constitution does not cater for Basque aspirations of
self determination.
	   Anasagasti said the door remained open should the Popular Party
to change its attitude and strike a new deal with the Basque group.

Protection increased for Netanyahu as protests grow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Security around Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was tightened Wednesday in response to calls by Jewish
extremists to ``take down'' the leader who agreed to hand West Bank
land to the Palestinians.
	   In a front-page photo, the daily Maariv showed Netanyahu
surrounded by six bodyguards as he walked into parliament, one of
the most secure buildings in Israel.
	   Netanyahu has said he was aware of the possible dangers, but
that he tried to ignore them when making decisions. ``The minute
leaders ... make their policies based on personal risk of any kind,
they are completely immobilized,'' he told CNN earlier this week.
	   The prime minister also said he felt that the Islamic militant
group Hamas posed more of a threat to his safety than Jewish
extremists. He said Hamas had put a price on his head.
	   Israeli police began investigating two Jewish extremists, Noam
Federman and Rabbi Moshe Levinger, on suspicion they incited to
violence against the prime minister.
	   Delivering a eulogy Tuesday for a Jewish settler killed by
Palestinian militants in the West Bank town of Hebron, Federman
held Netanyahu and his land-for-peace policy responsible.
	   ``We need to take down a man like this,'' Federman told the
mourners of Danny Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron.
	   As part of the new security arrangement, Netanyahu has been
asked by the Shin Bet security service to stay away from large
crowds, Israeli radio stations said.
	   From now on, Netanyahu will travel in helicopters when visiting
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a major road near his home may be
closed to restrict access, the reports sad.
	   Netanyahu's office would not comment on the security
arrangements.
	   Concern in Israel over renewed political violence grew after
hundreds of Jewish settlers gathered outside Netanyahu's home on
Monday evening, several hours after the slaying of Vargas.
	   Some in the crowd chanted ``traitor, traitor.''
	   Demonstrators also held up a large drawing showing Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shake bloodstained hands.
	   The protests came as Israelis prepared for the third anniversary
of the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a
Jewish extremist. The assailant, Yigal Amir, said he killed the
prime minister because he wanted to stop the handover of land.

Turkish Parliament asked to lift immunity of Islamic party leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Maintaining pressure on Turkey's Islamic
movement, prosecutors on Wednesday are seeking to have the new
Islamic party's leader prosecuted for allegedly insulting the
Alawite sect, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Ankara's chief prosecutor asked the justice ministry to request
that Parliament lift immunity for deputy Recai Kutan's.
	   Kutan, leader of Turkey's largest party in parliament, the
Virtue Party, is under investigation for a speech earlier this
month describing Syrian leader Hafez Assad as member of a
``deviated kind of Alawite sect.''
	   Kutan spoke at the height of a Turkish-Syrian crisis over
Damascus' alleged support for Kurdish rebels. His statement created
an uproar in Turkey, where Alawites, a minority Muslim sect that
backs secularism, are uncomfortable with the rise of radical Islam
backed by some Sunni Muslim circles.
	   Kutan has said his words were aimed at the Syrian leader and not
at the religious sect.
	   Assad and some of Syria's top military officers belong to
Syria's Alawite minority.
	   The Constitutional Court earlier this year disbanded Virtue's
predecessor, the Islamic Welfare Party, for anti-secular activity
and slapped a five-year ban from politics on its leader, former
Premier Necmettin Erbakan.
	   And another top Islamic party politician, the mayor of Istanbul,
was banned from politics for life after a court convicted him of
inciting religious hatred for reading a poem during a rally.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Spreading fear across the western
Caribbean Tuesday, one of the century's most powerful hurricanes
forced tens of thousands to flee, dumped torrents of rain, mowed
down trees and damaged homes. At least 12 people were reported
killed.
	   Hurricane Mitch hovered 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the coast
of Honduras on Wednesday morning, its downpours causing rivers to
flood across Honduras, Belize and elsewhere in Central America.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said up to 20 inches
(50 centimeters) of rain could fall on mountain areas.
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180 mph (290 kph) winds. By 7 a.m.
EST (1200 GMT) Wednesday, the 350-mile (565-kilometer) wide storm
still packed a punch, but its winds were down to 120 mph (190 kph),
with higher gusts.
	   More than 45,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
low-lying areas of Honduras, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel,
chief of the National Emergency Committee. Many towns were cut off
by some 50 flooded rivers.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts like Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on pumping
oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Belize, most of the 75,000 people in Belize City fled inland
in cars and government buses.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Security around Prime Minister Benjamin

Afghan opposition leader says Bin Laden harms Islam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, the man
accused of bombing U.S. embassies in Africa, is harming Islam and
bringing ``endless problems'' to Afghanistan, an Afghan opposition
leader said in remarks published Wednesday.
	   Ahmed Shah Massood, the military leader of forces fighting
Afghanistan's Taliban militia, said that bombs planted at the U.S.
embassies in August killed hundreds of Muslims as well as
Americans.
	   ``Is this holy war?'' he asked in an interview with the
London-based newspaper Al-Hayat.
	   Massood criticized his opponents for giving a free hand to bin
Laden. The Saudi dissident, who has called for holy war against the
United States, runs a training camp in southern Afghanistan that
was attacked by U.S. cruise missiles Aug. 20.
	   The strike retaliated for the car bombs outside U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12
Americans.
	   ``How is it in our (Afghan) interest when Osama bin Laden uses
our territory to create endless problems for us,'' said Massood.
	   Ironically, Massood was defense minister in the government of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani that gave asylum to bin Laden. The
Taliban ousted that government in 1996.
	   ``We cannot bring down America by these actions. This behavior
harms Islam's reputation.'' Massood said at his base in Panjshir
Valley, northern Afghanistan.
	   Asked what he would do if bin Laden was in parts of Afghanistan
under his control, Massood said he would try to reconcile such
exiles with their home governments.
	   ``I would ask their governments not to imprison or kill them but
let them live in their countries.''
	   Those Arabs who wanted to fight for God, ``we would guide them
to the right way and there are several ways in which Islam can be
served and defended without doing harm to its reputation.''
	   Massood, whose forces have been squeezed into about 10 percent
of Afghanistan, said he wanted a negotiated solution to the Afghan
civil war.
	   ``We want to sit (with the Taliban) and talk to find a
solution.''
	   Massood said that despite the Taliban's recent tensions with
Iran over the killing of eight Iranian diplomats, the Taliban was
still concentrating its forces against the Afghan opposition.
	   He maintained that troops sent to the Iran-Afghan border to face
about 200,000 Iranian troops on the other side were not Taliban
forces but soldiers from the Pakistani army and a Pakistani
militia.

Newspaper: parachutist from New York buildings is Norwegian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A daredevil who illegally parachuted from
the Empire State Building and then vanished is a Norwegian named
Thor Axel Kappfjell, an Oslo newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Kappfjell, 32, parachuted from the 86th floor of the Empire
State Building on Saturday and on Tuesday jumped from the Chrysler
Building, the Dagbladet newspaper reported. The newspaper said a
second jumper who joined Kappfjell on Saturday was a Russian
employed by the World Bank.
	   ``Fantastic. This was my biggest dream for many years,''
Kappfjell was quoted as telling the newspaper after his first jump.
He said he and friends smuggled his parachuting equipment past
building security guards in three bundles made to look like camping
equipment. He put on the equipment in a bathroom.
	   ``The Empire State Building is seen by BASE jumpers as one of
the buildings in the world that it is impossible to get up into
with all the equipment,'' he was quoted as saying. BASE is an
acronym for Building, Antenna, Span, Earth, the places preferred by
fixed object jumpers like Kappfjell.
	   After the first jump, Kappfjell disappeared into New York City
subway station, and was being sought by the city's police.
	   Kappfjell is an offshore oil worker from the northern Norway
town of Mo i Rana. He has also jumped from the Eiffel Tower in
Paris and the World Trade Center in New York.

Ukraine's medical supplies dwindling amid economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainians may soon find themselves facing
shortages of drugs and other medical supplies whose imports have
been frozen for nearly two months, local media reported Wednesday.
	   About 60 percent of medicines in the former Soviet republic are
imported, but supplies stopped arriving after the financial turmoil
in neighboring Russia spilled over into Ukraine in August.
	   The national hryvna currency fell sharply, making it difficult
for local companies to pay for imports. More than 1,500 Ukrainian
distributors now owe foreign suppliers about dlrs 300 million, the
government says.
	   Meanwhile, prices for imported drugs grew an average 50 percent
and for locally produced ones by 30 percent in September and
October.
	   ``Shall we have to `hunt' soon for popular foreign medicines?''
the daily Fakty asked in a front-page story Wednesday.
	   The deputy chief of the State Medical Industry Committee, Viktor
Chumak, said Ukraine currently has a dlrs 200 million stock of
imported drugs, enough to last four months.
	   But there could be shortages of some vital drugs, or the public
could starting a run on pharmacies, he told Fakty. There are no
signs now of panic buying.
	   Ukraine would have difficulty producing all the drugs it needs
at its 135 pharmaceutical factories because 90 percent of raw
materials used in the industry are imported and have to be bought
with foreign currency, Chumak noted.
	   With the government imposing strict regulations on currency
purchases in an attempt to defend the hryvna, ``the main difficulty
for us now is how to convert (hryvnas) into foreign currency to buy
raw materials. The industry is not on the list of priority
conversions,'' he said. ``Only the government can solve this
problem.''
	   At the same time, Ukrainian companies are concerned that the
government may give some importers credits for pharmaceutical
imports, since ``experience shows that such credits frequently are
used to purchase outdated products of Western companies,'' Chumak
added.
	   Before the financial crisis hit, Ukraine's exports of
pharmaceutical products grew by 5 percent in the first nine months
of 1998 over the same period in 1997, amounting to dlrs 102
million.

Brazil unveils budget-cutting plan

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Pressured by a rising deficit and
sinking investor confidence, Brazil unveiled a massive plan
Wednesday to cut spending, raise taxes and try to extricate itself
from an economic quagmire.
	   Corporations, civil servants and almost anyone with a bank
account will pay more to help the government save 28 billion reals,
or nearly dlrs 24 billion, next year. Spending will be cut by 8.7
billion reals, or about dlrs 7.3 billion.
	   A tough, realistic plan to slash the budget deficit was a
condition for the International Monetary Fund to approve a rescue
package worth an estimated dlrs 30 billion. Fund officials said the
money could be available next month _ if the plan is convincing.
	   But many of the measures _ such as an increase in social
security payments _ are controversial and face a tough battle in
congress, which must approve much of the plan.

NATO keeps up guard in Kosovo as some refugees return

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Having deferred airstrikes for the
moment, NATO revealed plans Wednesday for more spy plane flights to
make sure President Slobodan Milosevic continues to withdraw forces
from Kosovo and lets tens of thousands of refugees return home.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said Wednesday
that the withdrawal of Serb forces was not complete but so far it
represented a ``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling
the demands.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military alliance
did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one
expired Tuesday.
	   That was a bitter disappointment to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
politicians, who had been hoping that NATO would deliver a
devastating blow to the Yugoslav war machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet Hamiti of the League of
Democratic Kosovo said Wednesday.
	   But by warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back.
	   To back up its demands, the alliance decided to keep more than
400 warplanes on alert. On Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced at
its Mediterranean headquarters in Italy that American P-3C Orion
surveillance will begin regular flights over Kosovo on Sunday.
	   The planes can fly for 10-12 hours without refueling and will
help monitor the situation day and night regardless of the weather.
The Navy said it conducted a few such flights around the time of
the first NATO deadline Oct. 17.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
accelerating efforts to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to
verify compliance on the ground.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said after a meeting of NATO
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' he added. ``I urge both sides
to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward.''
	   In an Oct. 12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
demanded that Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in
Kosovo to the levels of last February, when Milosevic began his
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have
died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo is a province in
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters that NATO would move quickly to use force against
Yugoslavia if Milosevic sends troops and special police back to
Kosovo.
	   Albright said the NATO allies were organizing a rapid-reaction
force based in neighboring Macedonia to protect _ if necessary _
the 2,000 unarmed personnel who will verify that Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   A spokesman for the OSCE said Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was
due in Pristina on Thursday to take charge of the verification
operation.
	   International officials hope the continued pressure will
encourage many refugees to return home. Many of them are camping in
the woods and hills, fearful that Serb police will shoot at them if
they tried to go back.
	   In the village of Ostrozub, southwest of Pristina, Avdullah
Krasniqi loaded up his wagon with his wife, children and household
goods and headed home Tuesday. His decision was prompted by one
fact: It was getting colder by the day in his mountain refuge.
	   ``We spent three months in the mountains,'' Krasniqi said as
family members sat on a huge pile of carpets, kitchen utensils and
other household goods, all pulled by the family tractor. ``It's
very cold.''
	   The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but they are still
wary.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, licking his
thick dark mustache, and noting that his next-door neighbor was
shot and killed on his doorstep.

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with U.S. pressing for deal to be
implemented on time. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time, officials said Wednesday.
	   As part of that effort, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon earlier this week.
	   ``All sides must begin implementation next Monday night,'' said
Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of a
delay when he announced Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely
postponing a Cabinet meeting at which the deal was to have been
approved.
	   Netanyahu insisted Wednesday that he needed Cabinet backing and
that he would not start the pullback until he had it.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   However, U.S. officials and Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Cabinet approval was not a prerequisite for
Netanyahu to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's office said in a statement the Cabinet meeting was
postponed because the Palestinians had not submitted a detailed
security plan to the United States as promised.
	   However, Israeli media said the main reason for the delay was
Netanyahu's concern that he would not get a majority in his Cabinet
for the troop withdrawal.
	   Several Israeli Cabinet ministers who initially said they were
undecided have announced in recent days that they would vote
against the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians were
aware of Monday's deadline and would verbally present their
security plan to the Americans by then.
	   U.S. diplomats met with Palestinian officials Wednesday in an
attempt to prevent any delays in implementation.
	   Bar-Illan noted that in the first week of the 12-week process,
the steps to be taken must come from the Palestinian side and that
Israel does not have to take any action during that time.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he was
confident both sides would keep their promises and that he was not
concerned about the postponing of the Israeli Cabinet meeting.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' said Arafat, who returned home Wednesday to a
carefully orchestrated welcome by flag-waving students.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Albright called the
Palestinian leader on Monday evening. Asked what the two discussed,
Abourdeneh said that ``the Americans are keen on implementing the
agreement.''
	   Israeli media said Wednesday that security for Netanyahu has
been increased recently in response to the vociferous street
protests against the West Bank withdrawal.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu will cut down on appearances in
large crowds and travel to the West Bank and Gaza Strip only by
helicopter.
	   In recent protests against Netanyahu, demonstrators have shouted
``Traitor! Traitor!'' Such cries were common in the weeks leading
up to the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.
	   Also Wednesday, the Israeli army removed travel restrictions
imposed on Palestinians in Hebron earlier this week after a Jewish
settler was killed in the tense town.
	   The decision was made after Palestinian security forces arrested
two suspects in the killing of the settler, 29-year-old Danny
Vargas from the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Taiwan takes delivery of last eight French-made Mirage fighters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan took delivery Wednesday of the last
eight of the 60 Mirage jet fighters it ordered from France, the
state-run news agency reported.
	   The Mirage 2000-5s were unloaded from a French freighter at
eastern Hualien port before being transported to a nearby air base,
the report said.
	   The Mirages were part of a major overhaul to replace Taiwan's
aging World War II-era warplanes.
	   Taiwan also has taken delivery of 103 of the 150 F-16s it has
ordered from the United States. Lockheed Martin Corp. has said it
will deliver the remaining jets by October next year.
	   With the deliveries, Taiwanese officials have said the island
could stay about three years ahead of China in military aviation.
China has bought advanced Su-27's from Russia.
	   Taiwan has paid U.S. dlrs 12.7 billion for the F-16s and the
Mirages, along with air-to-air missiles.
	   The purchases drew strong protests from China, which opposes
Western countries selling advanced weapons to Taiwan.
	   Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province to be reunified
with the mainland by force if necessary.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Security around Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was tightened Wednesday in response to calls by Jewish
extremists to ``take down'' the leader following his agreement to
hand West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   While visiting the Knesset, one of the most secure buildings in
Israel, Netanyahu was surrounded by eight bodyguards Wednesday.
	   In a front-page photo with the caption ``under tight guard,''
the daily Maariv showed Netanyahu accompanied by several guards.
	   Netanyahu has said he was aware of the possible dangers, but
that he tried to ignore them when making decisions. ``The minute
leaders ... make their policies based on personal risk of any kind,
they are completely immobilized,'' he told CNN earlier this week.
	   The prime minister also said he felt that the Islamic militant
group Hamas posed more of a threat to his safety than Jewish
extremists. He said Hamas had put a price on his head.
	   Israeli police began investigating two Jewish extremists, Noam
Federman and Rabbi Moshe Levinger, on suspicion they incited to
violence against the prime minister.
	   Delivering a eulogy Tuesday for a Jewish settler killed by
Palestinian militants in the West Bank town of Hebron, Federman
held Netanyahu and his land-for-peace policy responsible.
	   ``We need to take down a man like this,'' Federman told the
mourners of Danny Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron.
	   As part of the new security arrangement, Netanyahu has been
asked by the Shin Bet security service to stay away from large
crowds, Israel radio said.
	   From now on, Netanyahu will travel in helicopters when visiting
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a major road near his home may be
closed to restrict access, the report said.
	   Netanyahu's office would not comment on the security
arrangements.
	   Concern in Israel over renewed political violence grew after
hundreds of Jewish settlers gathered outside Netanyahu's home on
Monday evening, several hours after the slaying of Vargas.
	   Some in the crowd chanted ``traitor, traitor.''
	   Demonstrators also held up a large drawing showing Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shake bloodstained hands.
	   The protests came as Israelis prepared for the third anniversary
of the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a
Jewish extremist. The assailant, Yigal Amir, said he killed the
prime minister because he wanted to stop the handover of land.

	   DOUAI, France (AP) _ French authorities on Wednesday released
German suspect Karl-Heinz Elschner, accused in the near-fatal
beating of a French policeman during the World Cup over the summer.
	   Elschner was freed from jail in northern French town on
Wednesday afternoon after an appeals court ordered his release that
morning.
	   But the young German was to be kept under judicial surveillance
in Germany for further questioning, officials said.
	   Elschner was accused of taking part in the beating of policeman
Daniel Nivel last June in the nearby city of Lens during the June
21 match there between Germany and Yugoslavia. Nivel, 44, lay in a
coma for six weeks before regaining consciousness.
	   On Oct. 16, witnesses said they did not see Elschner near Nivel
on the day of the attack.
	   Several other suspects in the attack remained held in German
jails.

BRASILIA: the plan.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Finance Ministry released copies of the plan Wednesday
morning, and the finance minister, Pedro Malan, was to speak about
the plan later. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's
largest, postponed its opening by an hour to wait for the speech.
	   A big chunk of the new revenue would come from an increase in a
tax on all financial transactions, from checks to stock market
investments. The plan would raise the tax to 0.38 percent from 0.2
percent now, declining to 0.3 percent in 2000.
	   A tax on corporate earnings will rise to 3 percent from 2
percent, and the government will submit a bill to levy the tax on
banks, too.
	   The most sensitive measure would raise social security payments
for government employees and collect social security payments from
pensioners. The extra revenue is expected to come to 2.6 billion
reals, or dlrs 2.2 billion.
	   President Henrique Cardoso said social benefits for civil
servants was the single biggest drain on the budget. This year, the
``hole'' is 18 billion reals, or more than dlrs15 billion.
	   But government employees have almost sacred-cow status in
Brazil, and the proposal is likely to face constitutional
challenges.
	   ``Here, there's no doubt there will be resistance,'' said Rep.
Michel Temer, president of the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government has ordered no
investigation of possible bank accounts belonging to former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said a Spanish judge who
ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition aimed at freezing
any accounts the 82-year-old general might have in Luxembourg and
Switzerland.
	   But government spokesman Achille Casanova said no accounts have
so far been frozen in Switzerland and no investigation order has
been given to federal banking authorities.
	   Pinochet has been held at a London clinic since his arrest
earlier this month. Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking
his extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism
during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   On Monday, Switzerland also requested Pinochet's arrest and
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   The move followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva last week
by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual
nationality who disappeared in May 1977.
	   Swiss authorities said the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet
should be given priority. A Spanish request for legal assistance
from Switzerland, made Friday, has been passed on to Geneva
authorities.
	   No details have been given of the content of the Spanish
request.

Libya denies it is delaying the hand-over of the Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has denied U.S._British allegations
that it is delaying the hand-over of two men wanted for the blowing
up of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Libya ``does not accept the claim that
it is procrastinating to gain time as the other sides claim,'' the
official Libyan news agency said Wednesday in a report received in
Cairo.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Sate Madeline Albright and
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of delaying the
case and warned it would face stiffer U.N. sanctions if it did not
hand over for trial two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which killed 270 people in 1988.
	   In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S._British plan
for the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial
in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but
called for further negotiations and later insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail. The
plan calls for sentences to be served in a British prison.
	   The Libyan foreign ministry said it was astonished by the
``harmony'' between the British and U.S. statements which
``confirms Libya's warning that the British-American initiative is
nothing more than a trick.''
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the defendants. The sanctions include a ban on air links
with Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oil
equipment.
	   The statement said Libya had sent a legal team to the United
Nations to discuss the guarantees for the suspects in the event of
a trial in the Netherlands. It was still waiting for answers from
the parties concerned.
	   The U.N. secretariat has called for a meeting between all
parties on Nov. 9, the statement added.

	   Another idea sure to raise howls is a reduction in federal funds
transfered to the states.
	   In a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, Cardoso said his
options were limited by the constitution _ three-fourths of the
budget is untouchable.
	   Cardoso said the plan was conceived so it ``won't burden the
poor.'' He said that's why there was no increase in income tax, as
many had thought.
	   But the poor surely will be affected, if only indirectly. The
cuts will affect all areas, including already-precarious public
schools and hospitals.
	   The higher taxes and spending cuts also will slow the economy to
a crawl and raise unemployment. The government forecasts a 1
percent decline in the economy next year _ private economists are
even gloomier.
	   Cardoso said tough measures were needed to ``cut the evil by the
roots.'' A harsh cut now will allow Brazil to lower interest rates
and resume growth, he said.
	   The big problem is interest rates, which Brazil raised to nearly
50 percent last month to try to stem the outflow of dollars.
Interest accounts for more than 80 percent of the budget deficit,
now around dlrs 65 billion, and unless they come down quickly, the
entire austerity plan could be in vain.

Report: Lightning kills 11 players during soccer game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo _ A burst of lightning killed 11 members of a
Congolese soccer team and injured dozens more people during a
weekend match, the Congolese news agency has reported.
	   The lightning strike wiped out all the players fielded by the
home team in the village of Bena Tshadi, in the south-central
Congolese province of Eastern Kasai, the Congolese Press Agency
said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Local investigators are blaming the lightning bolt on witchcraft
because none of the players on the opposing team from nearby
Basangana village were injured, the agency reported Tuesday.
	   The report said that sorcery is often used in the region in an
attempt to influence soccer games.
	   The two teams were tied 1-1 when the lightning struck.
	   More than 30 people, most of the them standing along the
sidelines, were injured by the lightning, but none of the injuries
are believed to be life-threatening, the report said.
	   Witchcraft is often blamed throughout west and central Africa to
explain natural phenomenon and illness.
	   In South Africa over the weekend, six players from a local team
were hurt when lightning struck the playing field during a
thunderstorm.

	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan Wednesday by its disgruntled captain, who
allegedly told authorities he did it because he was angered over
pay and working conditions.
	   ``I feel relaxed,'' Yuan Bin said in a brief exchange with
reporters, after prosecutors questioned him at the airport before
taking him to court. ``I shall have no regret whatever happens to
me.''
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing FOR the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but was diverted in the air and arrived safely under
military jet escort at Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17
a.m. (0317 GMT).
	   Yuan, 30, was accompanied on the flight by his wife, identified
as Xu Mei, 27. She also was detained by Taiwanese authorities, who
were not immediately sure whether to consider her a suspect.
	   ``He was determined to come to Taiwan, live or die,'' Hwang
Yun-hwa, vice aviation police commander, told a news conference.
``He said the company had treated him badly.''
	   Yuan's co-pilot, Wen Fei, did not try to physically stop the
captain, for fear a fight in the cockpit could endanger the
passengers, said Chang Kuo-cheng, director of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration.
	   Nobody was hurt and the Boeing 737's two other pilots were
allowed to take off from Taiwan six hours later, flying 94
remaining passengers and six crew members back to China. China's
Xinhua News Agency said 20 foreigners were aboard, but it did not
give their nationalities.
	   The plane finally landed in Xiamen, in China's southeastern
Fujian province, according to Hong Kong officials who had been
monitoring its progress.
	   Taiwan Television showed the captain in his uniform white shirt,
carrying a suitcase as he was led out of the plane by policemen in
helmets and bulletproof vests. His wife was shown in a black coat.
	   Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said Yuan admitted he diverted
the jet to Taiwan because he was displeased with Air China's
policies and his pay. It was not immediately clear what Yuan hoped
to accomplish.
	   ``There was no political motive,'' Huang said.
	   Chang said Yuan would face trial in Taiwan, although no
information on the precise charges was immediately released.
	   The flight by Air China, the main airline run by the Civil
Aviation Administration of China, was scheduled originally to stop
in Kunming, then continue to Yangon, Myanmar, Chang said.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew condemned Wednesday's
incident.
	   ``We've never agreed to such deeds,'' he told reporters _
although Taiwan in recent memory used to shower hijackers from
mainland China with gold and cash rewards. Taiwan began cracking
down on the hijackers after longstanding tensions with the mainland
began easing in the 1980s.
	   The 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed for
up to 12 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to China.
	   China has demanded that Taiwan send all the hijackers back. The
two sides were near reaching an agreement about repatriation in
1995 when China broke off the talks in anger over a Taiwanese drive
to gain diplomatic recognition.
	   In recent months, the two sides have slowly approached each
other to restore the long-stalled dialogue.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

Five militants killed in gunbattle with government troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Government troops cordoned off a village in
India's northern Kashmir state Wednesday where a fierce gun battle
was being fought with separatist militants, police said. Five
militants were killed in the fighting.
	   Some of the militants stormed into a policeman's house in the
village of Satra and took his three children hostage. But
government soldiers rescued the children after a prolonged exchange
of fire, said a police official on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, police and army soldiers surrounded the village in the
border district of Poonch after receiving information that
militants were hiding there. The militants opened fire at the
approaching soldiers.
	   Even while the battle was continuing, police claimed five
militants had been killed. There were no immediate details about
government casualties.
	   India says militants frequently cross the border to infiltrate
fighters and weapons into Kashmir, where an armed insurrection
against Indian rule has been under way since 1989. About 15,000
people have been killed.
	   Kashmiris, who are mostly Muslims, are fighting for independence
from predominantly Hindu India or to merge the disputed territory
with neighboring Pakistan, an officially Islamic nation.

Top political leader in custody in corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PATNA, India (AP) _ A powerful regional politician was detained
in a multimillion dollar corruption case Wednesday after he
surrendered in court in the state considered India's most lawless.
	   Laloo Prasad Yadav, former chief minister of Bihar state, has
been charged with siphoning off millions of dollars in government
funds during his tenure. Judge S.K. Lal ordered him held in
``judicial custody'' at a government guest house instead of a jail
_ for security reasons _ during a hearing in the state's capital of
Patna.
	   Judge Lal gave no decision Wednesday on a bail petition moved by
Yadav. The hearing will continue on Thursday, court officials said.
	   Hundreds of Yadav's supporters beat drums, waved flags and
shouted slogans against Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
Bharatiya Janata Party as Yadav entered the courtroom. Yadav claims
he was framed by federal investigators.
	   He will be kept at the sprawling guest house of the Bihar's
military police, officials said. Yadav was held there under similar
conditions for two months last year, after which he complained he
was suffering from heart ailments and was shifted to a hospital.
	   Yadav was forced to quit the chief minister's position after
being charged with corruption. He immediately appointed his wife
chief minister and continues to wield enormous power from behind
the scenes even as his trial continues.

Hakkinen confident of fair fight in Formula One season-ending race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen is sure
Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix will be such a clean race he will
secure his first Formula One world title without anyone crashing
into him.
	   ``I believe it will be a completely fair fight this time,'' the
30-year-old Finn said. ``That's what everybody wants, and everyone
in the world will be watching.''
	   It helps that all he needs is second place. He holds a
four-point lead over Ferrari's Michael Schumacher going into the
season-ending race.
	   ``Michael cannot take any risks. He has to finish the race
because if we both retired I'd still have more points than him and
win,'' said Hakkinen, who hopes to hand McLaren its first
constructors title since 1991.
	   Hakkinen brushed off questions about any possible dirty play
from his German rival _ although he acknowledged some have pointed
to a Formula Three race 10 years ago in Macau when the two racers
crashed.
	   ``We don't want people pointing the finger afterward. It is a
very critical position going into the race, but nobody will want to
risk an accident,'' Hakkinen said.
	   In the season-ending Grand Prix last year in Jerez, Spain,
Schumacher rammed Jacques Villeneuve in what was widely viewed as a
deliberate attempt to knock him out of the race and win the title.
But it was Schumacher who slid out of the race and Villeneuve went
on to clinch the title.
	   In 1989 at Suzuka, Artyon Senna and Alain Prost collided, and a
year later, Senna drove Prost off the track at the first corner to
clinch the title. In 1994 in Adelaide, Schumacher collided with
Damon Hill to win the title.
	   Hakkinen was firm, however, that whatever happened in the past
will have no effect on the Suzuka race.
	   ``I have never done dirty on the track and I never will _ that
is not my style. But it is not something I am worried about with
Michael,'' he said.
	   Two-time world champion Schumacher is predicting he will capture
his third with a victory Sunday.
	   Schumacher has reason to be confident on the difficult Suzuka
course. He won the Japanese Grand Prix last year for Ferrari and in
1995 while driving for Benetton.
	   But to beat Hakkinen, he may also need the help of teammate
Eddie Irvine. Irvine has said he is aiming to finish second behind
Schumacher.
	   A possible factor in Shumacher's favor is the weather. Rain is
common in November in Suzuka and Schumacher is a great wet-weather
driver.
	   If the German wins and Hakkinen finishes no better than third,
Ferrari would have its first championship driver since Jody
Scheckter in 1979 and its first constructors title in 15 years.
	   Schumacher's name would also be added to the elite list of
drivers who have won the world championship three times.
	   Only five have done that _ the late Ayrton Senna, Jack Brabham,
Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda and Nelson Piquet. Alain Prost won four,
and Argentine pioneer Juan Manuel Fangio had five.
	   Team chief Eddie Jordan agreed rain could help Schumacher _ but
perhaps younger brother Ralf rather than Michael.
	   ``If it rains, then I would put my money on Schumacher,'' said
Jordan. ``But by that I mean Michael or Ralf.''
	   If Ralf Schumacher wins and Michael Schumacher places second,
Hakkinen must come sixth or lower for the elder Schumacher to take
the title.
	   With seven victories in 15 races this year, winning is nothing
new for Hakkinen. But a driver's title would be his first.
	   Hakkinen said he respected Schumacher.
	   ``He's a good driver and a good racer, after all he's two times
the world champion,'' Hakkinen said. ``But I don't think he is
anything to fear.''
	   Hill, who was crowned world champion on the Japanese track in
1996, predicts Hakkinen will get the same honors, come Sunday.
	   ``It is going to be a tall order for Michael to beat Mika and
they both know it,'' said Hill.
	   For Hakkinen, relief is in knowing that all he has to do is come
in second. Even if Schumacher wins, both would then have 96 points,
and Hakkinen would win by virtue of more seconds.
	   ``The whole year I've been fighting for first, and winning races
and getting pole positions. Now it's different,'' he said. ``I can
go to the Grand Prix and just finish second.''

Five militants killed in gunbattle with government troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Government troops cordoned off a village in
India's northern Kashmir state Wednesday where a fierce gun battle
was being fought with separatist militants, police said. Five
militants were killed in the fighting.
	   Some of the militants stormed into a policeman's house in the
village of Satra and took his three children hostage. But
government soldiers rescued the children after a prolonged exchange
of fire, said a police official on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, police and army soldiers surrounded the village in the
border district of Poonch after receiving information that
militants were hiding there. The militants opened fire at the
approaching soldiers.
	   Even while the battle was continuing, police claimed five
militants had been killed. There were no immediate details about
government casualties.
	   India says militants frequently cross the border to infiltrate
fighters and weapons into Kashmir, where an armed insurrection
against Indian rule has been under way since 1989. About 15,000
people have been killed.
	   Kashmiris, who are mostly Muslims, are fighting for independence
from predominantly Hindu India or to merge the disputed territory
with neighboring Pakistan, an officially Islamic nation.

Tourist arrivals in Singapore continue to drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Tourist arrivals in Singapore in this year's
first nine months dropped 16.6 percent from a year earlier as
Asia's economic crisis kept potential tourists at home, according
to government figures released Wednesday.
	   The Singapore Tourism Board said 4.7 million people visited
Singapore in the January-September period.
	   Arrivals from key countries like Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Taiwan and Hong Kong all continued to decline, because of either
economic or political uncertainties there.
	   Singapore relies heavily on tourism, and in past years the
number of visitors has been equal to several times the city-state's
population of 3.1 million. But only 3 million tourists arrived in
the first half of 1998, and the declining trend has yet to reverse
itself.

NATO keeps up guard in Kosovo as some refugees return

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Having deferred airstrikes for the
moment, NATO on Wednesday revealed plans for more spy flights to
make sure President Slobodan Milosevic continues to withdraw forces
from Kosovo and lets tens of thousands of refugees return home.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said Wednesday
that the withdrawal of Serb forces was not complete but so far it
represented a ``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling
the demands.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military alliance
did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one
expired Tuesday.
	   That was a bitter disappointment to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
politicians, who had been hoping that NATO would deliver a
devastating blow to the Yugoslav war machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet Hamiti of the League of
Democratic Kosovo said Wednesday.
	   But by warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back.
	   It was unclear how many refugees were returning home Wednesday.
In Geneva, Switzerland, U.N. refugee agency spokesman Kris Janowski
said there ``has been some movement but at the same time the people
are still apprehensive.''
	   Janowski said men in some areas were returning to check the
condition of homes abandoned during the fighting but it was unclear
whether most felt it was safe to bring back their wives and
children.
	   To back up its demands, NATO decided to keep more than 400
warplanes on alert. On Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced at its
Mediterranean headquarters in Italy that American P-3C Orion
surveillance will begin regular flights over Kosovo on Sunday.
	   The planes can fly for 10-12 hours without refueling and will
help monitor the situation day and night regardless of the weather.
The Navy said it conducted a few such flights around the time of
the first NATO deadline Oct. 17.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
accelerating efforts to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to
verify compliance on the ground.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said after a meeting of NATO
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' he added. ``I urge both sides
to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward.''
	   In an Oct. 12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
demanded that Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in
Kosovo to the levels of last February, when Milosevic began his
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have
died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo is a province in
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters that NATO would move quickly to use force against
Yugoslavia if Milosevic sends troops and special police back to
Kosovo.
	   Albright said the NATO allies were organizing a rapid-reaction
force based in neighboring Macedonia to protect _ if necessary _
the 2,000 unarmed personnel who will verify that Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   A spokesman for the OSCE said Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was
due in Pristina on Thursday to take charge of the verification
operation.
	   International officials hope the continued pressure will
encourage many refugees to return home. Many of them are camping in
the woods and hills, fearful that Serb police will shoot at them if
they tried to go back.
	   In the village of Ostrozub, southwest of Pristina, Avdullah
Krasniqi loaded up his wagon with his wife, children and household
goods and headed home Tuesday. His decision was prompted by one
fact: It was getting colder by the day in his mountain refuge.
	   ``We spent three months in the mountains,'' Krasniqi said as
family members sat on a huge pile of carpets, kitchen utensils and
other household goods, all pulled by the family tractor. ``It's
very cold.''
	   The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but they are still
wary.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, licking his
thick dark mustache, and noting that his next-door neighbor was
shot and killed on his doorstep.

Radio: 34 people killed, 20 wounded in Burundi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Thirty-four people were killed and 20
others wounded in an overnight attack south of Burundi's capital,
the state-owned Radio Burundi reported Wednesday.
	   The broadcast did not say who was responsible for the attack but
said the number of casualties was likely to rise. It gave no
explanation.
	   The attack on the Nyamaboko and Kiyenzi neighborhoods, about 15
kilometers (10 miles) south of Bujumbura, was the first serious
slaughter since a third round of talks to stop the bloodletting
ended Oct. 22 in the northern Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   After 10 days of talks representatives of 18 political parties
chose Italian priest Mathias Zuppi, who has been involved in
mediation efforts in Angola and Mozambique, to head a panel to
discuss security issues in Burundi.
	   Zuppi is to present his report when peace negotiations resume
Jan. 18.
	   Hutu rebels are fighting to topple the military government of
Pierre Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority that accounts for 14
percent of Burundi's population of 6 million. Hutus make up 85
percent.
	   At the same time, soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated military are
known to kill Hutu civilians in retaliation for rebel attacks,
especially those on Tutsi civilians and army patrols and outposts.
	   More than 200,000 people have been killed in violence that broke
out in Burundi in October 1993 after Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected president,
Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.

Yavlinsky warns of corruption threat to new Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A prominent liberal lawmaker on Wednesday claimed
that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet is just as prone to
corruption as its predecessors, prompting a quick government threat
to sue him for libel.
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko faction in parliament's
lower house, said he continues to support Primakov but urged him to
take quick action against lobbyists infesting his Cabinet.
	   ``There are some people in the government who interest certain
groups,'' Yavlinsky told reporters.
	   ``Some people have taken senior positions in the new government
not because of their professional qualities, but because of their
ability to fulfill certain orders'' _ as in orders from companies
that want to curry favor with the government, he said.
	   Yavlinsky singled out First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov, closely tied to Russia's military-industrial complex,
and Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, a defender of state farms.
	   He wouldn't accuse either official of corruption directly or
give any other names, saying he simply wants the public to be aware
of the problem.
	   ``I'm simply saying that there is such a danger,'' he said.
``It's my duty to draw attention to a problem that was
all-embracing in the previous government.''
	   Yavlinsky was quoted Wednesday as making a similar statement in
the British Daily Telegraph: ``Corruption can determine who gets
what position. My people inside the government tell me you can buy
offices for money.'' He gave no names.
	   Yavlinsky, 46, is one of Russia's leading politicians and a
presidential hopeful. He was the one who first suggested Primakov's
candidacy for prime minister after the latest economic crisis hit
in August, leading to the previous Cabinet's ouster.
	   Yavlinsky's claims drew a quick response from Maslyukov's
office, which called them ``malicious lies.''
	   Primakov's chief of staff Yury Zubakov said the prime minister
is bent on eradicating corruption and called on Yavlinsky to
provide proof of wrongdoing. ``Otherwise, everybody is put under a
cloud,'' the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
	   Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov also called on Yavlinsky
to give specifics _ or face a possible lawsuit for libel.
	   Yavlinsky hasn't abandoned Primakov altogether, however.
	   ``We continue to support Primakov, who can ensure a relative
stability in the country,'' Yavlinsky said. ``We are drawing
Primakov's attention to those circumstances, and believe he would
take certain steps to stop the process (of corruption).''

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Netanyahu surrounded by eight
bodyguards in parliament. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time, officials said Wednesday.
	   As part of that effort, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon earlier this week.
	   ``All sides must begin implementation next Monday night,'' said
Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of a
delay when he announced Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely
postponing a Cabinet meeting at which the deal was to have been
approved.
	   Netanyahu insisted Wednesday that he needed Cabinet backing and
that he would not start the pullback until he had it.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   However, U.S. officials and Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Cabinet approval was not a prerequisite for
Netanyahu to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's office said in a statement the Cabinet meeting was
postponed because the Palestinians had not submitted a detailed
security plan to the United States as they had promised.
	   However, Israeli media said the main reason for the delay was
Netanyahu's concern that he would not get a majority in his Cabinet
for the troop withdrawal.
	   Several Israeli Cabinet ministers who initially said they were
undecided have announced in recent days that they would vote
against the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians were
aware of Monday's deadline and would verbally present their
security plan to the Americans by then.
	   U.S. diplomats met with Palestinian officials Wednesday in an
attempt to prevent any delays in implementation.
	   Bar-Illan noted that in the first week of the 12-week process,
the steps to be taken must come from the Palestinian side and that
Israel does not have to take any action during that time.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, said he was confident both sides would keep
their promises and that he was not concerned about the postponing
of the Israeli Cabinet meeting.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' said Arafat, who returned home Wednesday to a
carefully orchestrated welcome by flag-waving students.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Albright called the
Palestinian leader on Monday evening. Asked what the two discussed,
Abourdeneh said that ``the Americans are keen on implementing the
agreement.''
	   Security around Netanyahu was tightened Wednesday in response to
the vociferous street protests against the West Bank withdrawal. He
was surrounded by eight bodyguards while visiting the Knesset, one
of the most secure buildings in Israel.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu will cut down on appearances in
large crowds and travel to the West Bank and Gaza Strip only by
helicopter.
	   In recent protests against Netanyahu, demonstrators have shouted
``Traitor! Traitor!'' Such cries were common in the weeks leading
up to the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.
	   Also Wednesday, the Israeli army removed travel restrictions
imposed on Palestinians in Hebron earlier this week after a Jewish
settler was killed in the tense town.
	   The decision was made after Palestinian security forces arrested
two suspects in the killing of the settler, 29-year-old Danny
Vargas from the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Brazil presents ``unprecedented'' budget-cutting plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines urgent series, edits. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Pressured by a rising deficit and
sinking investor confidence, Brazil unveiled a massive plan
Wednesday to cut spending and raise taxes and _ hopefully _
extricate itself from economic crisis.
	   Corporations, civil servants and almost anyone with a bank
account will pay more to help the government save 28 billion reals,
or nearly dlrs 24 billion, next year. Spending will be cut by 8.7
billion reals, or about dlrs 7.3 billion.
	   A tough, realistic plan to slash the budget deficit was a
condition for the International Monetary Fund to approve a rescue
package worth an estimated dlrs 30 billion. Fund officials said the
money could be available next month _ if the plan is convincing.
	   But many of the measures _ such as an increase in social
security taxes _ are controversial and face a tough battle in
congress, which must approve much of the plan.
	   The Finance Ministry released copies of the plan Wednesday
morning, and the finance minister, Pedro Malan, was to speak about
the plan later. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's
largest, postponed its opening by an hour to wait for the speech.
	   A big chunk of the new revenue would come from an increase in a
tax on all financial transactions, from checks to stock market
investments. The plan would raise the tax to 0.38 percent from 0.2
percent now, declining to 0.3 percent in 2000.
	   A tax on corporate earnings will rise to 3 percent from 2
percent, and the government will submit a bill to levy the tax on
banks, too.
	   The most sensitive measure would raise social security taxes for
government employees and collect the social security tax for the
first time from pensioners. The extra revenue is expected to come
to 2.6 billion reals, or dlrs 2.2 billion.
	   President Henrique Cardoso said social security benefits for
civil servants are the single biggest drain on the budget. The
social security system paid out 18 billion reals _ or dlrs 15
billion _ more in benefits this year than it received in taxes, he
said.
	   But government employees have almost sacred-cow status in
Brazil, and the proposal is likely to face constitutional
challenges.
	   ``Here, there's no doubt there will be resistance,'' said Rep.
Michel Temer, president of the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies.
	   Another idea sure to raise howls is a 25 percent reduction in
federal funds transferred to the states.
	   In a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, Cardoso said his
options were limited by the constitution, saying three-fourths of
the budget is untouchable.
	   Cardoso said the plan was conceived so it ``won't burden the
poor.'' He said that's why it contained no increase in income tax,
as many had anticipated.
	   But the poor surely will be affected, if only indirectly.
Cardoso said the ``unprecedented cuts'' will affect all areas,
including already-precarious public schools and hospitals.
	   The higher taxes and spending cuts also could cause the economy
to contract and raise unemployment. The government forecasts a 1
percent decline in the economy next year; private economists are
even gloomier.
	   Cardoso said tough measures were needed to ``cut the evil by the
roots.'' A harsh cut now will allow Brazil to lower interest rates
and resume growth, he said.
	   The big problem is interest rates, which Brazil raised to nearly
50 percent last month to try to stem the outflow of dollars.
Interest payments account for more than 80 percent of the budget
deficit, now around dlrs 65 billion, and unless the rates come down
quickly, the entire austerity plan could be in vain.

Austrian Protestant Church acknowledges role in oppression of Jews
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The Austrian Evangelical Church on
Wednesday acknowledged its role in the ``suffering of Jews''
through this country's history and admitted the Protestant
denomination shared responsibility for the Holocaust.
	   In a statement adopted by the church's General Synod, the
denomination said that ``with shame we declare that our church
showed insensitivity for the fate of the Jews and uncounted others
who were persecuted.''
	   The church said such conduct during the Nazi era was
particularly shameful because Protestants themselves had been
victims of oppression during the Counter Reformation.
	   Yet the church as an institution turned its back on the murder
of 6 million European Jews, including Austrian citizens, before the
defeat of the Nazis in 1945.
	   ``Therefore, we share guilt, not only as individual Christians
but also as a church, in the Holocaust,'' the statement said.
	   The statement added that the Austrian denomination wished
``justice and peace for the state of Israel.''
	   ``We hope and pray that this state can find a secure peace with
its neighbors, especially with the Palestinian people, on the basis
of mutual respect for the right to a homeland so that Jews,
Christians and Muslims can live peacefully together.''
	   Austria was absorbed into Nazi Germany in 1938 and was restored
as a separate national state after World War II. The country has in
recent years begun to re-examine its role in the Nazi era after
having viewed itself for decades as a victim rather than
participant in Adolf Hitler's crimes.

Egypt upgrades mission in Iran in sign of warming ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has upgraded its diplomatic mission in
Iran in a sign of thawing ties between the two countries, Egyptian
and Iranian diplomats said Wednesday.
	   Mohammed Rifa'a, a career diplomat who holds the rank of
ambassador, was sent to Tehran last month to head the Egyptian
interests section.
	   Egypt and Iran severed ties after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Egypt maintains an interests section in Tehran, which works from
the Italian Embassy.
	   Rifa'a is the highest-ranking Egyptian diplomat to serve in
Tehran since the revolution.
	   The decision to appoint Rifa'a followed a series of meetings
between the foreign ministers of the two countries, who have been
working to upgrade relations.
	   Recently, Iran sent trade, parliamentary and press delegations
to Egypt in a bid to improve ties.
	   Egypt has said it is eager to improve relations with Iran but
has demanded that Tehran end support for fundamentalist Egyptian
groups trying to topple the secular regime of President Hosni
Mubarak.
	   Iran has denied supporting Egyptian radicals.

Libya denies delaying handover of Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has denied U.S.-British allegations
that it is delaying the handover of two men wanted for the blowing
up of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Libya ``does not accept the claim that
it is procrastinating to gain time as the other sides claim,'' the
official Libyan news agency said Wednesday in a report received in
Cairo.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of delaying
the case and warned it would face stiffer U.N. sanctions if it did
not hand over for trial two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people in 1988.
	   In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S.-British plan
for the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial
in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but
demanded further negotiations and later insisted that the suspects,
if convicted, serve their sentences in a Libyan jail. The plan
stipulates that sentences be served in a British prison.
	   The Libyan foreign ministry said it was astonished by the
``harmony'' between the British and U.S. statements which
``confirms Libya's warning that the British-American initiative is
nothing more than a trick.''
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the defendants. The sanctions include a ban on air links
with Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oil
equipment.
	   The statement said Libya had sent a legal team to the United
Nations to discuss the guarantees for the suspects in the event of
a trial in the Netherlands. It was still waiting for answers from
the parties concerned.
	   The U.N. secretariat has called for a meeting between all
parties on Nov. 9, the statement added.

Protection increased for Netanyahu as protests grow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Netanyahu adviser &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL-104, JRL-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Security around Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was tightened Wednesday in response to calls by Jewish
extremists to ``take down'' the leader following his agreement to
hand West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   While visiting the Knesset, one of the most secure buildings in
Israel, Netanyahu was surrounded by eight bodyguards Wednesday.
	   In a front-page photo with the caption ``under tight guard,''
the daily Maariv showed Netanyahu accompanied by several guards.
	   Netanyahu has said he was aware of the possible dangers, but
that he tried to ignore them when making decisions. ``The minute
leaders ... make their policies based on personal risk of any kind,
they are completely immobilized,'' he told CNN earlier this week.
	   The prime minister also said he felt that the Islamic militant
group Hamas posed more of a threat to his safety than Jewish
extremists. He said Hamas had put a price on his head.
	   Israeli police began investigating two ultranationalist Jews,
Noam Federman and Rabbi Moshe Levinger, on suspicion they incited
to violence against the prime minister.
	   Delivering a eulogy Tuesday for a Jewish settler killed by
Palestinian militants in the West Bank town of Hebron, Federman
held Netanyahu and his land-for-peace policy responsible.
	   ``We need to take down a man like this,'' Federman told the
mourners of Danny Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron.
	   As part of the new security arrangement, Netanyahu has been
asked by the Shin Bet security service to stay away from large
crowds, Israel radio said.
	   From now on, Netanyahu will travel in helicopters when visiting
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a major road near his home may be
closed to restrict access, the report said.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said that ``whether or not he
(Netanyahu) is in danger, his public activities have not been
curtailed.''
	   Concern in Israel over renewed political violence grew after
hundreds of Jewish settlers gathered outside Netanyahu's home on
Monday evening, several hours after the slaying of Vargas.
	   Some in the crowd chanted ``traitor, traitor.''
	   Demonstrators also held up a large drawing showing Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shake blood-stained hands.
	   The protests came as Israelis prepared for the third anniversary
of the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist Jews. The assailant, Yigal Amir, said he killed
the prime minister because he wanted to stop the handover of land.

IOC president attends Alexandru Siperco's funeral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Alexandru Siperco, who served as a
member of the IOC for 43 years until his death at the age of 77,
was remembered Wednesday as a man who dedicated his life to the
Olympic movement.
	   Siperco, the longest serving member of the International Olympic
Committee, died Monday of a heart attack at his home in Bucharest.
He had been an IOC member since 1955.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was among those who
attended Siperco's funeral Wednesday at the Sfanta Vineri cemetery
in Bucharest.
	   ``Thank you, Alexandru, for everything you did,'' Samaranch
said.
	   Samaranch said he lost a friend and a man who spent most of his
life working for the Olympic movement.
	   The Orthodox funeral ceremony was also attended by several
Romanian celebrities and officials, including the former tennis
star and head of Romania's Olympic Committee, Ion Tiriac.
	   Siperco, born in Tataresti in 1920, was president of the
Romanian Olympic Committee from 1952 to 1959.
	   He was an IOC executive board member from 1979 to 1986, and IOC
vice president from 1982 to 1986.
	   Siperco became the ``doyen'' of the IOC when the Grand Duke of
Luxembourg, who had served on the IOC since 1946, resigned earlier
this year.

Mir crew unpacks cargo ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Mir space station's two cosmonauts unloaded
food, water, fuel and New Year's gifts Wednesday from the latest
cargo ship to dock with the space station.
	   The 2.5 tons of supplies aboard the Progress ship, which docked
with Mir on Tuesday, also included a giant space mirror that is
expected to reflect sunlight into some of the chilly reaches of
northern Russia during the long winter nights.
	   The Znamya, or Banner, mirror is to be unfurled in February,
when the Progress is jettisoned from Mir.
	   Mir's crew _ cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev _
also retrieved their New Year's gifts from the cargo ship _ marked
plainly ``Do Not Open Until Dec. 31,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The Progress was the third and last cargo ship to fly to Mir
this year. It also delivered scientific equipment for collecting
data about a micro-meteorite cloud, which the Mir is expected to
enter in mid-November.
	   Padalka and Avdeyev plan to make a spacewalk on Nov. 11 to
install the equipment, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, India (AP) _ India rode on Sachin Tendulkar's
electrifying performance to post a commanding total of 307 for
eight wickets in the Wills International Cup quarterfinal against
Australia in the Bangabandhu national stadium Wednesday.
	   Tendulkar's quickfire 141 for 125 balls was the centerpiece of
the Indian innings that had a horrible start with the loss of two
quick wickets of opener Saurav Ganguly for one and skipper Mohammad
Azharuddin for no score when the board read just eight.
	   But India recovered swiftly with Tendulkar's two super
partnerships with Rahul Dravid (140) and Ajay Jadeja (132). The
three helped India put up a score that left Australia chasing a
score of more than six an over.
	   For Australia, Michael Kasprowicz was the most successful bowler
claiming three wickets for 71 runs.
	   But the two early wickets turned out to be the last success for
the Australians for a long time as Tendulkar and Dravid took the
Aussie challenge and scored freely on the newly laid Bangabandhu
national stadium wicket.
	   Tendulkar raced to his 50 in 46 balls with 10 boundaries and
then cracked his 100 off 94 deliveries.
	   The Australians managed to stem the runs, but only at the end of
the Indian innings when they got four wickets within a short span
of time.

Libya denies it is delaying the hand-over of the Lockerbie suspects

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has denied U.S._British allegations
that it is delaying the hand-over of two men wanted for the blowing
up of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Libya ``does not accept the claim that
it is procrastinating to gain time as the other sides claim,'' the
official Libyan news agency said Wednesday in a report received in
Cairo.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of delaying
the case and warned it would face stiffer U.N. sanctions if it did
not hand over for trial two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people in 1988.
	   In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S._British plan
for the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial
in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but
called for further negotiations and later insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail. The
plan calls for sentences to be served in a British prison.
	   The Libyan foreign ministry said it was astonished by the
``harmony'' between the British and U.S. statements which
``confirms Libya's warning that the British-American initiative is
nothing more than a trick.''
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the defendants. The sanctions include a ban on air links
with Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oil
equipment.
	   The statement said Libya had sent a legal team to the United
Nations to discuss the guarantees for the suspects in the event of
a trial in the Netherlands. It was still waiting for answers from
the parties concerned.
	   The U.N. secretariat has called for a meeting between all
parties on Nov. 9, the statement added.

Japan edges Egypt 1-0 in goodwill match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSAKA (AP) _ Japan edged Egypt 1-0 on Masashi Nakayama's
25th-minute penalty kick in a goodwill soccer match Wednesday.
	   Both teams stressed defense, with midfielders often playing
defensive roles, until the goal by Nakayama, one of the highest
scorers in the professional Japan League.
	   South Korean referee Kim Young-joo whistled Egyptian defender
Mohamed Owara for bringing down Nakayama from behind as the
Japanese forward took control of a pass from Brazilian-born Wagner
Lopes and began racing toward the goal.
	   Italian-based midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, on a visit for the
match, narrowly missed scoring another goal for Japan when his shot
from close range met a fingertip save by Egyptian goalie Nader El
Sayed in the 72nd minute.
	   The Egyptians never got truly close to a goal, with the Japanese
outshooting them 4-1.

Kuril Islands ask Moscow mayor for patronage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ If they can't become part of Japan, the disputed
Kuril Islands want to be part of Moscow, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   The head of the South Kuril administration, Vladimir Zema, has
written to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov asking him to take the Kurils
under his patronage and draw investors' attention to the islands,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   On Tuesday, Zema said the South Kurils administration was also
circulating a petition to lease the islands to Japan on a long-term
basis, using a 1992 presidential decree that allows to lease land
to foreigners for up to 99 years.
	   Zema said the petition was driven by the federal government's
``complete indifference to the problems of a remote province.''
	   The Soviet Union seized the Kuril Islands from Japan at the end
of World War II, and the dispute has prevented the Russia and Japan
from signing a peace treaty.

IOC official ends evaluation of Olympic sites in Austria, Italy,
</HEADLINE>
Slovenia

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ An evaluation team of the
International Olympic Committee has completed its inspection of
potential Austrian, Italian and Slovenian sites for the 1996 Winter
Games, but its chairman didn't go beyond praising the
``professional'' joint candidacy.
	   Under the catchword ``Klagenfurt 2006,'' the southern Austrian
province of Carinthia, Giulia Venezia in Italy and Slovenia have
pooled efforts to compete together for staging the Winter Olympics
in eight years. The Austrian city of Innsbruck organized Winter
Games in both 1964 and 1976.
	   ``I can only congratulate (you) on this professional
candidacy,'' Chiharu Igaya, the chairman of the IOC's evaluation
commission was quoted as saying Tuesday at the end of the panel's
three-day visit to the region.
	   He said the task of the mission was not to make suggestions or
voice criticism but to make a technical appraisal of the
application on the basis of 18 themes established by the IOC,
adding he would submit a report on his visit to be drafted after
visiting all candidates by the end of January 1999.
	   The 2006 Games wil be awarded on June 19, 1999 in Seoul, South
Korea.
	   ``We have discovered a region which has very much to offer for
the Winter Olympic Games,'' Igaya said according to the Austria
Press Agency.
	   He cited the great tradition of winter sports, the experience
with big events, the excellent infrastructure, the Olympic Village
as well as the great support from authorities and the population.
But he said it was a weakness that the individual sites are
``scattered somewhat far apart.''
	   Told by his hosts that this was also the case in Nagano, Japan,
where Igaya was part of the organizing committee, Igaya, as quoted
by APA, replied, ``I hope these problems do not reappear once
more.''
	   The evaluation commission was scheduled to travel Wednesday from
Klagenfurt, the Carinthia province capital, to Poprad, Slovakia.
The last leg of its tour is the joint candidacy of Helsinki and
Lillehammer in Norway. Sion in Switzerland and Turin, Italy,
already have been assessed.

Cambodian conference hailed for sharing mine clearing techniques
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Participants praised a three-day
conference that ended Wednesday as a landmark effort at sharing
land mine clearing techniques among affected countries and giving
donors a closer look at what is needed.
	   Donor representatives praised Cambodia's mine clearance program
and said they were encouraged by the cooperation achieved among the
mine-infested countries that attended.
	   ``I was very interested to participate and watch mine-affected
countries share their problems,'' Japanese Foreign Ministry
official Hideaki Ueda told reporters.
	   ``We learned to focus on what mine-affected countries need, and
on the other side, they learned what donors want to see,'' said
Ueda, whose government sponsored the conference.
	   Participants traveled Tuesday to the Cambodian Mine Action
Center's training center 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Phnom
Penh for a presentation of community-based mine awareness programs
and mine clearance techniques employed in Cambodia.
	   ``Now they can see the real facts, the real life of what they
are contributing to,'' CMAC Director General Sam Sotha said of the
donors.
	   Cambodia is estimated to have 4 million to 6 million land mines
buried within its borders following decades of civil war. One in
every 250 Cambodians has had limbs amputated because of
mine-related injuries.
	   Cambodia's mine clearance program is considered one of the most
advanced in the world. Sam Sotha said CMAC's future efforts would
focus on speeding up mine clearance while maintaining international
standards.
	   ``Our main goal is to clear quicker,'' he said, adding that new
mechanical methods had proven much faster than removing mines by
hand.
	   ``Previously it has been said that it would take 170 years to
clear all the mines in Cambodia. Now we are happy to say it can be
done in 30 to 40 years,'' he said.

US AID official says humanitarian catastrophe averted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. humanitarian aid official
said Wednesday he no longer feared thousands of Kosovo refugees
would die this winter because they now had sufficient clothes, food
and shelter.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
said Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
	   Parmer said that just seven months ago, on his last trip to the
war-torn Serbian province, 50,000 people were living in the woods,
most lacking even plastic sheeting for cover.
	   Now, many of those who fled when violence broke out in February
have returned to villages, either living with friends or relatives
or in some cases, gone back home. Parmer estimated that
approximately 10,000 people were still sleeping in the woods with
minimal shelter.
	   ``I think we will see no deaths due to isolation or lack of
food,'' he said.
	   Parmer arrived Monday in Pristina aboard a plane carrying
medical supplies and blankets for the refugees.

Thai baht rises to highest level in more than a year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's baht reached its highest
value in more than a year Wednesday, as spot trading in the
currency closed at 36.85 to the dollar.
	   ``The baht can still rise further to test the next dollar
support at 36.50 baht,'' said a dealer at Citibank, echoing market
sentiment that the baht will strengthen further.
	   The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the baht
appreciated on continued dollar selling by overseas hedge funds and
local exporters.
	   At Wednesday's close, the baht was 29.8 percent below its level
before Thailand abandoned its fixed foreign exchange system on July
2, 1997. On Jan. 12 this year, it touched its low point of 56.45 to
the dollar.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul told a news
conference Wednesday that the baht has strengthened on a current
account surplus and inflows of foreign investment.
	   Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Kitti Patpongpibul said Tuesday
the country generated a current account surplus of nearly dlrs 1
billion a month in 1998. Kitti added that since the start of the
year, about dlrs 3.3 billion in foreign currencies have flowed into
Thailand.
	   Capital inflows are a small part of the baht's rise, but dollar
weakness is the main factor, said a dealer at a U.S. bank in
Singapore, also requesting anonymity.
	   ``The Bank of Thailand is buying dollars constantly, and they
should be,'' he said, citing the dollar's decline as a way for the
central bank to take advantage of a buyer's market for dollars.
	   Chatu Mongol said the baht's strengthening has reduced the
nation's foreign debt servicing commitment in baht terms.
	   ``When the dollar drops one baht, it means Thailand pays 87
billion baht less of foreign debt in baht terms,'' he said.
	   He said Thailand currently has outstanding foreign debt of dlrs
87 billion, of which dlrs 60 billion is from the private sector.
	   The collapse of the baht was a key element spurring Asia's
financial crisis, whose effects are still severe.
	   Thai Deputy Finance Minister Pichase Panvichatikul said
Wednesday that ``given improving economic fundamentals, the baht
could be stronger, but not by much.''
	   Pichase said the baht's recent strength ``certainly will have an
adverse effect on exports, but it will help importers and foreign
debt servicing. The positives outweigh the negatives.''
	   Central bank Deputy Governor Kitti said Tuesday the central bank
has bought dollars recently to moderate the baht's rise, and to
settle forward swap contracts.
	   Some analysts now see the baht settling at 36 to the dollar by
year-end.
	   The baht's advance is in tandem with other Asian currencies
against the dollar, which has weakened markedly since the U.S.
Federal Reserve cut interest rates twice in the past month.

<TEXT>
	   OSNABRUECK, Germany (AP) _ Auto engineer and manufacturer
Wilhelm Karmann, whose curvy, bug-like 1950s sports car _ the
Karmann-Ghia _ bore his name and brought him international
recognition, has died. He was 83.
	   Karmann died Sunday after a lengthy undisclosed illness.
	   Sports cars were Karmann's specialty, particularly convertibles.
He designed and built the Karmann-Ghia in 1955 in cooperation with
Volkswagen and Porsche, and went on to design the Scirocco-Coupe
and Golf Cabriolet for VVolkswagen. He also built cars for Porsche,
BMW, Opel, Ford and Mercedes-Benz.
	   Karmann was 19 when he started working in his family's car
factory in the northeastern city of Osnabrueck. He took over the
firm in 1952, with 1,452 employees and annual sales at 24 million
mark (dlrs 15 million). By 1989, the firm had 7,000 employees and
annual sales at 1 billion marks (dlrs 625 million).
	   Information about surviving family members and funeral
arrangements was not immediately available.

NATO keeps up guard in Kosovo as some refugees return

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Having deferred airstrikes for the
moment, NATO on Wednesday revealed plans for more spy plane flights
to make sure President Slobodan Milosevic continues to withdraw
forces from Kosovo and allows tens of thousands of refugees to
return home.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said Wednesday
that the withdrawal of Serb forces was not complete but so far it
represented a ``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling
the demands.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military alliance
did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one
expired Tuesday.
	   That was a bitter disappointment to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
politicians, who had been hoping that NATO would deliver a
devastating blow to the Yugoslav war machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet Hamiti of the League of
Democratic Kosovo said Wednesday.
	   But by warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back.
	   Despite the uncertainty, a senior U.S. humanitarian aid official
said Wednesday he believed international actions had already
prevented thousands from dying this winter because the agreement
had enabled organizations to rush in clothing, food and other
supplies.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, told reporters.
	   Parmer said that just seven months ago, on his last trip to
Kosovo, 50,000 people were living in the woods, most lacking even
plastic sheeting for cover. Parmer said that figure had probably
dropped to about 10,000.
	   ``I think we will see no deaths due to isolation or lack of
food,'' he said.
	   Still, it is unclear how many refugees were returning home
Wednesday. In Geneva, Switzerland, U.N. refugee agency spokesman
Kris Janowski said there ``has been some movement but at the same
time the people are still apprehensive.''
	   Janowski said men in some areas were returning to check the
condition of homes abandoned during the fighting but it was unclear
whether most felt it was safe to bring back their wives and
children.
	   To back up its demands, NATO decided to keep more than 400
warplanes on alert. On Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced at its
Mediterranean headquarters in Italy that American P-3C Orion
surveillance will begin regular flights over Kosovo on Sunday.
	   The planes can fly for 10-12 hours without refueling and will
help monitor the situation day and night regardless of the weather.
The Navy said it conducted a few such flights around the time of
the first NATO deadline Oct. 17.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
accelerating efforts to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to
verify compliance on the ground.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said after a meeting of NATO
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' he added. ``I urge both sides
to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward.''
	   In an Oct. 12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
demanded that Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in
Kosovo to the levels of last February, when Milosevic began his
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have
died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo is a province in
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters that NATO would move quickly to use force against
Yugoslavia if Milosevic sends troops and special police back to
Kosovo.
	   Albright said the NATO allies were organizing a rapid-reaction
force based in neighboring Macedonia to protect _ if necessary _
the 2,000 unarmed personnel who will verify that Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   A spokesman for the OSCE said Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was
due in Pristina on Thursday to take charge of the verification
operation.
	   International officials hope the continued pressure will
encourage many refugees to return home. Many of them are camping in
the woods and hills, fearful that Serb police will shoot at them if
they tried to go back.

Yugoslav and U.N. officials appeal for release of abducted
</HEADLINE>
reporters

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's information minister
appealed Wednesday to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to help win
the release of two Serbian journalists still held captive by ethnic
Albanian armed rebels in Kosovo.
	   Goran Matic urged Annan to use all his influence as U.N. chief
to free Nebojsa Radosevic and Vladimir Dobricic, Belgrade-based
reporters of the Yugoslav official news agency Tanjug.
	   The two went missing Oct. 18 while on assignment in the war-torn
Kosovo province. Later, the Kosovo Liberation Army which has been
fighting government troops to secede the province from Yugoslavia,
confirmed they held the two and would release them after an
unspecified checking procedure.
	   Also Wednesday, Jiri Dienstbier, the top U.N. human rights
official, told a news conference in Belgrade he had demanded from
the KLA's representative Adem Demaci the immediate release of the
journalists.
	   Dienstbier said Demaci's answer was that the two abducted were
``alive and OK'' but still being questioned by the ethnic Albanian
rebels if they were spies.
	   ``I told Mr. Demaci they'd be OK if they are released,''
Dienstbier said.
	   Another Serbian reporter and his driver have been missing in
Kosovo since August but without any indication that they are still
alive.

Undersea earthquakes rock Indonesian islands; no injuries, damage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quake hitting Ternate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two undersea earthquakes shook some
remote Indonesian islands Wednesday, but there were no immediate
reports of injuries or damage, seismologists said.
	   The strongest one, with a magnitude of 5.6, struck Ternate
Island in northern Maluku at 3:53 p.m. (0653 GMT), Indonesia's
Meteorology and Geophysics Bureau said.
	   It was centered in the Maluku Sea, 65 kilometers (40 miles) west
of Ternate. The island, 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) northeast of
Jakarta, also had been by a 5.1 quake Saturday.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a magnitude 5.2 earthquake centered 399
kilometers (250 miles) north of Bitung on Sulawesi Island rocked
Ternate and parts of neighboring Halmahera Island.
	   It was recorded at 4:16 a.m. (2116 GMT Tuesday), and was also
felt in Bitung, 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles) northeast of
Jakarta, as well as other parts of north Sulawesi.
	   A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage if
centered near an urban area.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from North America across to Japan, through
Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and New Zealand.

New German minister conciliatory on ending nuclear power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new environment minister is
ready to negotiate with utilities to phase out nuclear power plants
rather than forcing a shutdown by law, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Juergen Trittin, the first member of the environmentalist Greens
party to hold the post, had warned the power industry only last
weekend that the new government has the votes in parliament to push
through its plans for phasing out nuclear reactors.
	   Now, he was quoted as telling the weekly Die Woche, ``We want to
achieve it through consensus, as far as possible. It's easier than
through conflict.''
	   However, he said talks would also focus on how to involve
utility companies in plans for alternative power supplies.
	   Trittin repeated his goal to start shutting down reactors before
the next election in 2002.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his Green coalition partners
have agreed to move toward shutting down Germany's 19 nuclear power
stations, but no timetable has been set.
	   As a first step, the government plans shutdown negotiations with
the power industry, which has threatened to sue for billions of
marks (dollars) in damages if the administration closes nuclear
plants without its consent.
	   Schroeder's economics minister Werner Mueller, who has no party
affiliation, has warned the plan could only succeed with the
agreement of the utility companies.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Tournament newcomer Roni Agustinus of
Indonesia upset ninth seed Thomas Stuer Lauridsen of Denmark 15-5,
15-7 Wednesday, opening day of the Indonesian Badminton Open
championship.
	   Lauridsen, a finalist in last year's Hong Kong Open, was the
first foreign player eliminated from the dlrs 120,000 tournament,
which runs until Sunday.
	   In women's singles, his compatriot Mette Sorensen advanced to
the second round by beating Felsinka, another Indonesian, 11-5,
11-3.
	   Yong Hock Kin of Malaysia beat Indonesia's Agung Kuncoro 15-4,
15-2 in another men's first-round match.
	   Only 27 foreign competitors, from Denmark, Malaysia, England,
Poland and Brunei, are playing in the championship, which is
missing many of the world's top players except Dane Olympic
medalist Poul Erik Hoyer Larsen.
	   Economic crisis has prevented many countries, including
badminton power China, from sending players to battle the 42
Indonesians in the field.

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS attribution in 3rd graf, UPDATES with Palestinians saying
Israelis and Palestinians met Wednesday in Tel Aviv to discuss
security plan &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time next week, officials said Wednesday.
	   As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat earlier this week.
	   An official close to the talks said Albright also spoke to
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, but the report could not be
confirmed independently.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Larry Schwartz, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv,
said it was important to uphold the timetable. ``All sides must
begin implementation next Monday night,'' Schwartz said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of a
delay when he announced Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely
postponing a Cabinet meeting that was to have approved the deal.
	   Netanyahu insisted Wednesday that he needed Cabinet backing and
that he would not start the pullback until he did.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   However, U.S. officials and Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Cabinet approval was not a prerequisite for
Netanyahu to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's office said in a statement the Cabinet meeting was
postponed because the Palestinians had not yet submitted a detailed
work plan on security to the United States as they had promised.
	   However, Israeli media said the main reason for the delay was
Netanyahu's concern that he would not get a majority in his Cabinet
for the troop withdrawal.
	   Several Israeli Cabinet ministers who initially said they were
undecided have announced in recent days that they would vote
against the agreement.
	   One Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials met in
Tel Aviv on Wednesday to discuss the security plan.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians were
aware of Monday's deadline and would present their plan to the
Americans by then.

EU Commission proposes ban on Portuguese beef because of mad cow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fischler, Bonino press conference, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday to ban the export of beef from Portugal for nine months
and to bar the export of live cattle for at least 18 months from
the country.
	   EU's Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said the proposed ban on
beef exports will expire after nine months unless there is still
evidence of meat safety problems in Portugal.
	   The proposed ban on cattle exports will be reviewed after 18
months, Fischler told a news conference.
	   The two proposals by the EU executive Commission must be
endorsed by a majority of EU countries. An EU veterinary committee
is expected to vote on the issue Friday.
	   The two proposals do not affect exports from Portugal's Azores
Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean, Fischler said.
	   The EU sent two monitoring missions to Portugal this year. The
EU found that between May and October the cases of mad cow disease
had doubled, from 30 to over 60.
	   ``The situation is serious,'' the EU's Commissioner for Consumer
Affairs Emma Bonino told reporters.
	   There are currently 67 cases of mad cow disease - or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy - in Portugal. BSE in beef has been
linked to a fatal brain ailment in humans.
	   The Commission has claimed Portugal was not enforcing an EU ban
on the use of the remains of bovine animals in feed for bovine
animals.
	   It has also said that Portugal was not enforcing EU rules on the
treatment of bovine animal remains used in feed for pigs and
poultry. BSE is believed to have spread in Europe through animal
feed.
	   ``There is a higher, increasing incidence of BSE, as well as a
weakness in controls, protective measures,'' EU spokesman Gerry
Kiely said.
	   But the ban is unlikely to influence the European beef market,
Fischler said, as Portugal is a small player on the market.
	   Last year, Portugal exported 1,500 tons of beef: 700 tons went
to Spain, 600 to Angola and 200 to Belgium and Luxembourg. Portugal
also exported 1,600 tons of live cattle, the vast majority of which
went to Spain.
	   The Commission says it will help compensate Portugal financially
for the ban, but said it was too early to give a figure.

Serb former police chief pleads innocent to war crimes charges

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb former police chief
pleaded innocent Wednesday to Yugoslav war crimes tribunal charges
that he murdered, tortured and raped Muslims and Croats in 1992.
	   Stevan Todorovic faces 15 charges stemming from atrocities he
allegedly committed while serving as police chief in the northern
Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac.
	   Appearing at his second arraignment hearing, Todorovic answered
``not guilty'' after each charge was read.
	   He will stand trial with three other Bosnian Serbs in custody
who are charged under the same indictment. If convicted, he faces a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   Prosecutors allege that Todorovic, 40, oversaw a ruthless
campaign of terror and discrimination by Serb forces that drove all
but a handful of non-Serbs from Bosanski Samac in 1992 and 1993.
	   Todorovic was initially arraigned last month, but claimed he was
too sick to enter pleas because he had been clubbed in the head
with a baseball bat during his arrest by NATO forces in northern
Bosnia.
	   But on Wednesday he said he was ready to plead.
	   ``I feel much better,'' Todorovic told the U.N. court. ``Thank
you for the high regard for me and my health.''
	   A neurological examination found no abnormalities, presiding
Judge Claude Jorda said, and a brain scan previously requested by
Todorovic was not necessary.
	   Todorovic is the ninth suspect arrested by NATO forces in
Bosnia. He allegedly beat and kicked one Muslim to death, beat or
tortured six others, and forced two prisoners to perform sexual
acts on each other while Serb guards watched _ an allegation that
warrants a rape charge under the tribunal's rules.
	   The tribunal was set up in 1993 to bring to justice those
responsible for atrocities during fighting in the former
Yugoslavia. It has indicted 58 suspects and has 26 in custody.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Spreading fear across the western
Caribbean on Wednesday, one of the century's most powerful
hurricanes forced tens of thousands to flee, dumped torrents of
rain, mowed down trees and damaged homes. At least 14 people were
reported killed.
	   Hurricane Mitch hovered 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the coast
of Honduras on Wednesday morning, its downpours causing rivers to
flood across Honduras, Belize and elsewhere in Central America and
Mexico.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said up to 20 inches
(50 centimeters) of rain could fall on mountain areas.
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph (305-kph) winds. By 1200
GMT Wednesday, the 350-mile (600-kilometer) wide storm still packed
a punch, but its winds were down to 120 mph (205 kph), with higher
gusts.
	   More than 45,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
low-lying areas of Honduras, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel,
chief of the National Emergency Committee. Many towns were cut off
by 50 flooded rivers.
	   One of them was La Ceiba, a city of 40,000, whose two highways
out were both cut. To the east, the pillars of the Saopin bridge
were weakened by a swollen river and the bridge sagged into the
water. To the west, the Pico Bonito bridge was entirely washed
away.
	   Electricity was out in the entire city, and the sea moved a
half-block into town in some places. Fireman Tomas Hayden said
officials had banned private cars in the city of 40,000 to ease
emergency rescue work.
	   Waves crashed against the walls of seafront discos and people
waded through knee-deep water with furniture on their backs to flee
flooded houses.
	   In the Barrio Ingles shantytown, the ground was entirely covered
in white foam from the surf, making it look like it had snowed.
	   Twelve-year-old Dalixa Reyes wandered through the foam in the
lashing rain, looking for her parents and brothers and sisters. She
lives with other relatives a few blocks away.
	   ``I'm worried about my family, my friends, about the people who
live here,'' she said.
	   She found them, standing on a flooded sidewalk gazing at the
destruction in awe.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts like Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on pumping
oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Belize, most of the 75,000 people in Belize City fled inland
in cars and government buses. With gasoline stations running dry,
the government of neighboring Belize commandeered private buses to
help people move inland from coastal Belize City, which was almost
destroyed by Hurricane Hattie in 1961.
	   Port officials at Chetumal, Mexico, said a wave kicked up by
Hurricane Mitch washed a Connecticut man off a catamaran south of
Cancun on Monday and he was presumed dead. He was identified as
Robert Gates, 55, of Niantic.
	   Honduras reported five deaths _ one in a collapsed house, two
men electrocuted when they were blown off a roof, one man drowned
in a swollen river and another killed as he crossed a bridge on his
bicycle; the river tore away the bridge with him on it.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains.
	   On Tuesday, Mitch blasted the Honduran Bay Island of Guanaja, 75
miles (125 kilometers) northeast of La Ceiba, ripping the metal
roofing off hundreds of houses and knocking out power and
telephones. Many residents took shelter on larger nearby islands.
	   ``It's raining hard and the winds are very strong,'' said Marta
Ondina, a worker at the Hong Kong restaurant on Roatan, an island a
few miles (kilometers) west of Guanaja.
	   ``They have taken people from the shore to churches and more
secure places,'' she said by telephone. ``The people are very
worried. There is no power.''
	   Tina Haylock, a Guanaja resident visiting Tegucigalpa, the
capital, told Canal 5 television that she had talked to her family
early Wednesday and they told her 14 people had died on the island.
The report couldn't be confirmed.
	   She said most of the houses in the town of Sandy Bay were
destroyed, and that everyone had taken refuge in a shelter.
	   Mitch appeared nearly stalled Wednesday over Guanaja, moving
very slowing toward Honduras' coast. The hurricane center said it
was expected to head west later in the day, but the storm's slow
pace made its movements unpredictable.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.

IAAF honors Cacho, Meert with Silver Order of Merit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ Former Olympic 1,500-meter champion Fermin
Cacho and Wilfried Meert, director of the Memorial Van Damme meet
in Brussels, have been named IAAF Silver Order of Merit winners.
	   The two will pick up the awards Thursday during the
International Amateur Athletic Federation's World Calendar
Conference in this southern Spanish city.
	   In recognizing Cacho's achievements, the world governing body of
track and field described him as the ``greatest'' Spanish track and
field athlete of all time.
	   Cacho, 29, won gold at 1,500 meters at the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics and silver in '96 at Atlanta. He also won silver in the
'93 and '97 world championships over the same distance.
	   Cacho is also the European record holder for 1,500 meters (3
minutes 28.95 seconds) and has won 10 national titles indoor and
outdoor since 1989.
	   Meert, a former middle-distance runner, has been director of the
annual Memorial Van Damme meet for 22 years and ``has worked
tirelessly to make the Brussels' event a sell-out attraction,'' the
IAAF said in a statement.

FIVB approves new volleyball rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to make matches more exciting, volleyball's
world governing body decided Wednesday to change scoring rules to
award points to whichever team wins a rally, whether it is serving
or not.
	   Under current rules, only the serving team can win a point. In
the new rally point scoring system, matches will continue to be the
best of five sets, but the first four sets will be to 25 points,
instead of the current 15, and only the fifth set will be to 15
points. A team must lead by at least two points to win any of the
sets.
	   The changes, recommended by the FIVB Board of Administration,
will take effect next year. They were approved unanimously by 174
delegates representing 131 countries at the Federation
Internationale de Volleyball World Congress in Tokyo.
	   National federations that have tried the new scoring say
interest in the sport was boosted and TV coverage was easier
because the games became shorter, the FIVB said in a statement.
	   ``This major change is a historical milestone in the life of
volleyball,'' said FIVB President Ruben Acosta. ``It makes the FIVB
very confident in the future of this sport.''
	   The congress earlier approved a rule change that will allow each
team to register one specialized defensive ``libero'' player
restricted to the back row.
	   That rule, already tried out at several competitions, will be in
effect at the World Championships starting Nov. 3 in Japan. The new
scoring system will apply at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

 &UR; Portugal derides proposed beef ban, plays down `mad cow' threat

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government Wednesday scrambled to
allay public fears over meat safety after the European Union
Commission recommended an export ban on Portuguese beef and cattle
because of a surge in mad cow disease.
	   ``It is just as safe to eat meet in Portugal as in any other EU
country,'' Agriculture Minister Luis Capoulas Santos told
reporters.
	   He said the proposed ban was ``unfair, excessive and
inappropriate.''
	   The EU Commission proposed Wednesday to ban the export of beef
from mainland Portugal and its Madeira islands for nine months and
to ban the export of live cattle for at least 18 months from the
country.
	   An EU veterinary committee is expected to vote on the proposal
Friday.
	   Portugal has reported 67 new cases of mad cow disease this year.
That compares with a total of 94 cases in all the previous seven
years. Also, there are at least 28 suspected but unconfirmed cases.
	   The disease's incubation period is long, and the recent rise in
cases has sparked fears that the scale of the problem in Portugal
is only now beginning to emerge.
	   The EU proposed the ban after it found that Portugal was not
enforcing a prohibition on the use of the remains of bovine animals
in cattle feed.
	   Mad cow disease _ or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE _ is
believed to have spread in Europe through animal feed containing
bovine remains.
	   ``Some failings have indeed been detected in the controls on
feed factories, but such failings have also been discovered in 13
of the 15 EU countries ... and no measures have been taken against
them,'' Capoulas Santos said.
	   He added that new measures introduced earlier this month
tightened controls on animal feed and stressed that veterinary
controls at abattoirs and at retail outlets were adequate.
	   No cases of nvCJD, a disease similar to BSE which affects
people, have been reported in Portugal.
	   Portugal imports 40 percent of the beef it consumes. Last year,
it exported just 1.5 billion escudos (dlrs 8.8 million) worth of
beef, according to government statistics. Most of that went to
Spain which last month banned the import of Portuguese beef.

German conservatives blast ex-communists' new role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ The Christian Democrats on Wednesday
blasted a deal by the Social Democrats that lifts the former
communists into power at the state level for the first time since
German unification in 1990.
	   The Social Democrats and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
successors to the former East German communists, said late Tuesday
they had reached a coalition agreement in Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania with the PDS as junior partner.
	   Germany's conservatives, who in the past have likened the former
communists to neo-Nazis, were stung.
	   ``Only nine years after overcoming the barbed wire barriers and
the Berlin Wall, the SPD permits the heirs to return to power,''
said the Christian Democrats' general secretary, Peter Hintze.
	   He accused the Social Democrats, who won national elections last
month, of betraying East Germans who took part in the peaceful
revolution that overthrew communism in 1989.
	   The coalition deal scraps the rule for background checks of
public officials with the federal agency that tracks ties with the
Stasi, former East Germany's dreaded secret police.
	   The Social Democrats came out on top in the eastern state's
Sept. 27 election, the Christian Democrats second, and the
ex-communists a strong third.
	   Eckhardt Rehberg, the state Christian Democratic chairman,
accused governor-elect Harald Ringstorff of deceiving voters by
sounding out his party as a possible coalition partner, too. The
talks were ``a farce,'' Rehberg said.
	   The pact must be approved by conventions of both parties
scheduled Saturday.
	   The Social Democrats have governed in another eastern German
state, Saxony-Anhalt, since 1994 with the tacit support of the PDS,
but the ex-communists have never officially been part of a
government.
	   Social Democratic leaders have ruled out working with the PDS at
the federal level, but have increasingly favored forcing the
ex-communists to shoulder responsibility in the struggling eastern
states.

crackdown
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stanisic's statement in the 9th graf; more moves
against independent media in the 18th graf, adds details in the 3rd
graf, more reaction in the 6th graf.
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite bowing to NATO demands over
Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic is reinforcing his grip on
power by firing his secret service chief and refusing to budge on
his purge of Serbia's independent media.
	   On Tuesday, the government announced that secret service chief
Jovica Stanisic had been fired and replaced by police Gen. Radomir
Markovic.
	   Stanisic, who assumed the powerful post in 1991, was considered
one of the main pillars of Milosevic's rule. Recently, he was
purportedly critical of Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo and his
alliance with ultranationalist extremists.
	   His removal indicated that hard-liners are gaining ground
against moderates within the Yugoslav government. Milosevic has
used a threat of NATO attacks against military targets in
Yugoslavia to clamp down on his opponents at home.
	   NATO said Tuesday that Milosevic had withdrawn enough forces
from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes. But the alliance reserved the
right to attack if he resumes his crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said Stanisic's replacement was
``worrying'' and reminded him of Communist purges in former
Yugoslavia. Independent media editor Slavko Curuvija said the
regime is sacking ``all those who think with their own heads.''
	   Another opposition leader, Vuk Obradovic, said Stanisic was a
``professional'' and a ``reasonable'' man. He said he expected more
key figures in Serbia to resign or be replaced.
	   Stanisic was quoted Wednesday by the independent Glas Javnosti
daily as saying he had rejected offers for another job.
	   In a statement released through the independent Beta news agency
Wednesday, Stanisic insisted that he had done nothing illegal and
was loyal to ``the Serbian president.'' The wording of the
statement indicated Stanisic feared he could be blamed for
professional wrongdoing.
	   At the same time, Milosevic shows no sign of easing up on his
crackdown on independent Serbian media. In a meeting Tuesday with
editors and broadcasters, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill promised he
would again push the issue with the autocratic president.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law severely
restricting press freedom and instituting severe fines for those
publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   ``You cannot wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said.
	   ``It is a 19th century means, not worthy even of the Ottoman
empire,'' Hill said, referring to Serbia's ancient enemy, the
Ottoman Turks.
	   Also Tuesday, independent daily NT Plus halted publication after
telephone threats to its chief editor, Momcilo Djogovic.
	   ``The new media law has turned into a widespread lynching of
journalists,'' Djogovic said.
	   On Monday, two Serbian independent daily newspapers, Nasa Borba
and Danas, which were briefly banned by the government earlier this
month, stopped publishing in protest after police raided the office
of another non-government newspaper, confiscated property and fined
the paper for alleged anti-state activity.
	   Independent B 92 radio reported Wednesday moves against Glas
Javnosti, for allegedly slandering a state official in an article.
B 92 also said the director of independent Radio Index faces
charges for broadcasting despite a government ban.
	   Monday night, police raided the apartment of Ivan Tadic, manager
of DT-press publishing company, which publishes the weekly
Evropljanin, or European. All Tadic's belongings were taken away
except his baby's crib and clothes.
	   Over the weekend, a Belgrade court fined his weekly dlrs 246,000
for publishing an article that accused Milosevic of introducing
``dictatorship.''

Sports car designer Wilhelm Karmann dies

<TEXT>
	   OSNABRUECK, Germany (AP) _ Auto engineer and manufacturer
Wilhelm Karmann, whose curvy, bug-like 1950s sports car _ the
Karmann-Ghia _ bore his name and brought him international
recognition, has died. He was 83.
	   Karmann died Sunday after a lengthy undisclosed illness.
	   Sports cars were Karmann's specialty, particularly convertibles.
He designed and built the Karmann-Ghia in 1955 in cooperation with
Volkswagen and Porsche, and went on to design the Scirocco-Coupe
and Golf Cabriolet for Volkswagen. He also built cars for Porsche,
BMW, Opel, Ford and Mercedes-Benz.
	   Karmann was 19 when he started working in his family's car
factory in the northeastern city of Osnabrueck. He took over the
firm in 1952, with 1,452 employees and annual sales at 24 million
mark (dlrs 15 million). By 1989, the firm had 7,000 employees and
annual sales at 1 billion marks (dlrs 625 million).
	   Information about surviving family members and funeral
arrangements was not immediately available.

Oil paintings to doodles: legacy of an affair with Picasso
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 18-19 with Wednesday's sale of matchbox
sketches &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PAR105-106
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Holed up like a hermit in her apartment on the Rue
de Savoie, refusing to see even her good friends, the aging Dora
Maar spent the years before her death in illness and poverty.
	   But the woman who was Pablo Picasso's dark-haired muse for eight
passionate years was surrounded by glory: paintings, drawings,
sketches, notes, cards, photos and countless other mementos of her
years with the master.
	   That treasure trove, which she refused to part with _ even when
she needed money _ is on the auction block this week. Her friends
say Maar, who died in 1997, wouldn't be happy.
	   ``Dora wanted her things to go to the church,'' said John
Richardson, a collector and friend. ``But she left only a 1958 will
that named only monks, now dead. How silly.''
	   Another close friend, James Lord, said Maar ``would be just
horrified at all this.''
	   ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' he said. ``It's
rather morbid to have it up for sale.''
	   Picasso's granddaughter, Diana Widmaier, agreed.
	   ``Some of these private things should never have gone on the
market,'' she said.
	   Whatever Maar's wishes, the auction has given art lovers a rare
chance to examine the minutiae of an affair _ from the goofy
postcards to the tiny drawings on matchbooks to a doodle on a
restaurant menu.
	   The three-day auction, which began Tuesday, was expected to
raise up to dlrs 70 million. The first evening, focusing on oil
paintings and drawings, saw sky-high prices for drawings but lower
than expected prices for some of the paintings.
	   But it is the deeply personal, slice-of-life nature of the
collection that had Parisians standing in the rain to get a
pre-auction glimpse at the Maison de la Chimie near the Eiffel
Tower.
	   Dora Maar was 29, the dark-haired daughter of a Yugoslav
architect and a French mother, when she met Picasso in 1936. She
quickly became his lover and his model.
	   But in the 1940s, Picasso moved on to the younger Francoise
Gilot, and Maar went into a tailspin.
	   Though she appeared to have no heirs, genealogists tracked down
two distant relatives, both of whom had never even heard of Maar.
Now, after the government takes 60 percent of the proceeds for
taxes, those relatives will get much of the remaining 40 percent.
	   The big-ticket items Tuesday were 10 oil paintings, including
seven of Dora herself. The highest price, 37 million francs (dlrs
6,642,729) went for the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for
Guernica)'' _ in which Dora's eyes are turned into tears pierced
with long pins.
	   Yet the favorite of many, ``Dora Maar with Green Nails,''
fetched a disappointing 23 million francs (dlrs 4,129,264.) The
1936 tableau shows the muse at the height of her style, her chin
resting on green-painted nails and hair braided on top of her head.
	   The evening's big success was the drawings, especially ``Dora
with Undone Hair,'' which went for 5 million francs (dlrs 897,666).
	   On Wednesday, a set of five sketches on torn-off matchbox lids
and bottoms fetched 1.1 million francs (dlrs 198,915). The
estimated sale price had been 40,000 francs.
	   It included ``Still life with candle,'' ``Full-length portrait
of woman,'' and ``Portrait of Dora Maar with hair in bun.''
	   But the most fascinating objects, to go on sale later this week,
are the smallest: little portraits of Dora made into jewelry,
little instruments made from the silver wrapping around a wine
cork, dozens of sketches on tiny matchbook covers, photographs of
the dashing Picasso at all ages, original books, notes, postcards,
and letters.
	   Nothing, it seems, was too small or insignificant for Picasso to
scrawl on. One matchbook says: ``It was so dark at noon that the
stars could be seen.'' A restaurant menu is adorned with a
whimsical self-portrait of the artist.
	   And perhaps the oddest but most poignant item from this lover's
cache: a scrap of paper with a brownish stain, and the scrawled
words, ``Blood of Picasso.''

Official: no thefts of nuclear materials in recent years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ No radioactive materials have been reported stolen
from Russia's nuclear facilities for the past three years, thanks
to more efficient controls and growing apprehension that they are
hard to sell, officials said Wednesday.
	   Nikolai Redin, who oversees security issues at the Nuclear
Energy Ministry said there were about 30 thefts of radioactive
substances in 1992-1995, although none of them involved
weapons-grade materials.
	   No thefts have been reported since, Redin was quoted by the
ITAR-Tass news agency as saying.
	   Moscow has long denied the disappearance of any weapons-grade
material, which in large quantities could be used in nuclear bombs
or warheads.
	   Most of the earlier thefts were by impoverished nuclear workers,
excited by media speculation about the growing black market demand
for enriched uranium, Redin said.
	   ``There is no black market, there is a regular one on which you
can legally buy and sell uranium on regular prices,'' he said.
	   Redin said that a new automatic safety system at Russia's
nuclear facilities, set up with help from the United States and the
European Union, has helped to significantly improve nuclear safety.

Five Albanian stowaways narrowly escape being burned to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTHERAM, England (AP) _ Five ethnic Albanian stowaways hidden
among scrap metal in the back of a truck escaped death when they
jumped off just before the driver tipped his load into a blazing
furnace, police said Wednesday.
	   The Albanians from Kosovo had been hiding among the metal for
three days when the truck stopped Tuesday afternoon at a British
Steel plant in this north England town.
	   ``The load was just about to be put on the furnace when the five
men were spotted climbing out,'' said a spokesman for the South
Yorkshire police force, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. `` I don't think they expected such a hot reception when
they decided to come to England.''
	   The men were arrested and handed over to immigration officials.
	   Ten other ethnic Albanians found in the back of a truck in
nearby Castleford were also arrested Tuesday, police said.

Rios returns to beat Haas; Ivanisevic, Krajicek also through

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios reached the third round
the Eurocard Open on Wednesday by defeating Tommy Haas, against
whom he had to retire last week because of a hamstring injury.
	   Rios appeared fit and won 6-3, 7-5 to keep alive his hopes of
knocking down Pete Sampras from the No. 1 spot in the final season
rankings.
	   Sampras played against Nicolas Kiefer later in the day as all
top-ranked six players in the world went into action in the dlrs
2.45 million tournament.
	   Rios, who held the No. 1 ranking on two occasions for a total of
six weeks earlier this year, had to retire against Haas on Saturday
in the semifinals in Lyon, France, suffering from a hamstring
injury in his left leg.
	   The Chilean wasted one match point in the ninth game of the
second set and squandered two more before breaking Haas' serve to
win the match in 75 minutes. Rios had also broken the German's
serve to win the first set.
	   Rios leads the tour with seven titles this year and he could
take the No. 1 spot if Sampras loses in the second or third round
and the Chilean reaches the final.
	   Alex Corretja, the seventh-seeded Spaniard who beat Haas in the
Lyon final, was upset by Jan-Michael Gambill, losing 6-2, 6-4. The
American is ranked No. 50 in the world.
	   With so many top players in action, three former winners of the
tournament were relegated to play in a smaller neighborhood hall.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, overpowered Wayne Ferreira 6-4,
7-6 (8-6), while Richard Krajicek, a former Wimbledon champion,
ousted Magnus Norman 6-4, 6-1.
	   Petr Korda, the defending champion who is seeded fifth this
year, played later against Thomas Johansson.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, the 12th-seeded Swede, advanced by beating
Gianluca Pozzi, an Italian qualifier, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

Arena names all-MLS roster, nine debutantes for Australia match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Bruce Arena fulfilled his promise to immediately
rebuild the U.S. national team with young MLS players on Wednesday,
selecting nine first-timers for his roster for the Americans' Nov.
6 friendly against Australia.
	   All 22 play in Major League Soccer, only three were over 30 and
only five were members of the France '98 squad: forwards Brian
McBride of Columbus and Joe-Max Moore of New England, midfielder
Cobi Jones of Los Angeles, and defenders Jeff Agoos and Eddie Pope
of Arena's D.C. United.
	   Two others were considered, but Columbus midfielder Brian
Maisonneuve is still recovering from an injury and New England
defender Mike Burns is getting married the weekend of the Australia
match.
	   Arena, who was announced Tuesday as the coach to replace Steve
Sampson following the Americans' debacle at the World Cup, said
during his news conference about half of his roster for the
Australia match would be players who had never played for their
country.
	   On Wednesday, Arena selected MLS Rookie of the Year Ben Olden
from his own D.C. United to lead the pack, along with Los Angeles
midfielder Clint Mathis, Chicago Fire forward Josh Wolff, and
defenders Mike Petke of the MetroStars, Leo Cullen of Miami and
C.J. Brown of Chicago.
	   Also getting their first call were goalkeepers Kevin Hartman of
Los Angeles and David Kramer of San Jose and midfielder Richie
Williams of D.C.
	   Several others have three or fewer caps including Chicago
goalkeeper Zach Thornton and midfielders Paul Bravo of Colorado,
Eddie Lewis of San Jose and Ante Razov of Chicago.
	   No members of the ``old guard'' which created the core of the
United States team in the last three World Cups were included on
the roster: Eric Wynalda, Tab Ramos, Marcelo Balboa, Alexi Lalas or
John Harkes _ the team's former captain who was surprisingly
dismissed by Sampson a month before France '98.
	   Also on Wednesday, the U.S. federation announced it would play
Germany in a friendly Feb. 6 in Jacksonville, Florida.
	   The game will be part of a two-game tour in the United States by
Germany during the Bundesliga's winter break. It will face Colombia
three days later in Miami's Orange Bowl.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; U.S. Roster &QC; 
	   Goalkeepers: Kevin Hartman (Los Angeles), David Kramer (San Jose
Clash), Zach Thornton (Chicago).
	   Defenders: Jeff Agoos (D.C. United), C.J. Brown (Chicago), Leo
Cullen (Miami), Robin Fraser (Los Angeles), Mike Petke (New
York-New Jersey), Eddie Pope (D.C. United).
	   Midfielders: Mark Chung (Kansas City), Cobi Jones (Los Angeles),
Eddie Lewis (San Jose), Clint Mathis (Los Angeles), Ben Olsen (D.C.
United), Steve Ralston (Tampa Bay), Richie Williams (D.C. United).
	   Forwards: Paul Bravo (Colorado), Roy Lassiter (D.C. United),

Chinese pilot's hijacking of own jet to Taiwan puzzles authorities

<TEXT>
	   TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) _ Professing frustration over pay and
working conditions, the captain of an Air China jet with 104 people
aboard hijacked his own flight Wednesday, landing in Taiwan in a
case that left authorities puzzled.
	   ``I feel relaxed,'' Yuan Bin said in a brief exchange with
reporters, after prosecutors questioned him at the airport before
taking him to court. ``I shall have no regret whatever happens to
me.''
	   Yuan diverted flight CA905 from its first scheduled stop, the
southwestern Chinese city of Kunming, and headed toward Taiwan just
20 minutes after taking off from Beijing, the director of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration, Chang Kuo-cheng, told a news
conference.
	   Under escort of four Taiwanese military jets, the Boeing 737-300
arrived safely at Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17 a.m.
(0317 GMT) and immediately taxied to an out-of-the-way domestic
terminal where the drama came to a swift and peaceful conclusion.
	   Yuan, 30, was accompanied on the bizarre flight by his wife, Xu
Mei, 27. The captain exited the plane calmly, guarded by Taiwanese
police commandos.
	   Six hours later, backup pilots flew the jet with 94 passengers
and six crew members back to China. The plane finally landed in
Xiamen, in China's Fujian province directly across the Taiwan
Strait, according to Hong Kong officials who had been monitoring
the jet's progress.
	   Yuan and Xu were questioned and detained, but Taoyuan District
Prosecutor Liu Teh-cheng said his office had not yet decided what
charges might be filed.
	   Hijacking carries a maximum penalty of death in Taiwan, although
no such sentence has been handed down in recent years. Officials
said Yuan did not appear to have used lethal force.
	   ``He was determined to come to Taiwan, live or die,'' said Hwang
Yun-hwa, vice aviation police commander. ``He said the company had
treated him badly.''
	   Wen Fei, pilot of a backup crew who was serving as Yuan's
co-pilot, did not try to physically stop the captain, for fear a
fight in the cockpit could endanger the passengers, Chang said. No
one was hurt in the incident.
	   Wen was in charge of the plane as it flew back to China. Extra
flight crew had been aboard because CA905 had been scheduled to
eventually land in Yangon, Myanmar, and Air China regularly
dispatches two sets of pilots and co-pilots on such long flights.
	   After changing course, Yuan radioed in his modified flight plan
and Chang said he was informed of the hijacking just before 10:30
a.m. (0230 GMT) following a call from Air China to Taiwan's China
Airlines.
	   During the long wait on a cool, overcast afternoon, passengers
remained on board the plane at Wen's insistence, Chang said. The
Taiwanese provided food and drinks and had prepared a lounge on the
ground where the passengers could have waited, he said.
	   Twenty non-Chinese were aboard the flight, including three
Japanese, two Sri Lankans, and citizens of 15 other countries,
Chang said.
	   It was not immediately clear what Yuan hoped to accomplish.
Chinese seeking freedom or better jobs committed a series of
hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and 1994, but all 16 were
arrested and jailed for up to 12 years. Two of them were paroled
and sent back to China.
	   ``There was no political motive,'' said Interior Minister Huang
Chu-wen.
	   During the height of their Cold War animosity, Taiwan greeted
hijackers from China as freedom-seeking defectors and showered them
with rewards of gold and cash. Taiwan began cracking down on the
hijackers after tensions began easing in the 1980s.
	   China has demanded that Taiwan send all the hijackers back. The
two sides were near reaching an agreement about repatriation in
1995 when China broke off the talks in anger over a Taiwanese drive
to gain diplomatic recognition.

EU Commission proposes ban on Portuguese beef because of mad cow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Portugal's reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday to ban the export of beef from Portugal for nine months
and to bar the export of live cattle for at least 18 months from
the country.
	   EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said the proposed ban on
beef exports will expire after nine months unless there is still
evidence of meat safety problems in Portugal.
	   The proposed ban on cattle exports will be reviewed after 18
months, Fischler told a news conference.
	   The two proposals by the EU executive Commission must be
endorsed by a majority of EU countries. An EU veterinary committee
is expected to vote on the issue Friday.
	   The two proposals do not affect exports from Portugal's Azores
Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean, Fischler said.
	   Portugal's Farm Minister Luis Capoulas Santos called the
proposals ``unfair, excessive and inappropriate.''
	   ``It is just as safe to eat meat in Portugal as in any other EU
country,'' the minister told reporters in Lisbon.
	   The EU sent two monitoring missions to Portugal this year. The
EU found that between May and October the cases of mad cow disease
had doubled, from 30 to over 60.
	   ``The situation is serious,'' the EU's Commissioner for Consumer
Affairs Emma Bonino told reporters.
	   There are currently 67 cases of mad cow disease - or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy - in Portugal. BSE in beef has been
linked to a fatal brain ailment in humans.
	   The Commission has claimed Portugal was not enforcing an EU ban
on the use of the remains of bovine animals in feed for bovine
animals.
	   It has also said that Portugal was not enforcing EU rules on the
treatment of bovine animal remains used in feed for pigs and
poultry. BSE is believed to have spread in Europe through animal
feed.
	   ``There is a higher, increasing incidence of BSE, as well as a
weakness in controls, protective measures,'' EU spokesman Gerry
Kiely said.
	   But the ban is unlikely to influence the European beef market,
Fischler said, as Portugal is a small player on the market.
	   Last year, Portugal exported 1,500 tons of beef: 700 tons went
to Spain, 600 to Angola and 200 to Belgium and Luxembourg. Portugal
also exported 1,600 tons of live cattle, the vast majority of which
went to Spain.
	   The Commission says it will help compensate Portugal financially
for the ban, but said it was too early to give a figure.

Government to set up national AIDS council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans should shed their traditional
inhibitions and discuss AIDS openly in order to stop the spread of
the disease, Health Minister Jackson Kalewo said Wednesday.
	   ``We are hypocrites; we do not discuss this things openly.
That's why we are here cursing sex,'' Kalweo said. ``Let us be
ourselves; we must know the causes of contacting the HIV/AIDS
virus.''
	   Kalweo was addressing the opening of Kenya's second national
conference on HIV/AIDS.
	   In many African societies, sex is not discussed in public and
not at gatherings where both men and women are present.
	   Kalweo also said the government will set up a broad-based
national HIV/AIDS council to address AIDS-related problems and
liase with international agencies working to combat AIDS.
	   He said the devastating effects of AIDS over the past two
decades have assumed such proportions that many households in Kenya
are not able to cope with the impact.
	   According to UNAIDS, there are 440,000 AIDS orphans in Kenya.
	   More than 600 delegates are attending the three-day conference
whose theme is ``Lessens Learned/Future Challenges.''
	   Last week, the Health Ministry's National AIDS/STDs Control
Program said an estimated 256,750 Kenyans have died since 1980 from
HIV/AIDS.
	   The report said 1.5 million Kenyans or about 9 percent of the
population have been infected with the HIV virus since 1980 when
the first case was reported.
	   The figure includes 90,000 children.
	   Kalweo urged Kenyans to avoid sexual promiscuity and drunkeness,
which he said are accelerating the spread of the disease that
attacks the body's immune system.
	   He said the ministry is restructuring its programs to emphasize
the involvement of support systems and traditional approaches to
the care of orphans.
	   He said the strategy will be supplemented by community foster
care homes and day care centers for AIDS orphans. He said the
property of such orphans with be protected from unscrupulous
relatives.

Philippine president approves rice imports after typhoons ruin rice
</HEADLINE>
lands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has
authorized a government agency to import up to 300,000 tons of rice
because of damage to rice crops from four recent typhoons,
officials said Wednesday.
	   The National Food Authority sought Estrada's permission to
import rice after 734,750 tons of rice worth 1.7 billion pesos
(dlrs 42.5 million) was destroyed by the typhoons, mostly on the
main Philippine island of Luzon.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said an inter-agency
committee will assess in about a week the amount of rice to be
imported under the authorization.
	   The committee will examine how much rice harvests from the
southern Philippine region of Mindanao can offset the crops
destroyed by the typhoons, Barican said.
	   Mindanao, one of the country's food baskets, has been spared by
the recent typhoons.
	   Also Wednesday, the Agriculture Department said agricultural
production will grow by a maximum of 2 percent this year, and may
contract because of the effects of heavy rains on farm output.
	   ``The positive 1 percent to 2 percent growth rate is the
best-case scenario,'' said Agriculture Secretary William Dar.
	   While estimates for agricultural production in the fourth
quarter have yet to be firmed up, Dar is predicting a contraction
in output for the third quarter of between 1 percent and 4 percent.
	   In the first half of the year, agricultural production slumped
7.2 percent due to the effects of a drought attributed to the El
Nino weather disturbance, the sector's worst performance in more
than two decades.
	   The farm sector's dismal performance was largely to blame for a
0.7 percent contraction in the country's gross national product in
the second quarter of the year, the first contraction in five
years.
	   The Department of Agriculture has requested a 25 billion peso
(dlrs 609 million) annual budget for the next five years to boost
rice production.
	   Much of the extra money will go for irrigating more rice land,
with the goal of achieving national rice self-sufficiency by 2003,
officials say.

Confusion surrounds resignation of mugged Cabinet minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's tabloid newspapers reported Wednesday
that a Cabinet minister who resigned after being robbed at
knifepoint by a stranger he picked up in a south London park was
involved in a ``gay'' sex mugging.
	   Scotland Yard announced that three people had been arrested in
connection with the incident, which has left Britons intrigued as
to what Welsh Secretary Ron Davies was doing in an area known as a
rendezvous for homosexual men and drug sellers.
	   ``Cabinet Minister Quits In Gay Sex Scandal,'' reported The Sun,
Britain's biggest-selling tabloid. ``Shame Of Gay Sex Cabinet
Minister,'' reported its rival, The Mirror.
	   Davies resigned Tuesday, saying only that he has suffered a
``lapse of judgment.''
	   Walking on Clapham Common on Monday night, Davies said he was
approached by a male stranger, started chatting and accepted an
invitation to pick up two of the strangers' friends and go to the
man's apartment for a meal. He was later robbed of his wallet,
mobile phone and car, he said.
	   Alastair Campbell, the spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair,
said Davies had denied the incident was related to a sexual
encounter.
	   ``There is no evidence at all of any gay link or any drug
link,'' Campbell said, adding that Blair knew few other details
when he accepted Davies' resignation.
	   Davies made no public comments Wednesday.
	   Quoting unnamed police sources, newspapers reported that the
Clapham Common area where the married minister was approached was a
notorious meeting place for gay men looking for casual sex with
strangers, which also acted as magnet for muggers.
	   As well as being a cabinet minister, Davies is also the
designate first minister _ an equivalent to prime minister _ of the
new Welsh Assembly, which will meet for the first time in May 1999.
	   He had led last year's referendum campaign on whether to have a
separate assembly for Wales.

Report: Petroleum tanker truck crashes, killing five
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A petroleum tanker truck exploded after
crashing into a brick wall on Tuesday, burning alive five people
and destroying seven houses, a Lagos newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Those killed in Tuesday's mishap on the outskirts of the
southwestern city of Ibadan, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north
of Lagos, included a woman and her small child who were outside
their home when the explosion occurred, the Lagos Tribune reported.
	   It was the second fatal petroleum blaze since a gasoline-fed
inferno in the village of Jesse, about 300 kilometers (190 miles)
southeast of Lagos, killed an estimated 700 people.
	   Many of the victims of the Jesse explosion were believed to be
trying to scavenge gasoline gushing from a leaking pipeline when it
ignited _ possibly by a cigarette or the spark of tools used by
vandals who may have broke open the pipe.
	   An unnamed military administrator on Wednesday made a radio
appeal to the people of Nigeria to ``examine our conscience. Many
wrong things are happening. We appear to be paying for our sins.''
	   Some people in west and central of Africa attribute natural
disasters to supernatural forces caused by wrongdoings.
	   A lit cigarette ignited cans of illicit gasoline at a
black-market storage house in a village near the capital, burning
four people alive, Nigeria's news agency reported Monday.

NATO keeps up guard in Kosovo as some refugees return

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Having deferred airstrikes for the
moment, NATO on Wednesday revealed plans for more spy flights to
make sure President Slobodan Milosevic continues to withdraw forces
from Kosovo and lets tens of thousands of refugees return home.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said Wednesday
that the withdrawal of Serb forces was not complete but so far it
represented a ``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling
the demands.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military alliance
did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one
expired Tuesday.
	   That was a bitter disappointment to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
politicians, who had been hoping that NATO would deliver a
devastating blow to the Yugoslav war machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet Hamiti of the League of
Democratic Kosovo said Wednesday.
	   But by warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back.
	   Despite the uncertainty, a senior U.S. humanitarian aid official
said Wednesday he believed international actions had already
prevented thousands from dying this winter because the agreement
had enabled organizations to rush in clothing, food and other
supplies.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, told reporters.
	   Parmer said that just seven months ago, on his last trip to
Kosovo, 50,000 people were living in the woods, most lacking even
plastic sheeting for cover. Parmer said that figure had probably
dropped to about 10,000.
	   ``I think we will see no deaths due to isolation or lack of
food,'' he said.
	   Still, it is unclear how many refugees were returning home
Wednesday. In Geneva, Switzerland, U.N. refugee agency spokesman
Kris Janowski said there ``has been some movement but at the same
time the people are still apprehensive.''
	   Janowski said men in some areas were returning to check the
condition of homes abandoned during the fighting but it was unclear
whether most felt it was safe to bring back their wives and
children.
	   To back up its demands, NATO decided to keep more than 400
warplanes on alert. On Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced at its
Mediterranean headquarters in Italy that American P-3C Orion
surveillance will begin regular flights over Kosovo on Sunday.
	   The planes can fly for 10-12 hours without refueling and will
help monitor the situation day and night regardless of the weather.
The Navy said it conducted a few such flights around the time of
the first NATO deadline Oct. 17.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
accelerating efforts to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to
verify compliance on the ground.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said after a meeting of NATO
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' he added. ``I urge both sides
to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward.''
	   In an Oct. 12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
demanded that Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in
Kosovo to the levels of last February, when Milosevic began his
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have
died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo is a province in
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters that NATO would move quickly to use force against
Yugoslavia if Milosevic sends troops and special police back to
Kosovo.
	   Albright said the NATO allies were organizing a rapid-reaction
force based in neighboring Macedonia to protect _ if necessary _
the 2,000 unarmed personnel who will verify that Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   A spokesman for the OSCE said Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was
due in Pristina on Thursday to take charge of the verification
operation.
	   International officials hope the continued pressure will
encourage many refugees to return home. Many of them are camping in
the woods and hills, fearful that Serb police will shoot at them if
they tried to go back.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has strategic interests in all of the
Balkans, not just Serbia, the foreign minister said in an interview
published Wednesday, underlining Moscow's firm opposition to NATO
airstrikes.
	   ``The Balkans have always been a zone of special strategic
interest for Russia due to obvious reasons _ the territorial
closeness and access to the Mediterranean,'' Igor Ivanov was quoted
as telling Izvestia.
	   ``We are linked with that region not only by sentimental
feelings, but broad economic perspectives.''
	   Russia has staunchly opposed the use of force against Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, for its crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province. Russia and Serbia share Slavic and
Orthodox religious roots.
	   Ivanov also claimed Russia played a decisive role in averting
NATO airstrikes so far, by coming up with the idea to deploy 2,000
observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to Kosovo.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, a Communist lawmaker who leads the hard-line
Movement in Support of the Armed Forces, warned Wednesday that the
situation remains tense with NATO still planning its ``offensive
against the Slav world.''
	   Ilyukhin said his movement had prepared 10,000 volunteers to
fight alongside Serbs in case of NATO airstrikes.
	   Despite the fierce pro-Serb rhetoric by many Russian
politicians, a nationwide poll released Wednesday by the respected
Public Opinion Foundation showed that many Russians are
non-committal about the Kosovo conflict.
	   Forty-three percent of the 1,600 respondents said they support
neither the Serbs, nor Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. Sixteen percent
said they back the Serbs, 4 percent support Albanians, 24 percent
were undecided and the remaining 13 percent said they knew nothing
about the conflict.
	   The poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 23-26. The Interfax
news agency, which carried the poll, didn't cite its margin of
error.

Report: ETA preparing permanent truce in Basque conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds:CORRECTS the name of the newspaper in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA will
shortly announce a definitive truce to end its 30-year campaign for
independence, a leading Basque newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings, is planning a
statement in response to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's demand
for more proof of peaceful intentions, the Bilbao daily El Correo
Espanol reported without citing sources.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18,
five weeks before last weekend's regional elections.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
before the elections, two hooded members of ETA claimed the
cease-fire was ``solid and serious.''
	   The truce is believed to be directly responsible for the boost
in votes for the pro-independence Euskal Herritarrok coalition,
which obtained 14 seats in the 75-seat regional legislature, its
highest showing in six regional elections.
	   The cease-fire on Sept. 18 resulted from months of talks between
the moderate pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party, which
topped the polls, and Herri Batasuna, the ETA political link and
founder of Euskal Herritarrok.
	   Sunday's elections resulted in no clear winner and demonstrated
how sharply divided the northern region is over independence. Three
separatist parties gained a total of 41 seats while four groups
opposed to breaking up Spain notched up 34.
	   Although Aznar has said he is not yet convinced by ETA,
government insiders indicated this week he will not insist on an
immediate hand-over of arms.
	   They added that talks over ETA demands that its jailed
accomplices be transferred to Basque prisons were also possible.
	   The chief ETA demand has been the right to self-determination
for the Basque country, including the three Basque provinces of
northern Spain and parts of neighboring Navarra and southwestern
France.
	   Many Basques, including independence advocates, see armed
violence as unnecessary, considering the high level of autonomy the
region has enjoyed for two decades.
	   ETA has faced a tough government anti-terrorist policy, as well
as a groundswell of public condemnation over the killing of unarmed
municipal officials belonging to Aznar's governing Popular Party.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time next week, officials said Wednesday.
	   As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week, U.S. State
Department officials said.
	   Larry Schwartz, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv,
said it was important to uphold the timetable. ``All sides must
begin implementation next Monday night,'' Schwartz said.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Netanyahu raised the possibility of a delay when he announced
Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely postponing a Cabinet
meeting that was to have approved the deal.

UEFA okays Partizan-Lazio home match in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Next week's Cup Winners Cup
second-round match between Partizan Belgrade and Lazio of Rome can
go ahead in Belgrade, UEFA said Wednesday.
	   Citing security concerns, the European governing body earlier
this month moved a UEFA Cup match between Red Star Belgrade and
Lyon of France to Bucharest.
	   The move was prompted by the threat of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia unless it complies with international demands over
Kosovo. UEFA deferred a decision on the second-leg Partizan match.
	   The latest decision was taken ``due to the fact that the
political situation has improved to the extent that the
above-mentioned match can now be staged in Belgrade as originally
scheduled,'' UEFA said in a statement.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back from Kosovo, the Western
military alliance did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes
after the previous one expired Tuesday.
	   Partizan and Lazio go into next Thursday's second-leg match tied
0-0 after last week's first leg in Rome.
	   A Euro 2000 qualifier between Yugoslavia and Ireland, postponed
because of the threat of air raids, has been rescheduled for Nov.
18. But UEFA said it will decide on the venue next week.
	   A decision will also be taken then on the venue for a qualifier
between Albania and Greece, rescheduled for the same date after
being postponed because of political turmoil in Albania.

Ace reliever Sasaki voted Central League's MVP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kazuhiro Sasaki, whose relief pitching helped the
Yokohama BayStars win their first Japanese professional
championship in 38 years, was voted the Central League's most
valuable player Wednesday.
	   Infielder Kazuo Matsui of the Pacific League champion Seibu
Lions was chosen his league's MVP in voting by 155 Japanese sports
writers.
	   Sasaki, 30, relieved in 51 games and finished with a 1-1 record
with 45 saves, breaking the record of 38 saves that he and South
Korean pitcher Sun Dong-yol of the Chunichi Dragons had shared in
1997.
	   Sun, formerly of the Hai Tai Tigers of the South Korean
professional league, was 3-0 with 29 saves in 42 games this season.
	   Sasaki also helped the BayStars win the deciding game of the
Japan Series, closing out the Lions with a double play with the
potential tying and winning runs on base in the top of the ninth.
The BayStars won four games to two in the best-of-seven series.
	   The 23-year-old Matsui has captured the stolen base title for
the past two years. He and Makoto Kosaka of the Chiba Lotte Marines
each stole 43 bases this season, and Matsui was the league's fifth
in hitting with a .311 average.
	   The Central League's Rookie of the Year Award went to pitcher
Kenshin Kawakami, 23, of the second-place Chunichi Dragons, who
beat Yoshinobu Takahashi of the third-place Yomiuri Giants.
	   Kawakami, who joined the Dragons from Tokyo's Meiji University,
had a 14-6 record with a 2.57 ERA, the league's second best after
the 2.34 of teammate Shigeki Noguchi (14-9).
	   Takahashi batted .300 average with 19 home runs.
	   Outfielder Tatsuya Ozeki of the Lions was named the Pacific
League's top rookie for his .285 average and 15 stolen bases in 104
games.
	   Takanori Suzuki of the BayStars was the Central League's leading
hitter with a .337 average. He also hit 16 home runs and batted in
87 runs.

Report: ETA preparing permanent truce in Basque conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of newspaper in 2nd graf. Minor edits
throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Basque separatist group ETA will soon
announce an end to its 30-year campaign for independence, a leading
Basque newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings, is planning a
statement in response to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's demand
for more proof of peaceful intentions, El Correo Espanol reported.
The newspaper, a daily based in the Basque city of Bilbao, cited no
sources.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18,
five weeks before last weekend's regional elections.
	   The truce helped the pro-independence Euskal Herritarrok
coalition obtain 14 seats in the 75-seat regional legislature, its
highest showing in six regional elections.
	   The cease-fire resulted from months of talks between the
moderate pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party and Herri
Batasuna, the ETA political link and founder of Euskal Herritarrok.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party, which topped the polls, has come
under criticism from Aznar and his followers for its contacts with
Herri Batasuna. The party retaliated Wednesday by saying it could
no longer guarantee its support for Aznar's minority government in
the national parliament.
	   It gave a taste of what that meant by opposing the government in
a preliminary vote on next year's budget draft. The Basques have
six seats in the 350-seat national parliament, an important if not
crucial number for the ruling Popular Party, which has 156 seats.
	   Sunday's regional elections resulted in no clear winner and
demonstrated how sharply divided the northern region is over
independence. Three separatist parties gained a total of 41 seats
while four groups opposed to breaking up Spain notched up 34.
	   Although Aznar says he is not yet convinced by ETA, government
insiders say he will not insist on an immediate handover of arms.
They also suggest talks are possible on ETA demands that its jailed
accomplices be transferred to Basque prisons.
	   The chief ETA demand has been the right to self-determination
for the Basque country, including the three Basque provinces of
northern Spain and parts of neighboring Navarra and southwestern
France.
	   Many Basques, including independence advocates, see armed
violence as unnecessary, considering the high level of autonomy the
region has enjoyed for two decades.
	   ETA has faced a tough government anti-terrorist policy as well
as a groundswell of public condemnation over the killing of unarmed
municipal officials belonging to Aznar's governing Popular Party.

EU Commission proposes ban on Portuguese beef
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday to ban the export of beef from Portugal for nine months
and to bar the export of live cattle for at least 18 months from
the country.
	   EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said the proposed ban on
beef exports will expire after nine months unless there is still
evidence of meat safety problems in Portugal.
	   The proposed ban on cattle exports will be reviewed after 18
months, Fischler told a news conference.
	   The two proposals by the EU executive Commission must be
endorsed by a majority of EU countries. An EU veterinary committee
is expected to vote on the issue Friday.
	   The two proposals do not affect exports from Portugal's Azores
Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean, Fischler said.
	   Portugal's Farm Minister Luis Capoulas Santos called the
proposals ``unfair, excessive and inappropriate.''
	   ``It is just as safe to eat meat in Portugal as in any other EU
country,'' the minister told reporters in Lisbon.
	   The EU sent two monitoring missions to Portugal this year. The
EU found that between May and October the cases of mad cow disease
had doubled, from 30 to over 60.
	   ``The situation is serious,'' the EU's Commissioner for Consumer
Affairs Emma Bonino told reporters.
	   There are currently 67 cases of mad cow disease - or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy - in Portugal. BSE in beef has been
linked to a fatal brain ailment in humans.
	   The Commission has claimed Portugal was not enforcing an EU ban
on the use of the remains of bovine animals in feed for bovine
animals.
	   It has also said that Portugal was not enforcing EU rules on the
treatment of bovine animal remains used in feed for pigs and
poultry. BSE is believed to have spread in Europe through animal
feed.
	   ``There is a higher, increasing incidence of BSE, as well as a
weakness in controls, protective measures,'' EU spokesman Gerry
Kiely said.
	   But the ban is unlikely to influence the European beef market,
Fischler said, as Portugal is a small player on the market.
	   Last year, Portugal exported 1,500 tons of beef: 700 tons went
to Spain, 600 to Angola and 200 to Belgium and Luxembourg. Portugal
also exported 1,600 tons of live cattle, the vast majority of which
went to Spain.
	   The Commission says it will help compensate Portugal financially
for the ban, but said it was too early to give a figure.

Top U.S. official to discuss Angola peace and Congo war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The U.S. State Department's top Africa
official arrived here Wednesday on a three-day visit to discuss the
country's stymied peace process and Angola's role in neighboring
Congo's civil war.
	   Susan Rice, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa, was
accompanied by President Bill Clinton's special assistant Gayle
Smith and his special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Howard
Wolpe.
	   They were to meet with Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura during
their stay.
	   It was not clear whether they would meet with President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos before they left Friday for a tour of other
countries in the region.
	   The U.S. officials were not expected to meet with
representatives from the former rebel group UNITA, which waged a
two-decade civil war with the government before the signing of a
1994 peace pact.
	   However, they will hold talks with a group of dissidents who
recently split with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, a U.S. diplomat in
Luanda said.
	   The Angolan government in September severed all contact with
Savimbi, who lives in the country's central highlands, and has
waged an international diplomatic campaign to isolate him.
	   The United States, Portugal and Russia are monitoring the
implementation of the ailing 1994 peace deal.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ broke contact with the three
observer countries in August, accusing them of bias in the
southwest African nation's peace process.
	   The former rebel group has failed to comply fully with the terms
of the peace pact, triggering U.N. and U.S. sanctions against it.
	   Angola, along with Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad, has sent troops
to support Congo President Laurent Kabila against insurgents who
are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

Bulgaria declares war on CD piracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ During the first nine months of this
year, Bulgaria's police have seized some 350,000 illegal compact
discs and started to scrutinize makers through a new system of
licensing requirements, the Interior Ministry announced Wednesday.
	   These harsh measures taken by authorities reflect the
government's efforts to wipe out Bulgaria's reputation as the
worlds's third-largest pirating center after China and Taiwan.
	   Chavdar Krumov, the Interior Ministry spokesman, claimed that
because of these measures the country has moved from ``one of the
world's main pirate producers of CDs to the leading anti-pirate.''
	   Krumov said authorities' efforts are focused now on
international smuggling rings. He reported that on October 23,
customs officers in the Black Sea port of Burgas, some 400
kilometer (250 miles) east of Sofia, seized 350,000 illegal CDs.
	   ``They were loaded in New York and the final destination of the
shipment was the Romanian port of Constanta,'' he said.
	   He said police were still investigating where the CDs were
produced.
	   With financial assistance from the International Federation of
Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the Interior Ministry has equipped a
laboratory able to tell the origin of any pirate CD.
	   ``Bulgaria is now the only country where there is non-stop
police presence in CD production works,'' Krumov said.
	   Recently police sealed a compact disc plant in Sofia after
seizing in it 200,000 pirate CDs.
	   The SMC company has been the third of 11 compact disc makers
that a government commission licensed this year to resume operation
after closing their facilities in February and putting them under
24-hour police surveillance.
	   Western officials have praised Bulgaria's government for
imposing stringent controls on compact disc makers and traders in
an effort to crack down on copyright piracy which prior governments
had tolerated.
	   Krumov said that during his recent visit to Britain, Interior
Minister Bogomil Bonev was assured by IFPI officials that Bulgaria
had overcome one of the main obstacles for its integration in
European structures - the piracy on intellectual property.

Philippine Red Cross seeks foreign assistance for typhoon damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Red Cross is seeking
money from the international Red Cross federation to help more than
200,000 people left homeless by three typhoons that swept through
the Philippines in the past five weeks, an official said Wednesday.
	   ``We have reported to the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies that our funds are fast dwindling,''
said Lourdes Loyola, secretary-general of the Philippine National
Red Cross.
	   The federation said it is launching an international appeal for
3 million Swiss francs (about dlrs 2.2 million) ``in urgent
humanitarian assistance'' for the typhoon victims.
	   Mrs. Loyola said the last time the federation helped the local
Red Cross was in 1995, when Typhoon Angela devastated the northern
Philippines.
	   It also helped in relief efforts following the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo in June 1991, and when a flash flood killed more than
6,000 people in central Ormoc City in November that year.
	   The latest typhoon, Babs, which came on the heels of Typhoon
Vicki and Typhoon Zeb, swept through the same general area hit by
Angela, leaving at least 189 people dead, most of them from
landslides.
	   In all, the three typhoons and another that came in early
September killed 370 people, the civil defense office said. The
number does not include at least 70 people killed when a ferry sank
during Typhoon Vicki.
	   The civil defense office also reported that the typhoons damaged
or destroyed 10.4 billion pesos (dlrs 252.8 million) worth of
infrastructure, crops and other property.
	   The Department of Agriculture said the typhoons destroyed more
than 734,700 tons of rice worth 1.74 billion pesos (dlrs 42.55
million).
	   In its report to the federation, the Philippine National Red
Cross said many areas remain flooded, aggravated by seasonal
monsoon rains, even after Babs left the country last Sunday.
	   ``Local government responses are nil because they themselves are
hapless victims,'' it said. ``Relief supplies need to be airlifted
to the disaster areas to feed hungry survivors who subsist on
banana shoots due to dwindling food supplies.''
	   Typhoon Babs affected more than 2 million people in 224
municipalities, many of them still without electricity and
unreachable by telephone after power pylons collapsed. Many roads
on the main island of Luzon were impassable due to floods and
landslides.
	   The Red Cross said no acute health problems have been reported
so far, but with the prolonged exposure of homeless victims and the
destruction of water supplies and sanitation facilities, ``there is
a risk of epidemics.''
	   ``If emergency relief assistance will not be extended to the
population, more people may succumb to this seemingly endless
agony,'' the Red Cross said.
	   The typhoons and heavy rains ravaged the northern Philippines
just as the southern parts of the country were coming out of a long
drought.

Akzo's profit hit by financial crisis in Asia and Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel NV
said Wednesday its third-quarter net profit fell 5 percent to 430
million guilders (dlrs 231 million), marred by financial crises in
Asia, Russia and Latin America.
	   The company reported a net profit of 455 million guilders (dlrs
244 million) a year ago for the same period ending Sept. 30.
	   For the full year, the company expects a ``slightly higher
full-year net income, excluding non-recurring items.''
	   Akzo shares fell sharply following the disappointing results. By
midmorning its stock was trading down 8.4 percent.
	   Akzo Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Fritz Frohlich
said developments in Southeast Asia, Russia and Latin America and
the strengthening of European currencies all had a negative impact
on growth.
	   He said the contribution from British chemical group Courtaulds
PLC, which Akzo bought earlier this year for 6.1 billion guilders
(dlrs 3.2 billion), was ``slightly negative.''
	   Akzo hinted that Courtaulds' integration and its withdrawal from
the fibers business may lead to job losses.

 &UR; Pro-government lawmaker proposes re-establishing vice-presidency &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with last member of new government named. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of the pro-government faction in
parliament proposed Wednesday restoring the post of vice president
to stabilize Russia's political situation, shaken by President
Boris Yeltsin's frequent illnesses.
	   Also Wednesday, Yeltsin named the last member of the new
Cabinet, more than two months after firing the old one. Gennady
Khodyrev was appointed minister for anti-monopoly policy and
supporting business, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The introduction of the post of vice president would allow us
to avoid early elections,'' said Alexander Shokhin, leader of the
moderate Our Home Is Russia faction.
	   Restoring the vice president's job has been suggested recently
by other Russian politicians, including Alexander Lebed, a former
general-turned- provincial governor, who is a leading potential
contender for the presidency.
	   The position of vice president was abolished when Russia revised
its constitution in 1993. The last vice president, Alexander
Rutskoi, led an armed rebellion against Yeltsin in the fall of that
year that failed and prompted the constitutional changes.
	   Under the current law, the prime minister would step in if the
president died or resigned before the end of his term, and would be
required to call new elections within three months.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no crippling illness and will serve out
the rest of his term, which ends in the summer of 2000.

Truth Commission spares de Klerk in final report on apartheid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES throughout with ANC calling for delay of report,
de Klerk affidavit, RECASTS; no pickup
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Precede CAPE TOWN

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The panel investigating
apartheid atrocities suffered a setback Wednesday when South
Africa's last white president forced it to delete his name from a
roll-call of racist perpetrators.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission spared F.W. de Klerk on
the eve of making public its final report Thursday, a watershed
moment in the country's attempts to overcome the painful legacy of
white minority rule.
	   De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson
Mandela for bringing an end to the racist system, had sued to stop
the report's release.
	   He challenged its finding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation, which housed anti-apartheid
organizations.
	   The finding could have opened him up to prosecution because de
Klerk did not seek amnesty, as did many officials and security
operatives of the apartheid apparatus.
	   Former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the panel's chairman,
said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal
challenge.
	   ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been
engaged in a vendetta against him.''
	   A court hearing was scheduled for March 4.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appear
after all the hoo-ha has died down.''
	   De Klerk, reached in London, had no comment.
	   ``In effect, he has achieved his primary purpose,'' said
spokesman Dave Steward.
	   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by
laying bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the
country for more than two years, listening to victims and
perpetrators seeking amnesty.
	   The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South
Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race
elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral
condemnations and could recommend individual prosecutions.
	   De Klerk's challenge was part of a storm of criticism prompted
by leaks of the report. Conservative white parties have called it a
witch hunt.
	   The African National Congress, the movement that helped defeat
apartheid and now runs the country, angrily rejected a leaked
finding that it too was guilty of human rights violations in its
armed struggle.
	   ANC Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe on Wednesday called for
a postponement of the report until everyone mentioned in a negative
light has a chance to respond.
	   ``The ANC is an aggrieved party,'' he said in an interview with
APTN. ``To submit a distortion of history is incomprehensible,'' he
said.
	   Legal threats have led to fewer individuals being named as
rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported
Wednesday.
	   Tutu responded that more than 400 people had been given a chance
to respond, but only 15 argued themselves out of the report.
	   The report also rejected barring perpetrators from holding
public office or denying pensions to those who were state
employees, the newspaper said.
	   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know about the
roles of former law and order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Johan van
der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to tell police.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, the
two were already applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter.
	   ``I cannot conceivably be held morally accountable for matters
which were brought to my attention long after they occurred,'' he
said in an affidavit.
	   ``Moral accountability for concealing the truth is, in any
event, not a gross violation of human rights,'' he said.
	   The bombings took place in the late 1980s, before de Klerk
became president in 1989. No one was killed.
	   The case is reminiscent of another legal challenge to the
commission. P.W. Botha, a former hardline president, refused to
testify and was convicted last August of ignoring a subpoena. He
was given a one-year suspended sentence.

Singapore to launch regional TV news station with `Asian voice'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore will launch an all-news local
television station next year and go regional with the channel soon
after, because the economic crisis has fueled demand for timely
information with an ``Asian voice.''
	   The state-run Television Corporation of Singapore announced
Wednesday that it will start broadcasting Channel NewsAsia on March
1, 1999, with 18 hours of daily programs in English on current
affairs, lifestyles and news emphasizing business events.
	   The first year's operation is estimated to cost 20 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 12.3 million). The station is expected to
go Asia-wide about one year after its launch, said TCS president
and chief executive officer Lee Cheok Yew.
	   The channel will provide a ``genuine Asian voice on news and
business in the region,'' he said.
	   It will be the first Asian-run network dedicated to events in
the region and broadcast in English to Asia, said Channel
NewsAsia's vice president, Woon Tai Ho.
	   ``We're not out to challenge CNN, BBC or CNBC, but we think we
can complement them,'' said Woon. ``They give Asia an idea of what
the world thinks of Asia.
	   ``Perhaps it is time the world knows what Asia thinks of itself,
and what Asia thinks of the world,'' he said.
	   Woon said such a home-grown news channel ``will be able to cover
the area with an authority, an understanding, and the sensitivity
that can come only because we're part of the region.''
	   Television in Singapore, and in other Asian nations such as
China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and North Korea, is tightly
controlled by governments.
	   The Singapore government had to repeatedly defend its television
news departments this year against public criticism after local
television was far behind CNN and other foreign broadcasters in
reporting the crash last December of a Silkair jet carrying mostly
Singaporeans.
	   Political considerations aside, officials said the economic
downturn could pose a threat to the new channel's success, though
the crisis was precisely the reason for its creation. Recent
ratings and surveys found the public was clamoring for more news
and information.
	   ``Because of the crisis, the need for information on Asia has
never been more pressing,'' said Woon.
	   Lee also noted that ``a lot of viewers seem to be demanding more
information, more immediacy in terms of information, relating to
their investments in these difficult times.''
	   Lee estimated 100 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 62 million)
would be spent over five years to run the new station locally and
regionally, with hopes of a profit from the third year.
	   Shaun Seow, vice president of TCS news and current affairs,
added that the company is searching for an editorial alliance with
an existing regional media company, and is in discussions with one
such operator.
	   TCS' main channel will become more entertainment-based, said the
officials.

 &UR; LONDON: Spanish magistrate.

<TEXT>
	   Dozens of Chilean exiles in court cheered when they heard
Pinochet must stay in custody.
	   ``A former head of state is clearly entitled to immunity for
criminal acts committed in the course of exercising public
functions,'' the judge said.
	   ``I order that both provisional warrants be quashed. We will
listen to any argument that will be addressed to us on leave to
appeal.''
	   British police arrested Pinochet's , 82, Oct. 16 in his bed at a
London hospital on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking his
extradition to face charges of murder, kidnapping and torturing
political opponents during his 17-year rule. He underwent back
surgery Oct. 9.
	   Since the arrest, other groups have filed suits seeking to have
him tried in Europe.
	   Four Chilean exiles have asked Britain's Attorney General to
make Pinochet stand trial in Britain. Similar filings are being
pursued in Switzerland, Sweden and France.
	   Pinochet stepped down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief
of the army until last March.
	   Pinochet's lawyers argued that the Spanish warrant was illegal
on grounds that former heads of state cannot be prosecuted for
actions committed in their ``official capacity'' and because he is
not Spanish.
	   Attorney Alun Jones, representing the Spanish magistrate,
countered that murder and torture are not ``something that is in
the furtherance of his function as head of state.''
	   Jones alleged that Pinochet was responsible for up to 4,000
murders, including at least one in the United States, and had sent
agents to Spain to kill opponents there.

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with State Department confirmation that
Albright called Arafat and Netanyahu, Palestinians saying Israelis
and Palestinians met Wednesday in Tel Aviv to discuss security
plan, with quote by Netanyahu adviser on security. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned about delays, the United States is
pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start implementing their
new peace agreement on time next week, officials said Wednesday.
	   As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week, U.S. State
Department officials said.
	   Larry Schwartz, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv,
said it was important to uphold the timetable. ``All sides must
begin implementation next Monday night,'' Schwartz said.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian security
measures aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis.
	   Netanyahu raised the possibility of a delay when he announced
Tuesday evening that he was indefinitely postponing a Cabinet
meeting that was to have approved the deal.
	   Netanyahu insisted Wednesday that he needed Cabinet backing and
that he would not start the pullback until he did.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   However, U.S. officials and Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Cabinet approval was not a prerequisite for
Netanyahu to go ahead with the troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's office said in a statement the Cabinet meeting was
postponed because the Palestinians had not yet submitted a detailed
work plan on security to the United States as they had promised.
	   However, Israeli media said the main reason for the delay was
Netanyahu's concern that he would not get a majority in his Cabinet
for the troop withdrawal.
	   Several Israeli Cabinet ministers who initially said they were
undecided have announced in recent days that they would vote
against the agreement.
	   One Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials met in
Tel Aviv on Wednesday to discuss the security plan.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians were
aware of Monday's deadline and would present their plan to the
Americans by then.
	   An American official who spoke on condition of anonymity,
pointed out that the Palestinians have until Monday to present
their plan and that no one has violated the agreement yet.
	   However, U.S. diplomats met Wednesday with Palestinian officials
in an attempt to prevent any delays in implementation.
	   Bar-Illan noted that in the first week of the 12-week process,
the steps to be taken must come from the Palestinian side and that
Israel does not have to taken any action during that time.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he was
confident both sides would keep their promises and that he was not
concerned about the postponing of the Israeli Cabinet meeting.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Albright called the
Palestinian leader on Monday evening, while Arafat was visiting
Saudi Arabia. Asked what the two discussed, Abourdeneh said that
``the Americans are keen on implementing the agreement.''
	   The dispute over the security plan is only the latest bump on
the road to carrying out the peace accord. On the last day of the
Mideast summit, Netanyahu linked the signing of the agreement to
the release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard from a U.S. jail. The
demand held up the signing ceremony for several hours.
	   In related developments Wednesday, Israeli media said security
for Netanyahu has been increased in recent days in response to the
vociferous street protests against the West Bank withdrawal.
	   Asked about the reports, Bar-Illan would only say that ``whether
or not he (Netanyahu) is in danger, his public activities have not
been curtailed.''
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu will cut down on appearances in
large crowds and travel to the West Bank and Gaza Strip only by
helicopter.
	   While visiting the Knesset, one of the most secure buildings in
Israel, Netanyahu was surrounded by eight bodyguards Wednesday.
	   In recent demonstrations against Netanyahu, demonstrators have
shouted ``traitor, traitor.'' Such cries were common in the weeks
leading up to the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin by a Jewish extremist in November 1995.

Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah introduces himself to the world

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah is back from a world tour in which he established himself
as the man in charge in his oil-rich kingdom and also unveiled a
gentler picture of himself at home.
	   Abdullah, next-in-line to the ailing King Fahd, visited such key
allies as the United States, France, Britain, China and Japan. Both
journalists who accompanied him and analysts said Wednesday that
the prince succeeded in stepping out from Fahd's shadow.
	   ``He was given the reception of a head of state everywhere we
went,'' said journalist Amir Taheri, one of those on Abdullah's
six-week, seven-nation world tour that ended Tuesday.
	   On the trip, Abdullah opened the doors to new business, tried to
dispel the notion he was anti-American and showed himself a more
forceful spokesman than Fahd on the touchy issue of Arab-Israeli
relations.
	   Abdullah, who took over the throne briefly in 1995 when Fahd had
a stroke, has taken on more responsibilities lately since Fahd has
been hospitalized four times this year. Fahd is believed to be at
least 75 and Abdullah a couple of years younger.
	   Taheri said one of the main goal's of the marathon trip was show
show allies that ``Abdullah is now in charge and they have to deal
with him, that there has been a transition of power and that it was
smooth.''
	   Abdullah also wanted to affirm Saudi Arabia's commitment to its
policies, said Waheed Hashem, assistant professor of political
science at King Abdul-Aziz University in the Saudi Red Sea port
city of Jiddah.
	   ``He wanted to assure leaders ... relations will remain the same
and there will be no major shifts in the country's oil or foreign
policy,'' he explained.
	   Another major goal for Abdullah _ who also visited South Korea
and Pakistan _ was to tell the world that Saudi Arabia was open for
business.
	   In Washington, Abdullah met with heads of major oil companies
and discussed joint ventures. The need for foreign investment is
crucial since the drop in oil prices has left the Saudis with an
estimated dlrs 13 billion deficit.
	   The prince also presented himself as a friend of the West. When
asked by Time magazine about charges he was anti-American, Abdullah
replied, ``I assure you that I fully appreciate the strong and deep
relations that tie our two countries.''
	   But whereas Fahd shied from discussing Israel _ a major U.S.
ally _ Abdullah was more bold.
	   In an interview with the Saudi daily al-Riyadh, Abdullah
criticized Israeli policies and said he constantly brought up with
Western leaders the importance of Jerusalem to Arabs and Muslims.
	   ``We were able to find an understanding with these leaders about
the significance of the holy city, the seat of the third holiest
shrine in Islam, and the Palestinians living there,'' the paper
quoted Abdullah as saying.
	   Abdullah also increased his popularity at home by taking the
unprecedented step of allowing pictures of himself wearing tennis
shoes and colorful sports shirts. For most, it was the first sight
of a Saudi leader without the traditional flowing white robes.
	   ``This gave Saudis a new perspective of him and made him appear
human ... like he was one of us,'' Hashem said.

High Court quashes Pinochet arrest warrants

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The High Court on Wednesday quashed Spanish arrest
warrants against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, ruling that the former
Chilean dictator is entitled to immunity from prosecution.
	   ``The applicant is entitled as a former head of state to
immunity from civil and criminal proceedings of the English
court,'' Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said.
	   Dozens of Chilean exiles in court cheered when they heard
Pinochet, 82, must remain in custody pending appeal by a Spanish
magistrate.
	   Summing up Pinochet's case, Bingham said, ``A former head of
state is clearly entitled to immunity for criminal acts committed
in the course of exercising public functions.''
	   ``I order that both provisional warrants be quashed. We will
listen to any argument that will be addressed to us on leave to
appeal,'' he said.
	   British police arrested Pinochet in his bed at a London hospital
Oct. 16 on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking his
extradition to face charges of murder, kidnapping and torturing
political opponents during his 17-year rule. He underwent back
surgery Oct. 9.
	   Since the arrest, other groups have filed suits seeking to have
him tried in Europe.
	   Four Chilean exiles have asked Britain's Attorney General to
make Pinochet stand trial in Britain. Similar filings are being
pursued in Switzerland, Sweden and France.
	   Pinochet stepped down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief
of the army until March.
	   His lawyers argued that the Spanish warrant was illegal on
grounds that former heads of state cannot be prosecuted for actions
committed in their ``official capacity'' and because he is not
Spanish.
	   Attorney Alun Jones, representing the Spanish magistrate,
countered that murder and torture are not ``something that is in
the furtherance of his function as head of state.''
	   Jones alleged that Pinochet was responsible for up to 4,000
murders, including at least one in the United States, and had sent
agents to Spain to kill opponents there.

Yeltsin gives day-to-day duties to prime minister, aide says

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will serve out the last
two years of his term, but has turned over day-to-day affairs to
his prime minister, a top aide was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday, where he has been taking walks, receiving treatment and
resting to recover from fatigue, his spokesman said.
	   He has stayed at the secluded Barvikha sanitarium several times
before when he was ill, often for weeks at a stretch. The
president's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, did not indicate how long
Yeltsin would stay at the rest home, or elaborate on his condition.
	   A team of doctors has been watching over Yeltsin, but they did
not meet Wednesday to discuss their patient, Yakushkin said. The
sanitarium has extensive medical facilities, but is not a hospital.
	   Yeltsin was ``undergoing treatment which is standard at any
sanitarium. Everything is going according to plan,'' Yakushkin told
Russian news agencies.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been seldom seen since the country was rocked
by an economic crisis in August, and it has become increasingly
clear that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is handling day-to-day
decisions.
	   Primakov's ``government is now fully responsible for the
economy,'' Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Segodnya.
	   ``That doesn't mean, however, that the president can't demand
that the government account for its actions in his same stern
manner,'' Sysuyev added.
	   Yeltsin could be expected to focus on constitutional reform when
he recovers from his latest illness, the aide added.
	   ``The most important task for the president is to turn over
stable power to his successor,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Russians overwhelmingly disapprove of Yeltsin's
performance as president, a poll showed.
	   Only 5 percent approve of his work and 93 percent disapprove,
according to a poll by the All-Russian Public Opinion Research
Center. The poll is in line with several other recent surveys on
Yeltsin's performance.
	   Primakov received the highest favorable rating of any Russian
politician, at 50 percent, up from 47 percent last month. The poll
results, reported by the Interfax news agency, gave no margin of
error.
	   Yeltsin has been working only part-time at the Kremlin in recent
months. He had little appetite for mundane tasks of government even
when he was healthy, and has always delegated many chores to his
staff.
	   Doctors say he must rest to recover from exhaustion and high
blood pressure, but no additional details about his condition have
been released.
	   The president has fallen ill about a half-dozen times since his
re-election in 1996, and had heart bypass surgery two years ago.
	   Yeltsin has insisted he will serve out his term, which runs
until the year 2000. But critics have been demanding his
resignation, and few Russians believe he will again show the vigor
that he had during his early years in office.

<TEXT>
	   OSNABRUECK, Germany (AP) _ Auto engineer and manufacturer
Wilhelm Karmann, whose curvy, bug-like 1950s sports car _ the
Karmann-Ghia _ bore his name and brought him international
recognition, has died. He was 83.
	   Karmann died Sunday after a lengthy undisclosed illness.
	   Sports cars were Karmann's specialty, particularly convertibles.
He designed and built the Karmann-Ghia in 1955 in cooperation with
Volkswagen and Porsche, and went on to design the Scirocco-Coupe
and Golf Cabriolet for Volkswagen. He also built cars for Porsche,
BMW, Opel, Ford and Mercedes-Benz.
	   Karmann was 19 when he started working in his family's car
factory in the northeastern city of Osnabrueck. He took over the
firm in 1952, with 1,452 employees and annual sales at 24 million
mark (dlrs 15 million). By 1989, the firm had 7,000 employees and
annual sales at 1 billion marks (dlrs 625 million).
	   Information about surviving family members and funeral
arrangements was not immediately available.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Spreading fear across the western
Caribbean on Wednesday, one of the century's most powerful
hurricanes forced tens of thousands to flee, dumped torrents of
rain, mowed down trees and damaged homes. At least 14 people were
reported killed.
	   Hurricane Mitch hovered 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the coast
of Honduras Wednesday, its downpours causing rivers to flood across
Honduras, Belize and elsewhere in Central America and Mexico.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said up to 25 inches
(65 centimeters) of rain could fall on mountain areas.
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph (305-kph) winds. By 1500
GMT Wednesday, the 350-mile (600 kilometer) wide storm still packed
a punch, but its winds were down to 120 mph (205 kph), with higher
gusts.
	   More than 45,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
low-lying areas of Honduras, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel,
chief of the National Emergency Committee. Many towns were cut off
by some 50 flooded rivers.
	   One of them was La Ceiba, a city of 40,000, whose two highways
out were both cut. To the east, the pillars of the Saopin bridge
were weakened by a swollen river and the bridge sagged into the
water. To the west, the Pico Bonito bridge was entirely washed
away.
	   Electricity was out in the entire town, and the sea moved a
half-block into town in some places. Fireman Tomas Hayden said
officials had banned private cars to ease emergency rescue work.
	   Waves crashed against the walls of seafront discos and people
waded through knee-deep water with furniture on their backs to flee
flooded houses.
	   In the Barrio Ingles shantytown, the ground was entirely covered
in white foam from the surf, making it look like it had snowed.
	   Twelve-year-old Dalixa Reyes wandered through the foam in the
lashing rain, looking for her parents and brothers and sisters. She
lives with other relatives a few blocks away.
	   ``I'm worried about my family, my friends, about the people who
live here,'' she said.
	   She found them, standing on a flooded sidewalk gazing at the
destruction in awe.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts like Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on pumping
oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Belize, most of the 75,000 people in Belize City fled inland
in cars and government buses. With gasoline stations running dry,
the government of neighboring Belize commandeered private buses to
help people move inland from coastal Belize City, which was almost
destroyed by Hurricane Hattie in 1961.
	   Port officials at Chetumal, Mexico, said a wave kicked up by
Hurricane Mitch washed a Connecticut man off a catamaran south of
Cancun on Monday and he was presumed dead. He was identified as
Robert Gates, 55, of Niantic.
	   Honduras reported five deaths _ one in a collapsed house, two
men electrocuted when they were blown off a roof, one man drowned
in a swollen river and another killed as he crossed a bridge on his
bicycle; the river tore away the bridge with him on it.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains.
	   On Wednesday morning, Mitch was blasting the Honduran Bay Island
of Guanaja, 75 miles (125 kilometers) northeast of here, ripping
the metal roofing off hundreds of houses and knocking out power and
telephones. Many residents took shelter on larger nearby islands.
	   ``It's raining hard and the winds are very strong,'' said Marta
Ondina, a worker at the Hong Kong restaurant on Roatan, an island a
few miles (kilometers) west of Guanaja.
	   ``They have taken people from the shore to churches and more
secure places,'' she said by telephone. ``The people are very
worried. There is no power.''
	   Tina Haylock, a Guanaja resident visiting Tegucigalpa, told
Canal 5 television that she had talked to her family early
Wednesday and they told her 14 people had died on the island. The
report couldn't be confirmed.
	   She said most of the houses in the town of Sandy Bay were
destroyed, and that everyone had taken refuge in a shelter.
	   Mitch appeared nearly stalled Wednesday over Guanaja, moving
very slowing toward Honduras' coast. The hurricane center said it
was expected to head northwest on Thursday, but the storm's slow
pace made its movements unpredictable.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.

Guinea-Bissau rebels stay away from peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau rebel leaders refused to
fly to nearby Gambia for peace talks Wednesday, in the latest
setback to diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in the west
African nation, news reports said.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said he was willing to meet rebel
leader Brig. Ansumane Mane in the Gambian capital Banjul, about 200
kilometers (124 miles) north of Guinea-Bissau and encircled by
Senegal.
	   But the rebels said they were concerned about their safety in
overflying neighboring Senegal, which has provided troops to
support Vieira, a rebel spokesman told the Portuguese news agency
Lusa.
	   ``It would be a great risk to cross Senegal's air space,''
Zamora Induta said.
	   The Banjul talks were the latest effort by diplomats from
Portugal, France and Sweden to mediate an end to the five-month-old
conflict in the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``It's clear that the meeting won't take place in the next
hours. This will heighten the already tense atmosphere,'' Francisco
Henriques da Silva, Portugal's ambassador in Bissau, told Lisbon
radio TSF.
	   A cease-fire had been in place since July 26.
	   Fighting restarted 10 days ago, when the rebels advanced on the
center of Bissau. Troops loyal to Vieira secured the capital, while
the rebels overran strategic inland towns.
	   The surge in fighting deepened the plight of some 500,000
displaced people in this country of 1 million.
	   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday urged both sides to commit
themselves to a peaceful solution to ``end these long sufferings.''
	   Senegalese troops and bureaucratic procedures reportedly have
prevented food and medicine from reaching the displaced.

Antarctic explorers repeat ski trek to South Pole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ In 1911, after trekking almost
1,750 miles (2,800 kilometers) across the Antarctic wilderness and
finding they were a month too late to be the first people at the
South Pole, English explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his team died
just a few days walk from journey's end.
	   Eighty-seven years later, three men on skis will begin their own
Antarctic odyssey Thursday, trying to recreate and complete Scott's
trek.
	   Expedition leader Peter Hillary, the son of Everest conqueror
and polar explorer Sir Edmund Hillary, says technological advances
will make their journey easier than that of Scott's ill-fated
expedition.
	   The New Zealander, with Australian companions Eric Philips and
Jon Muir, plans to cross some places _ on Shackleton Glacier, for
example _ where no one is thought to have been before.
	   ``Many aspects of this expedition are no different from ...
Scott's expedition at the beginning of the century. We're
man-hauling on skis,'' Hillary said this week.
	   Scott and his men died of starvation and weakness only a few
miles (kilometers) from a supply dump and only days from journey's
end.
	   ``Look, it will be a long, hard, cold and painful journey in
many ways, but it also will be an extraordinary adventure,''
Hillary said.
	   ``I mean to complete Scott's journey and to make the first
complete ascent of the Shackleton Glacier ... and hopefully to have
a really extraordinary time doing it makes it all worthwhile to
me.''
	   Hillary followed in his father's footsteps in climbing Mount
Everest. Sir Edmund, with Nepalese sherpa Tenzing Norgay, was the
first to reach the mountain's summit, and was knighted for his
conquest.
	   Hillary Sr. also made Antarctic history when he led a farm
tractor-and-sled expedition to the South Pole and back 40 years
ago.
	   The team is waiting for an airlift out of Christchurch to New
Zealand's Scott Base at McMurdo Sound, the starting point of their
journey. Antarctic weather and technical problems with their plane
have delayed their departure. They now expect to leave New Zealand
Thursday.
	   Preparations for what Hillary describes as the ``journey to end
all journeys'' have been under way for 18 months.
	   The men will use specially designed plastic sleds that are
lighter than the more commonly used fiberglass sleds, and the
wooden sleds used by Scott.
	   Each man will tow 330 pounds (150 kilograms) of food, fuel and
equipment on the sleds, and the expedition will be without the help
of outside support such as food drops.
	   Steerable kites, capable of propelling the men at 9 miles an
hour (15 kph), would be used to help speed their progress.
	   ``On the way back we hope to be able to fly the kites and
actually ski-sail most of the way back to the coast.''
	   The team will also take cameras and a satellite phone.
	   Hillary and the two Australians expect to reach the South Pole
from Scott Base about Christmas Day, after some 60 days traveling.
	   Hillary said that in the name of self-sufficiency, they would
have to ``avoid the temptation'' to share a tipple or two with
scientists at a small U.S. base at the South Pole.
	   Instead, the three would plant a small flag and turn around
again. Satellite phone calls home will be their only Christmas
treat.
	   Even a bottle of heartwarming whisky has been scratched from the
provisions list.
	   ``It's got to the stage now where, in an effort to keep down our
weight, we're removing the labels on clothing,'' Hillary said.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians marched
Wednesday in the funeral procession of a 16-year-old boy killed in
a power struggle between the Fatah faction of Yasser Arafat and
military intelligence agents.
	   The victim, Fatah supporter Wassim Tarifi, was shot to death
during stone throwing clashes outside military intelligence
headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Sunday.
	   Fatah leaders blamed military intelligence agents for Tarifi's
death and demanded that the killers be tried and executed. No
arrests have been made in connection with the death.
	   On Wednesday, Tarifi's body was placed on a stretcher and driven
through Ramallah in an ambulance decorated with wreaths. Military
vehicles led the convoy to the city's largest mosque where sobbing
classmates consoled each other. Other students held black flags and
posters of Tarifi.
	   The confrontation began when military intelligence agents raided
the Fatah headquarters in Ramallah early Sunday, apparently in
response to Fatah activists detaining and questioning three men
training to become pilots in the budding Palestinian air force.
	   In the raid, seven Fatah members were arrested by military
intelligence. In response, about 100 Fatah supporters threw stones
at the military headquarters on Sunday. Shots were fired, and
Tarifi was killed.
	   Moussa Arafat, the head of military intelligence, said Tuesday
that Fatah has been trying to act as a security force in the city
and has hassled Palestinian security officers.
	   ``There cannot be two authorities in the city,'' Arafat said.
	   He denied that his men killed Tarifi.
	   Fatah's West Bank leader, Marwan Barghouti, said the raid part
of a local power struggle.
	   ``Fatah swears that any hand laid on the sons of Fatah, or any
other Palestinian by whom ever may be, that hand will be cut off,''
Barghouti told the mourners Wednesday.
	   On Tuesday, four military intelligence agents involved in the
raid were convicted of violating the sanctity of the Fatah office
and harming national unity. Three men were sentenced to three years
and the most senior officer received a four-year term.

Azerbaijan to review suggestions on oil pipeline next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A decision on which pipeline route to use for
transporting the bulk of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil to the West
has been postponed until at least next month, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   Azerbaijani officials earlier said they expected to make a
decision in October. But President Geidar Aliev said Wednesday that
an international oil consortium would make its pipeline
recommendation to the government Nov. 12, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Aliev will make the final announcement on the route, but is
almost certain to take the consortium's recommendation.
	   Aliev favors a proposed pipeline through Georgia and Turkey.
Several U.S. oil companies have invested heavily in the project,
and the United States also favors the Georgia-Turkey route.
	   A smaller pipeline to the Black Sea port of Supsa in Georgia is
expected to start pumping oil in April.
	   Caspian oil reserves are believed to be the largest outside the
Middle East, but they remain relatively untapped because countries
with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive
projects off the ground.

NFL Europe season to kick off April 17-18
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The NFL Europe League will kick off the 1999
season April 17-18 with the defending champion Rhein Fire playing
the Scottish Claymores in Edinburgh.
	   The league announced Wednesday that the 10-week regular season
will open Saturday, April 17, with the Frankfurt Galaxy hosting the
new Berlin franchise and the Barcelona Dragons traveling to the
Amsterdam Admirals.
	   The Duesseldorf-based Fire, which beat the Galaxy 34-10 in last
season's World Bowl, will open defense of its title the next day at
the Claymores' Murrayfield Stadium.
	   The 1999 World Bowl, pitting the top two teams in the six-team
standings, is scheduled for June 27 in Duesseldorf.
	   The England Monarchs, the former flagship of the league, folded
after last season. The Monarchs were replaced by a franchise in
Berlin, which still has not been named.
	   ``In a relatively short space of time, the league has developed
some great rivalries, and the addition of a third German team
certainly adds to that,'' league president Oliver Luck said.
	   NFL Europe, formerly known as the World League of American
Football, is a joint venture of the NFL and the Fox television
newtwork. The teams are stocked with NFL-allocated players and
selected national players.

Basque party warns of split with government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The minority government of Spain's prime
minister was weakened Wednesday when a Basque party withdrew it
promise of support in parliamentary voting.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party said it could no longer be
considered an associate of the governing Popular Party and gave a
taste of what that meant by opposing the government in a
preliminary vote on next year's budget draft.
	   The government ``has lost our support and things in parliament
could get complicated for it,'' said Inaki Anasagasti, a spokesman
for the Basque party.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's party won 156 seats in the
350-seat parliament in 1996 and formed a minority government. It
had the support from regional parties such as the Basques, who have
six seats, a Catalan party that has 16 and a Canary Island group
with four.
	   The government will now rely more on both the Catalan coalition,
called Convergence and Union, and the Canary Coalition to remain in
office. For the moment, the votes of both groups ensure the
budget's passage.
	   The rupture stems from disagreements and mudslinging between
Aznar's party and the pro-independence parties in the run-up to
last weekend's regional elections in the northern Basque region.
	   Aznar and his followers criticized the group's negotiation with
Herri Batasuna, widely believed to be the political wing of the
militant separatist group ETA.
	   Aznar's party has also condemned the Basque Nationalist Party's
claim that the Spanish constitution does not cater to Basque
aspirations of self determination.
	   Anasagasti said the door remained open should the Popular Party
to change its attitude and strike a new deal with the Basque group.

IOC official ends tour of Olympic sites in Austria, Italy,
</HEADLINE>
Slovenia &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT slug, year of Games in lead. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
has completed its inspection of potential Austrian, Italian and
Slovenian sites for the 2006 Winter Games, receiving a somewhat
timid evaluation of ``professional'' for the joint candidacy.
	   ``I can only congratulate (you) on this professional
candidacy,'' Chiharu Igaya, the chairman of the IOC delegation was
quoted as saying Tuesday at the end of the panel's three-day visit
to the region.
	   Under the catchword ``Klagenfurt 2006,'' the southern Austrian
province of Carinthia, Giulia Venezia in Italy and Slovenia have
pooled efforts to compete for the Winter Olympics in eight years.
The Austrian city of Innsbruck organized Winter Games in both 1964
and 1976.
	   Igaya said the task of the mission was not to make suggestions
or voice criticism but to make a technical appraisal of the
application on the basis of 18 themes established by the IOC. He
said he would submit a report on his visit to be drafted after
visiting all candidates by the end of January 1999.
	   The 2006 Games wil be awarded on June 19, 1999, in Seoul, South
Korea.
	   ``We have discovered a region which has very much to offer for
the Winter Olympic Games,'' Igaya said according to the Austria
Press Agency.
	   He cited the great tradition of winter sports, the experience
with big events, excellent infrastructure, the Olympic Village as
well as the great support from authorities and the population. But
he said it was a weakness that the individual sites are ``scattered
somewhat far apart.''
	   Told by his hosts that this was also the case in Nagano, Japan,
where Igaya was part of the organizing committee, Igaya replied,
``I hope these problems do not reappear once more.''
	   The evaluation commission was scheduled to travel on Wednesday
from Klagenfurt, the Carinthia provincial capital, to Poprad,
Slovakia. The last stop on of its tour is the joint candidacy of
Helsinki and Lillehammer in Norway. Sion in Switzerland and Turin,
Italy, already have been visited.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Yugoslav Soccer Association in 7th,
8th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Next week's Cup Winners Cup
second-round match between Partizan Belgrade and Lazio of Rome can
go ahead in Belgrade, UEFA said Wednesday.
	   Citing security concerns, the European governing body earlier
this month moved a UEFA Cup match between Red Star Belgrade and
Lyon of France to Bucharest.
	   The move was prompted by the threat of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia unless it complies with international demands over
Kosovo. UEFA deferred a decision on the second-leg Partizan match.
	   The latest decision was taken ``due to the fact that the
political situation has improved to the extent that the
above-mentioned match can now be staged in Belgrade as originally
scheduled,'' UEFA said in a statement.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back from Kosovo, the Western
military alliance did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes
after the previous one expired Tuesday.
	   Partizan and Lazio go into next Thursday's second-leg match tied
0-0 after last week's first leg in Rome.
	   In Belgrade, Branko Bulatovic of the Yugoslav Soccer Association
welcomed the UEFA decision.
	   ``It's a realistic, just decision, in true spirit of
sportsmanship,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency quoted Bulatovic
as saying. ``UEFA has contacted several Western embassies in
Belgrade and received favorable reports regarding the security
situation in our country.''
	   A Euro 2000 qualifier between Yugoslavia and Ireland, postponed
because of the threat of air raids, has been rescheduled for Nov.
18. But UEFA said it will decide on the venue next week.
	   A decision will also be taken then on the venue for a qualifier
between Albania and Greece, rescheduled for the same date after
being postponed because of political turmoil in Albania.

Reporter to be investigated for slandering Tudjman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A district attorney has asked Zagreb
district court on Wednesday to launch a criminal investigation
against political analyst Slaven Letica for slandering President
Franjo Tudjman in an interview with a Slovene newspaper.
	   The investigation might lead to an indictment. If charged and
tried, Letica can get up to three years in prison.
	   The case would be the second in independent Croatia, based on a
new law on insulting top state officials, including the president.
	   Letica told the Slovene weekly Mladina in September that Tudjman
``loves deviant types. He feels a certain attraction to ...
criminals, paramilitary criminals, prostitutes. These people
fascinate him, because they're bringing some fun into his boring,
bureaucratic life.''
	   Letica also said Tudjman was responsible for the increased gap
between the rich and poor in Croatia and for tolerating the use of
intelligence services in his ruling party's internal struggles.
	   Tudjman's critics repeatedly charge that he tolerated the
activity of some crime suspects. They also accuse him of enriching
himself and his associates, while the majority of Croats live in
virtual poverty.
	   Letica, a professor at the medical university and columnist of
the independent weekly Globus, was Tudjman's adviser in 1991. He
later became his harsh critic.
	   The Zagreb district attorney's office said Letica ``gravely
insulted'' Tudjman, the state-run news agency HINA reported.
	   In the previous case, the editor-in-chief and a reporter of the
independent weekly Feral Tribune were charged with slandering
Tudjman. In a 1996 edition, reporter Marinko Culic scorned
Tudjman's plan to bury the victims of the infamous World War II
Jasenovac concentration camp alongside members of the Croat Nazi
puppet state that ran the camp. He compared the move to Franco's
attempts to unite Spain under totalitarian rule.
	   The two were acquitted in September 1996, but the prosecutor
appealed and they are going to be retried.
	   Critics at home and abroad have said such trials are reminiscent
of Communist repression of the media and are in fact an attempt by
theauthoritarian government to silence critics and clamp down on
independent media.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The High Court on Wednesday quashed Spanish arrest
warrants against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, ruling that the former
Chilean dictator is entitled to immunity from prosecution.
	   ``The applicant is entitled as a former head of state to
immunity from civil and criminal proceedings of the English
court,'' Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said.
	   Dozens of Chilean exiles in court cheered when they heard
Pinochet, 82, must remain in custody pending appeal by a Spanish
magistrate.
	   Summing up Pinochet's case, Bingham said, ``A former head of
state is clearly entitled to immunity for criminal acts committed
in the course of exercising public functions.''
	   ``I order that both provisional warrants be quashed. We will
listen to any argument that will be addressed to us on leave to
appeal,'' he said.
	   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon was given leave to appeal because
of the ``obvious public importance and international interest ...
as to the outcome,'' the judge said.
	   British police arrested Pinochet in his bed at a London hospital
Oct. 16 on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking his
extradition to face charges of murder, kidnapping and torturing
political opponents during his 17-year rule. He underwent back
surgery Oct. 9.
	   Since the arrest, other groups have filed suits seeking to have
him tried in Europe.
	   In a separate development Wednesday, British Attorney General
John Morris turned down a bid by four Chilean exiles to have
Pinochet stand trial in Britain on torture charges.
	   ``There is insufficient admissible evidence under English law of
an offense,'' the Attorney General's office said in a statement.
	   Groups in Sweden, Switzerland and France are also seeking to
have Pinochet tried in Europe.

Mauritanian foreign minister bolsters improved relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit
by Mauritania's foreign minister Wednesday to reaffirm Israel's
desire to improve relations with the Arab world.
	   Israel has tied the visit to a over-all warming of relations
resulting from the latest Mideast peace agreement negotiated in
eastern Maryland last week.
	   Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed Khouna also hinted at a connection
during brief remarks with reporters following a meeting with
Netanyahu on Wednesday.
	   ``I arrived carrying a letter from his excellency President
Sid'Ahmed Ould Taya to prime minister Netanyahu to congratulate him
on the signing of the Wye agreement and express support to the
peace process,'' Khouna said.
	   Netanyahu told reporters that the two countries discussed
upgrading relations, but he did say whether any official changes
were imminent. He also said broadening relations with Muslim and
Arab countries ``will advance the security and stability in our
region.''
	   Israel and Mauritania established low-level interest offices in
November 1995.
	   ``They are going to (do) their best to improve bilateral
relations and they expect, at the same time, other Arab countries
will do the same,'' said David Dadonn, an Israeli foreign ministry
official.
	   Several Arab countries established low ties with the Jewish
state after Israel and the Palestinians first signed peace accords
in 1993 and 1995. Contacts froze, however, during the 17-month
stalemate under Netanyahu's hard line administration.
	   Khouna arrived in Israel Tuesday and has also met with Israeli
President Ezer Weizman and Dan Tichon, the speaker of Israel's
parliament. Khouna's Thursday schedule includes a visit to Yad
Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, and a possible meeting with
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who has been ill with the flu.

Polish spy wants to return home, despite confiscation of former

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish army officer who spied for the
CIA during communist rule and later fled to the United States wants
to return home, despite the government's refusal to give his house
back, his spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Col. Ryszard Kuklinski was sentenced to death by Poland's former
communist government in 1984 for passing 35,000 pages of Warsaw
Pact secrets to the CIA and telling them about the communist
government's plan to impose martial law in 1981 and launch a bloody
crackdown on the pro-democracy Solidarity movement.
	   Kuklinski fled the country weeks before martial law was imposed
in December 1981, and the government seized his house along with
other personal assets including a yacht. He has lived in the United
States since, visiting his homeland for the first time in May,
months after a court cleared him of the treason charges.
	   During the emotional visit, Kuklinski said he wanted to return
to live in Poland. However, acknowledging Poles' division on
whether he acted as a hero or traitor, he put off making immediate
plans.
	   A close friend of Kuklinksi's who acts as his spokesman said the
former Army colonel was disappointed by the government's decision
earlier this week not to return his former Warsaw house, offering
instead compensation in dollars.
	   ``He would prefer to get back his house, stolen by the
communists. But if the government decides to pay compensation, he
will not take the issue to court,'' spokesman Jerzy Bukowski said.

Iran fines black market dealers dlrs 163 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has imprisoned a group of black market
money dealers and fined them 490 billion rials (dlrs 163 million)
for buying and selling foreign currency, Iranian television
reported Wednesday.
	   It did not say how many people were arrested or give details on
the crime or the prison sentences. It also did not give the dates
of the arrests.
	   ``The members of the gang had sabotaged the country's economic
system and have been given prison sentences as well as a fine,''
the broadcast quoted an official as saying.
	   Iran nationalized its banking sector in 1979 and forbids
currency trading outside official channels.
	   The official exchange rate is 3,000 rials to the dollar, but the
dollar sells for some 6,500 rials on the black market.
	   Black market currency traders are easy to find on busy streets
in downtown Tehran. The government has been trying to eradicate the
black market for years.

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with with comments by Palestinian
security official &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and the Palestinians on Wednesday
accused each other of not keeping promises they made in their new
peace agreement, raising concern that the land-for-security deal
will not get started on time.
	   Concerned about delays, the United States has been pressing the
two sides to stick to the timetable. ``All sides must begin
implementation next Monday night,'' said Larry Schwartz, the
spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian steps to
prevent attacks on Israelis.
	   Netanyahu raised the possibility of a delay when he said he
would not begin a troop withdrawal until the Palestinians have
presented a work plan on security.
	   Netanyahu said he would not convene his Cabinet to approve the
agreement until the security plan was in place. The prime minister
also said he would not begin a withdrawal without Cabinet backing.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said that unless
that Palestinian security plan was presented to U.S. officials by
Monday, ``it will be impossible to proceed.''
	   However, Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the
Gaza Strip, accused the Israelis of making up excuses to try and
get out of implementing the agreement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is simply trying to create a problem,'' Dahlan
told The Associated Press. ``He is trying to place obstacles in
front of implementation of the agreement.''
	   Dahlan said the Palestinians were meeting their obligations and
were outlining their security plan in talks with U.S. officials.

IMF delegation arrives in Kishinev to view economic progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ A delegation of the International
Monetary Fund on Wednesday evaluated Moldova's economic progress
and discussed releasing a delayed dlrs 28 million loan.
	   ``This is a visit of evaluation and the government expects the
IMF to draw some favorable conclusions regarding Moldova's
reforms,'' said Valeriu Lazar, an adviser in the Economy Ministry.
	   During the two-week visit, the IMF delegation led by Richard
Haas will analyze Moldova's efforts to reduce its budget deficit,
speed up privatization and provide social welfare for retirees.
	   IMF officials will meet with officials from the central bank,
the government and parliament and will visit several Moldovan
companies.
	   The Moldovan government is hoping to get the last, dlrs 28
million installment of a dlrs 185 million loan agreed with IMF in
1996. The country has received only three payments so far because
of dissatisfaction over the government's economic policies.
	   Recently an IMF official said Moldova might receive the tranche
before the end of the year if it cuts state spending and privatizes
the energy sector.
	   Lazar said Moldova had managed to solve its dlrs 200 million
debt to Russia's Gazprom when it set up a joint venture in Moscow
last week with the government of the breakaway region of
Trans-Dniester. The new company is called Moldovagaz.
	   Gazprom will own a 50 percent stake in the venture, Moldova 36
percent and Trans-Dniester 14 percent.
	   Moldova will pay back a part of its debts by selling bonds of
dlrs 90 million for seven years and handing over the country's gas
assets.
	   Another dlrs 47 million will be obtained from the venture's
profits and Gazprom will also accept food and technical equipment
in exchange for the debts.
	   Moldova's budget deficit target for 1998 is 4.8 per cent but it
has been widening because of fallout from Russia's economic crisis.
	   The Moldovan currency, the leu, has depreciated sharply in the
past two months. The central bank has sold about dlrs 100 million
to prop it up.

Top U.S. official to discuss Angola peace and Congo war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The U.S. State Department's top Africa
official arrived here Wednesday on a three-day visit to discuss the
country's stymied peace process and Angola's role in neighboring
Congo's civil war.
	   Susan Rice, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa, was
accompanied by President Bill Clinton's special assistant Gayle
Smith and his special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Howard
Wolpe.
	   They were to meet with Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura during
their stay.
	   It was not clear whether they would meet with President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos before they left Friday for a tour of other
countries in the region.
	   The U.S. officials were not expected to meet with
representatives from the former rebel group UNITA, which waged a
two-decade civil war with the government before the signing of a
1994 peace pact.
	   However, they will hold talks with a group of dissidents who
recently split with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, a U.S. diplomat in
Luanda said.
	   The Angolan government in September severed all contact with
Savimbi, who lives in the country's central highlands, and has
waged an international diplomatic campaign to isolate him.
	   The United States, Portugal and Russia are monitoring the
implementation of the ailing 1994 peace deal.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ broke contact with the three
observer countries in August, accusing them of bias in the
southwest African nation's peace process.
	   The former rebel group has failed to comply fully with the terms
of the peace pact, triggering U.N. and U.S. sanctions against it.
	   Angola, along with Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad, has sent troops
to support Congo President Laurent Kabila against insurgents who
are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

Japan to lend dlrs 40 million to Kyrgyzstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan will lend dlrs 40 million to the
impoverished central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan, a news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   The loan, agreed upon during Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev's
visit to Japan this week, will be used to reconstruct a major
north-south highway in the former Soviet republic, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   Japanese officials also expressed interest other development
projects but no contracts were drawn up, said the chairman of
Kyrgyzstan's government investment committee, Naken Isayev.
	   Japan's Export-Import Bank has tentatively agreed to participate
in a dlrs 10 million telecommunications project, and the Toshiba
Corp. is interested in a plan to produce semiconductors there,
Interfax cited Isayev as saying.
	   Japan, one of the biggest investors in Central Asia, has given
Kyrgyzstan millions of dollars in development aid since 1991, when
the agricultural nation gained independence from the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Sophia Loren says she is taking her doctor's orders
seriously, but that doesn't stop her from joking about her heart.
	   The actress, 64, fell ill on an Aug. 10 flight from Geneva,
Switzerland, to New York, where she was diagnosed as having an
irregular heartbeat and hospitalized for a few days.
	   Now she's back at home in Geneva, where she has been spotted
taking a walk in a botanical garden.
	   After a telephone interview with Rome's La Repubblica daily, the
newspaper quoted Loren as saying the doctor had ordered her to take
brisk walks _ ``every day making a little bigger effort.''
	   Otherwise, she is taking things more slowly, the actress said in
the interview, which ran Wednesday.
	   ``I'll take airplanes less, I'll work less, I'll do everything
to avoid every stress .... I'll learn to stay calm, I'll ruthlessly
avoid all kinds of emotions, any apprehension,'' said Loren,
playing on the Italian word for ``apprehension,'' which can also
mean ``heartthrob.''
	   ``Unfortunately, I won't be able to fall in love again,'' she
said, laughing, ``because I care more about my heart than about a
fantastic heartthrob.''
	   Loren said she would return to the United States in January to
promote her new book combining memoirs and recipes.

Hoping to beat unemployment, Germany considers lowering retirement
</HEADLINE>
age to 60 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's retirement age may be
lowered in an effort to create new jobs for young people and beat
chronic high unemployment, its new labor minister said Wednesday.
	   Faced with whopping joblessness of 10.3 percent, new labor
minister Walter Riester said it was an ``urgent goal'' of a
proposed jobs creation plan to work towards lowering the official
retirement age of 65, though he did not mention a lower age.
	   The president of Germany's Federation of Trade Unions, Dieter
Schulte, was quoted in Bild newspaper as saying that lowering the
retirement age to 60 could cut unemployment by 1.5 million over the
medium-term.
	   Nearly 4 million people are unemployed in Germany. Unemployment
is the country's hottest political issue.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat-Greens coalition
government wants to set up a jobs alliance of industry, workers and
government to brainstorm on jobs creation.
	   Industry leaders have recently doubted the alliance would
succeed, pointing to high wage increases unions are looking for in
1999.
	   But in a positive signal, the president of the German Industry
and Trade Congress, Hans-Peter Stihl, said Wednesday his powerful
group would join the alliance.
	   However Stihl said new taxes proposed so far wouldn't help
create jobs.

Hostages freed during crackdown in Chechnya

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two people were freed and seven people arrested
during the first hours of a crackdown on hostage-takers in the
breakaway region of Chechnya, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The offensive by Chechen law enforcement officials began Tuesday
when they beefed up police checkpoints around the region and
threatened harsher punishment for hostage-takers. Relatives of the
hostages are also helping to look for the kidnappers.
	   The two released hostages had been held for more than six months
and a large ransom had been demanded, Chechen Security Minister
Aslanbek Arsayev told Interfax.
	   The seven people arrested were involved in their kidnapping, he
said. He gave no details about the hostages.
	   Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said authorities
were willing to assign 1,000 men to the anti-kidnapping effort, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Kidnappings and other crimes have become common in Chechnya
since the end of its 1994-96 war with Russia. Chechen officials say
103 people are still being held, including three Britons, a New
Zealander and a Turk.
	   Separate car bomb attacks this week killed Chechnya's top
anti-kidnapping official and slightly injured a Muslim cleric.
	   The violence has sometimes spilled over into neighboring regions
and one of them, Dagestan, said Wednesday it had put border police
on alert, fearing reprisals because of the hostage crackdown.
	   Russia's Interior Ministry said Thursday it has massed 10,000
combat-ready troops on the border of Chechnya in Dagestan and the
Stavropol region to ``ensure maintenance of public order'' and
prevent any spillover violence.
	   And Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov invited Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov to meet Thursday in an unspecified north
Caucasus Mountains region, Maskhadov press secretary Mairbek
Vachagayev said Wednesday, according to Interfax.
	   Maskhadov has not decided whether to accept the invitation,
Vachagayev said.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Politicians defy police ban, start building in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Striking a blow for Jewish settlers in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, three members of the Israeli
parliament struggled Wednesday to erect a fence around a
controversial construction site.
	   The hard-line members of parliament were also trying to drive a
stake in to the heart of the Wye River agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians, signed last week at the White House.
	   It wasn't easy.
	   Middle-aged and paunchy, the politicians wrestled with a
10-foot-high (three meter) fence post and a simple, cylindrical
hand-operated pounding device. They succeeded in getting the post
far enough into the ground to stand on its own, but just barely.
	   Stopping every few blows to answer questions from reporters,
Michael Kleiner, head of the Land of Israel bloc in parliament and
leader of the movement to toppled Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government said the politicians were doing the work
because police banned settlers from putting up the fence.
	   ``It's a shame that we have to use our parliamentary immunity to
perform an act that is perfectly legal,'' he complained.
	   Irving Moskowitz, a Miami millionaire and backer of Jewish
settlers, bought the four-acre plot of land in the Arab
neighborhood of Ras Al Amud, just across from the Old City of
Jerusalem, several years ago.
	   His backers showed The Associated Press a building permit for
132 apartments on the site, but the Israeli government has held up
work, citing public safety concerns. Palestinians object to the
construction, calling it an illegal Jewish settlement.
	   There were no Palestinian demonstrators in sight as the Israeli
politicians tried to make their point with their hands instead of
their mouths.
	   Kleiner took off his tie, put on work gloves and started
pounding the fence post. He ran into rock the first two tries, but
managed to get the post to stand on his third attempt.
	   ``I built a fence at a settlement in the desert when I was 17,''
he said, ``but I was lot younger then.''
	   Though they denied that the construction was a provocation aimed
at scuttling implementation of the Wye accords, the politicians
repeated their objections to the accord over and over, whenever a
reporter asked a question.
	   Benny Elon of the far-right opposition Moledet Party, uncoiling
a roll of barbed wire, charged that Netanyahu has a secret
understanding with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to give the
Palestinians control of a wide swath of territory linking
Jerusalem's Old City with the West Bank.
	   The construction site is in the way. Elon said: ``It's essential
to stop the secret plan.''

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ With nearly all Yugoslav forces out of
Kosovo or back to their barracks, major powers are now rushing to
send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to the Serbian province to make
sure Slobodan Milosevic complies with a peace agreement.
	   On Wednesday, 13 Norwegian technicians arrived in Kosovo's
capital Pristina to begin setting up the headquarters for the
``ground verification mission,'' which will serve as the ``eyes and
ears'' for NATO and the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is responsible for the operation, hopes to have a
substantial part of the mission up and running in Kosovo in the
next few weeks, said spokeswoman Melissa Fleming.
	   Nevertheless, a number of details remain unresolved, including
the training program for the verifiers and the exact composition of
the mission.
	   Fleming said that despite doubts that such a large force could
be assembled fast enough, ``getting the 2,000 together doesn't seem
to be a problem.''
	   The five European members of the Contact Group -- Russia,
Germany, France, Italy and Britain -- will each provide about 200
people, she said. The United States, the other member of the
Contact Group, has agreed to send fewer verifiers but is primarily
responsible for aerial surveillance.
	   A number of other countries, including former Soviet Bloc states
such as Romania and the Czech Republic, have also agreed to send
personnel. Norway has also promised to allocate dlrs 26 million, to
cover costs of security, housing and communications for the first
year.
	   On a day-to-day basis, the verifiers will roam around Kosovo to
make sure both the government forces and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army are honoring a cease-fire. They will file reports
to the Vienna headquarters on what they see.
	   Because of the nature of the mission, OSCE hopes that many of
the verifiers will have had military experience. They are expected
to undergo a brief training program.
	   But details such as the length of training and the venue --
either Vienna, Macedonia or Pristina -- have not been resolved,
Fleming said.
	   A major focus of the training will be security, said Fleming.
Under the Oct. 12 agreement between Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke, the verifiers will not carry weapons.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO plans to station
a rapid reaction force in Macedonia to rescue verifiers if they are
in danger from either side in the conflict.

Egypt upgrades mission in Iran in sign of warming ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has upgraded its diplomatic mission in
Iran in a sign of thawing ties, Egyptian and Iranian diplomats said
Wednesday.
	   Egypt and Iran severed ties after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Egypt maintains an interests section in Tehran, which works from
the Italian Embassy.
	   Mohammed Rifa'a, a career diplomat who holds the rank of
ambassador, was sent to Tehran last month to head Egypt's interests
section. He is the highest-ranking Egyptian diplomat to serve in
Tehran since the revolution and replaces a junior diplomat.
	   Rifa'a was appointed after a series of meetings between the
foreign ministers of the two countries, which have been working to
upgrade relations.
	   Egypt is eager to improve relations, but wants Iran to end its
alleged support for fundamentalist Egyptian groups trying to topple
the secular regime of President Hosni Mubarak. Iran has denied
supporting the Egyptian radicals.

when South Africa's last white president, F.W. de Klerk, forced it
to delete his name with a legal challenge.
	   The much-awaited 3,500-page document is a watershed moment in
the country's attempts to overcome the painful legacy of white
minority rule.
	   The ANC, which led the struggle to overturn white minority rule,
has expressed outrage that the commission would find it guilty of
``gross violations of human rights,'' saying it was engaged in a

Serbian hackers intrude Croatian daily's website
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A group of Serbian hackers, who call
themselves ``Black Hand,'' apparently intruded the website of
Croatia's daily Vjesnik on Wednesday, deleting its home page and
causing the system to crash, the paper said.
	   Instead of Vjesnik's ``welcome page'' (www.vjesnik.com), there
appeared a sign: ``Black Hand home page.''
	   The group also left a message saying: ``The last thing we want
to do is to threaten, but we will stop any twisting of the truth in
any possible way,'' Vjesnik said in a statement.
	   Earlier this month, the Black Hand group publicly declared a
computer war against anti-Serb websites. They first focused on
Albanian sites, saying they wanted to ``remove (ethnic) Albanian
lies from the Internet.''
	   The group's actions began as NATO threatened Yugoslavia with
airstrikes unless it stops its crackdown on Albanians in its
southern province of Kosovo.
	   Vjesnik is a state-run daily and considered a mouthpiece of the
government. The Black Hand obviously sees it as being anti-Serb.
	   Vjesnik said hackers didn't enter other pages, but they caused
system crash. The website should nevertheless be back later in the
day, it said.
	   Vjesnik is one of the few Croatian papers with a daily updated
website. When the site was launched two weeks ago, the move was
followed by heavy propaganda commercials in the paper and on
state-run television.

U.S. envoy stresses financial support for Turkish route for Caspian

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. energy envoy expressed confidence
Wednesday that oil companies would pick the proposed Turkish route
for oil from the petroleum-rich Caspian Sea, outlining U.S.
financial support to help with the cost of the still-unbuilt
pipeline.
	   Turkey has been in intense negotiations with energy companies to
push them to pick its route from the Caspian, whose reserves are
believed to be the world's largest outside the Middle East but
remain largely untapped.
	   The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov. 12.
	   Richard Morningstar, U.S. envoy for Caspian energy development,
stressed U.S. support for the Turkish-backed route, which would
take oil from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku across Georgia to the
Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
	   ``All the companies agreed that Baku-Ceyhan should be the route.
The concerns that the companies raised were commercial issues that
we think are being worked out,'' Morningstar said.
	   The chief alternative is an existing pipeline from Baku to the
Georgian Black Sea of Supsa. Oil companies reportedly have been
favoring that route, showing reluctance to invest in the estimated
dlrs 2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
	   Morningstar insisted that the financial concerns of the oil
companies were being addressed by Turkey. Turkey is offering to
build its own stretch of the pipeline; Morningstar said the Turks
also were offering tax exemptions.
	   He outlined planned U.S. financial support for Baku-Ceyhan,
including backing from the Export-Import Bank, political risk
insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corp., and
government-sponsored feasibility studies.
	   The presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are expected to sign a declaration on
Thursday supporting Baku-Ceyhan.
	   Turkey's main argument against other routes is the already heavy
oil tanker traffic through the Bosporus strait, which has led to
hundreds of accidents. On Saturday, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
said Turkey would increase restrictions on the narrow strait,
reducing tanker traffic.
	   ``Turkey has a legitimate interest in protecting itself from
environmental and safety concerns over the overuse of the
Bosporus,'' Morningstar said.
	   Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry issued another warning
Wednesday, advising oil companies that a ``wrong'' decision on the
pipeline could lead Turkey to ``give priority to sources and
producers outside the Caspian.''
	   This could involve diverting Turkey's energy imports from the
Caspian to other regions such as northern Africa, Norway, and
Indonesia, a ministry spokesman said.

	   Truth Commission officials were caught by surprise, and could

the report's release -- planned as a solemn ceremony in which
former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu hands it over to President
Nelson Mandela in Pretoria, the capita.

	   According to leaked findings, the commission condemned the ANC
for planting mines in rural areas, executing enemy agents and
blurring the line between military and civilian targets.
	   De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for
bringing an end to the racist system, sued to stop the report's
release.
	   He challenged its finding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation, which housed anti-apartheid
organizations.
	   The finding could have opened him up to prosecution because de
Klerk did not seek amnesty, as did many officials and security
operatives of the apartheid apparatus.
	   Former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the panel's chairman,
said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal
challenge.
	   ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been
engaged in a vendetta against him.''
	   A court hearing was scheduled for March 4.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appear
after all the hoo-ha has died down.''
	   De Klerk, reached in London, had no comment.
	   ``In effect, he has achieved his primary purpose,'' said
spokesman Dave Steward.
	   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by
laying bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the
country for more than two years, listening to victims and
perpetrators seeking amnesty.
	   The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South
Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race
elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral
condemnations and could recommend individual prosecutions.
	   De Klerk's challenge was part of a storm of criticism prompted
by leaks of the report. Conservative white parties have called it a
witch hunt.
	   ANC Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe earlier Wednesday called
for a postponement of the report.
	   ``The ANC is an aggrieved party,'' he said in an interview with
APTN. ``To submit a distortion of history is incomprehensible,'' he
said.
	   Legal threats have led to fewer individuals being named as
rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported
Wednesday.
	   Tutu responded that more than 400 people had been given a chance
to respond, but only 15 argued themselves out of the report.
	   The report also rejected barring perpetrators from holding
public office or denying pensions to those who were state
employees, the newspaper said.
	   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know about the
roles of former law and order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Johan van
der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to tell police.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, the
two were already applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter.
	   ``I cannot conceivably be held morally accountable for matters
which were brought to my attention long after they occurred,'' he
said in an affidavit.
	   ``Moral accountability for concealing the truth is, in any
event, not a gross violation of human rights,'' he said.
	   The bombings took place in the late 1980s, before de Klerk
became president in 1989. No one was killed.
	   The case is reminiscent of another legal challenge to the
commission. P.W. Botha, a former hardline president, refused to
testify and was convicted last August of ignoring a subpoena. He
was given a one-year suspended sentence.

Brazil unveils wide-ranging budget-cutting plan

social security deficit. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Pressured by a rising budget deficit and
sinking investor confidence, Brazil on Wednesday unveiled a massive
plan to cut spending, raise taxes and _ hopefully _ extricate
itself from economic crisis.
	   Corporations, civil servants and almost anyone with a bank
account will pay more to help the government save nearly 28 billion
reals (dlrs 24 billion) next year. Spending will be cut by roughly
8.7 billion reals (dlrs 7.3 billion).
	   A tough, realistic plan to slash the budget deficit was a
condition for the International Monetary Fund to approve a rescue
package worth an estimated dlrs 30 billion. Fund officials said the
money could be available next month _ if the plan is convincing.
	   But many of the measures, such as an increase in the social
security tax paid by civil servants, are controversial and face a
tough battle in Congress, which must approve much of the plan.
	   ``Our destiny is in our own hands,'' Finance Minister Pedro
Malan said as he presented the plan.
	   ``We have every condition to confront the current turbulence
through our own action,'' he added. ``If we can't convince
ourselves, we won't convince others.''
	   Much of the country stopped Wednesday morning to watch Malan
speak on television. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's
largest, postponed its opening by an hour to wait for the speech.
	   In a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, President
Henrique Cardoso said his options were limited by the constitution
_ three-fourths of the budget is untouchable.
	   Cardoso said the plan was conceived so it ``won't burden the
poor.'' He said that's why there was no increase in income tax.
	   But the poor surely will be affected, if only indirectly. The
cuts will affect all areas, including already precarious public
schools and hospitals.
	   A big chunk of the savings would come from an increase in a tax
on all financial transactions, from checks to bank withdrawals to
stock market investments. The plan would raise the tax paid on
those transactions to 0.38 percent from 0.2 percent now, declining
to 0.3 percent in 2000.
	   A tax on corporate earnings will rise to 3 percent from 2
percent, and the government will submit a bill to levy the tax on
banks, too.
	   The most sensitive measure, however, would raise the social
security tax paid by government employees and _ for the first time
_ collect the tax from retired civil servants. The extra revenue is
expected to come to dlrs 2.2 billion.
	   Cardoso said social security payments to civil servants was the
single biggest drain on the budget. This year, the total was more
than 18 billion reals (dlrs 15 billion) for federal workers alone.
Adding in the social security deficit for state, city and
private-sector workers, the shortfall comes to nearly 42.2 billion
reals (dlrs 36 billion).
	   ``That's more than double the amount spent on health,'' said
Malan. ``And the bill is sent to society.''
	   But government, 10th graf

Greens Minister Fischer begins first foreign trip in Paris

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ As a hitchhiking German teen, he sketched Jesus on
Marseille sidewalks to make money. As a Greens lawmaker, he wore
jeans and sneakers. On Wednesday, Joschka Fischer made his first
trip as foreign minister beginning with Paris, wearing a suit.
	   The trip, the day after he was sworn in, aimed to reassure
European partners the new German government will stress continuity,
including the Franco-German drive behind the European Union and its
euro single currency.
	   After all, the two countries are each other's biggest trading
partners, something Germany's reformed and moderate
environmentalist Greens party has learned to accept under their
leader, Fischer.
	   ``The Franco-German relationship is not only capital for our
countries but also is the engine to integrate Europe,'' said the
50-year-old Fischer, with graying hair and a dark business suit, in
the gold-leafed halls of the French Foreign Ministry.
	   The foreign minister also noted, after talks with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine, that ``there are differences,''
including the German desire to cut its EU contribution.
	   But he said he saw ``no insurmountable differences.''
	   Fischer's next stops, in Britain and Poland, also aimed to show
Germany doesn't see the Paris-Bonn link as exclusive.
	   French officials publicly insist Germany's new assertiveness and
wider desire to reach out doesn't bother them. ``Let's not pretend
we're scaring ourselves!'' Vedrine said in Wednesday's edition of
Le Figaro.
	   ``Germany doesn't hesitate anymore at defending its national
interests. So what?'' he told the conservative daily. The
Franco-German engine is ``not enough, and it must be widened with
close relations with each of our other EU members.''
	   Fischer was also scheduled to meet with Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, Greens Environment Minister Dominique Voynet and the
Socialist head of the National Assembly's foreign affairs
committee, Jack Lang.
	   Fischer has sought to demonstrate that Europe's most
economically powerful and populous nation, even with a Greens
foreign minister, will continue to support European unification.
	   But he also said in Monday's leftist Paris daily Liberation that
his government ``will add new accents: the human rights question,
durable development, the democratization of Europe, the relaunch of
disarmament.''
	   Among other issues causing friction between Paris and Bonn are
the new German government's decision to wean the country off
nuclear power _ which will deal a blow to France's nuclear power
industry.
	   Fischer's insistence on human rights could chafe with France's
dealings with former African colonies ruled by strongmen. Meanwhile
cooperation is growing between British and German defense
industries and stock markets, bypassing a France that is slower to
privatize and liberalize.
	   Fischer had a London stopover Wednesday night, then travels to
Warsaw, a gesture meant to continue forging a special bond with
Poland since World War II. He flies home Thursday night.

Defense calls ex-wife blackmail victim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A lawyer for the ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci
insisted Wednesday she was a victim of blackmail, describing her as
a ``golden cow'' milked by her codefendants in the trial for the
slaying of the fashion mogul.
	   ``Who in their right mind would go out and advertise a murder
and then go ahead and commit it? It isn't credible,'' said Patrizia
Reggiani Martinelli's lawyer, Gianni Dedola, giving his closing
arguments in the case.
	   The prosecution contends that Reggiani Martinelli contracted the
killing to gain control over Gucci's multi-million-dollar estate.
	   The defense admits she threatened Gucci and repeatedly sought
someone to kill him, but never went through with the plan.
	   Gucci was shot to death March 27, 1995 outside his Milan office.
	   His ex-wife is on trial for premeditated murder along with four
alleged accomplices. Prosecutor Carlo Nocerino has asked for life
sentences for the five, the stiffest penalty in Italy, which does
not have the death penalty.
	   The case may go to the jury next week.
	   In his closing arguments, Dedola claimed that Reggiani
Martinelli was the target of a scheme to extort money hatched by
her friend Pina Auriemma, one of her codefendants.
	   ``In Pina's eyes, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli was a golden cow,
to be milked for money,'' Dedola said, claiming that Auriemma was
the architect and chief coordinator of the murder plot.
	   Auriemma has confessed she helped find the people who carried
out the murder, saying she did it at Reggiani Martinelli's repeated
urging.
	   During Wednesday's session, Reggiani Martinelli, 50, had a brief
reunion with her two daughters, aged 22 and 17, and her mother.
	   She has seen her daughters only a few times since she was
arrested 21 months ago.

Italy to send police to Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Italy is to station a members of its
police force in southern Albania's southern ports, in an effort to
stop refugees being smuggled across the Adriatic, Italian Interior
Minister Rose said Wednesday.
	   Jervolino traveled to Tirana to meet Albanian officials and
discuss joint necessary measures to stop the flux of refugees
fleeing to Italy in dinghies, and to help strengthen Albania's own
police force.
	   ``It's not yet decided how many troopers we will be sending to
the south, but it will be a sufficient number to control the
territory along the coasts'' Jervolino told reporters at a news
conference Wednesday.
	   Starting Thursday, the Italians will be collaborating with
Albanian police to beef up security along the Albanian seacoast. A
main focus of the project is to stop more people attempting to
leave Albania before they have a chance to set sail, Jervolino
said.
	   Last year 80 people drowned when a ship carrying Albanian
refugees sank after colliding with an Italian navy vessel.
	   A joint ``maritime'' base in Vlora, near Sazan island in
southern Albania is to be set up, as part of the project, where
Albanian and Italian patrol boats will be stationed.
	   Italy is a popular destination for refugees fleeing desperate
living conditions in the Balkans. Albania has been without a stable
security force since it collapsed into anarchy in 1997 and
civilians looted state armories.
	   ``We are ready to collaborate with the Italian government on the
measures that would avoid the people smuggling, and also the drugs
and weapon smuggling'' told reporters the Albanian Interior
Minister Petro Koci.
	   Albanian Interior Minister also appealed to Italy for aid in
helping train and equip its local police forces

New competition and attack ads spell trouble for Deutsche Telekom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ After decades of not being able to mention the
competition or compare prices in their ads, some German companies
have been going at each other with gloves off ever since a court
loosened advertising rules last spring.
	   And the firm getting hit the hardest is one that was used to no
competition at all: Deutsche Telekom. The former state-owned
monopoly, now partially privatized, said Wednesday it will slash
prices to try to squash the siren song _ and aggressive ads _ of
its cheaper competitors.
	   The opening of Europe's telecoms market to competition this year
was designed to bring down prices, but advertising experts say the
fact that it coincided with a new era of direct comparison ads has
speeded up the process.
	   ``Telekom is put under more pressure through the public debate''
about its prices, said Volker Nickel, director of the central
association of the German advertising industry in Bonn.
	   Torsten Kollande, spokesman for one of the telephone upstarts,
Mobilcom, says the consumers are the winners.
	   ``We've kicked open a door'' by taking on Telekom, he says. ``If
Telekom says it's dropping its prices because of the competition,
then it has something to do with that.''
	   Few German companies have actually moved to take advantage of
the court decision last May that lifted Germany's ban on
comparative advertising, in keeping with new European Union
regulations.
	   Volker Nickel, director of the central association of the German
advertising industry in Bonn, says it's mostly in fields that are
``hyper-competitive,'' like car rental firms and fast-food
restaurants.
	   The developing telephone market has been at the forefront as
well.
	   Private companies hope to entice new customers with headlines
like ``Telephone Cheaper!'' and charts showing how much cheaper it
is to use their service than Telekom.
	   Mobilcom went even further this month with a print campaign
disguised as a Telekom ad, using the phone giant's trademark pink
background and typestyle to instruct Telekom customers to switch.
	   ``We have to get the attention of the consumers as a small
company,'' Kollande says. ``We're sporting about it, very laid
back.''
	   Telekom fired back by getting a temporary injunction banning
further running of the newspaper ads. Its latest television spot
shows the Telekom spokesman, a grandfatherly figure, using
Mobilcom's ad to light his cigar and referring to the competitor as
a ``cheat.''
	   But the attack ads are obviously having an effect. Telekom is
still the market leader, but industry experts say the new private
companies now carry every third long-distance call within Germany.
	   Deutsche Telekom reported a 22 percent rise in net profit for
the first nine months, but said sales were stagnant in the third
quarter due to declining market share.
	   To fight back, Telekom said it will move earlier than planned to
implement ``aggressive price reductions'' in the next few weeks.
	   Telekom didn't announce by how much, but company sources said
rates for long-distance calls within Germany would drop by more
than half, pending regulatory approval.
	   Telekom admits its size and status as the former monopoly makes
it an especially easy target for the almost 100 new providers that
are seeking to carve out a piece of the telecommunication pie.
	   ``We were the sole provider until now and so the one that all of
them are concentrating on,'' says Telekom spokesman Hans Ehnert.
``But now the market is open and developing and it'll affect the
others too.''

United States says peace agreement must be implemented on time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with comments by Palestinian security
official &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and the Palestinians on Wednesday
accused each other of not keeping promises in their new peace
agreement, raising concern that the land-for-security deal will not
get started on time.
	   Concerned about delays, the United States has been pressing the
two sides to stick to the timetable. ``All sides must begin
implementation next Monday night,'' said Larry Schwartz, the
spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week.
	   Under the agreement, Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for Palestinian steps to
prevent attacks on Israelis.
	   Netanyahu raised the possibility of a delay when he said he
would not begin a troop withdrawal until the Palestinians have
presented a work plan on security.
	   Netanyahu said he would not convene his Cabinet to approve the
agreement until the security plan was in place. The prime minister
also said he would not begin a withdrawal without Cabinet backing.
	   ``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu
said. ``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.''
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said that unless
that Palestinian security plan was presented to U.S. officials by
Monday, ``it will be impossible to proceed.''
	   However, Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the
Gaza Strip, accused the Israelis of making up excuses to try and
get out of implementing the agreement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is simply trying to create a problem,'' Dahlan
told The Associated Press. ``He is trying to place obstacles in
front of implementation of the agreement.''
	   Dahlan said the Palestinians were meeting their obligations and
were outlining their security plan in talks with U.S. officials.

<TEXT>
	   OSNABRUECK, Germany (AP) _ Auto manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann,
whose curvy, bug-like 1950s sports car _ the Karmann-Ghia _ bore
his name and brought him international recognition, has died. He
was 83.
	   Karmann died at his home Sunday from an undisclosed illness,
company spokeswoman Renate Samra said. She said his family was with
him when he died.
	   ``We are all very saddened, though we knew he was ill for a long
time,'' Samra said. ``He was a very respected figure.''
	   Sports cars were Karmann's specialty, particularly convertibles.
He designed and built the Karmann-Ghia in 1955 in cooperation with
Volkswagen and Porsche. He later built Volkswagen's Scirocco-Coupe
and Golf Cabriolet and models for Porsche, BMW, Opel, Ford and
Mercedes-Benz.
	   Born Dec. 4, 1914, in the northwestern city of Osnabrueck,
Karmann got his start as a 19-year-old apprentice in his father's
vehicle and horse-drawn coach factory. He attended technical school
near Berlin in 1935-37 and fought in World War II, returning to
help rebuild the family business.
	   The cornerstone for the Osnabrueck factory operating today was
laid in 1949.
	   Karmann took over the firm from his father in 1952, with 1,452
employees and annual sales at 24 million mark (dlrs 15 million). By
1989, the firm had annual sales at 1 billion marks (dlrs 625
million). The Wilhelm Karmann GmbH today employs 6,400 people in
Germany and a total 2,600 in operations in Brazil, Portugal, and
the United States, near Detroit.
	   Funeral services were scheduled for Friday in Osnabrueck.
	   Karmann is survived by his wife, Christiane, his son, Wilhelm
Dietrich, who is a manager in the company, daughters Christiane and
Stephanie, and eight grandchildren.

Ex-Nigerian general, reportedly mulling election, joins party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A former Nigerian military ruler reported
to be mulling a run for the presidency said Wednesday he has joined
one of the major parties, but declined to say whether he would be a
candidate.
	   Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, speaking at his home in the southwestern
town of Abeokuta, said he joined the Peoples Democratic Party
because it is the most nationalistic of Nigeria's nine registered
parties.
	   ``I have examined their appeal and said to myself that at this
stage of my service to Nigeria I cannot be anything but a
nationalist,'' he told reporters. ``Any party which professes
nationalism both in program and objectives ... should be
supported.''
	   He did not go into further detail.
	   The Peoples Democratic Party, like most Nigerian parties,
remains largely undefined politically, and has only a vague
platform.
	   Newspaper reports regularly say Obasanjo is debating whether to
run for president in February elections.
	   While among the better known of potential candidates, many
Nigerians feel Obasanjo did not do enough to back opposition
activists supporting the late millionaire-turned-politician Moshood
Abiola, whose 1993 presidential election victory was annulled.
Abiola died in custody in July.
	   Obasanjo, who came to power in 1976 after a failed coup attempt
took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
relinquished power and retired in 1979.
	   He was arrested in 1995 in connection with an alleged coup plot,
but was freed by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Abubakar, who came to power in June after the death of dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha, has promised free elections and a transition to
democratic rule next May.
	   Nigeria's military has ruled the country for all but 10 years
since independence in 1960.

Naval officer's defense shows public records used for disputed

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defense lawyers for a retired naval officer showed
documents in court Wednesday that they said proved that all the
information in his disputed report on Russian nuclear waste came
from public records and could not have been a state secret.
	   Alexander Nikitin is on trial for treason for giving a Norwegian
environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, information on how the
Russian navy's Northern Fleet handles its nuclear waste and
reactors. Prosecutors say the data constituted a state secret.
	   On Wednesday, the defense team presented public records _ which
included textbooks for students _ to show that the information was
from public sources.
	   ``The judges could make certain that everything from the first
to the last figure, from the first to the last drop of information,
came from public sources,'' defense lawyer Yuri Schmidt told The
Associated Press.
	   ``What the prosecution will do now is not quite clear,'' Schmidt
added.
	   Nikitin pleaded innocent when his trial opened in St. Petersburg
last week, more than three years after he was first charged. Most
hearings are held behind closed doors, but Nikitin and his lawyers
were cautiously optimistic he would get a fair trial.
	   Also in Wednesday's proceedings, a Defense Ministry expert,
Valery Bavykin, testified for the prosecution, saying he estimated
the damage inflicted by Nikitin's report at 280,000 rubles (dlrs
16,500), Schmidt said.
	   The defense argued that the estimate is based on the assumption
that Nikitin had revealed a state secret.
	   ``He never doubted that. He used some strange method of
calculation, and he estimated that the information was worth
280,000 rubles,'' Schmidt said.
	   Investigators earlier estimated the alleged damage at 4.5
million rubles (dlrs 900,000 at the time the indictment was filed),
but that figure has not been mentioned at the trial, Schmidt said.
	   Nikitin is charged on the basis of Defense Ministry internal
decrees that have never been published and were shown to his
lawyers for the first time when the trial began.
	   The defense argues that under the Russian Constitution, criminal
charges cannot be filed on the basis of unpublished laws.
	   Nikitin faces seven counts of treason. Prosecutors have asked
that he be sent to prison for 12 to 20 years.

Argentine president lays wreath in Britain to start reconciliation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with new detail &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With a handshake symbolizing reconciliation and
the simple laying of a wreath, Britain and Argentina began
Wednesday to heal the wounds left by their 1982 war over the
still-disputed Falkland Islands.
	   Carlos Menem, the first Argentine president to visit Britain
officially since the war, placed the wreath of blue-and-white
flowers before a plaque at St. Paul's Cathedral listing the 255
British soldiers slain in the 74-day conflict.
	   He then clasped hands on the cathedral's steps with Prince
Andrew, the son of Queen Elizabeth II who flew combat missions as a
helicopter pilot during the war over the windswept south Atlantic
archipelago.
	   Menem's six-day visit has been billed by both governments as one
for reconciliation, not recriminations, with the focus on booming
trade and generally good relations with Argentine's democratically
elected government.
	   ``We can agree to disagree,'' Argentine Foreign Minister Guido
Di Tella said before the wreath-laying ceremony, referring to the
Falklands. ``This idea of agreeing to disagree is a very British
idea.''
	   The ceremony was intended to deflect from the dispute over the
Falklands, whose 2,200-strong population is of British descent.
	   Most of the 970 soldiers killed were Argentineans, many of them
young conscripts sent there by the then-military junta.
	   In the crypt of St. Paul's, the Rev. George Cassidy read from
the Book of Micah: ``They shall beat their swords into ploughshares
... nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall
they learn war any more.''
	   The 15-minute service was attended by both British and Argentine
veterans, and by those who lost relatives in the conflict.
	   Among those shaking hands with Menem was former Parachute
Regiment Pvt. Denzil Connick, who lost a leg when his position was
hit by rocket fire.
	   ``There was a time when it was beyond my wildest dreams to have
met the Argentine head of state, not so many years ago, and I may
not have wanted to,'' he said. ``But things change and you have to
change with it.''
	   In a letter to a British tabloid Friday, Menem had stopped short
of an apology, but said he deeply regretted the war and that it
``should never have happened.''
	   The Argentine president had lunch with the queen Wednesday, and
was scheduled to meet Thursday with Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   He kicked off his visit with a Wednesday breakfast with British
industry chiefs, telling them, ``The time has come for both nations
to leave behind us misunderstandings and mistrust that have
separated us for years.''
	   Most of the 200 people crowded outside St. Paul's seemed to have
done just that, with no protesters in sight.
	   ``The Falklands? It's a matter of history, isn't it?'' said
Peter Ingrams of London. ``You move on. I don't think that anyone
in Britain really cares anymore.''

Israeli politicians defy police ban, start building in east
</HEADLINE>
Jerusalem &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinian &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Striking a blow for Jewish settlers in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, three members of the Israeli
parliament struggled Wednesday to erect a fence around a
controversial construction site.
	   The hard-line members of parliament were also trying to drive a
stake in to the heart of the Wye River agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians, signed last week at the White House.
	   It wasn't easy.
	   Middle-aged and paunchy, the politicians wrestled with a
10-foot-high (3-meter-high) fence post and a simple, cylindrical
hand-operated pounding device. They succeeded in getting the post
far enough into the ground to stand on its own, but just barely.
	   Stopping every few blows to answer questions from reporters,
Michael Kleiner, head of the Land of Israel bloc in parliament and
leader of the movement to toppled Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government said the politicians were doing the work
because police banned settlers from putting up the fence.
	   ``It's a shame that we have to use our parliamentary immunity to
perform an act that is perfectly legal,'' he complained.
	   Irving Moskowitz, a Miami millionaire and backer of Jewish
settlers, bought the 4-acre (1.6-hectare) plot of land in the Arab
neighborhood of Ras Al Amud, just across from the Old City of
Jerusalem, several years ago.
	   His backers showed The Associated Press a building permit for
132 apartments on the site, but the Israeli government has held up
work, citing public safety concerns. Palestinians object to the
construction, calling it an illegal Jewish settlement.
	   There were no Palestinian demonstrators in sight as the Israeli
politicians tried to make their point with their hands instead of
their mouths.
	   Kleiner took off his tie, put on work gloves and started
pounding the fence post. He ran into rock the first two tries, but
managed to get the post to stand on his third attempt.
	   ``I built a fence at a settlement in the desert when I was 17,''
he said, ``but I was lot younger then.''
	   Though they denied that the construction was a provocation aimed
at scuttling implementation of the Wye accords, the politicians
repeated their objections to the accord over and over, whenever a
reporter asked a question.
	   Benny Elon of the far-right opposition Moledet Party, uncoiling
a roll of barbed wire, charged that Netanyahu has a secret
understanding with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to give the
Palestinians control of a wide swath of territory linking
Jerusalem's Old City with the West Bank.
	   The construction site is in the way. Elon said: ``It's essential
to stop the secret plan.''

Azerbaijan to review suggestions on oil pipeline next month
</HEADLINE>

postponement bodes well. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A decision on which pipeline route to use for
transporting the bulk of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil to the West
has been postponed until at least next month, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   Azerbaijani officials earlier said they expected to make a
decision in October. But President Geidar Aliev said Wednesday that
an international oil consortium would make its pipeline
recommendation to the government Nov. 12, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Aliev will make the final announcement on the route, but is
almost certain to take the consortium's recommendation.
	   Aliev favors a proposed pipeline through Georgia and Turkey.
Several U.S. oil companies have invested heavily in the project,
and the United States also favors the Georgia-Turkey route.
	   Richard Morningstar, U.S. envoy to Caspian energy development,
said Wednesday in Ankara that the postponement of the pipeline
decision was a good sign for the Georgia-Turkey route.
	   ``Negotiations have taken on a very serious tone over the past
few weeks. ... I see that as a very positive sign, that the reason
for that delay is because the negotiations are taking place.''
	   A smaller pipeline to the Black Sea port of Supsa in Georgia is
expected to start pumping oil in April.
	   Caspian oil reserves are believed to be the largest outside the
Middle East, but they remain relatively untapped because countries
with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive
projects off the ground.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Heavy storms across northern Europe
killed at least two people Wednesday and closed rail lines, blocked
roads and stranded farm animals in flooded fields.
	   Trees uprooted by wind struck cars in Germany and in the Czech
Republic, killing a truck driver in eastern Thuringia state and a
woman in a car in the Czech capital, Prague.
	   Rain in Germany was heaviest in northern Schleswig-Holstein
state, where police sent radio appeals to farmers to care for their
livestock. Animals were up to their necks in water.
	   The weight of the rain collapsed the roof of a supermarket in
the northern town of Itzehoe, causing 3 million to 4 million marks
(dlrs 1.8 million to 2.4 million) in damages. Roads in the town
were submerged under a meter (yard) of water.
	   Berlin has received more rain in the last 24 hours than is
normal for entire month of October. In Hamburg, the fire department
responded to some 200 calls to pump drains.
	   In central Germany, heavy rain and wind felled trees, disrupting
some power supplies.
	   Fallen trees blocked roads and a rail line connecting small
towns and cities in Thuringia state. The German Railway said train
connections were disrupted in several northern and eastern cities,
including Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg and Leipzig.
	   The rising Fulda and Sieg rivers in Hesse and North
Rhine-Westphalia states passed the high water marks, but officials
said there was no immediate flood danger along Germany's major
Rhine and Main rivers, despite the arrival of a new storm system
Wednesday.
	   Torrential rains and howling winds triggered hundreds of
kilometers (miles) of traffic jams in the Netherlands. People in
low-lying areas scrambled to fortify sodden dikes with sandbags,
and flooding was reported in the north and east.
	   The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute repeatedly has
cautioned motorists of the dangers of driving on wet pavement, rare
warnings in a soggy country prone to bad weather.
	   ``October is a pretty wet month, but this is extreme,'' said
institute spokesman Harry Geurts.

Rios returns to beat Haas; Ivanisevic, Krajicek also through
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Becker beating Moya &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker showed he can still work
up some magic when he beat French Open champion Carlos Moya 6-7
(4-7), 6-4, 6-4 in the second round of the Eurocard Open on
Wednesday.
	   The 30-year-old three-time Wimbledon champion may be in
semi-retirement but he remains a threat, especially on indoor
surfaces, which are not Moya's favorite environment.
	   Moya, ranked No. 4 in the world, dropped to 0-4 indoors this
year. Becker wasted three set points in the first set and then
committed a double-fault that helped the Spaniard win the
tiebreaker.
	   But Becker broke Moya's serve at the start of each of the next
two sets to show that he can still occasionally topple a Top 10
player.
	   Becker is playing only his 10th tournament of the year and is
coming off an ankle injury that had kept him sidelined for three
months.
	   Marcelo Rios reached the third round by defeating Tommy Haas,
against whom he had to retire last week because of a hamstring
injury.
	   Rios appeared fit and won 6-3, 7-5 to keep alive his hopes of
knocking down Pete Sampras from the No. 1 spot in the final season
rankings.
	   Sampras played against Nicolas Kiefer later in the day as all
top six players in the world went into action in the dlrs 2.45
million tournament.
	   Rios, who held the No. 1 ranking on two occasions for a total of
six weeks earlier this year, had to retire against Haas on Saturday
in the semifinals in Lyon, France, suffering from a hamstring
injury in his left leg.
	   The Chilean wasted one match point in the ninth game of the
second set and squandered two more before breaking Haas' serve to
win the match in 75 minutes. Rios had also broken the German's
serve to win the first set.
	   Rios leads the tour with seven titles this year and he could
take the No. 1 spot if Sampras loses in the second or third round
and the Chilean reaches the final.
	   Alex Corretja, the seventh-seeded Spaniard who beat Haas in the
Lyon final, was upset by Jan-Michael Gambill, losing 6-2, 6-4. The
American is ranked No. 50 in the world.
	   With so many top players in action, three former winners of the
tournament were relegated to play in a smaller neighborhood hall.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, overpowered Wayne Ferreira 6-4,
7-6 (8-6), and Richard Krajicek, a former Wimbledon champion,
ousted Magnus Norman 6-4, 6-1.
	   Petr Korda, the defending champion who is seeded fifth this
year, played later against Thomas Johansson.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, the 12th-seeded Swede, advanced by beating
Gianluca Pozzi, an Italian qualifier, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
	   Greg Rusedski, No. 13, squeezed past Jason Stoltenberg 7-6
(7-5), 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-4) after wasting five match points in the
second set, and 10th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov overcame Mark
Philippoussis, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).

With Yeltsin slipping, Primakov fills power vacuum in Russia
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officially, nothing has changed. But over the past
few weeks power in Russia has been steadily slipping out of Boris
Yeltsin's weakened grip and into the waiting hands of Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Nearly two months after his appointment as premier, Primakov _ a
former spymaster and diplomat widely admired in Russia _ finds
himself carrying out most of the country's top leadership duties.
Yeltsin, meanwhile, has been confined to a rest home, this time for
treatment of what is being described as exhaustion.
	   The 67-year-old Yeltsin, who has been a part-time president for
months, may well return to work, as he has after recovering from
previous illnesses. But his deputy chief of staff conceded in an
interview published Wednesday that Yeltsin is relinquishing his
authority over day-to-day affairs.
	   ``The president's main work will become revising the
constitution,'' Oleg Sysuyev told the newspaper Sevodnya. He added
that Yeltsin's most important task will be ``to turn over stable
power to his successor.''
	   Primakov, who turns 69 on Thursday, ``is now fully responsible
for the economy,'' Sysuyev said.
	   Primakov's de facto assent comes at a crucial time for Russia,
which is reeling from the effects of its deepest economic crisis in
years, if not decades.
	   But while Primakov is almost universally admired in Russia, some
people are beginning to wonder when Primakov is going to start
doing something.
	   The official ITAR-Tass news agency, summing up Primakov's
accomplishments so far, put it this way Wednesday: ``During a month
and a half of his work in the post of prime minister, Primakov
managed to inspire 150 million Russian citizens with hope that the
grave economic crisis ... can be overcome.''
	   That is no small accomplishment. But as Russians know all too
well, hope won't buy a bag of potatoes and inspiration can't be
cashed at the bank.
	   ``In several months,'' ITAR-Tass continued, ``the Primakov
government will have to explain to the people why inflation is
going on, why the living standards continue to decline, why
production is at a standstill and why the relations between Russian
regions are worsening.''
	   Primakov has taken some measures, of course. He has paid back
some wage and pension arrears. He has restored some measure of
political calm to the country. He has helped bring at least
temporary stability to the ruble, now worth one-third of what it
was in August.
	   He has even promised to restore Russia's national soccer team to
glory.
	   Confidence in his government, as measured by public opinion
polls, is surprisingly strong in a nation of skeptics _ 37 percent
in one recent survey. And there are rumblings of talk about
Primakov as a potential presidential candidate. He has dismissed
such speculation as ``rubbish.''
	   So far, though, Primakov has yet to announce a coherent plan for
tackling the country's economic crisis.
	   ``I don't see any real practical results of his government's
performance,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a political analyst for the
conservative Heritage Foundation. ``Well, maybe the only result is
that the situation isn't radically deteriorating, causing a
catastrophe. But this is mostly a result of him doing nothing.''
	   Primakov, whose career was launched as a newspaper correspondent
in the Middle East, vaulted to world attention in 1990-91 as the
special envoy of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Primakov
tried, but was unable, to broker a deal with Iraq to avert the Gulf
War.
	   Later, as Yeltsin's spy chief and foreign minister, he developed
Russia's ``multipolar'' view of the world, which sees its mission
as fending off the United States' drive to be the world's only
superpower.
	   Robert Legvold, a professor of political science at Columbia
University who specializes in Russian affairs, has known Primakov
personally since the early 1970s. He sees his slow start as prime
minister as the legacy of a scholar and diplomat who is used to
deliberation and compromise.
	   ``He really does like to think things through,'' Legvold said.
He dismisses critics who believe Primakov is a Soviet holdover who
will jerk the country back into communism.
	   But given Primakov's penchant for consensus, he worries about
what sort of economic plan will come from a Cabinet whose members
span a good bit of Russia's political spectrum.
	   ``In a phrase, the threat is not turning the clock back,'' he
said. ``The threat is, as the Russians say, `kasha''' _ porridge.
In other words, Legvold said, ``a muddled mess.''

CDC investigating post-storm pink-eye outbreak in Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NORBERTO SANTANA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The U.S. Centers
for Disease Control is investigating an outbreak of conjunctivitis,
or ``pink eye,'' in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Georges
passed through.
	   Some 1,051 cases of the virus have been reported in St. Croix,
population 55,000, and 50 more in St. Thomas, population 50,000,
said Dr. Paul Arguin of the CDC.
	   Dozens of viruses can cause the highly contagious infection,
whose symptoms include tearing, itchiness and swelling of the eyes.
Its spread can be checked by washing hands and not sharing items
such as towels.
	   The St. Croix outbreak may be related to residents taking refuge
in public shelters during Hurricane Georges on Sept. 21 and the
temporary loss of water and power, which could have made washing
difficult, Arguin said Tuesday.
	   CDC officials discounted initial concerns that the outbreak was
linked to the spread of dust from several chemical plants on St.
Croix during the hurricane, he said.
	   While conjunctivitis outbreaks aren't unusual in the tropics,
``there have been reports of pink eye spreading throughout the
Caribbean,'' Arguin said.
	   The infection got a lot of attention this month during local
Senate debate on the fiscal 1999 budget when Sen. Judy Gomez
entered the chamber and declared she was ready to work ``despite
contracting the highly contagious pink eye.''
	   For most of a day, senators argued over exactly how contagious
pink eye is before agreeing to allow Gomez to monitor the budget
debate from her office and enter the Senate chambers only to cast
votes.

Oil paintings to doodles: legacy of an affair with Picasso

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Who needs a canvas? Matchbox covers, torn pieces of
tablecloth and the top of a shoebox, all with the unmistakable
imprint of Pablo Picasso, fetched prices better suited to major oil
paintings on Wednesday.
	   On the second day of a three-day auction featuring the legacy of
Picasso muse Dora Maar, it was the sentimental items that took hold
of the public's imagination.
	   One of the most dramatic purchases: 1.1 million francs (dlrs
198,915) for a set of five torn-off matchbox covers, almost 30
times the official estimate. One of the miniature sketches is of
Dora Maar with her hair in a bun; another is a colored still-life
with an oval guitar.
	   And a bird, sculpted by Picasso out of wood and plaster, brought
2.1 million francs (dlrs 379,747).
	   A postcard dressed to Maar with a fanciful animal drawing,
accompanied by three other small sketches, went for 650,000 francs
(dlrs 117, 541.) The top of a shoebox was a good substitute for a
canvas, too _ the pencil sketch on it went for 85,000 francs (dlrs
15,371), eight times its estimate.
	   Buyers were clearly fascinated by the bittersweet story of Maar
and Picasso, who spent eight tumultuous years together before he
left her _ as was his pattern _ for another, younger woman.
	   Though she fell into a depression when they parted, Maar saved
the objects until her death at age 89 in 1997, even though she
spent her final years in poverty and illness.
	   Her friends say Maar wouldn't be happy with the sale.
	   ``Dora wanted her things to go to the church,'' said John
Richardson, a collector and friend. ``But she left only a 1958 will
that named only monks, now dead. How silly.''
	   Another close friend, James Lord, said Maar ``would be just
horrified at all this.''
	   ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' he said. ``It's
rather morbid to have it up for sale.''
	   Picasso's granddaughter, Diana Widmaier, agreed.
	   ``Some of these private things should never have gone on the
market,'' she said.
	   Whatever Maar's wishes, the auction, expected to bring it up to
dlrs 70 million, has given art lovers a rare chance to examine the
minutiae of an affair _ from the goofy postcards to the tiny
drawings on matchbooks to a doodle on a restaurant menu.
	   Though Maar appeared to have no heirs, genealogists tracked down
two distant relatives, both of whom had never even heard of Maar.
Now, after the government takes 60 percent of the proceeds for
taxes, those relatives will get much of the remaining 40 percent.
	   The first evening, focusing on oil paintings and drawings, saw
sky-high prices for drawings but lower than expected prices for
some of the paintings.
	   The highest price, 37 million francs (dlrs 6,642,729) went for
the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for Guernica)'' _ in which
Dora's eyes are turned into tears pierced with long pins.
	   Yet the favorite of many, ``Dora Maar with Green Nails,''
fetched a disappointing 23 million francs (dlrs 4,129,264.) The
1936 tableau shows the muse at the height of her style, her chin
resting on green-painted nails and hair braided on top of her head.
	   The evening's big success was the drawings, especially ``Dora
with Undone Hair,'' which went for 5 million francs (dlrs 897,666).

Report suggests Western Sahara referendum could be held next
</HEADLINE>
December &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief submitted proposals
Wednesday to speed up identifying tribal voters in disputed Western
Sahara so a referendum on the territory's political status could be
held next year.
	   For the first time, Secretary-General Kofi Annan also suggested
a possible new date for the referendum: December 1999, a year later
than the original Dec. 7, 1998 target date.
	   The Western Sahara is a disputed area of North Africa claimed
both by Morocco and the rebels of the Polisario Front, which is
seeking independence for the area's indigenous people. The two
sides have agreed to hold a referendum on the territory's future,
and voters will choose between independence for the region and
integration with Morocco.
	   The territory would increase the size of Morocco by more than 50
percent.
	   A U.N. force has been trying to identify voters because of
disagreements about who is eligible to cast ballots. Each side has
accused the other of trying to pad voter rolls and both have failed
to resolve differences over identifying voters among three Saharan
tribes.
	   Annan said in a report to the Security Council that he had
decided to make his own arbitration on how to break the deadlock
over the voting rights of the three tribes.
	   He said he saw no alternative but to ask that the commission
identifying voters consider requests from any individual applicant
from the tribes to verify whether that person has the right to
vote.
	   Western Sahara was abandoned by Spain, its former colonial
ruler, in 1976. The following year, Morocco occupied two-thirds of
the territory, claiming historical links.
	   According to the agreement for a referendum, people whose names
were on the 1974 Spanish census can take part in the referendum
along with members of factions or sub-factions of tribes who lived
in the Spanish Sahara at the time but were not counted.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The former security minister of Georgia, who
resigned earlier this week, has been appointed deputy secretary of
the National Security Council in the former Soviet republic,
ITAR-Tass said Wednesday.
	   Dzhemal Gakhokidze resigned from the Cabinet on Monday, a week
after mutinous soldiers staged a one-day revolt against President
Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   The mutiny was led by supporters of late President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia's widow was injured Wednesday when about
300 of his supporters tried to hold a demonstration marking the
eighth anniversary of his election. Several people were arrested.
	   Gakhokidze said he resigned because financial shortages made it
impossible to carry out key reforms in the country's security
system, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Shevardnadze nominated the head of his bodyguard service,
Vakhtang Kutateladze, as new security minister, Interfax said.
	   Under Gakhokidze's leadership, the security ministry failed to
head off a number of violent incidents, including a rocket attack
on Shevardnadze, the hostage-taking of four U.N. observers, and the
Oct. 19 revolt.
	   Thirty-one people have been arrested in connection with the
revolt, although the leader, Akakiy Eliava, remains at large.
	   Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when
it gained independence in 1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought
a short war in a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994.

Guinea-Bissau rebels stay away from peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau rebel leaders refused to
fly to nearby Gambia for peace talks Wednesday, in the latest
setback to diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in the west
African nation.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said he was willing to meet rebel
leader Brig. Ansumane Mane in the Gambian capital Banjul, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) north of Guinea-Bissau and encircled by
Senegal.
	   But the rebels said they were concerned about their safety
flying over neighboring Senegal, which has provided troops to
support Vieira, a rebel spokesman told the Portuguese news agency
Lusa.
	   ``It would be a great risk to cross Senegal's air space,''
Zamora Induta said.
	   The Banjul talks were the latest effort by diplomats from
Portugal, France and Sweden to mediate an end to the five-month
conflict in the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``It's clear that the meeting won't take place in the next
hours. This will heighten the already tense atmosphere,'' Francisco
Henriques da Silva, Portugal's ambassador in Bissau, told Lisbon
radio TSF.
	   A cease-fire had been in place since July 26.
	   Fighting restarted 10 days ago, when the rebels advanced on the
center of Bissau. Troops loyal to Vieira secured the capital, while
the rebels overran strategic inland towns.
	   The surge in fighting deepened the plight of some 500,000
displaced people in this country of 1 million.
	   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday urged both sides to commit
themselves to a peaceful solution to ``end these long sufferings.''
	   Senegalese troops and bureaucratic procedures reportedly have
prevented food and medicine from reaching the displaced.

Yeltsin gives day-to-day duties to prime minister, aide says

sanitarium at the end of the week for vacation. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will serve out the last
two years of his term, but has turned over day-to-day affairs to
his prime minister, a top aide was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday, where he has been taking walks, receiving treatment and
resting to recover from fatigue, his spokesman said.
	   He is expected to stay at the secluded Barvikha sanitarium until
the end of the week, and will then go on vacation for an
unspecified period of time, spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
Yakushkin did not say where he would spend his time off or
elaborate on his condition.
	   Yeltsin has stayed at Barvikha several times before when he was
ill, often for weeks at a stretch.
	   A team of doctors has been watching over Yeltsin, but they did
not meet Wednesday to discuss their patient, Yakushkin said. The
sanitarium has extensive medical facilities, but is not a hospital.
	   Yeltsin was ``undergoing treatment which is standard at any
sanitarium. Everything is going according to plan,'' Yakushkin told
Russian news agencies.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been seldom seen since the country was rocked
by an economic crisis in August, and it has become increasingly
clear that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is handling day-to-day
decisions.
	   Primakov's ``government is now fully responsible for the
economy,'' Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Segodnya.
	   ``That doesn't mean, however, that the president can't demand
that the government account for its actions in his same stern
manner,'' Sysuyev added.
	   Yeltsin could be expected to focus on constitutional reform when
he recovers from his latest illness, the aide added.
	   ``The most important task for the president is to turn over
stable power to his successor,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Russians overwhelmingly disapprove of Yeltsin's
performance as president, a poll showed.
	   Only 5 percent approve of his work and 93 percent disapprove,
according to a poll by the All-Russian Public Opinion Research
Center. The poll is in line with several other recent surveys on
Yeltsin's performance.
	   Primakov received the highest favorable rating of any Russian
politician, at 50 percent, up from 47 percent last month. The poll
results, reported by the Interfax news agency, gave no margin of
error.
	   Yeltsin has been working only part-time at the Kremlin in recent
months. He had little appetite for mundane tasks of government even
when he was healthy, and has always delegated many chores to his
staff.
	   Doctors say he must rest to recover from exhaustion and high
blood pressure, but no additional details about his condition have
been released.
	   The president has fallen ill about a half-dozen times since his
re-election in 1996, and had heart bypass surgery two years ago.
	   Yeltsin has insisted he will serve out his term, which runs
until the year 2000. But critics have been demanding his
resignation, and few Russians believe he will again show the vigor
that he had during his early years in office.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ India rode on Sachin Tendulkar's
electrifying performance to defeat Australia by 44 and enter the
Wills International Cup semifinals in the Bangabandhu national
stadium Wednesday.
	   Man of the Match Sachin Tendulkar showed great all round form to
steer India to victory in front of a cheering crowd. After a
whirlwind 141 off 125 balls, he finished with four wickets for 38
runs, the highest wicket-taker in the Indian team.
	   Australia, chasing India's score of 307, made a decent start
with Mark Waugh and Adam Gilchrist matching the asking rate of more
than six an over. But both batsmen fell to bad strokes. The
Australian batsmen showed little discipline, paving the way for an
Indian victory.
	   The Indian bowling maintained a good line and length and with a
big Indian total behind them, skipper Azharuddin could experiment
with his attack.
	   But the Indian side had to pay 15 percent of their winnings as
penalty for failing to bowl the 50 overs in the stipulated time.
	   Earlier in the day, Tendulkar's quickfire 141 was the
centerpiece of the Indian innings that had a horrible start with
the loss of two quick wickets of opener Saurav Ganguly for one and
skipper Mohammad Azharuddin for no score when the board read just
eight.
	   But India recovered swiftly with Tendulkar's two super
partnerships with Rahul Dravid (140) and Ajay Jadeja (132). The
three helped India put up a score that left Australia chasing a
score of more than six an over.
	   For Australia, Michael Kasprowicz was the most successful bowler
claiming three wickets for 71 runs.
	   But the two early wickets turned out to be the last success for
the Australians for a long time as Tendulkar and Dravid took the
Aussie challenge and scored freely on the newly laid Bangabandhu
national stadium wicket.
	   Tendulkar raced to his 50 in 46 balls with 10 boundaries and
then cracked his 100 off 94 deliveries.
	   The Australians managed to stem the runs, but only at the end of
the Indian innings when they got four wickets within a short span
of time.
	   India will now play the winners of Thursday's semifinal match
between West Indies and Pakistan.

Foreign Minister: Miss Croatia dispute caused political damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The controversy surrounding this year's
Miss Croatia beauty contest has brought political damage to the
young state, Foreign Minister Mate Granic said Wednesday.
	   Granic was the first government official to speak out on the
event, which turned into a national scandal after the elected Miss
Croatia, Muslim Lejla Sehovic, was dethroned and later replaced by
a non-Muslim.
	   Some media and human rights organizations, and Sehovic herself
claimed the move happend because Sehovic is a Muslim.
	   Although the pageant organizer, Milan Seckovic, denied any
political implications and claimed Sehovic's title was revoked due
to irregular voting.
	   The vast majority of Croatia's 4.7 million people are Roman
Catholics. Muslims make a small minority.
	   ``Events surrounding the Miss Croatia contest have done a huge
political damage to Croatia,'' Granic said, denying that the
government had anything to do with the contest.
	   ``The contest organizer bear the immediate responsibility,'' he
said.
	   Some media reports suggested that nationalists within the
government initiated Sehovic's removal, because they couldn't stand
to have a Muslim representing Croatia.
	   Relations between Croatia and neighboring Bosnia have been
strained since the Croatia helped the Bosnian Croats during their
1993-94 war with the Muslims.
	   Sehovic was stripped of her title last Sunday, and previous
runner-up, Ivana Petkovic, was awarded the crown in a new round of
voting.
	   Afterwards, the organizers nevertheless suggested that Sehovic
should go to the Miss World contest this year, while Petkovic would
attend the next year's.
	   Sehovic accepted the offer.

U.N. envoy meets top official of Myanmar junta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new U.N. report; edits to conform; trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A U.N. envoy met Wednesday with a top
member of the country's ruling junta, one day after meeting the
government's most outspoken critic, opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi.
	   The meeting between Alvaro de Soto, a special representative of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and a top military leader, Lt.
Gen. Khin Nyunt, took place a few hours before the release of a new
U.N. report sharply critical of government repression.
	   De Soto, on his fifth visit as a U.N. envoy since 1995, arrived
Tuesday in Yangonto discuss political and human rights issues.
	   The report, whose release was unrelated to de Soto's visit,
expressed deep concern about the continued harassment of political
leaders and the detention of political prisoners in Myanmar.
	   Serious human rights violations continue to be committed by
Myanmar's armed forces in the ethnic minority areas, including
extrajudicial and arbitrary executions _ not sparing women and
children _ rape, torture, inhuman treatment, forced labor and
denial of freedom of movement, the report said.
	   ``These violations have been so numerous and consistent over the
past years as to suggest that they are not simply isolated or the
acts of individual misbehavior by middle-and- lower rank officers
but are rather the result of policy at the highest level, entailing
political and legal responsibility.''
	   The report was one of a series of country-by-country human
rights reports by special rapporteurs presented the General
Assembly this year.
	   No response was immediately available from the Myanmar
government.
	   Diplomats said de Soto was seeking to persuade the government
and the opposition to open talks to ease political tensions.
	   Details of his talks have not been made public.
	   De Soto, an assistant secretary-general, last visited Myanmar in
January in a failed effort to facilitate a dialogue between the
junta and Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy.
	   De Soto met Suu Kyi during his January visit, as well as the
ruling junta's chairman, Gen. Than Shwe, and other government
leaders.
	   Relations between the government and the opposition have
deteriorated sharply since then, with the military increasing its
repression of the pro-democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party
increasing its challenges to the government's legitimacy.
	   In the past few months, almost 1,000 members of Suu Kyi's party
have been detained in an effort to block its activities. Several
dozen have reportedly been released in the past few weeks.
	   De Soto, on his fifth visit as a U.N. envoy since 1995, met
Wednesday with the influential secretary-one of the junta, Lt. Gen.
Khin Nyunt, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   De Soto was expected to meet with Suu Kyi again Thursday to
convey the gist of his talks with Khin Nyunt, they said.
	   In August, Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ rejected
Secretary-General Annan's candidate to look into the military
regime's treatment of Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace
Prize.
	   Annan had asked that Razali Ismail of Malaysia, former president
of the General Assembly, be allowed to make a quick trip after the
Myanmar government had repeatedly blocked Suu Kyi's attempts to
travel outside the capital to meet with members of her political
party.
	   Myanmar said then there was no need for such a rushed trip.
	   The junta seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing
pro-democracy demonstrations. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide
victory in 1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused
to yield power.
	   Western nations, including the United States, and private groups
such as Amnesty International say the junta is responsible for
substantial human rights abuses. The U.N. Human Rights Commission
also has reported abuses and sought to encourage governmental
reforms in Myanmar.

UEFA OKs Belgrade for Partizan match against Lazio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Next week's European Cup Winners Cup
second-round match between Partizan Belgrade and Lazio of Rome can
go ahead in Belgrade, UEFA said Wednesday.
	   Citing security concerns, the European governing body earlier
this month moved a UEFA Cup match between Red Star Belgrade and
Lyon of France to Bucharest.
	   The move was prompted by the threat of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia unless it complies with international demands over
Kosovo. UEFA deferred a decision on the second-leg Partizan match.
	   The latest decision was taken ``due to the fact that the
political situation has improved to the extent that the
above-mentioned match can now be staged in Belgrade as originally
scheduled,'' UEFA said in a statement.
	   With Yugoslav forces withdrawing from Kosovo, NATO has not set
any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one expired
Tuesday.
	   Partizan and Lazio go into next Thursday's second-leg match tied
0-0 after last week's first leg in Rome.
	   In Belgrade, Branko Bulatovic of the Yugoslav Soccer Association
welcomed the UEFA decision.
	   ``It's a realistic, just decision, in true spirit of
sportsmanship,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency quoted Bulatovic
as saying. ``UEFA has contacted several Western embassies in
Belgrade and received favorable reports regarding the security
situation in our country.''
	   A Euro 2000 qualifier between Yugoslavia and Ireland, postponed
because of the threat of air raids, has been rescheduled for Nov.
18. But UEFA said it will decide on the venue next week.
	   A decision will also be taken then on the venue for a qualifier
between Albania and Greece, rescheduled for the same date after
being postponed because of political turmoil in Albania.

First Kosovo refugees housed at Swiss military barracks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRONSCHHOFEN, Switzerland (AP) _ An army barracks pressed into
service to relieve overcrowded reception centers opened its doors
Wednesday to a first group of Kosovo refugees.
	   Some 50 refugees, all of them families with children, arrived at
Bronschhofen in eastern Switzerland, where they are expected to
stay for two to three weeks. Police officers and private security
guards were on site.
	   Security at Bronschhofen and two similar centers set aside to
receive people fleeing violence in Serbia's Kosovo province was
stepped up after a device exploded there earlier this month.
	   The barracks will ease the pressure at a center in nearby
Kreuzlingen, said Roger Schneeberger, spokesman for the Federal
Office for Refugees. It is expected to be used until March.
	   The Kreuzlingen center, near the German border, has been so
crowded in recent weeks that people were reportedly sleeping in the
kitchen and in corridors.
	   Local opposition to the housing of refugees in Bronschhofen has
died down, Schneeberger said.
	   As well as using empty barracks for accommodation, the Swiss
government last week authorized the use of soldiers to help house
and feed an increasing flood of refugees from Kosovo.
	   An estimated 5,000 Kosovo Albanians are expected to arrive in
Switzerland this month, pushing the number of asylum seekers to an
all-time high by the end of the year.
	   Hundreds of refugees have been forced to fend for themselves,
embarrassing a country which prides itself for its humanitarian
traditions.
	   The Swiss fear that unless other European countries relax their
controls, it will face an even bigger influx.
	   Switzerland is home to a large population of ethnic Albanians
and so has acted as a magnet to people fleeing the fighting in
Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians accounted for a large chunk of the 26,000
requests for asylum _ 57 percent more than in 1997 _ in the first
nine months of the year.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ More than a month after elections
ended the rule of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, leaders of a
four-party coalition announced Wednesday they had agreed on
formation of a new government.
	   Party leaders signed the pact in the evening after agreeing on
the distribution of Cabinet posts.
	   In balloting last month, the coalition won 93 of the 150 seats
in the Slovak parliament. Meciar's government will resign Thursday,
when the new parliament convenes for the first time.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, the leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
is expected to succeed Meciar as prime minister.
	   Dzurinda said after signing ceremony in the Bratislava mayor's
residence that the first session of the new parliament would be
held Thursday when he hopes the new government will be officially
installed.
	   Parliament is expected to elect Jozef Migas, the chairman of the
Democratic Left party, to become chairman of parliament. Migas then
will formally ask Dzurinda to form the new government.
	   No names were officially announced on Wednesday, but Eduard
Kukan, who briefly was foreign minister in 1994 and also served as
ambassador to the United States, is expected to be the new foreign
minister.
	   Ladislav Pittner, another prominent member of Dzurinda's Slovak
Democratic Coalition, is expected to become interior minister.
	   In all, the Democratic Coalition party will receive eight other
posts. The second largest member of the coalition, the Democratic
Left, will get six ministries.
	   Three will go to the Hungarian Coalition party, which represents
the country's ethnic Hungarian minority. The smallest member, the
Party of Civic Understanding, ended up with two posts.
	   The coalition parties also agreed to support the chairman of the
Civic Understanding party, Rudolf Schuster, for Slovakia's mostly
figurehead president.
	   Schuster, mayor of Slovakia's second largest city Kosice and a
former ambassador to Canada, was one of two candidates nominated
for the presidency to fill a position vacant since March, when
Michal Kovac's term expired.
	   Kovac is the second presidential candidate.
	   The negotiations lasted until the early hours Wednesday, after
two exhausting days of discussions. The turning point came when the
Hungarians gave up their demand for the agriculture ministry, which
went to the Party of the Democratic Left.
	   The biggest stumbling block had been the initial refusal by the
Party of the Democratic Left to participate in a government with
the Hungarian Coalition party. This was resolved at the party's
congress last Saturday.
	   Meciar had ruled with near-autocratic power since 1993, and
there had been widespread speculation he would refuse to step down,
even if he lost the election.

Vienna          08      46      15 AP) _ England's Euro 2000 qualifying games
against Sweden and Luxembourg next summer may still be staged at
Wembley even with the bulldozers and demolition workers standing by
to knock the famous stadium down.
	   Wembley is being rebuilt as part of England's bid to stage the
2006 World Cup and it was thought the final game before demolition
would be the FA Cup final May 22 or an exhibition match for the
national team a few days afterwards.
	   Although a final decision has not yet been taken, the FA says
that the Euro 2000 games against Sweden June 5 and Luxembourg Sept.
4 could still be staged at the 78,000-capacity home of English
soccer instead of Manchester United's 55,000-seater Old Trafford.
	   The reasoning behind that is that much preparation work has to
be carried out between May and September before demolition actually
begins and the stadium will still be in a state to stage matches.
	   The new stadium, being built at a cost of 320 million pounds
(dlrs 534.4 million), is due to reopen in the year 2002.

At least 8 killed in Maoist violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ At least eight people were killed in
clashes between police and Maoist rebels over the last two days,
the government said Wednesday.
	   Among the dead were two policemen, one civilian and five leftist
guerrillas belonging to the Nepal Communist Party-Maoist group,
police said. The rebels have been waging a two-and-a-half year
guerrilla war to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy and to
establish a republic.
	   One policeman was killed when the rebels attacked a police
station in Phalate village Tuesday night and stole five guns and
some ammunition, said Home Ministry spokesman Gopendra Pandey.
Phalate is 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the Nepalese capital,
Katmandu.
	   Another policeman was killed by rebels in Tshisti village 200
kilometers (120 miles) west of Katmandu on Tuesday and one civilian
was killed outside the capital the same night.
	   In other parts of Nepal, five rebels were killed in clashes with
police when they tried to rob banks or steal jewelry and cash from
homes.
	   Police said security has been beefed up in the capital Katmandu
to prevent Maoist attacks. So far the rebels have kept away from
the capital.
	   Since the insurgency began, more than 350 people have been
killed, including 24 policemen.

NHL to let Penguins operate franchise during bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
proceedings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The North American National Hockey League has
reasserted its right to seize the Pittsburgh Penguins' franchise
now that the team has filed for bankruptcy, but the league will
continue to let it operate as it is.
	   The Penguins argued in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh on
Tuesday that federal law prohibits the automatic termination of a
contract, such as a franchise, during a bankruptcy.
	   However, NHL lawyer Jeffrey Levitan said the league does have
the right to take back the franchise, even if it does not plan to
do so at this time.
	   In order to preserve its legal right to seize the franchise, the
NHL gave the Penguins a 20-day notice of ending their franchise
agreement. The league earlier served a 10-day notice, but did not
act.
	   NHL spokesman Frank Brown said the league wants the Penguins'
bankruptcy situation resolved as soon as possible.
	   ``Every element of patience has limits, but we are totally
devoted to the notion, to the fact, that Pittsburgh is an
exceptional hockey community and the home of passionate fans who
love the Penguins,'' Brown said. ``We want them to have their
Penguins.''
	   The Penguins' co-owners, Howard Baldwin and Roger Marino, have
said the team has lost dlrs 37.5 million over the last two years.
It is estimated the team may be as much as dlrs 100 million in
debt, including money owed to investors _ or more than the
franchise is worth.
	   City Council president Jim Ferlo wants the Penguins evicted from
the Civic Arena until they pay their overdue tax bill.
	   Because the Penguins owed the city nearly dlrs 1 million in back
taxes before filing for federal bankruptcy protection, Ferlo wants
the team barred from playing in the Civic Arena.
	   Mayor Tom Murphy's administration said Ferlo's idea makes no
sense because it would cost the city more lost revenue and would
unnecessarily penalize arena workers who rely on income from
Penguins games.

Thirty injured in Strasbourg tram accident

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ Thirty people were injured Wednesday
when two trams going in the same direction collided in a tunnel in
this eastern city, police said.
	   All the casualties were in a stable condition, most of them
suffering from broken bones and bruises, police said.
	   The accident occurred shortly before midday when a tram came to
a halt in a tunnel leading to the city's train station, apparently
due to an engine failure. The tram was hit from behind shortly
after by another tram.
	   Police said there had apparently been a breakdown in
communication on the network.
	   Many of the injured were hospitalized, although some were
treated at the site of the accident.
	   It was the first tram accident in Strasbourg, where the European
Parliament is based, since the network was introduced in 1994.

Uzbekistan reports 4.4 percent GDP growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ The Central Asian nation of
Uzbekistan has reported a 4.4 percent increase in gross domestic
product for the first nine months of this year, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The former Soviet republic's GDP was 226 billion su (dlrs 2.1
billion) from January to September, up from 216 billion su (dlrs 2
billion) for the same period last year, Prime Minister Urtkir
Sultanov told a Cabinet session Tuesday.
	   Private production made up 65 percent of the total.
	   The Cabinet said industrial output was up 6.1 percent,
agricultural output grew 4.9 percent and retail trade was up 13.1
percent.
	   Privatization, exports and the development of a securities
market lagged, however, Sultanov said. He said the budget deficit
had not exceeded expectations but gave no figures.
	   The country's key cotton harvest is not as strong as usual,
which may bring the year's overall GDP down, he said.

	    &UR; Hurricane Mitch roars off Honduran coast
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mitch stationary at 1800 GMT. At 1800 GMT, Mitch
was centered near latitude 16.4 north, longitude 85.6 west.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Spreading fear across the western
Caribbean Wednesday, one of the century's most powerful hurricanes
forced tens of thousands to flee, dumped torrents of rain, mowed
down trees and damaged homes. At least 14 people were reported
killed.
	   Hurricane Mitch hovered 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast of
Honduras Wednesday, its downpours causing rivers to flood across
Honduras, Belize and elsewhere in Central America and Mexico.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said up to 25 inches
(64 cms) of rain could fall on mountain areas.
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph (305 km) winds. By 1800 GMT
Wednesday, the 350-mile (600 km) wide storm still packed a punch,
but its winds were down to 120 mph (205 kph), with higher gusts.
	   More than 45,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
low-lying areas of Honduras, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel,
chief of the National Emergency Committee. Many towns were cut off
by some 50 flooded rivers.
	   One of them was La Ceiba, a city of 40,000, whose two highways
out both were cut. To the east, the pillars of the Saopin bridge
were weakened by a swollen river and the bridge sagged into the
water. To the west, the Pico Bonito bridge was entirely washed
away.
	   Electricity was out in the entire town, and the sea moved a
half-block into town in some places. Fireman Tomas Hayden said
officials had banned private cars to ease emergency rescue work.
	   Waves crashed against the walls of seafront discos and people
waded through knee-deep water with furniture on their backs to flee
flooded houses.
	   In the Barrio Ingles shantytown, the ground was entirely covered
in white foam from the surf, making it look like it had snowed.
	   Twelve-year-old Dalixa Reyes wandered through the foam in the
lashing rain, looking for her parents and brothers and sisters. She
lives with other relatives a few blocks away.
	   ``I'm worried about my family, my friends, about the people who
live here,'' she said.
	   She found them, standing on a flooded sidewalk gazing at the
destruction in awe.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts like Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on pumping
oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In Belize, most of the 75,000 people in Belize City fled inland
in cars and government buses. With gasoline stations running dry,
the government of neighboring Belize commandeered private buses to
help people move inland from coastal Belize City, which was almost
destroyed by Hurricane Hattie in 1961.
	   Port officials at Chetumal, Mexico, said a wave kicked up by
Hurricane Mitch washed a Connecticut man off a catamaran south of
Cancun on Monday and he was presumed dead. He was identified as
Robert Gates, 55, of Niantic.
	   Honduras reported five deaths _ one in a collapsed house, two
men electrocuted when they were blown off a roof, one man drowned
in a swollen river and another killed as he crossed a bridge on his
bicycle; the river tore away the bridge with him on it.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains.
	   Mitch was blasting the Bay Island of Guanaja, 75 miles (125 kms)
northeast of here, ripping the metal roofing off hundreds of houses
and knocking out power and telephones. Many residents took shelter
on larger nearby islands.
	   ``It's raining hard and the winds are very strong,'' said Marta
Ondina, a worker at the Hong Kong restaurant on Roatan, an island a
few miles (kilometers) west of Guanaja.
	   ``They have taken people from the shore to churches and more
secure places,'' she said by telephone. ``The people are very
worried. There is no power.''
	   Tina Haylock, a Guanaja resident visiting Tegucigalpa, told
Canal 5 television that she had talked to her family early
Wednesday and they told her 14 people had died on the island. The
report couldn't be confirmed.
	   She said most of the houses in the town of Sandy Bay were
destroyed, and that everyone had taken refuge in a shelter.
	   Mitch appeared nearly stalled Wednesday over Guanaja, moving
very slowing toward Honduras' coast. The hurricane center said it
was expected to head northwest on Thursday, but the storm's slow
pace made its movements unpredictable.
	   Early Tuesday, Mitch passed directly over Honduras' tiny Swan
Islands, used in the 1960s as a base for CIA radio broadcasts to
Cuba. The military base lost its roof but the five soldiers posted
there were unhurt because they hid in nearby caves.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   In the Mexican resort of Cancun, 375 miles (640 kms) north of
here, American and other tourists formed long lines at the airport
trying to leave before the storm's arrival.
	   But as Mitch veered south, Cancun Mayor Rafael Lara Lara
canceled the city's emergency alert. State officials earlier had
evacuated several thousand people from coastal zones farther south,
near the Belize border.

 &UR; Albanians unhappy with NATO decision, still don't trust Serbs
 &UR; Eds: AMs: UPDATES with comment from U.S. envoy; ADDS details of
funeral of KLA member
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two things tell ethnic Albanians
that some change has come from international pressure on their
Serbian enemies _ uniformed guerrilla fighters moved openly in
several areas Wednesday and the dreaded police checkpoints had
virtually disappeared.
	   But that's not enough to convince most to return to their homes
or trust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and NATO's decision
to lift its deadline for Milosevic to comply or possibly face
airstrikes only bolstered their misgivings.
	   ``NATO, it isn't doing the job,'' red-eyed Albert Pacarizi, 24,
said at the funeral of his 18-year-old cousin, Ali Pacarizi, a
guerrilla killed Tuesday by a landmine left by Serb police. ``They
don't attack, they just give a news conference.''
	   Scores of armed guerrillas in green camouflage uniforms with the
red and yellow badge of their Kosovo Liberation Army marched in
formation at the funeral. That was unthinkable three days earlier,
when Serb police manned a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje and
shooting between the sides erupted nightly.
	   The police withdrew on Monday as part of a broad drawdown of
Serb and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo under the Oct. 12 agreement
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on ending the
Kosovo conflict.
	   Under the deal, Milosevic must cut the number of troops and
police in Kosovo to the levels of last February, when he began his
crackdown on the separatist KLA. Hundreds have died in the fighting
and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced from their homes.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO refrained from setting a
new deadline after its last one expired Tuesday night. It kept more
than 400 warplanes on alert, and the U.S. Navy announced Wednesday
that American P-3C Orion surveillance planes will begin regular
flights over Kosovo on Sunday.
	   The planes can fly up to 12 hours without refueling and will
help monitor the situation day and night regardless of the weather.
	   By warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police have retreated completely.
	   But such a threat was insufficient for Albanian politicians
hoping the alliance would strike the Yugoslav war machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' said Muhamet Hamiti of the League
of Democratic Kosovo.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said the
withdrawal of Serb forces was incomplete but so far represented a
``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling the demands.''
	   Also Wednesday, a senior U.S. humanitarian aid official said he
believed international actions had prevented thousands of refugees
from dying this winter because the agreement enabled organizations
to rush in clothing, food and other supplies.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
said Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development. ``I think we will see no deaths due to
isolation or lack of food.''
	   A U.N. refugee agency spokesman said people were returning home
in many areas, and he expected the numbers to increase.
	   ``People can't wait to return because it is getting very cold,''
said the spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.
	   But Anthea Webb of the U.N. World Food Program said one of her
field officers reported refugees were afraid to return home in the
village of Kodralji because of a Yugoslav military buildup in
nearby Decani, in western Kosovo.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
accelerating efforts to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to
verify compliance on the ground. A spokesman for the OSCE said
Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was due in Pristina on Thursday to take
charge of the verification operation.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo is a province in
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The government has offered only to discuss restoring the local
autonomy Milosevic revoked in 1989 -- a position supported by the
Americans and Europeans who also oppose Kosovo independence.
	   ``We do not see that the Serbs are going to be able to support
Kosovo's independence, and therefore it's a rather difficult
proposition at this point,'' said U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.

Jordanians sign 250-yard birthday card to King Hussein

<TEXT>
	   IRBID, Jordan (AP) _ It may be the world's longest birthday
card.
	   Some 15,000 Jordanians already have signed a 250-yard-long
(meter-long) paper card that wishes King Hussein a speedy return
home and aims for a place in the record books.
	   The card has been open for signatures since Tuesday and
organizers expect one million people to sign.
	   King Hussein _ the longest serving Arab ruler _ has been away
from home since July 14. He is receiving treatment for non-Hodgkins
lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   The soft paper card is one-yard-wide (one-meter-wide) and has
been placed in a red-velvet box with tabs on both sides to flip the
pages. It was designed by the Society for Culture and Global Peace,
an independent Jordanian group involved in peace studies.
	   The rectangular box is decorated with the royal crown and golden
stripes along the sides.
	   ``It is a note of love, esteem and loyalty to His Majesty King
Hussein, may God bless him and return him safe to his home,'' said
Mashhour Sawalha, a member of a group which designed the card.
	   King Hussein's 64th birthday is on Nov. 14.
	   Recent Israeli media reports have suggested that Hussein's
condition was terminal, sparking widespread concern among
Jordanians who have known no other leader during the past 43 years.
	   The card will be sent to Hussein on Nov. 8.
	   The first signatory was Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein
younger brother and heir to the throne. The second was Hussein's
eldest son, Abdullah, 37.
	   Sawalha said that after Hussein reads the letter, he plans to
have it registered in the Guinness Book of Records. If accepted, it
would be the first entry for a longest birthday card.

Turkish court orders 30-day closure of pro-Kurdish daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has ordered a pro-Kurdish daily to
stop publishing for 30 days on grounds of inciting ethnic hatred,
the newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The ban started Friday following the decision of an appeals
court, Ulkede Gundem said in a statement.
	   The daily, which frequently reports on the Kurdish insurgency in
Turkey's southeast, faces close to 300 court cases on accusations
of violating one or the other of Turkey's many laws governing the
press.
	   Four of its predecessors were closed down and appeals courts
have yet to rule on earlier convictions demanding 302 days of
closure for Ulkede Gundem.
	   Turkey holds the world record for jailed journalists, with 31
currently in prison for their work, according to the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists. Most were sentenced for articles
or columns concerning Turkey's war against autonomy-seeking Kurdish
rebels.
	   The conflict has killed about 37,000 people.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The African National Congress,
which led the fight against white rule, and apartheid's last
president struck back Wednesday against a human rights panel that
implicated both in apartheid-era abuses.
	   President Nelson Mandela's ANC said it was going to court to
block the Truth and Reconciliation Commission from releasing a
report that names it as a violator of human rights during its
struggle against apartheid.
	   Hours earlier, former President F.W. de Klerk filed a lawsuit
that forced the panel to strike a finding that he was an
``accessory after the fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.
	   The moves a day before the commission was to release its
watershed report showed just how difficult reconciliation was in
this country four years after the fall of apartheid.
	   Commission officials said they had no immediate plans to cancel
the release of the report, planned as a solemn ceremony in which
former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu hands it over to Mandela in
Pretoria, the capital. Tutu is chairman of the commission.
	   But one panel investigator, Cocky Mpshe, said that if the ANC
succeeded in winning a court order, it would probably mean the
whole report would be blocked, South African Press Association
reported.
	   ANC leaders hoped to file their appeal in Cape Town or
Johannesburg by late midnight, officials said.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who runs the country's day-to-day
affairs and is expected to succeed Mandela after next year's
elections, backed the court move, said Thenjiwe Mtintso, the
party's deputy secretary-general.
	   The commission -- created with the ANC's blessing -- was charged
with promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid's horrors.
It has held hearings around the country for more than two years,
listening to victims and perpetrators seeking amnesty.
	   The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South
Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race
elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral
condemnations and could recommend individual prosecutions.
	   From the beginning, it angered many whites who saw it as an
instrument to punish them, and many blacks who feared amnesty
provisions would allow apartheid's perpetrators to escape.
	   Wednesday's event showed how strong the divisions remain.
	   The ANC had expressed outrage that the commission would find it
guilty of ``gross violations of human rights,'' saying it was
engaged in a just war against the evils of apartheid. To condemn it
would ``criminalize the whole liberation struggle,'' said Mtintso.
She said the commission sent a letter Wednesday morning rejecting
the ANC's appeal for last-minute revisions.
	   According to leaked findings, the commission found the ANC
guilty of planting mines in rural areas, executing enemy agents,
blurring the line between military and civilian targets and
fomenting political violence.
	   The ANC move ``must have been triggered by the TRC decision
taken on de Klerk,'' said Mdu Lebede, a commission spokesman.
``When they saw de Klerk do this to us, and that we didn't have
time to respond, they took advantage of us,'' he said.
	   De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for
bringing an end to the racist system, sued in Cape Town to stop the
report's release.
	   He challenged its finding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation, which housed anti-apartheid
organizations.
	   The finding could have opened him up to prosecution because de
Klerk did not seek amnesty.
	   Tutu, the panel's chairman, said the commission would delete de
Klerk's name because it needed time to prepare to fight the legal
challenge. That apparently was enough for de Klerk's lawyers to
agree to a postponement of the case, which then was scheduled for a
hearing March 4.
	   ``It upsets me deeply. We have been scrupulously fair to Mr. de
Klerk,'' Tutu said in a statement.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appear
after all the hoo-ha has died down.''
	   Legal threats have led to fewer individuals being named as
rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported
Wednesday.
	   Tutu responded that more than 400 people had been given a chance
to respond, but only 15 argued themselves out of the report.
	   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know about the
roles of former law and order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Johan van
der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to tell police.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, the
two were already applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The North American National Basketball
Association canceled another two weeks' worth of games Wednesday,
adding to the toll the lockout has taken on a league that was
supposed to begin its regular season next week.
	   The cancellations were announced following a meeting of the
league's Board of Governors, and the announcement was made by
deputy commissioner Russ Granik before a collective bargaining
session with the players' union.
	   Two weeks' worth of games already had been scrapped, and now the
season can't begin until Dec. 1 at the earliest.
	   Until this labor dispute, the league had never lost a game to a
work stoppage.

Report: ETA preparing permanent truce in Basque conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds:UPDATES with reaction of ETA's political wing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA will
shortly announce a definitive truce to end its 30-year campaign for
independence, a leading Basque newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings, is planning a
statement in response to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's demand
for more proof of peaceful intentions, the Bilbao daily El Correo
Espanol reported without citing sources.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18,
five weeks before last weekend's regional elections.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
before the elections, two hooded members of ETA claimed the
cease-fire was ``solid and serious.''
	   The truce is believed to be directly responsible for the boost
in votes for the pro-independence Euskal Herritarrok coalition,
which obtained 14 seats in the 75-seat regional legislature, its
highest showing in six regional elections.
	   But Euskal Herritarrok denied that ETA was on the point of
proclaiming the truce permanent, and accused the government of
creating false expectations within the Basque region's ``very
delicate'' peace process.
	   ``It's a delaying tactic by the Spanish government,'' the Basque
party's spokesman said.
	   The cease-fire on Sept. 18 resulted from months of talks between
the moderate pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party, which
topped the polls, and Herri Batasuna, the ETA political link and
founder of Euskal Herritarrok.
	   Sunday's elections resulted in no clear winner and demonstrated
how sharply divided the northern region is over independence. Three
separatist parties gained a total of 41 seats while four groups
opposed to breaking up Spain notched up 34.
	   Although Aznar has said he is not yet convinced by ETA,
government insiders indicated this week he will not insist on an
immediate hand-over of arms.
	   They added that talks over ETA demands that its jailed
accomplices be transferred to Basque prisons were also possible.
	   The chief ETA demand has been the right to self-determination
for the Basque country, including the three Basque provinces of
northern Spain and parts of neighboring Navarra and southwestern
France.
	   Many Basques, including independence advocates, see armed
violence as unnecessary, considering the high level of autonomy the
region has enjoyed for two decades.
	   ETA has faced a tough government anti-terrorist policy, as well
as a groundswell of public condemnation over the killing of unarmed
municipal officials belonging to Aznar's governing Popular Party.

London doctors: A new way to save one twin when other has no heart
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JANET McCONNAUGHEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ It's a terrible choice: You're pregnant with
twins. One is healthy. The other has no heart. The healthy twin's
heart is pumping blood for both.
	   If you do nothing, it's likely that the healthy twin won't stay
that way. Its heart won't be strong enough for two. But trying to
abort just one fetus is too dangerous for the mother and the
healthy twin.
	   Now, doctors at University College London Medical School say
they have come up with a technique to save the healthy twin by
stopping the flow of blood to the one without a heart and causing
the fetus to die and wither.
	   Cases in which one twin has a heart and the other doesn't are
extremely rare, happening about once in 35,000 deliveries. That
would be about 110 out of the 3.9 million babies born in the United
States in 1996.
	   The new in-the-womb procedure was done with four sets of twins
16 weeks to 24 weeks old. In each case, the healthy twin's heart
couldn't pump hard enough to keep the other twin from swelling up,
just as heart patients' legs swell if they stand too long. One twin
had heart failure.
	   According to a report in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, Charles Rodeck and colleagues guided an electrode through
a needle and into or right next to the main blood vessel in the
abdomen of the twin without a heart.
	   They administered brief jolts of electricity to seal the blood
vessel. The twin without a heart gradually shriveled away, and the
other continued to develop. Three were born normally; the fourth
was delivered by Caesarean section.
	   Rodeck said the technique is safer and easier and can be used
earlier than other approaches, which include tying off or
heat-sealing the umbilical cord.
	   ``I think this technique is very promising,'' said Dr. Brian
Koos, a UCLA Medical School specialist who had to deal with a
so-called acardiac twin a few months ago and ultimately aborted
both fetuses. He said it's straightforward and looks less invasive,
easier and more likely to work than other techniques.
	   But, he cautioned, it is too early to tell whether the babies'
brains and nervous systems will develop normally, and four babies
is far too few for any final judgment. Since the condition is very
rare, it may be some time before it can be tested thoroughly.

Scaled-back AIDS treatment fails

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Two experimental attempts to cut down on the
15 to 20 pills a day that HIV-infected people must take to keep
AIDS at bay failed when the virus bounced back quickly in many
patients.
	   Over the past few years, the three-drug AIDS ``cocktail'' has
turned AIDS from a death sentence to a manageable illness. However,
patients must take their pills on an excruciatingly precise
schedule. Some pills must be taken with a quart of water, some on
an empty stomach, some only after eating. Missing a few can let the
virus mutate into forms resistant to the drugs.
	   In two studies published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, researchers tried to find out what would happen if they
cut back on patients' medication once the drugs had reduced the
virus to almost undetectable levels. It's the way cancer is
treated: hit it hard and fast at the start, then follow up with
easier-to-take maintenance therapy.
	   Doctors in France and the United States took different
approaches but got results so disappointing that both studies were
ended early.
	   In the United States, virus levels shot up rapidly in nearly
one-quarter of the patients whose medication was cut back to just
one or two of the drugs.
	   ``Most failed in the first couple of weeks,'' said Dr. Diane
Havlir of the University of California at San Diego, lead author of
the U.S. study, which treated 316 people at 27 centers.
	   The U.S. patients took all three drugs for six months, then were
divided into three groups. One group got all three drugs. The
second group got only Crixivan, the most popular protease
inhibitor. The third group got the two older drugs, AZT and 3TC.
	   All three groups continued taking the same number of pills, but
some of them were placebos, or dummy pills.
	   In the French study, led by Dr. Gilles Pialoux of the Pasteur
Institute Hospital, 279 patients at 34 centers took all three drugs
for three months. After that, one-third continued with all three,
and two other groups took AZT and either Crixivan or 3TC.
	   Only 4 percent of the U.S. patients and 9 percent of the French
patients taking all three drugs had more virus in their blood when
the studies ended than they did after the first three or six
months.
	   But 23 percent of each of the two other U.S. groups showed signs
of viral rebound. In France, that happened to 31 percent of the
patients on AZT and 3TC, and to 22 percent of those on AZT and
Crixivan.
	   All of the patients were treated as soon as they learned they
were infected, before symptoms appeared. That is standard with the
AIDS cocktail.
	   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, said it is too early to assume that people
must stay on the drug cocktail for the rest of their lives.
	   While these studies show that patients cannot be put on fewer
drugs after three or six months, Fauci said a year might do the
job.
	   Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital and at Fauci's center
are even testing whether someone who has had no detectable virus in
the blood for a year can go off the drugs entirely.
	   ``I say, if we want to treat it early and treat it hard, we
should treat it longer before switching to a less toxic regime,''
Fauci said. ``Three months or six months is really cutting it
close.''
	   Dr. Robert Siciliano, an AIDS researcher at Johns Hopkins
University, said the studies show that current drugs are barely
keeping the AIDS virus under control.
	   ``As soon as one drug is dropped, we immediately see that they
start to fail. So we need more potent drugs,'' he said.

Hoping for loans, Russia presents economic plan to IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with details of IMF meeting,
comments from Primakov, Zadornov, other details. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government presented a long-awaited plan for
pulling Russia out of its economic crisis to the International
Monetary Fund on Wednesday, in hopes of winning foreign loans to
plug holes in the budget.
	   The IMF insisted on seeing a plan to cope with the crisis _ and
signs that it is being implemented _ before it will release any
more of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package negotiated during the
summer. The Russian government desperately needs the cash to pay
its bills.
	   The program calls for tightening currency controls, would
require Russian exporters to sell 75 percent of their
foreign-currency profits to the state, and would reduce the profit
tax from 35 percent to 30 percent.
	   But there was no answer to the question that interests Russia
the most _ the possibility of more loans before the end of the
year.
	   ``Any speculations now would be inappropriate,'' Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov was quoted by Russian news agencies as
saying.
	   More than two months into the worst economic crisis since the
Soviet collapse _ and nearly as long since Yevgeny Primakov was
appointed prime minister _ the government has done little to pull
Russia out of the worst economic turmoil since the Soviet collapse.
	   Wednesday's talks with the IMF were the first attempt to present
a comprehensive plan.
	   A Finance Ministry report released earlier Wednesday said that
the Russian government has run up a budget deficit of 58.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 3.4 billion) for the first nine months of the year.
	   Much of the deficit has so far been covered by foreign loans,
but international lenders have frozen assistance since the country
was rocked by an economic crisis in August.
	   The negotiations Wednesday with the IMF were ``difficult,'' said
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov. The fund
representatives ``had a lot of criticism'' of the government's
work, he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF said it wanted to study the plan and send its analysis
to the government Friday, ahead of a Cabinet meeting to discuss the
program Saturday. Russia also plans to present a draft 1999 budget
to the IMF on Nov. 15, news reports said.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov called for greater state controls over the
economy, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``Russia at this stage needs state regulation,'' Primakov was
quoted as saying Wednesday during a visit to the central Russian
city of Saransk.
	   The IMF recommended that the Russian government revive the
nation's banking system, and pay off its debts _ including treasury
bill obligations whose payments Russia suspended in mid-August.
	   The fund also suggested that the Russian government should not
pay out bank deposits to the many Russians whose accounts were
frozen after the crisis hit, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   The government had offered the holders of frozen accounts at six
large commercial banks to transfer their accounts to the national
savings bank, Sberbank, where the money would be guaranteed. Any
foreign currency savings would be transferred into rubles at an
unfavorable rate.
	   The Central Bank said Wednesday that 47 percent of ruble
accounts and 14 percent of foreign currency accounts had been
transferred by the Oct. 10 deadline.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ With nearly all Yugoslav forces out of
Kosovo or back to their barracks, major powers are rushing to send
up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to the separatist province to monitor
whether the Yugoslav president sticks to his peace assurances.
	   On Wednesday, 13 Norwegian technicians arrived in Kosovo's
capital Pristina to set up the headquarters for the ``ground
verification mission,'' which will serve as the ``eyes and ears''
of NATO and the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is handling the operation, hopes to have a
substantial part of the mission going in Kosovo in the next few
weeks, spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said.
	   Some details on the mission's composition and how its members
will be trained are still being worked out, she said.
	   Fleming said finding 2,000 recruits ``doesn't seem to be a
problem.''
	   Russia, Germany, France, Italy and Britain will each provide
about 200 people, she said. The United States will send fewer
monitors but is primarily responsible for aerial surveillance.
Other nations, including the former Soviet bloc states of Romania
and Czech Republic also have offered personnel.
	   Norway has promised dlrs 26 million to cover costs of security,
housing and communications for the first year.
	   The monitors are to roam around Kosovo to make sure both the
government's forces and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
are honoring a cease-fire, and will file reports to the Vienna
headquarters.
	   OSCE hopes many of the monitors will have had military
experience. But under the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, the
monitors will not carry weapons.
	   Fleming said neither the length of the monitors' training
program nor its venue _ either Vienna, a Macedonian city or
Pristina _ has been decided.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO plans to station
a rapid reaction force in Macedonia to rescue monitors if they are
in danger from either side in the conflict.

Products from east Germany headed for U.S. teleshopping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ Aiming to raise eastern Germany's
profile in the virtual shopping community, companies in the east
German state of Saxony are offering their products to a U.S.
teleshopping giant.
	   Teleshopping group Quality, Value and Convenience, said
Wednesday that eastern German products offered vary from carved
wooden incense burners to mobile phone antennas for cars.
	   QVC representatives are in eastern Germany this week looking at
what companies there have available, said Rainer Sura, the
company's director of network development.
	   ``If the quality is right, the products can soon find their way
into US living rooms,'' said Gerald Brendler, an official at
Dresden's Department of Economic Development.
	   Twenty-three businesses from the state in
economically-struggling eastern Germany will take part in the
initiative, which could put their products on sale in two to three

Bomb explodes near Georgian parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A bomb ripped apart a construction
trailer near Georgia's parliament building Wednesday, though no
casualties were reported.
	   Mine experts from the Defense Ministry were searching for
additional explosives and police surrounded the area, about 30
meters (yards) from the parliament, which had closed for the night.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing.
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, who has survived two
assassination attempts and who put down a one-day revolt by
Georgian soldiers last week, was in Turkey for the country's 75th
anniversary celebrations.

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker showed he can still
produce some magic when he beat French Open champion Carlos Moya
6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4 in the second round of the Eurocard Open on
Wednesday.
	   The 30-year-old three-time Wimbledon champion may be in
semi-retirement but he remains a threat, especially on indoor
surfaces, which are not Moya's favorite environment.
	   Moya, ranked No. 4 in the world, dropped to 0-4 indoors this
year. Becker wasted three set points in the first set and then
committed a double-fault that helped the Spaniard win the
tiebreaker.
	   But Becker broke Moya's serve at the start of each of the next
two sets to show that he can still occasionally topple a Top 10
player.
	   Becker is playing only his 10th tournament of the year and is
coming off an ankle injury that had kept him sidelined for three
months.
	   ``I am surprised to be in such a good physical condition, but my
serve can still improve and so can my pace,'' Becker said.
	   Andre Agassi, who surged into the Top 5 ranks for the first time
since July 15, 1996 after winning last week's event in Ostrava,
Czech Republic, struggled in beating Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-7 (4-7),
6-3. Pavel lost in the qualifying but replaced the injured Thomas
Enqvist in the main draw.
	   Agassi double-faulted on set point in the tiebreaker but
regained control after breaking Pavel's serve for a 2-0 lead in the
third set.
	   Marcelo Rios reached the third round by defeating Tommy Haas,
against whom he had to retire last week because of a hamstring
injury.
	   Rios appeared fit and won 6-3, 7-5 to keep alive his hopes of
knocking down Pete Sampras from the No. 1 spot in the final season
rankings.
	   Sampras played against Nicolas Kiefer later in the day as all
top six players in the world went into action in the dlrs 2.45
million tournament.
	   Rios, who held the No. 1 ranking on two occasions for a total of
six weeks earlier this year, had to retire against Haas on Saturday
in the semifinals in Lyon, France, suffering from a hamstring
injury in his left leg.
	   The Chilean wasted one match point in the ninth game of the
second set and squandered two more before breaking Haas' serve to
win the match in 75 minutes. Rios had also broken the German's
serve to win the first set.
	   Rios leads the tour with seven titles this year and he could
take the No. 1 spot if Sampras loses in the second or third round
and the Chilean reaches the final.
	   Alex Corretja, the seventh-seeded Spaniard who beat Haas in the
Lyon final, was upset by Jan-Michael Gambill, losing 6-2, 6-4. The
American is ranked No. 50 in the world.
	   With so many top players in action, three former winners of the
tournament were relegated to play in a smaller neighboring hall.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, overpowered Wayne Ferreira 6-4,
7-6 (8-6), and Richard Krajicek, a former Wimbledon champion,
ousted Magnus Norman 6-4, 6-1.
	   But the fifth-seeded defending titlist and Australian Open
champion Petr Korda lost to Thomas Johansson, 6-2, 6-4.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, the 12th-seeded Swede, advanced by beating
Gianluca Pozzi, an Italian qualifier, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
	   Greg Rusedski, No. 13, squeezed past Jason Stoltenberg 7-6
(7-5), 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-4) after wasting five match points in the
second set, and 10th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov overcame Mark
Philippoussis, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).

US AID official says humanitarian crisis averted

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After several days touring Kosovo's
devastated mountain villages and listening to everyone from
homeless refugees to international observers, a top U.S. aid
official declared Wednesday that a humanitarian catastrophe had
been averted.
	   ``We had anticipated thousands of deaths from exposure and
illness when the snow came,'' said Hugh Parmer, assistant
administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
``Now, I don't think we will see any deaths.''
	   Parmer said the number of ethnic Albanian refugees living in the
woods without shelter had dropped from 50,000 in early September,
when he last visited, to approximately 10,000.
	   Many of the estimated 300,000 people who fled their homes when
Serbs began their offensive against the province's ethnic-Albanian
majority in February have returned to villages. Most are living
with friends or relatives and some have gone home.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees echoed
Parmer's remarks.
	   ``We have been saying that if people do not come down from the
hills there will be a catastrophe,'' said Fernando del Mundo. ``We
now have evidence that tractors full of people are coming back.''
	   During a convoy ride Tuesday through the Pagarusha area, about
45 kilometers (27 miles) southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital,
Parmer expressed amazement at how few refugees were living in a
valley.
	   ``There used to be about 30,000 people in this area,'' Parmer
said.
	   In Malisevo in central Kosovo, a refugee seeing his home for the
first time in three months told Parmer relief crews brought
supplies to him and others several times in the woods.
	   ``They gave us flour, oil, sugar, blankets, mattresses and a
stove,'' said 48-year-old Isuf Mazredaj, inspecting the ransacked
dwelling full of broken furniture, garbage and clothes strewn
about. ``But it is never enough.''
	   Parmer said international agencies planned to continue handing
out food and medicine but would focus on helping refugees rebuild
their homes, many of which were shelled and vandalized by Serb
soldiers.
	   The United States has provided approximately dlrs 49 million in
aid since the Serb crackdown began, Parmer said.
	   Prior to the Oct. 12 accord between Serb president Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke intended to halt the
conflict, Serb police frequently blocked aid convoys trying to
reach isolated villages. Now, most are getting through unhindered.
	   In addition, Serb police and Yugoslav army forces withdrew from
many positions throughout Kosovo this week, as called for by the
agreement. The withdrawals averted NATO's threat of airstrikes and
were considered crucial to improving free movement of refugees and
decreasing sporadic violence.
	   Parmer warned that improved stability on the ground must
continue or refugees would be afraid to return home.
	   A spokeswoman for the World Food Program, Anthea Webb, said
Wednesday that distributing aid would become much simpler and
effective once the refugees went home because convoys would not
have to ``chase them down.''

	   PARIS _ Pablo Picasso's son says it sometimes took the great
master two minutes to dash off a sketch on a matchbox cover. At the
rate some of those whimsical creations sold at auction Wednesday,
that would come to about dlrs 20,000 a minute.
	   Not only matchbox covers but torn pieces of tablecloth, the top
of a shoebox, and bits of paper with cigarette holes all fetched
prices better suited to oil paintings.
	   On the second of a three-day auction featuring the legacy of
Picasso muse Dora Maar, it was not major works, but rather the
intimate evidence of a love affair that took center stage.
	   Maar and Picasso spent eight tumultuous years together before he
left her _ as was his pattern _ for another, younger woman.
	   She died last year at age 89, after steadfastly refusing to sell
or even lend out the paintings, sketches, notes and other mementos
he gave her.
	   One of Wednesday's most dramatic purchases: 1.1 million francs
(dlrs 198,915) for a set of five torn-off matchbox covers, almost
30 times the official estimate. One of the miniature sketches shows
Dora Maar with her hair in a bun; another is a colored still-life
with an oval guitar.
	   Claude Picasso said his father used to draw the little sketches
when he was sitting with his children.
	   ``How long did it take? Well, sometimes only two minutes or
so,'' said Picasso, the son of Francoise Gilot, for whom his father
left Dora Maar in the 1940s.
	   Several dozen of the matchbox creations were sold on Wednesday,
in small groups. They all brought in many times the officially
estimated price; auctioneers said there simply wasn't any precedent
to help determine the estimates.
	   The day's highest price went for a sculpture of a bird, of wood
and plaster, at 2.1 million francs (dlrs 379,747). The same price
was paid for a 1936 drawing, ``Dora with a Chignon.''
	   A postcard dressed to Maar with a fanciful animal drawing,
accompanied by three other small sketches, went for 650,000 francs
(dlrs 117, 541.)
	   The top of a shoebox was a good substitute for a canvas, too _
the pencil sketch on it went for 85,000 francs (dlrs 15,371), eight
times its estimate.
	   Her friends say Maar wouldn't be happy with the sale.
	   ``Dora wanted her things to go to the church,'' said John
Richardson, a collector and friend. ``But she left only a 1958 will
that named only monks, now dead. How silly.''
	   Though Maar appeared to have no heirs, genealogists tracked down
two distant relatives, both of whom had never even heard of Maar.
	   The auction is expected to bring in up to dlrs 70 million. Yet
to be sold were photographs, books and documents.

Revolution names Zenga player-coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Walter Zenga has taken the
qualifier of ``interim'' off his title as coach of the New England
Revoluation and added the responsibility of player.
	   The former Italian national team goalkeeper becomes the first
player-coach in American Major League Soccer, taking the job
Wednesday two months after he replaced Thomas Rongen as coach late
in the season.
	   After taking over from Rongen on Aug. 24 with about a month
remaining, he guided the team to a 3-3 record.
	   ``As a goalkeeper, in many ways I have always been a coach on
the field,'' Zenga said.
	   Zenga played on the Italian national team from 1986 to 1992 and
joined the Revolution as its No. 1 goalkeeper in 1997 before
retiring to work as a sports commentator and actor in Italy.
	   The Revolution was 15-7 with Zenga in goal in 1997 and 0-10
without him that season.
	   ``New England has become my home away from home,'' Zenga said.
``I believe we can build a championship contender here.''
	   Zenga takes over a team that was the worst in MLS this past
season and has missed the playoffs, which include eight of 12
teams, two of the league's first three years.
	   ``Walter made an immediate impact on our team as our coach this
year and was our most valuable player on the field in 1997,''
Revolution General Manager Brian O'Donovan said. ``By combining
both of these talents, we can maximize his potential in building a
championship-caliber team for next year and beyond.''

Teachers end their protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Teachers ended Wednesday a two-day
strike after the government agreed to increase the education budget
toward raising teachers' salaries depending on their qualification,
age and location.
	   ``Our protest was a success and, finally, education was
recognized as a national priority,'' said Catalin Croitoru, a
leader of the teachers' union.
	   More than 200,000 teachers and professors stayed away from
classrooms to protest low salaries and budget cuts for education.
Almost 4 million pupils and students throughout the country were
affected by the strike.
	   Recently the government slashed dlrs 110 million from the
Education Ministry budget, drawing the wrath of teachers.
	   After several hours of negotiations Wednesday, the government
agreed to provide an additional monthly 153 billion lei (dlrs 16
million) for education from the state budget.
	   Most teachers earn less than the average national salary of dlrs
122 a month.

Report: ETA preparing permanent truce in Basque conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction of ETA's political wing. &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A leading Basque newspaper reported
Wednesday that the separatist group ETA will soon announce a
definitive truce in its 30-year campaign for independence the
Basque region.
	   But a spokesman for a political coalition associated with ETA _
Euskal Herritarrok _ denied that the militant group was on the
verge of a permanent truce, and accused the government of planting
the report to create false expectations in the Basque region.
	   ``It's a delaying tactic by the Spanish government,'' the Euskal
Herritarrok spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   The ETA, which has been blamed for 800 killings in its campaign,
began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18, five weeks
before last weekend's regional elections, but did not say it would
disarm.
	   The Bilbao daily El Correo Espanol reported that ETA was
planning a more definitive cease-fire in response to Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar's demand for more proof of peaceful intentions.
The newspaper did not cite sources for its report.
	   The pre-election truce helped the pro-independence Euskal
Herritarrok coalition obtain 14 seats in the 75-seat regional
legislature, its highest showing in six regional elections.
	   The cease-fire resulted from months of talks between the
moderate pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party and Herri
Batasuna, the ETA political link and founder of Euskal Herritarrok.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party, which topped the polls, has come
under criticism from Aznar and his followers for its contacts with
Herri Batasuna. The party retaliated Wednesday by saying it could
no longer guarantee its support for Aznar's minority government in
the national parliament.
	   It gave a taste of what that meant by opposing the government in
a preliminary vote on next year's budget draft. The Basques have
six seats in the 350-seat national parliament, an important if not
crucial number for the ruling Popular Party, which has 156 seats.
	   Sunday's regional elections resulted in no clear winner and
demonstrated how sharply divided the northern region is over
independence. Three separatist parties gained a total of 41 seats
while four groups opposed to breaking up Spain notched up 34.
	   Although Aznar says he is not yet convinced by ETA, government
insiders say he will not insist on an immediate handover of arms.
They also suggest talks are possible on ETA demands that its jailed
accomplices be transferred to Basque prisons.
	   The chief ETA demand has been the right to self-determination
for the Basque country, including the three Basque provinces of
northern Spain and parts of neighboring Navarra and southwestern
France.
	   Many Basques, including independence advocates, see armed
violence as unnecessary, considering the high level of autonomy the
region has enjoyed for two decades.
	   ETA has faced a tough government anti-terrorist policy as well
as a groundswell of public condemnation over the killing of unarmed
municipal officials belonging to Aznar's governing Popular Party.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A High Court ruled Wednesday that Gen. Augusto
Pinochet is immune from prosecution in British courts and ordered
the British government to pay the former Chilean dictator's legal
costs of 350,000 pounds (dlrs 560,000).
	   The court threw out a pair of Spanish arrest warrants _ acted
upon by British authorities _ that sought Pinochet's extradition to
face charges of murder, kidnapping and torturing political
opponents during his 17-year tenure.
	   In his ruling, Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said it was
``of course a matter for acute public concern that those who abuse
sovereign power to commit crimes against humanity should not escape
trial and appropriate punishment.''
	   But nothing, including the charter that established the
International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945, invalidated
the principle ``that one sovereign state will not impugn another in
relation to its sovereign acts,'' Bingham said.
	   To the joy of Chilean exiles, however, the court ordered that
Pinochet must remain in custody until an appeal by British
prosecutors to the House of Lords.
	   The Crown Prosecution Service said it will file an urgent appeal
on the immunity question Monday, the deadline given by the court.
	   Bingham said he was giving British prosecutors leave to appeal
because of the ``obvious public importance and international
interest ... as to the outcome'' of the case.
	   Pinochet's lawyers immediately applied for the release on bail
of the 82-year-old former leader, who is recuperating from spinal
surgery performed Oct. 9.
	   Magistrates set the bail hearing for Friday and said they would
not rule out holding it at the private London Clinic, where
Pinochet has remained under arrest since Oct. 16.
	   Demonstrators angered by the ruling jeered Wednesday as
Pinochet's wife, Lucia, and their three children entered the
clinic. Some yelled ``asesina'' _ Spanish for ``killer.''
	   Outside the Chilean Embassy, police prevented jeering protesters
from entering the building or blocking the path of Chilean
government officials. Several scuffles broke out.
	   At a news conference inside, Mariano Fenandez, Chile's deputy
foreign minister, said his country does not blame Britain.
	   ``We are not a culture for victories and defeats,'' he said.
``We are happy that the British High Court has recognized the state
immunity.''
	   Back home, Chileans were divided. In the affluent neighborhoods
of Santiago, drivers celebrated by blowing their horns and waving
Chilean flags. But outside the downtown presidential palace, young
members of the Communist Party chanted anti-Pinochet slogans.
	   The British government, which has defended its handling of the
case, refused comment because the matter is still before the
courts.
	   But human rights groups argued that the ruling was out of synch
with international laws.
	   ``Beginning with the Nazi leaders tried at Nuremberg, the
international community has consistently held government officials
responsible for crimes against humanity,'' the New York-based Human
Rights Watch said.
	   Since Pinochet's arrest, other groups have filed suits seeking
to have him tried in Europe.
	   In a separate development Wednesday, British Attorney General
John Morris turned down a bid by four Chilean exiles to have
Pinochet stand trial in Britain on torture charges, saying there
was ``insufficient admissable evidence.''
	   Groups in Sweden, Switzerland and France are seeking to have
Pinochet tried in Europe.
	   Lawyers for the Spanish magistrate had alleged that Pinochet was
responsible for up to 4,000 murders, including at least one in the
United States, and had sent agents to Spain to kill opponents
there.
	   Pinochet, who came to power in 1973, stepped down in 1990, but
remained commander-in-chief of the army until March.

Mandela meets Namibian president on Congo issues

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ A day after inconclusive peace talks on
Congo, South African President Nelson Mandela continued mediation
efforts with Namibian President Sam Nujoma on Wednesday.
	   After the four-hour meeting in the capital of this southwest
African country, Mandela said he hoped a cease fire would soon be
reached under supervision by the United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan and the Organization for African Unity.
	   But Nujoma said he would only withdraw Namibian troops from
Congo if he got the go-ahead from Congolese President Laurent
Kabila.
	   The two leaders said however that they agreed in principle to
work for a cease fire.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad have sent troops and weapons
to help defend Congolese President Laurent Kabila from a growing
rebel threat. Kabila claims the rebels are backed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Mandela was expected to meet Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba on Thursday in Pretoria.
	   On Tuesday, 12 African ministers and United Nations officials
ended two days of inconclusive Congo talks in Zambia, agreeing on a
cease-fire proposal that Congolese rebels refused to endorse.
	   Since the rebel offensive began in early August, African leaders
have been trying to negotiate a settlement of the Congolese
dispute, which threatens security throughout central Africa.
	   Last week, Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe agreed to step up their
troop commitments to Kabila.
	   Namibia over the weekend sent another battalion of 800 soldiers
to join at least 600 troops that are reportedly already there,
sources in the Namibian military who spoke on condition of
anonymity said.
	   Zimbabwe has committed a total of 5,000 troops and Angola has
sent 1,000 troops, and warplanes and weaponry, past reports said.
	   Mandela was expected to meet with Kabila, Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. It was
not clear when those meetings were scheduled.

German charged with planning terror attack pleads innocent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A German citizen arrested on suspicion
of plotting a suicide bombing in Israel said Wednesday that he was
innocent and had come to the Jewish state for a vacation and not to
carry out an attack.
	   Stephan Smyrek, 26, pleaded not guilty in a Tel Aviv District
Court and his lawyer Ronit Robinson said she will argue that a
confession her client gave to Israeli authorities on his was made
under duress and should not be admissible in court.
	   Robinson said she would be petitioning the Supreme Court to
disclose classified materials that may be helpful in Smyrek's
defense. According to Robinson, the evidence has been suppressed by
the defense ministry for security reasons.
	   Smyrek was arrested on Nov. 18 as he arrived at Israel's
Ben-Gurion Airport. He is accused of plotting with the
Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah to carry out a
bombing in Israel.
	   The plot was never carried out.
	   Smyrek's trial opened Wednesday and will reconvene Jan. 3 when
the prosecution begins its case.
	   In June, Israel rejected Germany's request to extradite Smyrek
to stand trial there. The charges against him carry a maximum
penalty of two life sentences plus five years.

NBA cancels two more weeks of games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs; ADDS quotes, details, color &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The American National Basketball Association
canceled another two weeks' worth of games on Wednesday, adding to
the toll the lockout has taken on a league that was supposed to
begin its regular season next week.
	   The cancellations came after a meeting of the league's Board of
Governors _ the committee of club owners, and the announcement was
made minutes before the owners walked into a bargaining session
with the players union.
	   Two weeks' worth of games already had been scrapped, and now the
season can't begin until Dec. 1 at the earliest.
	   NBA Commissioner David Stern did say, however, the league and
union would discuss ``recapturing'' games. That was a change of
tone from two weeks ago, when the league announced the first set of
cancellations and said the games would not be made up.
	   ``They had told us about games being recaptured. We knew that,''
said Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the union. ``You
can add (games) on later, or put more into the schedule.''
	   Until this labor dispute, the league had never lost a game to a
work stoppage.
	   A total of 194 games have been lost with the latest cancellation
of 95 games. Each team's 82-game schedule has now been reduced to
about 68 games and the players have lost about dlrs 200 million in
salaries.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   Stern said there was a ``skeleton'' of a framework for a deal,
but as far ``the guts of the deal, I would say we're no place yet.
And we're willing to have this meeting in order to get someplace.''
	   Stern said he did not want to set a deadline on when the season
would have to be abandoned.
	   ``One, we want to be ready to be imaginative,'' he said. ``Two,
we don't want to make threats; we want to make a deal.''
	   Stern said there would be no further announcements on
cancellation of games. He said that as each week goes by another
week of the season is lost.
	   With that, he and the owners' negotiating committee walked out
of their news conference, took an elevator three flights up and
went into the conference room where about 100 players had been
meeting. As they entered the room, several players cast suspicious
looks their way.
	   ``The main point is having the skeleton. We think that is
significant, since we had not agreed on a skeleton before,''
Kessler said. ``Now we're talking essentially about whether the
players will take a bad deal, which they won't. The issue is now
about dollars.''
	   Union director Billy Hunter had called upon the league's entire
player population to come to New York for this round of talks.
Hunter's plea was made last week in Las Vegas, and since then the
sides have begun to talk of a compromise.
	   Among the players on hand were Michael Jordan and Scottie
Pippen.
	   ``I have an obligation as a veteran player,'' Jordan said, ``to
see that the players of tomorrow have the same benefits and
opportunities that I have. Dr. J and Elgin Baylor and Oscar
Robertson and all those guys fought for this collective bargaining
agreement and the Larry Bird exception and the freedom to have
flexibility.
	   ``I'm obligated to make sure the other players have the same
opportunity,'' Jordan said.
	   The union wants to see if the league moves off its demand to
reduce salary costs from 57 percent to 48 percent of revenues.
	   The league has been seeking such a scaleback since the sides
began talking April 1, and Hunter said Tuesday it is the biggest
obstacle.

Iraqi ambassador says UN inspectors seized on single suspect U.S.
</HEADLINE>
test &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq turned down a request Wednesday by
U.N. weapons inspectors and chemical weapons experts to explain the
presence of VX nerve agent on missile warheads, saying it had
nothing more to say about the matter.
	   The VX findings from a U.S. Army laboratory were suspect to
begin with and don't match with the results of new tests from U.S.,
French and Swiss labs which turned up no definitive traces of VX,
Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said in a letter to the
Security Council.
	   The fact that inspectors are demanding an explanation for
questions that won't ever be satisfactorily answered shows they are
``intent on procrastination,'' he wrote, echoing a frequent Iraqi
claim that inspectors are merely acting as puppets of the United
States to prolong crippling U.N. sanctions.
	   Hamdoon was responding to a report issued Monday by U.N. and
international chemical experts, which reaffirmed as valid a first
round of U.S. tests this spring that found VX residue on 11 missile
fragments. The report also said that in a second round of tests a
French lab found decomposed nerve agent on one sample that could be
VX, sarin or another agent, soman.
	   No other tests on over 120 fragments from the second round
turned up VX or any other nerve agent. But the report from the U.N.
Special Commission, which carries out inspections in Iraq, asked
Baghdad to explain the presence of VX on some fragments.
	   ``UNSCOM chose to seize on this one sample against all the other
results and demanded from Iraq an explanation,'' Hamdoon wrote.
	   ``This is an obvious attempt to deflect attention from the
overwhelming evidence in support of Iraq's declarations that no VX
was stabilized and weaponized,'' he added.
	   Baghdad has ``essentially nothing new to add'' to its
declarations that it was never able to stabilize the deadly nerve
agent enough to load it into missile warheads, he said.
	   In his letter, Hamdoon doesn't address another element of the
report, which found that fragments from all three labs in the
second round of tests showed evidence of decomposed decontamination
compounds.
	   The first U.S. tests found no such compounds. Also, according to
Iraq's declarations, the warheads in question only came into
contact with alcohol, which wouldn't require a decontamination
product to destroy.
	   The presence of the compound residue suggested something more
potent than alcohol might have been in the warheads.
	   The report asked Iraq to explain the origin and history of the
fragments _ presumably to determine when and why the
decontamination product was used.
	   It wasn't believed Iraq would soon cooperate with that request
either, since Baghdad has suspended all cooperation with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction before the council will lift sanctions.
	   The council hasn't scheduled consultations to discuss the VX
report. Council members were, however, meeting Wednesday to discuss
elements of a ``comprehensive review,'' of Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested the review in a bid to
persuade Iraq to rescind its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperation,
which has halted spot searches of suspected weapons sites. The
review could build momentum for lifting sanctions.

Boy dies from using too much deodorant, coroner says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ A 16-year-old boy obsessed with
smelling nice died after months of repeatedly spraying his entire
body with deodorant, a coroner ruled Wednesday.
	   Jonathan Capewell had 10 times the lethal dosage of propane and
butane in his blood when he suffered a heart attack and died July
29, coroner Barrie Williams said.
	   It is believed the fumes built up in his body following months
of ``high'' deodorant use, Williams said.
	   ``His personal hygiene led him to use more than was normal in a
confined space, which limits ventilation,'' said the coronor, who
recorded the death as accidental.
	   Jonathan's father, Keith Capewell, said his son would cover his
entire body with deoderant at least twice a day.
	   ``When we told him he was using too much, he said he just wanted
to smell good,'' Capewell said.
	   ``Even when we were in a room downstairs we couldn't just smell
it, we could taste it,'' the father said. ``You wouldn't have
thought that could have been the cause for someone to die. What a
price to pay for smelling nice.''
	   Sue Rogers of the British Aerosol Manufacturing Association said
she had never heard of a similar incident.
	   ``It is extraordinarily unusual and terribly tragic,'' she said.
``The aerosols have warnings about spraying in confined areas and
well-ventilated places but these are for flammability risks, not
about accidental inhalation.''
	   The boy's mother, Louise, called for better warnings on
deodorant cans.
	   ``You just get up in the morning and spray it on, but who
expects it to kill you?'' she said.

Palmeiras apparent favorite over Boca
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ For a stranger to South American
soccer, Thursday's Copa Mercosur quarterfinal first leg between
Palmeiras and Argentina's Boca Juniors looks like a tremendous
mismatch.
	   On paper, the Brazilians have every edge. Palmeiras boasts a
perfect record in the tournament so far. Of the 20 teams in the
first round, only Palmeiras won all six of its games.
	   Boca, meanwhile, limped through the opening round and just
nipped past Brazil's Flamengo on the final game to take second
place in its group. Its nine points were the fewest of any
quarterfinalist.
	   While the Brazilians trained grimly for Thursday's game, the
visitors sent essentially a second-string squad, preferring to save
the ``A'' team for the Argentine national championship.
	   But Palmeiras is taking nothing for granted. When veteran
champions from rival Brazil and Argentina meet, anything can
happen.
	   ``Of the teams we faced, it's clear the Argentines are the
best,'' forward Magrao told the Rio sporting daily Lance. ``They
fight well with the body, trash-talk and are sly.''
	   ``Boca is in an excellent phase,'' added coach Luis Felipe
Scolari. ``They are leaders in Argentina and have a crack player,
Pallermo.''
	   Scolari wants to use the game against Boca to snap a three-game
losing streak, during which the team slid to third place in the
Brazilian national championship.
	   Palmeiras will be without starting forward Oseas, who was
expelled from the last game with Universidad of Chile and will sit
out a one-game suspension.
	   Scolari will choose his replacement between Almir and Magrao,
who shares the team scoring lead in the tournament with three
goals.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl
through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with
120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges,
flooding neighborhoods. At least 14 people were reported killed.
	   Mitch was almost stationary over the Bay Islands, Honduras' most
popular tourist area which is popular with American scuba divers
and beachcombers. According to unconfirmed reports, another 14
people died on the island of Guanaja, which would raise the death
toll to 28.
	   The storm was only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and
hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105 miles (165 kms);
tropical storm-force winds 175 miles (280 kms). That meant the
Honduran coast had been under hurricane conditions for more than a
day.
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph (305 km) winds. By 1800 GMT
Wednesday, the 350-mile (600 km) wide storm still packed a punch,
but its winds were down to 120 mph (205 kph), with higher gusts.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   The winds and rainfall _ up to 25 inches (64 cms) in mountain
areas _ began to take their toll. More than 50 rivers had overran
their banks, and the government evacuated more than 45,000 people
from low-lying areas, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel, chief of
the National Emergency Committee.
	   Many towns were cut off by washed-out roads and downed bridges,
and phone lines dropped on the Bay Islands, making it difficult to
gauge the extent of the damage.
	   Both highways out of La Ceiba, a city of 40,000, were cut
Wednesday. To the east, the pillars of the Saopin bridge were
weakened by a swollen river and the bridge sagged into the water.
To the west, the Pico Bonito bridge was entirely washed away.
	   Electricity was out in the entire town, and the sea moved a
half-block into town in some places. Firefighter Tomas Hayden said
officials had banned private cars to ease emergency rescue work.
	   Waves crashed against the walls of seafront discos and people
waded through knee-deep water with furniture on their backs to flee
flooded houses. In the Barrio Ingles shantytown, the ground was
entirely covered in white foam from the surf, making it look like
it had snowed.
	   Mario Hernandez was moving his chickens from his flooded shack
to a friend's house on higher ground. One of the 10 chickens had
already drowned, and he planned to take it to a shelter to see if
he could cook the bird.
	   ``My little son didn't let us sleep all night because he was so
hungry,'' Hernandez said, gesturing toward 9-month-old Eugenio.
	   His other son, 12-year-old Matias, clasped his hands in prayer,
shaking with cold.
	   Honduran officials reported five deaths _ one in a collapsed
house, two men electrocuted when they were blown off a roof, one
man drowned in a swollen river and another killed as he crossed a
bridge on his bicycle; the river tore away the bridge with him on
it.
	   In addition, Guanaja Island resident Tina Haylock, who was
visiting Tegucigalpa, told Canal 5 television that she had talked
to her family early Wednesday and they told her 14 people had died
on the island. The report couldn't be confirmed.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains. In a statement, the
organization blamed the deaths on the government, saying it
``hasn't adopted the safety measures necessary for people to cross
rivers.''
	   Mexican officials said a wave kicked up by the storm washed a
Connecticut man off a catamaran south of Cancun on Monday and he
was presumed dead. He was identified as Robert Gates, 55, of
Niantic.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts like Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on pumping
oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Mexican resort of Cancun, 375 miles (640 kms) north of
here, American and other tourists formed long lines at the airport
trying to leave before the storm's arrival.
	   But as Mitch inched south, Cancun Mayor Rafael Lara Lara
canceled the city's emergency alert. State officials earlier had
evacuated several thousand people from coastal zones farther south,
near the Belize border.
	   In Belize, most of Belize City's 75,000 residents had fled in
cars buses comandeered by the government. Belize City, then the
country's capital, was almost destroyed by Hurricane Hattie in
1961, forcing officials to build a new capital inland at Belmopan.

ANC legal move throws truth report release into turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATE expected after scheduled release of report at 1100 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The release of a long awaited
report into apartheid era crimes was thrown into turmoil Wednesday
after the African National Congress said it would try to block it
with a last minute court order.
	   The ruling ANC, which led the fight against white rule and
backed setting up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said it
was outraged the panel planned to blame it for human rights abuses
committed during its campaign.
	   Thenjiwe Mtintso, the party's deputy secretary-general, said the
report would ``criminalize the whole liberation struggle.'' She
said the commission sent a letter Wednesday morning rejecting the
ANC's appeal for last-minute revisions.
	   Commission officials said they had no immediate plans to cancel
the release of the report on Thursday, planned as a solemn ceremony
in which former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu hands it over to
President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria, the capital. Tutu is chairman
of the commission.
	   The ANC move came just hours after former apartheid President
F.W. de Klerk filed a lawsuit that forced the panel to strike a
finding that he was an ``accessory after the fact'' to
state-sponsored bombings.
	   Though the commission is adamant it will fight de Klerk in
court, officials said the legal move by white South Africa's last
ruler may have prompted the ANC action.
	   As the sum of three years of often heartbreaking work, the Truth
Commission's final report is seen as a key step in healing the
racial wounds still dividing South Africa.
	   Set up in 1995, a year after all race elections ended apartheid,
the panel was charged with uncovering the truth about atrocities by
all sides in the struggle for black liberation - a difficult task
that has earned it enemies of all political persuasions.
	   The 3,500 page report is the culmination of scores of public
hearings, victim statements and amnesty cases held all over the
country. The report will make findings as to exactly what happened
in South Africa's bloody past and who is to blame.
	   It is expected to finger high profile individuals from both
sides of the conflict for specific human rights abuses, paving the
way for possible criminal prosecutions for those who did not seek
amnesty.
	   The report is expected to implicate senior figures from
apartheid governments, such as former President P. W. Botha, as
well as anti-apartheid activists such as Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
the former wife of President Mandela, for acts carried out by her
gang of personal bodyguards.

Amoroso returns, Marcelinho doesn't
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Marcelinho has gotten on the wrong
side of Wanderley Luxemburgo, and apparently is making a home for
himself there.
	   The midfielder had a run-in with Corinthians coach Wanderley
Luxemburgo, who accused Marcelinho of indiscipline and suspended
him from the team.
	   On Wednesday, Luxemburgo _ who also coaches the national team _
named his squad for Brazil's friendly game with Russia on Nov. 18
in Fortaleza. For the first time since Luxemburgo took the job,
Marcelinho wasn't on it.
	   ``The rules of the national team are the same as on Corinthians:
unity and discipline, work and professionalism,'' Luxemburgo said.
``If Marcelinho thinks these rules suit him, his future on the
national team is not closed.''
	   Ronaldo again was left off the team. The Inter Milan forward has
recovered from soreness in his knees and returned to action but is
still far from peak form.
	   The only World Cup veterans on the squad are Cafu of Roma;
Rivaldo of Barcelona, and Denilson of Real Betis.
	   The surprise on the list was the return of Amoroso, the
midfielder of Italy's Udinese. Amoroso was considered one of
Brazil's brightest promises in 1994, but a severe leg injury
sidelined him for months, and he had not been called since.
	   Also returning is goalkeeper Dida of Cruzeiro. The No. 3 keeper
at this year's World Cup and widely considered the future starter,
Dida was passed over by Luxemburgo in Brazil's recent games.
	   Newcomers to the team include fullbacks Jean of Santos and
Flavio of Coritiba, as well as Santos midfielder Narciso.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Brazilian Roster &QC; 
	   Goalkeepers: Dida (Cruzeiro), Rogerio (Sao Paulo).
	   Defenders: Cafu (Roma), Felipe (Vasco), Serginho (Sao Paulo),
Cesar (Portuguesa), Jean (Santos), Flavio (Coritiba), Odvan

New search for author's plane after fisherman finds bracelet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, RECASTS, adds new quotes from salvage crews, CORRECTS
spelling of Delauze &QL; 
 &UR; By JEAN-MARC MATALON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Jean-Claude Bianco was fishing in a
rocky inlet for sole and mullet when he netted a bracelet that
could solve one of France's biggest aviation mysteries: the crash
that killed author Antoine de Saint-Exupery,
	   ``I told myself, you're dreaming, you're dreaming. The sea is
vast, and the bracelet was so small,'' Bianco said of the moment he
scraped at the silver chain bracelet to find the names of the
author's wife and publishers.
	   After his Sept. 26 discovery, marine salvage crews began a new
search in the Mediterranean for the remains of the plane's wreckage
_ this time armed with a vital clue.
	   ``This discovery makes me think that the plane isn't very far
away,'' Henri-Germain Delauze, head of the COMEX salvage crew told
a news conference Wednesday.
	   He said he was ``convinced'' that steel parts since discovered
nearby were part of the wreckage.
	   The author of ``The Little Prince'' mysteriously vanished in his
warplane while flying near the French coast after taking off from
Bastia-Borgo Airport on the island of Corsica on July 31, 1944.
	   Repeated searches near Nice failed to turn up Saint-Ex's
Lockheed P-38 Lightning, and theories have ranged from hostile
gunfire to mechanical problems to suicide.
	   The Minbibiex and the Remora 2000, two mini-submarines, were
combing an area of up to 100 square kilometers (38 square miles)
around where Bianco found the bracelet.
	   The operation is expected to take two months, at a cost of some
50,000 francs (dlrs 8,300) per day.
	   The bracelet, in almost-perfect condition, was slightly rusty,
entwined in seaweed and sand, and stuck to a piece of fabric
believed to be that of Saint-Exupery's flight suit. It was found
190 kms (115 miles) due west of the Marseille coast.
	   It carried the name of the author's Argentine wife, Consuelo,
and the names Reynal and Hitchcock, publishers of The Little
Prince.
	   ``My assistant was trying to sort out the fish and said `Hey,
there's a bracelet ... and I put it in my pocket and continued to
work,''' Bianco told reporters.
	   Several pieces of apparent plane wreckage already have been
located by sonar.
	   The waters where the search is being carried out vary in depth
between 300 and 600 meters (360 and 720 yards). Delauze said his
only concern was that the plane may have fallen in waters near the
Planier lighthouse with a depth of up to 2,700 meters _ beyond the
scope of their instruments.
	   ``The job's only just begun,'' he said. ``It's not just exciting
from a scientific point of view, it's also very moving because this
is a myth we feel we're searching for.''

Four killed in police firing, police officer lynched
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Indian police fired into a crowd of
8,000 farmers protesting a crash in groundnut prices, killing four
people and injuring 15 others on Wednesday.
	   The crowd turned violent after the shootings, lynching one
police officer and hurling stones that injured 10 others, police
said. The confrontation took place in the southern town of Sira,
120 kilometers (70 miles) from Bangalore, capital of Karnataka
state.
	   The farmers suspected government officials had colluded with oil
press owners to bring down the price of groundnut, an edible tuber
used in Indian dishes. Beginning Tuesday night, the farmers blocked
highway traffic, torched state-owned buses and tried to burn down
huts near the highway.
	   Police initially tried to beat back the crowd with batons and
then used tear gas. But when they failed, they fired into the
crowd, police said.
	   Authorities have banned crowds from assembling in Sira for five
days.

Researcher finds connection between quakes, volcanic eruptions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX DOMINGUEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Historical records appear to confirm what many
scientists have always suspected _ large earthquakes can trigger
volcanic eruptions.
	   A study of records dating to the 1500s found a statistical link
between the two, Alan T. Linde and I. Selwyn Sacks of the Carnegie
Institution in Washington reported in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
	   While the exact mechanism is not known, an earthquake may cause
bubbles to rise from the bottom of reservoirs of molten rock known
as magma chambers, increasing the pressure that leads to an
eruption, Linde said.
	   ``Seismic waves from earthquakes have the potential to increase
the pressure in magma chambers even at large distances from large
earthquakes,'' the researchers said. ``For a volcano already close
to the critical pressure state, this could result in a premature
eruption.''
	   While earthquakes alone cannot be used to predict eruptions,
close monitoring of active volcanoes may be able to determine which
volcanoes could be set off by a quake, Linde said.
	   Linde said he and Sacks reviewed 204 so-called great
earthquakes, or those with magnitudes of more than 8, and found
eight quakes appear to have triggered eruptions, some triggering
more than one.
	   The researchers also compared earthquakes with magnitudes
between 7.0 and 7.9 and found a total of nine eruptions in the two
days following such earthquakes.
	   Eruptions were only considered if they occurred within 750
kilometers (470 miles) of great earthquakes and 200 kilometers (125
miles) from the 7.0-to-7.9 quakes.
	   By comparison, in the 1,000 days before and after all of the
quakes studied, there were no more than four eruptions on days
other than the days of the quakes.
	   ``They show that a volcanic eruption is about eight times as
likely on a day of a big earthquake as compared to any other day,
within 500 miles or so,'' said Bill Menke, a Columbia University
professor who studies volcanoes. ``Earthquakes are kind of the
straw that broke the camel's back.''
	   Menke said Linde's work provides a statistical basis for what
many had already suspected and also supports one theory on the
causes of eruptions.
	   ``This work gives more credence to one of the theories that says
pressure is slowing building up in the volcano and when it reaches
some critical pressure, something breaks,'' he said.
	   David Hill, a volcano expert with the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park, California, said: ``I think their paper really provided
strong circumstantial evidence that there are relationships like
this, but we really have a long way to go to understand this.''

British Defense Secretary warns Bosnian Serb hardliners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ British Defense Secretary
George Robertson Wednesday warned an ultranationalist Serb leader,
who replaced the Bosnian Serbs' pro-western president, to abide by
the country's peace agreement.
	   Robertson met Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic on her last
day in office and congratulated her on all achievements her
reformist government had accomplished during its year in power.
	   ``I was pleased today to meet those responsible for moving
Republika Srpska so far into the future,'' Robertson said,
referring to the Serb half of Bosnia.
	   He also warned the supporters of the newly elected
ultranationalist Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen against
undermining the Dayton peace agreement, which ended the 3 1/2-year
war in Bosnia.
	   The new 83-member assembly in the Serb half of Bosnia is to be
constituted Thursday _ the parliament's first session Bosnia's
general elections this September.
	   Poplasen is also to be sworn in Thursday.
	   ``A very heavy responsibility lies on the members of the
assembly who meet tomorrow here in Banja Luka,'' Robertson told
reporters after meeting Plavsic.
	   ``The international community will be looking... with great
interest... at what happens tomorrow,'' he said, adding that if
Bosnian Serbs ``turn their eyes to the past, then it will be the
people who will be the losers.''
	   Robertson said that, thanks to Plavsic's moderate government, he
has seen ``huge improvement'' since his visit last year.
	   ``There has been real improvement in the standard of living and
major improvements in the public services... there are more jobs
and the country is much better,'' Robertson concluded.
	   Poplasen's victory against Western-backed Plavsic in September
elections came as a blow to the international community's efforts
of stitching Bosnia's disparate ethnic groups _ Muslims, Serbs and
Croats _ closer together.
	   His Radical Party is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction
backing war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic, and the West worries
he could work against the Dayton agreement, based on his record of
a paramilitary commander in the war.
	   Although the two did not meet face-to-face Wednesday, Robertson
warned Poplasen not to back away from the reforms the Plavsic
government has initiated.
	   The newly elected Serb National Assembly may play a key role in
the future, since it can approve or reject Poplasen's proposals for
a premier in case he offers a hard-liner like himself.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq would be ready to resume the U.N.
weapons inspection program ``provided it leads somewhere,'' a
senior government official said Wednesday.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein,
also rejected assertions by the chief U.N. weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, that Iraq had loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into
missiles.
	   ``We simply haven't done it,'' he said of the VX allegations.
	   He made the comments in an interview with The Associated Press
and AP Television News two days after Butler submitted a report on
tests by American, French and Swiss laboratories of Iraqi warheads.
	   Traces of VX were found in the tests carried out in the American
laboratories. No VX was detected in Europe although there were
indications that Iraq may have tried to clean the warheads before
they were sent to Europe.
	   ``Nonsense,'' al-Saadi said when asked about the tampering
allegations.
	   Also Wednesday, Iraq rejected a request by U.N. weapons
inspectors to explain the presence of VX on the warheads.
	   The U.N. inspectors are ``intent on procrastination,'' Iraq's
U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said in a letter to the U.N.
Security Council.
	   During the interview, al-Saadi spoke about efforts to resolve
the impasse between Iraq and the United Nations over weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 suspended spot searches by Butler's inspectors.
The United Nations retaliated by stopping periodical reviews of
punitive trade sanctions in place for eight years.
	   Al-Saadi said that ``a whole package is being worked out''
between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A ruling in Britain that Augusto Pinochet
is immune from prosecution prompted celebratory honking in
Santiago's affluent neighborhoods Wednesday and an angry protest by
young leftists.
	   Many others expressed relief, saying the arrest of the
82-year-old former dictator is causing serious tensions in Chile
and threatening to damage its institutional and democratic
stability.
	   British police arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 in his bed at a London
hospital as he recovered from back surgery. The arrest was
requested by a Spanish judge who wants to extradite him on charges
of genocide, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule.
	   Pinochet stepped down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief
of the army until last March.
	   Three High Court judges in London ruled that, as a former chief
of state, Pinochet has immunity from prosecution. He will remain
under arrest pending an appeal.
	   The legal victory was met in Chile with joy, frustration and
renewed demands for justice.
	   Santiago's affluent residents, mostly rightists, celebrated the
ruling by repeatedly blowing their car horns. Some waved Chilean
flags.
	   In front of the downtown presidential palace, a small group of
Communist Party members and other leftists chanted slogans against
Pinochet.
	   The government, which has sought Pinochet's release, said it
expects the ruling to be upheld.
	   ``This proves that the arrest was arbitrary and illegal,'' said
congressman Alberto Espina of the right-wing National Renewal
Party.
	   However, Communist Party president Gladys Marin said, ``our
great triumph is the arrest of Pinochet. One fact nobody will be
able to erase from Chilean history is that he was accused in Europe
of crimes against humanity.''
	   According to the civilian government that succeeded Pinochet in
1990, 2,095 people were killed for political reasons during his
regime and 1,102 others remain unaccounted for after being
arrested.
	   An amnesty law issued by Pinochet before he left power prevents
courts from dealing with crimes between 1973 and 1978, which is
when the most serious human rights violations took place.
	   Even some of Pinochet's supporters admit his arrest has shown
that past abuses are still unresolved in Chile.
	   ``This is still pending,'' said Sebastian Pinera, a former
senator seeking the presidential nomination for the right-wing
opposition in next year's election. ``It is important to seek
justice and allow some Chileans to at least bury their loved ones
in a Christian manner.''
	   Sen. Alejandro Foxley, a centrist, hoped the court ruling would
end some of the tension it had caused.
	   ``This should restore calm and serenity,'' he said.

Czechs celebrate 80th anniversary of the foundation of
</HEADLINE>
Czechoslovakia &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Havel awarding state orders, Havel quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Marking the 80th anniversary of
the founding of Czechoslovakia, President Vaclav Havel awarded 89
high state orders to those who have worked for the benefit of the
state.
	   ``One of the things that (Czechoslovakia's first president Tomas
Garrigue Masaryk) said was that countries are kept together by the
ideals upon which they were founded,'' Havel said during the
nationally televised ceremony held in the medieval Vladislav Hall
at the Prague Castle.
	   ``Let us follow the path of those who were putting these ideals
into practice before us and who are doing so now,'' he said.
``These include those men and women who ... are to receive Czech
state honors from me today.''
	   Among the honored were Cardinal Joachim Meisner of Berlin,
Prague's auxiliary bishop Vaclav Maly, a former dissident, and
Nicholas Winton of Britain, who helped save hundreds of children
from the Holocaust.
	   Several athletes, including veteran Emil Zatopek, Czech-born
tennis player Martina Navratilova and Buffalo's goalie Dominik
Hasek, also received medals. While Navratilova received the medal
presonally, Hasek was not present, and his father accepted the
honor in his stead.
	   Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Milos Zeman called on Czechs
to cultivate their culture and maintain their self-esteem.
	   Speaking to an assembly in the National Museum in Prague, Zeman
warned against self-indulgence that could lead to the loss of
national culture.
	   ``Let's make an effort that this nation keep its self-esteem and
pride, stemming from its history, that it become a dignified
partner to other nations,'' Zeman said.
	   He also praised Masaryk for his efforts to liberate Czechs from
the Austro-Hungarian empire 80 years ago.
	   ``At 65, when most people retire, Masaryk left for exile to
fight for the independence of his nation,'' Zeman said.
	   Before the foundation of Czechoslovakia on Oct. 28, 1918, Czechs
and Slovaks were part of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   Three years after the collapse of communism in late 1989, the
Slovak desire for independence prevailed over decades of common
history and Czechoslovakia split peacefully in two independent
states on Jan. 1, 1993.
	   Unlike the Czech Republic, Slovakia does not mark Oct. 28 as a
national holiday.
	   The celebrations were preceded by a scandal that erupted last
week after Havel said he would not award Helmut Zilk, former mayor
of Vienna, the order of White Lion, the country's highest honor.
	   Havel withdrew the honor after a source claimed that Zilk spied
for the Czech communist secret service and provided information
that led to several convictions. Zilk repeatedly has denied the
allegation.

Hoping for loans, Russia presents economic plan to IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with more details of plan, comment
from IMF. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government presented a long-awaited plan for
pulling Russia out of its economic crisis _ including price and
currency controls _ to the International Monetary Fund on
Wednesday, in hopes of winning foreign loans to plug holes in the
budget.
	   It remained unclear how effective the plan would be, or how
easily the government could adopt the measures and pass the
necessary legal changes through parliament. But it was the
government's first attempt at a comprehensive plan, more than two
months into Russia's worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse.
	   The program will come up for final approval by the Russian
Cabinet on Saturday, but government officials said they were
seeking the IMF's suggestions before that.
	   The IMF insisted on seeing a plan to cope with the crisis _ and
signs that it is being implemented _ before it will release any
more of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package negotiated during the
summer. The Russian government desperately needs the cash to pay
its bills.
	   The negotiations Wednesday were ``difficult,'' said First Deputy
Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov. The IMF representatives ``had a lot
of criticism'' of the government's work, he said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF said it wanted to study the plan and send its analysis
to the government Friday. Russia also plans to present a draft 1999
budget to the IMF on Nov. 15, news reports said.
	   The program calls for price controls on medicines and some basic
foods, and for compensating Russians for inflation by indexing
wages and pensions.
	   The government wants to keep inflation _ which soared after the
ruble was devalued Aug. 17 _ to 3-4 percent a month this year and
to 20-30 percent for all of next year, according to the plan.
	   It also foresees tightened currency controls and would require
Russian exporters to sell 75 percent of their foreign currency
profits to the state for rubles, in an effort to increase the
Central Bank's depleted foreign currency reserves.
	   The Central Bank will oversee a mass restructuring of Russia's
beleaguered banking sector, in which many ailing banks would be
shut down, the program says.
	   The plan would raise mandatory contributions for the
state-funded pension insurance and increase the land tax _ two
measures turned down by the State Duma earlier this year.
	   Wednesday's talks provided no answer to the question that
interests Russia the most _ the possibility of more loans.
	   ``Any speculations now would be inappropriate,'' Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov was quoted by Russian news agencies as
saying.
	   A Finance Ministry report released earlier Wednesday said that
the Russian government has run up a budget deficit of 58.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 3.4 billion) for the first nine months of the year.
	   Much of the deficit has so far been covered by foreign loans,
but international lenders have frozen assistance since the country
was rocked by an economic crisis in August.
	   ``There is a large number of problems on which we understand
each other,'' head of the IMF's Moscow office Martin Gilman was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency after the talks.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov called for greater state controls over the
economy but insisted that Russia would not reverse the results of
post-Soviet privatization.
	   ``Russia at this stage needs state regulation,'' Primakov was
quoted by ITAR-Tass as saying during a visit to the central Russian
city of Saransk. Canceling privatization, however, would
``undermine the nation,'' the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying.
	   The IMF recommended that the Russian government revive the
banking system, and pay off its debts _ including treasury bill
obligations whose payments Russia suspended in mid-August.
	   The fund also suggested that the Russian government should not
pay out bank deposits to the many Russians whose accounts were
frozen after the crisis hit, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   The government had offered the holders of frozen accounts at six
large commercial banks to transfer their accounts to the national
savings bank, Sberbank, where the money would be guaranteed. Any
foreign currency savings would be transferred into rubles at an
unfavorable rate.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Social discontent was moving toward a
new peak Wednesday, with women's groups and others expressing
solidarity with seven striking newspapers, university teachers
continuing their walkout and steelworkers threatening a strike.
	   The walkouts have added to the already charged atmosphere in the
runup to early presidential elections announced last month by
President Liamine Zeroual, sparking a power struggle within the
military-backed government.
	   Algeria's four main women's rights organizations backed the
newspapers in their 11th day of a strike. They called on ``those
who believe in the values of a modern, democratic and just
Algeria'' to support the journalists of seven privately-owned
newspapers.
	   Support also came Wednesday from three opposition parties _ the
Front for Socialist Forces, the Rally for Culture and Democracy and
the Movement for a Pacifist Society.
	   ``This is another attack on the freedom of expression,'' said
Samir Bouakouir of the Front for Socialist Forces. ``Freedom of the
press goes hand-in-hand with the search for peace.''

U.N. says world is aging and AIDS is cutting life expectancy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with press conference launching the
report &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ People are living longer, healthier lives
in most of the world except Africa, where AIDS is taking such a
devastating toll that life expectancy is decreasing instead of
increasing, according to U.N. population estimates released
Wednesday.
	   As the 21st century approaches, couples are having fewer
children and the world is aging rapidly, but global population is
continuing to climb _ even in Africa _ and should hit 6 billion in
October 1999 and nearly 9 billion by 2050, the U.N. Population
Division said.
	   Reflecting the decline in infant, child and adult mortality in
recent decades, life expectancy has increased from about 45 years
in the 1950s to nearly 63 years today, the division's director
Joseph Chamie told a news conference launching the new estimates.
	   But the AIDS epidemic is having a deadly impact, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa. According to U.N. figures, 91 percent of the
2.3 million adults and children killed by AIDS last year lived in
34 countries, 29 of them in sub-Saharan Africa. And 30 million
children and adults have the AIDS-causing HIV virus.
	   ``There are more deaths coming due to AIDS and life expectancy
will drop substantially, as well as (population) growth rates,''
Chamie said. ``However, the populations of these countries will
continue to grow'' because fertility remains high.
	   Without AIDS, for example, South Africa's population would
likely increase from 37.5 million today to 52 million in 2015 _ but
because of the AIDS epidemic the country's population will likely
reach just 43 million.
	   And children born today in the 29 African countries hardest hit
by AIDS will have an average life expectancy of 47 years rather
than 54 years if there had not been an AIDS epidemic, the report
said.
	   The demographic impact ``is expected to intensify in the
future,'' especially in the nine African countries where more than
10 percent of the adult population has the HIV virus _ Botswana,
Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia
and Zimbabwe, it said.
	   Chamie said that because the projected demographic impact of
AIDS is much higher than previously estimated, experts from his
office and U.N. agencies will meet Nov. 10 to discuss whether
statistics on the number of AIDS and HIV sufferers and the
projections of their impact are accurate and reliable.
	   While AIDS is taking ``a heavy, heavy death toll,'' Chamie said
lower death rates and longer life in most countries ``is probably
humanity's greatest achievement.''
	   ``From biblical times there has been this attempt to live a
long, healthy life _ and that's what's been achieved now,'' he
said.
	   In the last 30 years, population growth rates have dropped from
a peak of 2.04 percent annually to 1.33 percent at present, which
translates to the world's population growing by 78 million a year,
Chamie said. Because of decreasing fertility and increasing
longevity, the age structure of the world is changing.
	   ``There is a global graying of the world going on,'' Chamie
said. ``It's affecting every country because mortality rates have
come down, but more importantly fertility has been coming down.''
	   This means a greater percentage of the population is over 60
years old, which has implications for pension systems, business,
politics, medicine and class sizes, Chamie said.
	   In Europe, which is most affected, the proportion of older
people will increase from 20 percent in 1998 to 35 percent in 2050,
the U.N. said.
	   For the first time, U.N. experts estimated the number of people
in their 80s, 90s and over 100 _ and found 66 million people over
80 including 6.4 million over 90 and 135,000 centenarians. And
Chamie said the number of centenarians will increase to nearly 2.2
million by 2050 _ the vast majority of them women.
	   ``With the continuation of fertility decline and increase in
life expectancy, the population of the world will age much faster
in the next half-century than previously,'' the report said.

	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras, battling to preserve his
No. 1 ranking, and Marcelo Rios, seeking to take it away, both came
back from injuries to post straight-set victories at the Eurocard
Open on Wednesday.
	   Sampras beat Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 6-4 to reach the third round of
the star-studded dlrs 2.45 million event and Rios advanced by
beating another German, Tommy Haas, 6-3, 7-5.
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year and is
ranked No. 2, could reclaim the top spot he had already held for a
total of six weeks this year if he reaches the final and Sampras
loses in the next round, when he plays Bohdan Ulihrach.
	   Sampras is seeking to finish the season as No. 1 for a record
sixth year in a row.
	   Both Sampras and Rios had to retire from last week's tournament
in Lyon, Sampras with a back strain and Rios with hamstring and
back problems. Sampras withdrew before his quarterfinal against
Haas, while Rios retired in the semifinal, also against Haas.
	   ``I feel much better, I rested for a couple of days. I steel
feel my back a little bit but it is much better,'' Rios said.
	   Andre Agassi, who surged into the Top 5 ranks for the first time
since July 15, 1996 after winning last week's event in Ostrava,
Czech Republic and who still has a mathematical chance of ending he
year as No. 1, also picked up ground.
	   He beat Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3. Pavel lost in the
qualifying but replaced the injured Thomas Enqvist in the main
draw.
	   Although he is seeded sixth in the tournament, Agassi is No. 5
on the latest computer rankings. At this time last year, the former
No. 1 had dropped to No. 140 and was playing challenger events.
	   ``I knew it would take me the whole year to get myself back to
being in good position again. But I wasn't expecting to have
succeeded this quickly,'' said Agassi, who captured his fifth title
of the year Sunday in Ostrava, Czech Republic.
	   ``The end of this year is crucial to the ranking and it is also
crucial to your confidence. But I am not as interested in No. 1
right now as much as proving that I can be there.
	   ``I want to win big tournaments. That is the most important
thing to me,'' said Agassi, who did relatively poorly in the Grand
Slams this year.
	   Agassi next plays Richard Krajicek, who beat Magnus Norman 6-4,
6-1. Rios faces Jan Siemerink.
	   Carlos Moya, the No. 4 in the world who also has a chance of
finishing the year as No. 1, suffered a setback by losing to Boris
Becker.
	   Becker may be in semi-retirement but he can still be a threat
and he proved it by beating the French Open champion 6-7 (4-7),
6-4, 6-4.

New search for author's plane after fisherman finds bracelet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS author's age in 6th, details of mission in 7th, corrects
quotation mark sequence in 2nd and 12th &QL; 
 &UR; By JEAN-MARC MATALON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Jean-Claude Bianco was fishing in a
rocky inlet for sole and mullet when he netted a bracelet that
could solve one of France's biggest aviation mysteries: the crash
that killed author Antoine de Saint-Exupery,
	   ``I told myself, `You're dreaming, you're dreaming.' The sea is
vast, and the bracelet was so small,'' Bianco said of the moment he
scraped at the silver chain bracelet to find the names of the
author's wife and publishers.
	   After his Sept. 26 discovery, marine salvage crews began a new
search in the Mediterranean for the remains of the plane's wreckage
_ this time armed with a vital clue.
	   ``This discovery makes me think that the plane isn't very far
away,'' Henri-Germain Delauze, head of the COMEX salvage crew told
a news conference Wednesday.
	   He said he was ``convinced'' that steel parts since discovered
nearby were part of the wreckage.
	   The 44-year-old author of ``The Little Prince'' mysteriously
vanished in his warplane while flying near the French coast after
taking off from Bastia-Borgo Airport on the island of Corsica on
July 31, 1944.
	   Repeated searches near Nice failed to turn up Saint-Ex's
Lockheed P-38 Lightning, and theories have ranged from hostile
gunfire to mechanical problems to suicide during the Allied mission
he was flying against the Nazis.
	   The Minbibiex and the Remora 2000, two mini-submarines, were
combing an area of up to 100 square kilometers (38 square miles)
around where Bianco found the bracelet.
	   The operation is expected to take two months, at a cost of some
50,000 francs (dlrs 8,300) per day.
	   The bracelet, in almost-perfect condition, was slightly rusty,
entwined in seaweed and sand, and stuck to a piece of fabric
believed to be that of Saint-Exupery's flight suit. It was found
190 kms (115 miles) due west of the Marseille coast.
	   It carried the name of the author's Argentine wife, Consuelo,
and the names Reynal and Hitchcock, publishers of The Little
Prince.
	   ``My assistant was trying to sort out the fish and said `Hey,
there's a bracelet' ... and I put it in my pocket and continued to
work,'' Bianco told reporters.
	   Several pieces of apparent plane wreckage already have been
located by sonar.
	   The waters where the search is being carried out vary in depth
between 300 and 600 meters (360 and 720 yards). Delauze said his
only concern was that the plane may have fallen in waters near the
Planier lighthouse with a depth of up to 2,700 meters _ beyond the
scope of their instruments.
	   ``The job's only just begun,'' he said. ``It's not just exciting
from a scientific point of view, it's also very moving because this
is a myth we feel we're searching for.''

 &UR; Key points in Russian government's economic plan &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Key points in the government's plan for pulling Russia out of
its economic crisis, as presented to the International Monetary
Fund on Wednesday:
	   _ PRICES. Prices would be fixed for basic foods, medicines and
some fuel to help people through the winter, to not more than 120
percent of the wholesale price. Stores would be banned from setting
prices in dollars or any currency other than rubles, a common
practice because of soaring inflation.
	   _ INFLATION. Wages and pensions would be indexed to compensate
for losses to inflation. Inflation would be held to 3-4 percent a
month for the rest of the year, and to 20-30 percent annually next
year.
	   _ TAXES. A special tax collection agency would be created. Some
tax rates would be lowered, with a cap on property taxes and income
taxes. VAT would be lowered and profit taxes would be lowered from
35 percent to 30 percent. The plan seeks to crack down on
moonlighting, which is widespread, by increasing income taxes for
people who take a second job.
	   _ CURRENCY. The Central Bank will keep tight control over
currency trading and exporters must sell 75 percent of their hard
currency to the state for rubles. There will be no bans on foreign
currency.
	   _ BANKS. Restructuring plan for banking sector must be
introduced next month. The Central Bank will oversee it,
liquidating some ailing banks and combining others.
	   _ DEBTS. Calls for an inventory of all foreign debts owed by
Russia and those inherited from the Soviet Union. Does not outline
how Russia will pay off debts it froze in August.

Milosevic fires security chief, refuses to back down on media

crackdown
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 19 grafs with Stanisic's statement, more moves
against independent media and other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite bowing to NATO demands over
Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is reinforcing his
grip on power by firing his secret service chief and refusing to
budge on his purge of Serbia's independent media.
	   On Tuesday, the government announced that secret service chief
Jovica Stanisic was fired and replaced by police Gen. Radomir
Markovic.
	   Stanisic, who assumed the powerful post in 1991, was considered
one of the main pillars of Milosevic's rule. Recently, he was
reported as being critical of Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo and
his alliance with ultranationalist extremists.
	   His removal indicated hard-liners are gaining ground against
moderates within the Yugoslav government. Milosevic has used a
threat of NATO attacks against military targets in Yugoslavia to
clamp down on his opponents at home.
	   NATO said Tuesday that Milosevic had withdrawn enough forces
from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes. But the alliance reserved the
right to attack if he resumes his crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists seeking independence for the southern Serbian province.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic.
	   Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said Stanisic's replacement was
``worrying'' and reminded him of Communist purges in former
Yugoslavia. Slavko Curuvija, the editor of the independent daily
Dnevni Telegraf, said the regime is sacking ``all those who think
with their own heads.''
	   Another opposition leader, Vuk Obradovic, said Stanisic was a
``professional'' and a ``reasonable'' man. He said he expected more
key figures in Serbia to resign or be replaced.
	   Stanisic was quoted Wednesday by the independent Glas Javnosti
daily as saying he had rejected offers for another job.
	   In a statement released Wednesday through the independent Beta
news agency, Stanisic insisted that he had done nothing illegal and
was loyal to ``the Serbian president.'' The wording of the
statement indicated Stanisic feared he could be blamed for
professional wrongdoing.
	   At the same time, Milosevic shows no sign of easing up on his
crackdown on independent Serbian media. In a meeting Tuesday with
editors and broadcasters, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill promised he
would again push the issue with the autocratic president.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law severely
restricting press freedom and instituting severe fines for those
publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   ``You cannot wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said.
	   ``It is a 19th century means, not worthy even of the Ottoman
empire,'' Hill said, referring to Serbia's ancient enemy, the
Ottoman Turks.
	   Also Tuesday, independent daily NT Plus halted publication after
telephone threats to its chief editor, Momcilo Djogovic.
	   ``The new media law has turned into a widespread lynching of
journalists,'' Djogovic said.
	   On Monday, two Serbian independent daily newspapers, Nasa Borba
and Danas, which were briefly banned by the government earlier this
month, stopped publishing in protest after police raided the office
of another non-government newspaper, confiscated property and fined
the paper for alleged anti-state activity.
	   Independent B 92 radio reported Wednesday moves against Glas
Javnosti, for allegedly slandering a state official in an article.
B 92 also said the director of independent Radio Index faces
charges for broadcasting despite a government ban.

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's long-awaited plan to confront a
financial crisis offered a mix of spending cuts and higher taxes
that will affect corporations, civil servants and almost anyone
with a bank account.
	   With the plan, the government hopes to save nearly 28 billion
reals (dlrs 24 billion) next year and qualify Brazil for a rescue
package of about dlrs 30 billion being assembled by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   But the more controversial proposals, including an unprecedented
tax on social security pensions, face an uphill battle in Congress.
``Our destiny is in our own hands,'' said Finance Minister Pedro
Malan.
	   ``We have every condition to confront the current turbulence
through our own action,'' he added. ``If we can't convince
ourselves, we won't convince others.''
	   Pedro Parente, executive secretary at Brazil's Finance Ministry,
said the IMF aid should become available within a month.
	   The IMF, in a statement issued in Washington, said Brazil's
measures ``represent important progress in the implementation of
Brazil's stabilization and reform program, which will be supported
by the IMF and other members of the international community.''

Albanians unhappy with NATO decision, still don't trust Serbs

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two things told ethnic Albanians
that some change has come from international pressure on their
Serbian enemies: Uniformed guerrilla fighters moved openly in
several areas Wednesday and the dreaded police checkpoints had
virtually disappeared.
	   That's not enough, though, to persuade most to return to their
homes or trust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. NATO's
decision to lift its deadline for Milosevic to comply or possibly
face airstrikes only bolstered their misgivings.
	   ``NATO, it isn't doing the job,'' red-eyed Albert Pacarizi, 24,
said at the funeral of his 18-year-old cousin, a guerrilla killed
Tuesday by a land mine left by Serb police. ``They don't attack.
They just give a news conference.''
	   Scores of armed guerrillas in green camouflage uniforms with the
red and yellow badge of their Kosovo Liberation Army marched in
formation at the funeral. That was unthinkable three days earlier,
when Serb police manned a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje, 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The police withdrew on Monday as part of the Oct. 12 agreement
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to end the
crisis in southern Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Under the deal, Milosevic must cut the number of troops and
police in Kosovo to the levels of last February, when he began his
crackdown on secessionist rebels.
	   Hundreds have died and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced
from their homes. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents
are ethnic Albanian, and most favor independence.
	   With Yugoslav forces withdrawing, NATO refrained from setting a
new deadline after its last one expired Tuesday night. It kept more
than 400 warplanes on alert, and the U.S. Navy announced Wednesday
that American P-3C Orion surveillance planes will begin regular
flights over Kosovo on Sunday.
	   The planes can fly up to 12 hours without refueling and will
help monitor the situation day and night regardless of the weather.
	   By warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police have retreated completely.
	   The threat was insufficient for Albanian politicians hoping the
alliance would strike the Yugoslav war machine.
	   ``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing,
that he would be getting away with what he and his military police
have been doing here in Kosovo,'' said Muhamet Hamiti of the League
of Democratic Kosovo.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said the
withdrawal of Serb forces was incomplete but so far represented a
``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling the demands.''
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
accelerating efforts to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to
verify compliance on the ground.
	   Also Wednesday, a senior official with the U.S. Agency for
International Development, Hugh Parmer, said in Pristina that he
believed international actions had prevented thousands of refugees
from dying this winter. The agreement enabled organizations to rush
in clothing, food and other supplies.
	   A U.N. refugee agency spokesman said people were returning home
in many areas, and he expected the numbers to increase.
	   ``People can't wait to return because it is getting very cold,''
said the agency's spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.

Disappointment and determination in response to Pinochet ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Lawyers close to attempts to extradite Gen.
Augusto Pinochet to Spain were disheartened but defiant following
the quashing in London of Spanish arrest warrants against the
former Chilean dictator.
	   ``I was very optimistic until today,'' said lawyer Virginia Diaz
who has worked closely on the case.
	   Also Tuesday some two thousand human rights activists gathered
in Columbus Square in central Madrid to hold a 24-hour vigil
calling for Pinochet's extradition to Spain.
	   ``What has happened in Britain is shameful,'' said the leader of
the United Left party Julio Anguita at the vigil that was
punctuated by chants of ``Pinochet Assassin.''
	   Earlier Tuesday London's High Court ruled that Pinochet could
not be prosecuted outside of Chile for crimes committed when he
ruled the country after ousting an elected government in 1973 until
1990.
	   The court quashed arrest warrants issued by Spanish Judge
Baltasar Garzon that had kept Pinochet detained in a London clinic
since Oct. 16. The warrants were a first step towards extraditing
the ailing general to Spain to stand trial for genocide, terrorism
and torture.
	   ``We were surprised by the ruling'' said Diaz who has worked
closely with Garzon and argues that international law clearly rules
out immunity in cases of crimes against humanity.
	   ``We are not talking about a little bit of corruption, but the
killing, torture and disappearance of thousands of people,'' she
said.
	   Nonetheless Diaz said she was still hopeful with regards to an
appeal on the immunity question that is expected to be filed in
London Monday.
	   Pinochet remains under guard pending the appeal, with a hearing
set for Friday for his application for release on bail.
	   Meanwhile, the attempt to bring the former dictator to trial in
Spain could be indirectly quashed via a related ruling by the
Spanish National Court.
	   A panel of jurists from the National Court, to which Garzon is
attached, was due to begin discussing Thursday whether crimes such
as genocide that took place outside of Spain are within the
jurisdiction of Spanish judges.
	   Over the last two years Garzon and another National Court judge
have been gathering evidence into the murder, torture and
disappearance of thousands during the military juntas that ruled
Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Diaz said she feared the London ruling might influence the
Spanish panel in its decision that is expected Friday.
	   A ruling against Spanish jurisdiction for Chilean crime would
make the appeal against Tuesday's quashing of the arrest warrants
difficult to sustain.
	   ``I am very hopeful,'' Chilean Dora Carreno said to the crowd in
Colombus Square. ``We have been fighting for 25 years and we are
not going to stop here''
	   Carreno, the sister of a woman disappeared during Pinochet's
regime in Argentina, added ``For the relatives of the victims every
step however small is important.''
	   Some of those gathered at the vigil in Madrid planned to camp
out all night and through Thursday until the National Court began
discussing the jurisdiction issue.

Odds-on favorite prevails in Italy's record lottery: No one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ And for dlrs 32 million, the owner of the lucky six
numbers, the holder of Italy's all-time-biggest jackpot, the lucky
lotto winner is: No one.
	   For the 10th straight drawing, there was no winning ticket
Wednesday in a lottery that now rivals Europe's biggest ever.
Italians' misfortune was the Super Enalotto jackpot's gain: It
grows to about dlrs 37 million for next week's drawing, topping the
dlrs 36 million of Britain's 1995 National Lottery.
	   Ever-more Italians lined up at tobacco stores, betting parlors
and lotto kiosks as Wednesday evening's deadline approached; one
robber held up a kiosk to get his ticket at gunpoint.
	   Authorities estimated two out of three Italians were playing _
although with the jackpot the talk of schools, offices and the
street, it was hard to find anyone representing the one-in-three
crowd.
	   Still, the odds-on favorite prevailed Wednesday: Chances of
picking the correct six numbers were set at 1-in-622,614,630 - a
number that's about 10 times higher than there even are people in
Italy.
	   By contrast, July's dlrs 295.7 million Powerball lottery in the
United States was a comparatively easy 1-to-80.1 million shot.
	   Critics have suggested Italy should give luck a little better
chance, limiting the game's possible numbers to far fewer than the
90 now in play.

Lebanese guerrillas wound Israeli soldier, five militiamen

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired mortars and rockets at
Israeli army and allied militia outposts in southern Lebanon
Wednesday, wounding an Israeli soldier and five militiamen,
security officials said.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas opened fire at an Israeli
outpost at Blatt, some 3 kilometers (2 miles) north of the Israeli
border Wednesday afternoon, wounding the soldier, the officials
said.
	   In Israel, an army spokesman said the soldier was seriously
injured by mortar fire.
	   Later, pro-Syrian Amal guerrillas attacked two outposts of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia near the village of
Qantara, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of the Israeli border,
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. Five
militiamen were injured in that attack.
	   The Shiite Muslim guerrillas of the Hezbollah and Amal militias
have been fighting to dislodge some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 allied militiamen from the border strip in south Lebanon
which Israel set up in 1985 to try to protect its northern
settlements.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Heavy storms across northern Europe
killed at least two people Wednesday and closed rail lines, blocked
roads and stranded farm animals in flooded fields.
	   Late Wednesday police in Braunschweig in Lower Saxony state
reported the Leine and Ruhme rivers over their banks in low lying
areas.
	   In the 11,500 strong town of Bad Gandersheim, the old town
section was under water. Elderly residents were evacuated with
rubber boats as a precaution, police said.
	   Some streets and roads in several other towns were also flooded

Tauziat, Pierce advance in Luxembourg Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ No. 2 seed Mary Pierce survived an early scare
against French compatriot Sarah Pitkowski Wednesday to rally from
behind 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the Seat Luxembourg Open and remain on
course for a second tournament win in as many weeks.
	   Top-seeded Nathalie Tauziat had no such trouble to advance into
quarterfinals of the dlrs 164,250 WTA tournament, sweeping past
Austrian qualifier Sylvia Plischke 6-2, 6-4.
	   The only seed to fall Wednesday was No. 7 Iva Majoli of Croatia
who was no match for qualifier Evgenia Koulikovskaya of Russia 6-2,
6-4.
	   In other second round action, Germany's Anke Hueber, seeded
sixth here, won a drawnout match against France's Amelie Mauresmo
6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-1 and will now meet Tauziat in Thursday's
quarterfinals.
	   Fifth-seeded Ai Sugiyama of Japan was involved in a similar
marathon match against Barbara Schett. The Austrian, ranked 26th in
the world long played at the same level of the Japanese ranked 10
places ahead of her, but faltered in the final games 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
Pierce is up next for Sugiyama.
	   Elena Likhovtseva of Russia, the world's No. 26, had no trouble
beating Elena Tatarkova of Ukraine 6-2, 6-1. Tarakova had beaten
defending champion Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the first
round.
	   Irina Spirlea of Romania, seeded third here, also advanced into
the quarterfinals in straight sets, beating Belgium's Sabine
Appelmans 6-3, 7-5.

 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras, battling to preserve his
No. 1 ranking, and Marcelo Rios, seeking to take it away, both came
back from injuries to post straight-set victories at the Eurocard
Open on Wednesday.
	   Sampras beat Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 6-4 to reach the third round of
the star-studded dlrs 2.45 million event and Rios advanced by
beating another German, Tommy Haas, 6-3, 7-5.
	   Third-ranked Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champion who
is also in contention for the top spot, beat Magnus Gustafsson 6-1,
6-4.
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year and is
ranked No. 2, could reclaim the top spot he had already held for a
total of six weeks this year if he reaches the final and Sampras
loses in the next round, when he plays Bohdan Ulihrach.
	   Sampras is seeking to finish the season as No. 1 for a record
sixth year in a row.
	   ``It's a huge challenge and I am going to push hard,'' Sampras
said. I feel I am in a good position to do it. It'd be one of the
ultimate achievements in tennis.''
	   ``If I play well and win, the ranking will take care of
itself,'' he said.
	   With a heavy storm moving over Stuttgart, the roof of the arena
began to leak while Sampras and Rafter were playing and one spot on
the court had to be mopped up repeatedly.
	   Both Sampras and Rios had to retire from last week's tournament
in Lyon, Sampras with a back strain and Rios with hamstring and
back problems. Sampras withdrew before his quarterfinal against
Haas, while Rios retired in the semifinal, also against Haas.
	   ``I feel much better, I rested for a couple of days. I steel
feel my back a little bit but it is much better,'' Rios said.
	   Andre Agassi, who surged into the Top 5 ranks for the first time
since July 15, 1996 after winning last week's event in Ostrava,
Czech Republic and who still has a mathematical chance of ending he
year as No. 1, also picked up ground.
	   He beat Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3. Pavel lost in the
qualifying but replaced the injured Thomas Enqvist in the main
draw.
	   Although he is seeded sixth in the tournament, Agassi is No. 5
on the latest computer rankings. At this time last year, the former
No. 1 had dropped to No. 140 and was playing challenger events.
	   ``I knew it would take me the whole year to get myself back to
being in good position again. But I wasn't expecting to have
succeeded this quickly,'' said Agassi, who captured his fifth title
of the year Sunday in Ostrava, Czech Republic.
	   ``The end of this year is crucial to the ranking and it is also
crucial to your confidence. But I am not as interested in No. 1
right now as much as proving that I can be there.
	   ``I want to win big tournaments. That is the most important
thing to me,'' said Agassi, who did relatively poorly in the Grand
Slams this year.
	   Agassi next plays Richard Krajicek, who beat Magnus Norman 6-4,
6-1. Rios faces Jan Siemerink.
	   Carlos Moya, the No. 4 in the world who also has a chance of
finishing the year as No. 1, suffered a setback by losing to Boris
Becker.
	   Becker may be in semi-retirement but he can still be a threat
and he proved it by beating the French Open champion 6-7 (4-7),
6-4, 6-4.
	   Rafter next faces No. 13 Greg Rusedski, who squeezed past Jason
Stoltenberg 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-4) after wasting five
match points in the second set.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl
through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with
120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges,
flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people.
	   Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over the Bay
Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area. It also was only 30
miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched
outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles
(280 kms). That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane
conditions for more than a day.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which was within miles (kms) of
the eye of the hurricane. ``Few houses have remained standing.''

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Lawyers trying to extradite Gen. Augusto
Pinochet to Spain criticized a British court's decision to quash
the arrest of the former Chilean dictator, but said they remained
hopeful that an appeals court would overturn Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``I was very optimistic until today,'' said lawyer Virginia Diaz
who has worked closely on the case.
	   The High Court in London quashed arrest warrants issued by
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon that had kept Pinochet detained in a
London clinic since Oct. 16. The warrants were a first step towards
extraditing the ailing general to Spain to stand trial for
genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   The court ruled that Pinochet could not be prosecuted outside of
Chile for crimes during his 17-year dictatorship that began in 1973
because he was head of state at the time.
	   ``We were surprised by the ruling,'' said Diaz who has worked
closely with Garzon and argues that international law clearly rules
out immunity in cases of crimes against humanity.
	   ``We are not talking about a little bit of corruption, but the
killing, torture and disappearance of thousands of people,'' she
said.
	   Nonetheless Diaz said she was holds out some hope for an appeal
on the immunity question that is expected to be filed in London
Monday.
	   Pinochet remains under guard pending the appeal, with a hearing
set for Friday for his application for release on bail.
	   Meanwhile, the attempt to bring the former dictator to trial in
Spain is under indirect legal attack via a related discussion in
Spain's National Court.
	   A panel of jurists from the National Court, to which Garzon is
attached, was due to begin discussing Thursday whether crimes such
as genocide that took place outside of Spain are within the
jurisdiction of Spanish judges.
	   For two years Garzon and another National Court judge have been
gathering evidence into the murder, torture and disappearance of
thousands during the military juntas that ruled Chile and Argentina
in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Diaz said she feared the London ruling might influence the
Spanish panel in its decision that is expected Friday.
	   A ruling against Spanish jurisdiction for Chilean crimes would
make the appeal against Wednesday's decision in favor of Pinochet's
immunity difficult to sustain.
	   Also Wednesday some two thousand human rights activists gathered
in Columbus Square in central Madrid to hold a 24-hour vigil timed
to coincide with the lead up to the National Court's deliberations.
	   The vigil could not avoid contained references to the
Wednesday's ruling in London.
	   ``What has happened in Britain is shameful,'' said the leader of
the United Left party Julio Anguita at the vigil that was
punctuated by chants of ``Pinochet Assassin.''
	   The minority United Left and the main opposition Socialist Party
have vocally supported Garzon's efforts to extradite Pinochet. The
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has
insisted that the Pinochet controversy is purely a judicial matter
on which it should not comment.
	   ``I am very hopeful,'' Chilean Dora Carreno said to the crowd in
Columbus Square. ``We have been fighting for 25 years and we are
not going to stop here''
	   Carreno, the sister of a woman disappeared during Pinochet's
regime in Argentina, added ``For the relatives of the victims every
step however small is important.''

Fiorentina, Inter struggle against underdog teams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ League leader Fiorentina and Milan
powerhouse Internazionale struggled to 1-0 wins against low-ranked
opponents in third-round first leg games of the Italian Cup
Wednesday.
	   The Florentine team downed second-division Lecce on a late goal
by Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Inter defeated third-division Castel di Sangro on a powerful
free kick by young Italian forward Nicola Ventola in a game
preceded by a violent protest of Inter supporters.
	   Angered by consecutive defeats suffered by the Milan team in
league matches, groups of Inter fans hurled eggs at the bus taking
the players to San Siro stadium.
	   The situation remained tense inside the arena despite the
victory of the home team which started 8 non-Italians while keeping
Brazilian star Ronaldo at rest.
	   It was a lackluster round for the leading Serie A teams with
Udinese, Sampdoria and Roma held to draws by underdog Vicenza,
Bologna and Atalanta.
	   On Tuesday league champion Juventus played to a 1-1 home tie
with unheralded Venezia.
	   Otherwise, two goals by flashy Colombian forward Faustino
Asprilla gave Parma a 2-1 victory on the road against Bari.
	   Asprilla opened the scoring with a precise lob in the 75th
minute, following a lapse by Bari defense, and added a second goal
with a powerful drive in injury time.
	   In Florence Batistuta, fed by Brazilian teammate Edmundo, kicked
in the game winner with seven minutes left.
	   Batistuta's goal came following a streak of missed chances by
the stellar attack of the Florentine team which had irritated the
crowd.
	   In Milan Ventola scored Inter's winner in the 26th, one minute
after entering the field as substitute for injured Uruguayan
forward Alvaro Recoba.
	   In Bargamo, second-division Atalanta scored a quick goal with
Nicola Zanini, in the 2nd minute.
	   Forward Marco Del Vecchio tallied the equalizer in the 30th,
avoiding Roma a second upset in four days.
	   The Roman team lost 2-3 to AC Milan a league match last Sunday.
	   Udinese-Vicenza and Sampdoria-Bologna both ended in goalless
draws.
	   The game between defending Cup champion Lazio and AC Milan, at
Rome's Olympic stadium, will complete the first-leg round Thursday
night.

Tauziat, Pierce advance in Luxembourg Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ No. 2 seed Mary Pierce survived an early scare
against French compatriot Sarah Pitkowski Wednesday to win 4-6,
6-2, 6-3 in the Seat Luxembourg Open and remain on course for a
second tournament win in as many weeks.
	   Top-seeded Nathalie Tauziat had no advancing into quarterfinals
of the $164,250 WTA tournament, sweeping past Austrian qualifier
Sylvia Plischke 6-2, 6-4.
	   The only seed to fall Wednesday was No. 7 Iva Majoli of Croatia
who was no match for qualifier Evgenia Koulikovskaya of Russia 6-2,
6-4.
	   In other second-round action, Germany's Anke Huber, seeded sixth
here, won beat France's Amelie Mauresmo 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-1 and
will now meet Tauziat in Thursday's quarterfinals.
	   Fifth-seeded Ai Sugiyama of Japan was involved in a similar
marathon match against Barbara Schett, winning 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
Sugiyama will play Pierce next.
	   Elena Likhovtseva of Russia had no trouble beating Elena
Tatarkova of Ukraine 6-2, 6-1. Tarakova had beaten defending
champion Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the first round.
	   Irina Spirlea of Romania, seeded third, also advanced into the
quarterfinals in straight sets, beating Belgium's Sabine Appelmans
6-3, 7-5.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl
through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with
120 mph (205 kph) winds, sweeping away bridges, flooding
neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people.
	   Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over the Bay
Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area.
	   The storm was only 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the coast, and
hurricane-force winds stretched 105 miles (165 kilometers) from the
storm's center. That meant the Honduran coast and a good portion of
the interior was under hurricane conditions for more than a day.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island who was within miles
(kilometers) of the eye of the hurricane. ``Few houses have
remained standing.''
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was classified as the
fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane this century with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. By Wednesday afternoon, the 350-mile (600
kilometer)-wide storm still packed a punch, but its sustained winds
were down to 115 mph (195 kph).
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   The rainfall _ up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) in mountain
areas _ began to take a toll. More than 50 rivers had overran their
banks, and the government evacuated more than 45,000 people from
low-lying areas, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel, chief of the
National Emergency Committee.
	   Many towns were cut off by washed-out roads and downed bridges,
and severed phone lines on the Bay Islands, making it difficult to
gauge the extent of the damage. The government said 72,000 people
were forced to flee their homes.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared the Caribbean coast a
disaster zone, and officials said 23 people had died in Honduras
alone, including 14 on Guanaja.
	   Five people were killed in La Ceiba, including three police
officers swept into a river in their car, said regional police
chief Maria Lisa Borjas.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains. In a statement, the
organization blamed the deaths on the government, saying it
``hasn't adopted the safety measures necessary for people to cross
rivers.''
	   Mexican officials said a wave kicked up by the storm washed a
Connecticut man off a catamaran south of Cancun on Monday, and he
was presumed dead. He was identified as Robert Gates, 55, of
Niantic.
	   Both highways out of La Ceiba, a city of 40,000 people, were cut
Wednesday. To the east, the Saopin bridge sagged into the water as
the swollen river weakened its pillars. To the west, the Pico
Bonito bridge was entirely washed away.
	   Electricity was out in the entire town, and the sea moved a
half-block inland in some places.
	   Waves crashed against the walls of seafront discos and people
waded through knee-deep water with furniture on their backs to flee
flooded houses. In the Barrio Ingles shantytown, the ground was
entirely covered in white foam from the surf, making it look like
it had snowed.
	   Mario Hernandez was moving his chickens from his flooded shack
to a friend's house on higher ground. One of the 10 chickens had
already drowned, and he planned to take it to a shelter to see if
he could cook the bird.
	   ``My little son didn't let us sleep all night because he was so
hungry,'' Hernandez said, gesturing toward 9-month-old Eugenio.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts and cutting back on pumping oil from wells in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Mexican resort of Cancun, 375 miles (640 kms) north of
Honduras, tourists formed long lines at the airport trying to leave
before the storm arrived. But as Mitch inched south, Cancun Mayor
Rafael Lara Lara canceled the city's emergency alert.
	   Belize City, Belize's capital until 1961 when it was destroyed
by Hurricane Hattie, was a ghost town. Most of its 75,000 residents
had fled in cars buses commandeered by the government.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people
wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company
was broadcasting only the weather channel.
	   Freddy Sikaffy stayed behind with his wife to take care of his
Hotel El Centro, which was closed. But he had stored up only enough
food for a couple of days, and that was almost gone.
	   ``We have some water, some bread and some tin stuff,'' he said.
``But we thought that by Wednesday the hurricane would be out of
here.''

Norman throws his hats into the ring

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's richest sportsman, Greg
Norman, has struck a deal with Sydney 2000 Olympic organizers, who
are struggling to meet budget targets, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The golf star will supply 50,000 of his signature Great White
Shark hats for use by volunteers at the games and SOCOG will also
use his huge profile to help raise the Australian dlrs 874 million
(U.S. dlrs 542) needed from the marketing department.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said Norman's Australian
manager Frank Williams was unaware of the deal but reported Olympic
sources as saying it had been signed for some time.
	   SOCOG chiefs have admitted they are stretching to raise enough
revenue to meet the Australian dlrs 2.6 million (U.S. dlrs 1.64
million) budget. International Olympic Committee spokesman Jacques
Rogge called the budget ``ambitious yet feasible'' last week.
	   The Australian Olympic Committee has been negotiating with
Norman on activities to raise cash for athletes, including holding
other events in conjunction with the annual Greg Norman
International golf tournament, the paper reported.
	   Norman's Great White Shark Enterprises would supply goods and
services to SOCOG for a reduced price in exchange for some rights
to use Olympic insignia.

	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ As a choppy sea rocked the research
boat, a winch slowly hauled up a 2,000-year-old granite sphinx
Wednesday from the ruins of a sunken city where Cleopatra had a
palace.
	   The black stone figure was taken from its resting place to show
reporters and international archaeologists a sample of the
countless treasures discovered recently in the Mediterranean
seabed.
	   Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities proposes turning the site
into an underwater museum, council chief Gaballa Ali Gaballa told
reporters aboard the Princess Duda, which brought up the sphinx,
believed to depict Cleopatra's father, Ptolemy XII.
	   Instead of pulling up the artifacts _ barely a half-mile
(kilometer) away from the bustling marina of Alexandria _ Gaballa
proposes building a network of underwater transparent tunnels.
	   Tourists would go down into the tunnels to see the ruins of
Alexandria's royal court, which plunged into the sea more than
1,600 years ago following a series of earthquakes and tidal waves.
	   ``We are opening a whole new world,'' he said. ``This is the
world's heritage.''
	   A feasibility study for the museum was launched Tuesday. The
government will need to be persuaded to get the plan off the
ground, Gaballa said.
	   ``It sounds crazy, but I know it is not crazy. I know it can be
done,'' said Gaballa, Egypt's chief archaeologist.
	   He refused to say how long or how much money it will take to
build the tunnels around the site, which is about 20 feet (6
meters) under water. Gaballa did not rule out participation of
private groups and UNESCO.
	   The existence of the historically documented royal court was not
confirmed until 1996, when French marine archaeologist Franck
Goddio discovered the location after four years of exploration with
the help of sophisticated equipment including a satellite global
positioning system.
	   Working with Gaballa's organization, Goddio drew accurate maps
of the submerged quarters, including columns, statues, sphinxes,
pavements, ceramics and piers.
	   Goddio's 35-member mission also discovered the royal harbor of
Cape Lochias and the island of Antirhodos, which housed one of
Cleopatra's palaces, and the peninsula where her lover, Marc
Antony, built his retreat, the Timonium.
	   Cleopatra's original palace might not even have been in
existence when the royal quarters submerged _ her rule had ended
centuries earlier with her and her lover's suicide in 30 B.C. But
many of the artifacts date to the period when Cleopatra lived there
and many are as old as 3rd century B.C.
	   Alexandria was a great city long before Cleopatra. It was built
by Greek conqueror Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. after he saw the
magnificent harbor. At its height, the city was a commercial and
cultural center filled with gardens, fountains and temples.
	   While the discovery of the lost city is not likely to reveal
great secrets, it brings ``us within touching distance of history.
It gives a new perspective to the lives of people like Cleopatra,
Julius Caesar and Antony,'' Goddio said.
	   Among Goddio's most treasured find is the 825-pound (380 kilos)
sphinx dating to 50 B.C. _ a lion with a human head in Pharaonic
headgear, bearing close resemblance to Ptolemy XII.
	   On Wednesday, a steel frame hooked to a winch on the crazily
rocking research boat was slipped under the sphinx. As the statue
emerged from the water, visitors and crew broke into applause. The
divers' mascot, a golden retriever, wagged her tail madly.
	   ``Look at me. I have goose pimples all over. This is seeing
history alive,'' Gaballa said after running his hands over the
statue. Almost everybody on board crowded around the statue to have
pictures taken with it.
	   Ten minutes earlier, the divers had pulled out a 4-foot
(1-meter)-tall black granite statue of a priest from a temple of
the Egyptian goddess Isis, dating to the 1st century A.D.
	   Both statues will be returned to the sea, Gaballa said.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians marched
Wednesday in the funeral procession of a 16-year-old boy killed in
a power struggle between Fatah, Yasser Arafat's political faction,
and military intelligence agents.
	   The victim, Fatah supporter Wassim Tarifi, was shot to death
during stone throwing clashes outside military intelligence
headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Sunday.
	   Fatah leaders blamed military intelligence agents for Tarifi's
death and demanded that the killers be tried and executed. No
arrests have been made in connection with the death.
	   On Wednesday, Tarifi's body was placed on a stretcher and driven
through Ramallah in an ambulance decorated with wreaths. Military
vehicles led the convoy to the city's largest mosque where sobbing
classmates consoled each other. Other students held black flags and
posters of Tarifi.
	   The confrontation began when military intelligence agents raided
the Fatah headquarters in Ramallah early Sunday, apparently in
response to Fatah activists detaining and questioning three men
training to become pilots in the budding Palestinian air force.
	   In the raid, seven Fatah members were arrested by military
intelligence. In response, about 100 Fatah supporters threw stones
at the military headquarters on Sunday. Shots were fired, and
Tarifi was killed.
	   Fatah is the political faction of the Palestinian leader and
many of the Palestinian Authority's ministers, as well as
legislative council members and security force officials are drawn
from its ranks. However, those older Fatah members are less active
in the grass-roots activism of the movement than the younger
generation who today form its nucleus.
	   Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader and
the head of military intelligence, said Tuesday that Fatah has been
trying to act as a security force in the city and has hassled
Palestinian security officers.
	   ``There cannot be two authorities in the city,'' Moussa Arafat
said.
	   He denied that his men killed Tarifi.
	   Fatah's West Bank leader, Marwan Barghouti, said the raid part
of a local power struggle.
	   ``Fatah swears that any hand laid on the sons of Fatah, or any
other Palestinian by whom ever may be, that hand will be cut off,''
Barghouti told the mourners Wednesday.
	   On Tuesday, four military intelligence agents involved in the
raid were convicted of violating the sanctity of the Fatah office
and harming national unity. Three men were sentenced to three years
and the most senior officer received a four-year term.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Lawyers trying to extradite Gen. Augusto
Pinochet to Spain criticized a British court's decision to quash
the arrest of the former Chilean dictator, but said they remained
hopeful that an appeals court would overturn Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``I was very optimistic until today,'' said lawyer Virginia Diaz
who has worked closely on the case.
	   The High Court in London quashed arrest warrants issued by
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon that had kept Pinochet detained in a
London clinic since Oct. 16. The warrants were a first step towards
extraditing the ailing general to Spain to stand trial for
genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   The court ruled that Pinochet could not be prosecuted outside of
Chile for crimes during his 17-year dictatorship that began in 1973
because he was head of state at the time.
	   ``We were surprised by the ruling,'' said Diaz who has worked
closely with Garzon and argues that international law clearly rules
out immunity in cases of crimes against humanity.
	   ``We are not talking about a little bit of corruption, but the
killing, torture and disappearance of thousands of people,'' she
said.
	   No comment was available from Judge Garzon.
	   Meanwhile, the Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramon de
Miguel expressed the government's ``profound institutional
respect'' for the British legal decision, but refused to evaluate
it, the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
	   ``I have no comment to make on this or any other related legal
decision such as that might be taken by the Spanish courts,'' EFE
quoted him as saying.
	   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
has called for caution on the Pinochet controversy, but has always
insisted that it is a purely judicial matter.
	   Left leaning opposition parties have vocally supported the
extradition effort. ``What happened in London was shameful,'' said
the leader of the United Left Julio Anguita.
	   Looking forward to the next legal steps, Diaz said she held out
some hope for an appeal on the immunity question that is expected
to be filed in London Monday.
	   Pinochet remains under guard pending the appeal, with a hearing
set for Friday for his application for release on bail.
	   Meanwhile, the attempt to bring the former dictator to trial in
Spain is under indirect legal attack via a related discussion in
Spain's National Court.
	   A panel of jurists from the National Court, to which Garzon is
attached, was due to begin discussing Thursday whether crimes such
as genocide that took place outside of Spain are within the
jurisdiction of Spanish judges.
	   For two years Garzon and another National Court judge have been
gathering evidence into the murder, torture and disappearance of
thousands during the military juntas that ruled Chile and Argentina
in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Diaz said she feared the London ruling might influence the
Spanish panel in its decision that is expected Friday.
	   A ruling against Spanish jurisdiction for Chilean crimes would
make the appeal against Wednesday's decision in favor of Pinochet's
immunity difficult to sustain.
	   Also Wednesday some two thousand human rights activists gathered
in Columbus Square in central Madrid to hold a 24-hour vigil timed
to coincide with the lead up to the National Court's deliberations.
	   ``I am very hopeful,'' Chilean Dora Carreno said to the crowd in
Columbus Square. ``We have been fighting for 25 years and we are
not going to stop here''
	   Carreno, the sister of a woman disappeared during Pinochet's
regime in Argentina, added ``For the relatives of the victims every
step however small is important.''

Austerity measures received with skepticism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Brazil-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Skepticism and rejection greeted the
spending cuts and higher taxes announced Wednesday by Brazil to
stop its headlong dash to economic chaos.
	   The austerity measures are aimed at saving nearly 28 billion
reals (dlrs 24 billion) next year and qualify Brazil for a rescue
package of about dlrs 30 billion being put together by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Besides spending cuts to save government coffers 8.7 billion
reals, or about dlrs 7.3 billion, the belt-tightening measures
include a hefty increase on a financial transaction tax and on a
corporate tax used to finance the country's social security system.
	   ``The package of measures is not much different than so many
others that have failed in the past,'' said Denisard Alves,
chairman of the economics department at the University of Sao
Paulo. ``Congress will most likely oppose much of the package and
doom it to failure.''
	   He said most of the opposition to the measures will focus on
plans to increase the social security tax paid by government
employees and _ for the first time _ collect the tax from retired
civil servants. The extra revenue is expected to come to 2.6
billion reals (dlrs 2.2 billion).
	   Brazilian share prices bucked initial market expectations and
closed lower in a rollercoaster session.
	   The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index ended 43 points or
0.6 percent lower, at 6,826, after dipping as low as 1.9 percent.
	   ``The market initially welcomed the announcement of the fiscal
measures, but this euphoria proved to be exaggerated,'' said one
Sao Paulo trader.
	   Opposition politicians made it clear they plan to challenge the
measures.
	   ``The package is recessive and unjust,'' said Jose Genonio a
congressman with the opposition Workers' Party. ``We are not going
to negotiate this package, we are going to oppose it all the way.''
	   Ives Gandra Martins, one of Brazil's most respected tax lawyers,
said that by increasing taxes ``Brazil will be swimming against the
tide.''
	   ``While countries like Japan and Korea responded to the crisis
by lowering taxes to reactivate their economies, Brazil is
increasing its taxes,'' he said.
	   Fernando Bezerra, president of the National Confederation of
Industries, said the measures were necessary but admitted they
would result in a ``reduction of economic output, plunging Brazil
into a recession.''
	   The answer, he said was a reduction in interest rates, which
were raised to nearly 50 percent last month in an effort to staunch
capital flight.
	   Interest payments account for more than 80 percent of the budget
deficit, now around dlrs 65 billion, and economists have warned
that unless they come down quickly, the entire austerity plan could
collapse.

Iraq denies VX charge, says resuming inspections possible
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq would be ready to resume the U.N.
weapons inspection program ``provided it leads somewhere,'' a
senior government official said Wednesday.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein,
also rejected assertions by the chief U.N. weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, that Iraq had loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into
missiles.
	   ``We simply haven't done it,'' he said of the allegations.
	   He made the comments in an interview with The Associated Press
and AP Television News two days after Butler submitted a report on
tests by American, French and Swiss laboratories of Iraqi warheads.
	   Traces of VX were found in the tests carried out in the American
laboratories. No VX was detected in Europe although there were
indications that Iraq may have tried to clean the warheads before
they were sent to Europe.
	   ``Nonsense,'' al-Saadi said when asked about the tampering
allegations.
	   Also Wednesday, Iraq rejected a request by U.N. weapons
inspectors to explain the presence of VX on the warheads.
	   The U.N. inspectors are ``intent on procrastination,'' Iraq's
U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said in a letter to the U.N.
Security Council.
	   During the interview, al-Saadi spoke about efforts to resolve
the impasse between Iraq and the United Nations over weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 suspended spot searches by Butler's inspectors.
The United Nations retaliated by stopping periodical reviews of
punitive trade sanctions in place for eight years.
	   Al-Saadi said that ``a whole package is being worked out''
between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``It (negotiation) is still on and we hope it will be fruitful
as it has been in the past,'' he said.
	   Asked if this could lead to a reversal of the Aug. 5 decision,
he said: ``We see nothing wrong in resuming normal working
relations (with U.N. inspectors) provided it leads somewhere.''
	   He repeated Iraq's assertion that previous work by Butler and
his inspectors ``was leading nowhere.'' Iraq has long said that
Butler was dragging his work to prolong the sanctions.
	   Iraq is under sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions bar all trade with Iraq and only allow it limited oil
sales.
	   Al-Saadi said Iraq was gaining sympathy for the plight of its
people under sanctions, adding ``the world is seeing that and not
accepting it.''
	   Asked if there was a fundamental shift in public opinion in
favor of Iraq, he said: ``Indeed, it is perceptible.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that sanctions will only be
lifted when Iraq proves to U.N. weapons inspectors that it has
eliminated its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as
long-range missiles.

Gianluca Vialli scores hat trick in Chelsea's 4-1 win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gianluca Vialli scored a hat trick as holders
Chelsea defeated Premier League leaders Aston Villa 4-1 Wednesday
to reach the fourth round of England's League Cup and hand Villa
its first loss of the season.
	   In another key match featuring a Premier League side, Manchester
United defeated first-division neighbor Bury 2-0 in extra time as
Norway's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored in the 106th and Erik Nevland
added another in the 115th.
	   In other third-round games: Birmingham 1, Wimbledon 2; Crewe 0,
Blackburn 1; Derby 1, Arsenal 2; Leeds 1, Bradford 0; Middlesbrough
2, Everton 3 (extra time).
	   Vialli, with Aston Villa leading 1-0 on a goal by Mark Draper,
scored late in the first half to equalize and then got two more in
the second half as Chelsea dominated the league leaders in a match
before 26,000 at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground in West London.
	   Norway's Tore Andre Flo picked up the other goal for the Blues.
	   In the only sour note for Chelsea, Dennis Wise was sent off on a
red card in the final minutes for a reckless challenge, which
prompted pushing and shoving between both clubs.
	   Aston Villa and Chelsea play again this weekend in the league
with Aston Villa expected to field a slightly stronger side.
	   Manchester United and Bury were tied 0-0 after 90 minutes before
52,495 at Old Trafford, where the Reds fielded a second-string team
without stars like Dwight Yorke, Ryan Giggs, Andy Cole and Peter
Schmeichel.
	   United, saving itself for weekend league play and next week's
play in the Champions League, dominated play as Bury was content to
defend and hope for a minor miracle.
	   At Birmingham, Wimbledon defeated first-division Birmingham 2-1
on two goals by Neal Ardley. In a match between Premier League
sides, Arsenal won 2-1 at Derby with a Derby own-goal by Lee
Carsley and Nelson Vivas' goal giving Arsenal the winning margin.
	   At Leeds, Leeds prevailed 1-0 over Bradford on a goal by
Australian international Harry Kewell.
	   At Crewe, Premier League Blackburn won 1-0 over Crewe with a
goal from Chris Sutton.
	   In Everton's 3-2 win, Middlesbrough and Everton were tied 1-1
after regulation. But Ibrahima Bakayoko got a go-ahead goal in the
102nd minute and Don Hutchison added the winner six minutes later.
Hamilton Ricard scored in the 117th for Middlesbrough's second
goal. 3-2 score.

Supporters of Pinochet extradition critical of London ruling, gov't

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Lawyers trying to extradite Gen. Augusto
Pinochet to Spain criticized a British court's decision to block
the arrest of the former Chilean dictator but said they remained
hopeful that an appeals court would overturn Wednesday's ruling.
	   ``I was very optimistic until today,'' said lawyer Virginia Diaz
who has worked closely on the case. Looking forward to the next
legal steps, Diaz said she held out some hope for an appeal on the
immunity question that is expected to be filed in London on Monday.
	   The High Court in London quashed arrest warrants issued by
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon that had kept Pinochet detained in a
London clinic since Oct. 16. The warrants were a first step toward
extraditing Pinochet to Spain to stand trial for genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   The court ruled that Pinochet could not be prosecuted outside of
Chile for crimes during his 17-year dictatorship, which began in
1973, because he was head of state at the time.
	   Pinochet remains under guard pending the appeal, with a hearing
set for Friday for his application for release on bail.
	   ``We were surprised by the ruling,'' said Diaz, who has worked
closely with Garzon and argues that international law clearly rules
out immunity in cases of crimes against humanity.
	   ``We are not talking about a little bit of corruption, but the
killing, torture and disappearance of thousands of people,'' she
said.
	   Garzon had no immediate comment.
	   Meanwhile, the Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramon de
Miguel expressed the government's ``profound institutional
respect'' for the British legal decision but refused further
comment, the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
	   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
has called for caution on the Pinochet controversy and has always
insisted that it is a purely judicial matter.
	   Left leaning opposition parties have supported the extradition
effort and critizied the British court's decision. ``What happened
in London was shameful,'' said the leader of the United Left Julio
Anguita.
	   The attempt to bring the former dictator to trial in Spain was
also under indirect legal attack via a related discussion in
Spain's National Court.
	   A panel of jurists from the National Court, to which Garzon is
attached, was due to begin discussing Thursday whether crimes such
as genocide that took place outside of Spain are within the
jurisdiction of Spanish judges.
	   For two years Garzon and another National Court judge have been
gathering evidence into the murder, torture and disappearance of
thousands during the military juntas that ruled Chile and Argentina
in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Diaz said she feared the London ruling might influence the
Spanish panel in its decision that is expected Friday.
	   A ruling against Spanish jurisdiction for Chilean crimes would
make the appeal against Wednesday's decision in favor of Pinochet's
immunity difficult to sustain.
	   Also Wednesday, some two thousand human rights activists
gathered in Columbus Square in central Madrid to hold a 24-hour
vigil timed to coincide with the lead up to the National Court's
deliberations.
	   ``I am very hopeful,'' Chilean Dora Carreno said to the crowd in
Columbus Square. ``We have been fighting for 25 years and we are
not going to stop here''

Millions of jobless need social protection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The millions thrown out of work by the Asian
financial crisis need social protection systems because they can't
go back to farms or find temporary jobs in cities, a senior
official of the International Labor Union said Wednesday.
	   Kari Tapiola, the agency's deputy director general, said these
traditional sources of employment have been eroding steadily in the
face of the globalization of the world economy.
	   ``As the Asian crisis has shown, such mechanisms are grossly
inadequate in the face of a major economic disaster,'' Tapiola said
in a speech to a World Bank-International Monetary Fund meeting.
``We need to build innovative and adequate systems of social
protection in countries at all levels of development.''
	   Officials from the U.N. labor organization, the IMF and the bank
met to discuss ways to involve the two international financial
institutions more actively in worker rights issues. Some members of
Congress charge the IMF and the bank do not place sufficient
emphasis on these rights in their rescue packages for crisis-hit
countries.
	   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman said in a joint statement they believe the high-level
dialogue among the three organizations ``on the importance of
advancing core labor standards in the policies, programs and
operations of the international financial institutions is
invaluable.''
	   They welcomed the World Bank's strategy to combat child labor
and the IMF's encouragement of greater dialogue between governments
and labor unions in the fund's financial rescue packages.
	   As possible remedies to help the millions of jobless in Asia,
Tapiola suggested suggested unemployment insurance systems tailored
to the financial capacity of a crisis-hit country, emergency
government job creation programs or income support measures.
	   Tapiola said the Asian financial crisis that later spread to
Russia and looms over Latin America made it indispensable for the
U.N. labor agency, the IMF and the World Bank to find concrete ways
to fight the current financial crisis.
	   He said job creation should be an important element in the
economic programs the IMF and the bank recommend for countries
facing financial difficulties because employment ``is the main
means through which globalization benefits are transmitted to large
numbers of working people and their families.''
	   Tapiola was filling in for Geneva-based ILO Director Michel
Hansenne, who was ill.

Thousands of tourists flee from Hurricane Mitch, but losses low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Hurricane Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; By ISAAC A. LEVI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Some 20,000 tourists have fled Mexico's
luxurious Caribbean resorts and dozens of cruise ships have changed
their itineraries as Hurricane Mitch swirls through some of the
world's best beaches.
	   The huge, slow-moving storm that has affected resorts in
Jamaica, Honduras, Mexico and Cuba, but travel operators say the
bad news came at a good time.
	   ``Thank God it's the low season,'' said Ricardo Hernandez, a
tourism official for Mexico's Quintana Roo state, which includes
the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
	   He said only 10,000 of the 30,000 tourists in the state decided
to stay.
	   Cancun, Mexico's crown jewel in the Caribbean, has probably been
hardest hit by the tourist exodus. Visitors have been leaving in
droves since Sunday, when forecasters said Mitch would hit Cancun
this week.
	   The forecast has become less certain since then, with Mitch
nearly stationary off the coast of Honduras _ right over the
islands that make up Honduras' most popular tourist attractions.
Those islands were incommunicado Wednesday.
	   The two dozen cruise lines that operate in the Caribbean are
accustomed to avoiding hurricanes, and said they didn't expect big
losses because of Mitch.
	   ``We have 13 ships, and four of them had to alter their
itineraries this week,'' said Jennifer de la Cruz, spokeswoman for
Miami-based Carnival Cruise lines. ``Fortunately, the Caribbean is
very big and this was relatively easy to do.''
	   The losses for Mexico's Quintana Roo state, however, could be
high.
	   Cancun, a 13-mile sandbar at the northern tip of the Yucatan
Peninsula, anchors the industry with 153 mostly tony hotels and a
total of 23,700 rooms that house 2.7 million tourists a year. Nine
out of 10 are Americans and Canadians.
	   Tourists spend dlrs 2.7 billion a year in Cancun _ more than a
third of Mexico's average dlrs 7 billion revenue from tourism.
Rooms in Cancun average dlrs 250 a night.

Toronto Star owners make hostile bid for Canadian tabloid chain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The owners of the Toronto Star, Canada's
best-selling newspaper, Wednesday launched a hostile bid to take
over Sun Media Corp., owner of a popular chain of Canadian
tabloids.
	   The bid by Torstar Corp., offering dlrs 748 million (dlrs 486
million U.S.), came a day after Canada's biggest newspaper chain,
Southam Inc., entered the Toronto market with publication of a new
national daily, the National Post.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the Torstar offer from Sun
Media.
	   The National Post is expected to be a major competitor to the
all three of the established Toronto dailies _ the nationally
circulated Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star and the Toronto Sun,
flagship of the Sun chain.
	   Sun Media, Canada's second-largest newspaper chain in terms of
circulation, publishes 15 dailies, including tabloids in Toronto,
Edmonton, Ottawa and Calgary.
	   If successful, Torstar's bid would give it 26 percent of the
average weekly circulation of daily newspapers in Canada. This
compares with the 42 percent for the papers owned by Conrad Black's
Hollinger and Southam groups.
	   Torstar's offer of dlrs 16 Cdn per share is 62 percent higher
than Wednesday's closing price of Sun Media shares. The stock was
up 10 cents on the day at dlrs 9.90 Cdn.
	   ``This initiative is good for both companies,'' Torstar
president David Galloway told a news conference. ``It strengthens
the long-term position of two of the most distinctive voices on the
Canadian print media scene.''
	   If the takeover succeeds, the Sun tabloids would operate as a
separate division of Torstar, he said.
	   The Toronto Star's daily circulation is about 450,000, while the
Toronto Sun's is about 240,000.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ More than a month after elections
ended the rule of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, leaders of a
four-party coalition announced Wednesday they had agreed on
formation of a new government.
	   Party leaders signed the pact Wednesday evening at the
Bratislava mayor's residence after agreeing on the distribution of
Cabinet posts.
	   In balloting last month, the coalition won 93 of the 150 seats
in the Slovak parliament. Meciar's government will resign Thursday,
when the new parliament convenes for the first time.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, the leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
was expected to succeed Meciar as prime minister.
	   No names were officially announced on Wednesday, but Dzurinda
said that the first session of the new parliament would be held
Thursday and he hoped the new government would be officially
installed at that time.
	   The Democratic Coalition party will receive eight other posts,
including the foreign ministry. The second largest member of the
coalition, the Democratic Left, will get six ministries.
	   Three posts were to go to the Hungarian Coalition party, which
represents the country's ethnic Hungarian minority, while he
smallest member, the Party of Civic Understanding, ended up with
two posts.

Star gymnast declared an adult
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's developments; Moceanu declared an adult &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu was declared an
adult Wednesday in a settlement giving her financial independence
from her parents.
	   The 17-year-old high school senior, a gold medalist at the 1996
Atlanta Games, has been trying to find out where all her earnings
have gone. She claims her father squandered the money.
	   Her parents, Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu, changed their minds
and chose not to challenge their daughter's bid to become a legal
adult. State District Judge John Montgomery approved the
arrangement.
	   Jimmy Phillips Jr., a lawyer for the gymnast's parents, declined
to comment on their actions.
	   Moceanu ran away from home more than a week ago and filed a
request to be declared an adult.
	   She said earnings in her trust fund bankrolled unauthorized
risky investments and a dlrs 4 million gym bearing her name. Her
lawyers believe the trust is structured so she won't obtain control
over the assets until she turns 35, lawyer Roy Moore said.
	   As a legal adult, the gymnast can begin to demand information
about the trust, including records of expenditures. It's unclear
how much money, if any, remains in the trust.
	   Her parents withdrew their opposition to their daughter's
request on Tuesday after meeting with her in a deposition.
	   ``The parties have met amongst themselves and as a family unit
have resolved their differences,'' the family said in a statement
Tuesday.
	   Last week, Moceanu's parents asked a judge to dismiss their
daughter's lawsuit and a temporary restraining order she obtained
against them. Under the settlement, all restraining orders have
been removed.
	   Moceanu ran away Oct. 18, a day after her father threatened to
have her coach deported to Romania. She said her flight was the
result of months of arguments sparked by questions about her
earnings.
	   ``I want whatever I have earned to be under my control so I know
how my earnings are being used, and I want to be able to train and
compete in the sport I love for the right reason _ because I love
it, not because my father tells me I have to make more money,'' she
said last week.
	   Her parents said in court documents their daughter's coaches and
a friend had convinced her to run away.
	   But the gymnast insisted no one influenced her, saying she
simply wanted answers about how the money she earned in her
seven-year career was being spent.
	   Coincidentally, the court handling Moceanu's case is the same
one that took an identical request from then underaged gymnast Mary
Lou Retton.
	   In 1985, the then 17-year-old Retton asked the same 309th
District Court to declare her an adult so she could invest earnings
following her 1984 Olympic gold-medal performance.
	   Retton's parents, Lois and Ronnie Retton, never opposed their
daughter's request and it was granted without question four days
after the petition was filed.

ANC will file court case to stop criticism in apartheid rights

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The African National Congress,
which led the fight against white rule, and apartheid's last
president struck back Wednesday against a human rights panel that
implicated both in apartheid-era abuses.
	   President Nelson Mandela's ANC said it was going to court to
block the Truth and Reconciliation Commission from releasing a
report that names it as a violator of human rights during its
struggle against apartheid.
	   Hours earlier, former President F.W. de Klerk filed a lawsuit
that forced the panel to strike a finding that he was an
``accessory after the fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.
	   The moves came a day before the commission was to release its
watershed report showed just how difficult reconciliation was in
this country four years after the fall of apartheid.
	   Commission officials said they had no immediate plans to cancel
the release of the report, planned as a solemn ceremony in which
former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu hands it over to Mandela in
Pretoria, the capital.
	   Tutu, the panel's chairman, was saddened by the prospect of the
ANC court action.
	   ``A pall hangs over most of us because we believe that this
process deserved a glorious ending and now we are speculating as to
what will happen next,'' he said at a media gathering Wednesday
night in Pretoria.
	   One panel investigator, Cocky Mpshe, said that if the ANC
succeeded in winning a court order, it would probably mean the
whole report would be blocked, South African Press Association
reported.
	   ANC leaders were expected to file their appeal in the early
morning hours local time in Cape Town, officials said.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who runs the country's day-to-day
affairs and is expected to succeed Mandela after next year's
elections, backed the court move, said Thenjiwe Mtintso, the
party's deputy secretary-general. Mbeki is president of the ANC.
	   The commission -- created with the ANC's blessing -- was charged
with promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid's horrors.
It has held hearings around the country for more than two years,
listening to victims and perpetrators seeking amnesty.
	   The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South
Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race
elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral
condemnations and could recommend individual prosecutions.
	   From the beginning, it angered many whites who saw it as an
instrument to punish them, and many blacks who feared amnesty
provisions would allow apartheid's perpetrators to escape.
	   Wednesday's events showed how strong the divisions remain.
	   The ANC had expressed outrage that the commission would find it
guilty of ``gross violations of human rights,'' saying it was
engaged in a just war against the evils of apartheid. To condemn it
would ``criminalize the whole liberation struggle,'' said Mtintso.
She said the commission sent a letter Wednesday morning rejecting
the ANC's appeal for last-minute revisions.
	   According to leaked findings, the commission found the ANC
guilty of planting mines in rural areas, executing enemy agents,
blurring the line between military and civilian targets and
fomenting political violence.
	   The ANC move ``must have been triggered by the TRC decision
taken on de Klerk,'' said Mdu Lembede, a commission spokesman.
``When they saw de Klerk do this to us, and that we didn't have
time to respond, they took advantage of us,'' he said.
	   De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for
bringing an end to the racist system, sued in Cape Town to stop the
report's release.
	   He challenged its finding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation, which housed anti-apartheid
organizations.
	   The finding could have opened him up to prosecution because de
Klerk did not seek amnesty.
	   Tutu, the panel's chairman, said the commission would delete de
Klerk's name because it needed time to prepare to fight the legal
challenge. That apparently was enough for de Klerk's lawyers to
agree to a postponement of the case, which then was scheduled for a
hearing March 4.
	   ``It upsets me deeply. We have been scrupulously fair to Mr. de
Klerk,'' Tutu said in a statement.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appear
after all the hoo-ha has died down.''
	   Legal threats have led to fewer individuals being named as
rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported
Wednesday.
	   Tutu responded that more than 400 people had been given a chance
to respond, but only 15 argued themselves out of the report.
	   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know about the
roles of former law and order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Johan van
der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to tell police.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, the
two were already applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter.

Tour Championship to decide everything but money title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Jim Furyk didn't even bother to do the math. He
simply considered the year of David Duval, and all of a sudden his
long-shot odds of overtaking him on the money list got even longer.
	   That's not to say he doesn't think he can win the dlrs 4 million
Tour Championship, which starts Thursday on historic and
refurbished East Lake Golf Club. He just doesn't see Duval
finishing at the bottom of the pack in the 30-player field.
	   ``To come to the Tour Championship like this, pretty much have
the money title wrapped up, is kind of unheard of,'' Furyk said.
``It hasn't happened for a long while. I think that's pretty
impressive.''
	   The Tour Championship is a perk for the top 30 players on the
money list. It has been criticized by some in the past for the
prize money being too top-heavy _ dlrs 720,000 to the winner. With
four good rounds, a player who has had a solid year could win the
money title over someone who has played superbly from start to
finish.
	   Unless that someone is Duval.
	   He has won four times this year, one tournament in every season,
and already has a Tour-record dlrs 2.4 million in earnings. A
victory this week would make him golf's first dlrs 3 million man
and the only the second player since 1980 to win five tournaments
in a year (Nick Price won five in 1994).
	   ``It's been a wonderful year of golf for me,'' Duval said. ``I
will never view it in any other way. There's nothing you can
negative about it.''
	   That hasn't taken all of the drama out of the Tour Championship.
	   Still at stake is the PGA Tour player of the year award, voted
on by the players. Most players over the past few weeks are leaning
toward Mark O'Meara and his two major championships, although they
concede a victory by Duval this week could give them something more
to consider.
	   Duval is also locked in a race with Tiger Woods for the lowest
scoring average. Woods, who has won just one time this year but has
13 finishes in the top 10, has a narrow lead and Duval likely would
have to finish four strokes ahead at the end of the week.
	   Not surprisingly, Woods says he would rather win the scoring
title and Duval believes the money title is more important.
	   The biggest tournament within the tournament is the battle to
make the Presidents Cup teams. Duval, Woods, Furyk, O'Meara, Justin
Leonard, Phil Mickelson and Davis Love III have already secured a
spot on the team.
	   With a dlrs 4 million purse, and dollar amounts doubled this
year, every American in the field except Bob Estes, Scott Verplank
and Tom Watson still has an outside shot of making the team.
	   The irony of it all is that a tournament in which the rich get
richer is taking place on the home course of the late Bobby Jones,
the greatest amateur of them all.
	   East Lake, site of the 1963 Ryder Cup, had fallen into disrepair
when Atlanta developer Tom Cousins took on a project to revitalize
the neighborhood and restore the course.
	   Duval used to play East Lake when he was at Georgia Tech. The
greens would be in good shape every now and then, but the fairways
were always battered, the streets unsafe.
	   ``I certainly don't remember these houses right here on the road
being that nice,'' he said.
	   He certainly doesn't recall the course being this difficult.
	   Half of the 30-player field has won major championships, and
East Lake already has given them the feel of one _ greens that were
running close to 12 on the Stimpmeter on Wednesday, one fairway
that Furyk measured at 21 yards (19 meters) wide, and unrelenting
rough.
	   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Singh, who found the trees of
Sahalee much more forgiving. ``It's probably the hardest rough I've
ever played. It can get you really cheesed off. You can be only
100, 150 yards from the green and you can't advance the ball more
than 50 yards.''
	   And if that's not enough, East Lake has converted two par-5s
into par-4s _ the 480-yard (436-meter) fifth hole, and the 469-yard
(427-meter) 10th. And just like Congressional, site of the 1997
U.S. Open, it closes with a dastardly par-3 that plays 232 yards
(211 meters) and is guarded by a pond.
	   ``Very interesting,'' Woods said of the 18th. ``I had to smoke a
2-iron. I just landed on the front edge.''
	   With this kind of course, this kind of history and this kind of
field, the Tour Championship could turn out to be very interesting,
indeed. Even if the money title is a foregone conclusion.

Mangrum elected to Hall of Fame on PGA Tour ballot

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Lloyd Mangrum, who earned two purple hearts in
World War II and won the U.S. Open in 1946, was the only player
elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame on the PGA Tour ballot.
	   Mangrum received 75 percent of the vote, the exact amount
required for election. The only other player who came close was
Greg Norman at 65.8 percent.
	   Mangrum, who died in 1973 at 59, will be inducted March 22 along
with Seve Ballesteros, who was elected last year on the
international ballot.
	   Along with winning the U.S. Open in a 36-hole playoff over Byron
Nelson and Vic Ghezzi, Mangrum won 35 other PGA Tour events. But he
was often overlooked in a post-World War II era that featured
Nelson, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and Jimmy Demaret.
	   He turned pro in 1937 and won his first tournament in 1940
before the war interrupted his career. Mangrum was part of the
Allied Invasion Forces on D-Day.
	   ``I don't suppose that any of the pro or amateur golfers who
were combat soldiers, Marines or sailors will soon be able to think
of a three-putt green as one of the bad troubles in life,'' Mangrum
said after the war.
	   It was his putter that set him apart during a career in which he
won the money title in 1951 and was chosen to six Ryder Cup teams.
	   ``He was a cool cat on the course,'' Nelson once said. ``He
played with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth, and
he was a wonderful putter.''
	   Said Jack Burke Jr.: ``He was tough, unrelenting, exactly like
Hogan.''
	   Finally, Mangrum will join Hogan, Nelson and the other greats
from his era in the Hall of Fame.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SEASON EXTENDED: &LR;  This will be the final year of the Tour
Championship as it relates to the money title and other awards that
come down to the last official tournament of the year. That's
because next year, it won't be the last one.
	   With the World Golf Championships starting next year, the final
event will be the American Express Championship at Valderrama, a
72-hole stroke play event with a dlrs 5 million purse.
	   Does that mean the Tour Championship will be diminished?
	   ``As long as the event counts on our money list, yes,'' Jim
Furyk said.
	   ``I'm not excited about that,'' David Duval said of a trip to
Spain for a tournament will have more money at stake than the Tour
Championship.
	   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem doesn't see it that way.
	   ``One of the advantages we see in the positioning of the World
Golf Championships ... is to create a blockbuster two weeks,''
Finchem said. ``Our objective is to create a lot of enthusiasm
during that two-week block, and get the fans to understand it.''
	   If money creates enthusiasm, that shouldn't be a problem. A
player can win the final two tournaments of the season and earn
dlrs 1.62 million.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WATTS IN AMERICA: &LR;  Four great days at Royal Birkdale earned
Brian Watts his ticket home.
	   Watts has decided to play the PGA Tour full-time next year,
having won enough money from his runner-up finish to Mark O'Meara
in the British Open to easily make the top 125 on the PGA Tour
money list.
	   ``As an American, you dream of playing on the U.S. PGA Tour, and
I have the chance again to make that happen,'' Watts said.
	   The former NCAA champion from Oklahoma State, Watts failed to
earn his card at Q-school and went to Asia where he turned his game
_ and fortunes _ around, winning 11 times in Japan since 1994.
	   In the Open this year, Watts was the 54-hole leader, then got
into a four-hole playoff with what might be remembered as the best
shot of 1998 _ an awkward stance from the bunker at the 18th hole
to within a foot to save par.
	   Watts said it was difficult to leave behind his Japanese
sponsors, but playing the PGA Tour will make it easier to spend
more time with his wife and 1-year-old son.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; A LOOK AT THE GOODS: &LR;  After the first round of the Disney
Classic last week in Orlando, Florida, David Duval spent the
afternoon with Mark O'Meara and was going through his house when
they came to the trophy case.
	   ``He said, 'Well, I've got the claret jug and the Masters
trophy,' '' Duval said. ``I said, `Yeah, just rub it in.' ''
	   Duval was leading the Masters until a bogey at the 16th hole.
O'Meara won with a 20-foot (7-meter) birdie putt at the 72nd, a
similar putt to one that Duval just missed ahead of him.
	   O'Meara said Duval wanted to hold the claret jug from his
British Open victory.
	   ``He didn't want to touch the Masters trophy,'' O'Meara said.

Ariane 4 carries two satellites into orbit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A week after the successful final test launch of
the new Ariane 5 rocket, an Ariane 4 rocket on Wednesday blasted
into space with two American telecommunications satellites.
	   It was the 113th mission by the European rocket, counting last
week's Ariane 5 launch.
	   The Ariane blasted off at 7:15 p.m. local time (2215 GMT) from
Guiana Space Center near Kourou, French Guiana, on the northeastern
end of South America.
	   Built by Alcatel Space Industries for the U.S. company
WorldSpace Corp., the AfriStar satellite, placed over Congo, is the
first of three to be put into orbit for the company by Ariane.
	   The GE-5 was built by the German company Daimler Benz Aerospace
for the U.S. company GE American. Placed above the equator, it will
beam television signals to the United States for 12 years.
	   Beginning next year, the Ariane 5, the most powerful in the
European series of unmanned rockets, will gradually replace the
Ariane 4. Ariane 5 is twice as powerful as the Ariane 4, and is
aimed at maintaining the lead of Arianespace, the commercial arm of
the European Space Agency, in the world's commercial launch market.
	   The first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and a launch a year ago
was less than perfect, making last Wednesday's final test launch
critical.

Report: Intelligence agency not involved in Mossad incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada's national security agency knew nothing
about the use of Canadian passports by Israeli intelligence agents
engaged in a botched assassination attempt, says a report released
Wednesday.
	   There was also no evidence to suggest that the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service had cooperated with the Israel's Mossad spy
agency in its attempt to kill Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal
in Jordan.
	   A review committee that periodically audits CSIS operations
studied the September 1997 incident in the wake of allegations that
officials looked the other way while Canadian passports were used
by foreign agents.
	   The committee confirmed that the passports two Mossad spies were
carrying were forgeries. CSIS specialists also speculated that
Mossad has probably produced large numbers of forged Canadian
passports.
	   Shortly after the assassination attempt, Ottawa received an
apology and assurances from Israel's foreign minister that steps
would be taken to stop the use of Canadian passports.
	   ``They've got too many other possibilities,'' said Alistair
Hensler, former assistant director of CSIS operations and analysis.
``Canadian (passports) were good ... but there are others I'm sure
that would do just as well and they're quite capable of producing
those as well.''

Foreign Minister: Miss Croatia dispute caused political damage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS story throughout to RAISE that Sehovic will represent
Croatia this year and add details and background; NEW to some
points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The controversy surrounding this year's
Miss Croatia beauty contest ended Wednesday with a compromise _ the
Muslim woman who had been stripped of her title will go to the Miss
World contest this year, while her replacement will go next year.
	   Lejla Sehovic, a Muslim who was crowned Miss Croatia on Oct. 11,
only to have her title revoked amid a national scandal weeks later,
said Wednesday that she accepted the organizer's offer to represent
Croatia at this year's Miss World pageant in the Seychelles.
	   Sehovic, 22, had no other immediate comment.
	   Sehovic was replaced in a second round of voting, after media
reports said event organizers worried that the public and the
nationalist government would not accept a Muslim representing
Catholic-dominated Croatia.
	   Ivana Petkovic, 17, who won the second round and has no Muslim
heritage, will represent the country at next year's contest,
according to the compromise.
	   Sehovic, media and some human rights organizations had insisted
that she was ousted just because she's a Muslim.
	   But the organizer of the Miss Croatia pageant, Milan Seckovic,
denied any political implications and said the second vote was
taken simply because of balloting problems in the first round.
	   Late Monday, he told Croatian media that he was suggesting that
Sehovic be Croatia's Miss World candidate this year, and Petkovic
next year. Sehovic, who has threatened legal action over the
pageant results, accepted the offer on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Croatia's foreign minister criticized the contest's
organizers for the controversy and denied any government
involvement. The foreign minister, Mate Granic, was the first
government official to speak out on the event.
	   Some media reports have suggested that nationalists within the
government initiated Sehovic's removal, because they couldn't stand
to have a Muslim representing Croatia.
	   ``Events surrounding the Miss Croatia contest have done a huge
political damage to Croatia,'' Granic said, denying that the
government had anything to do with the contest. ``The contest
organizer bear the immediate responsibility.''
	   The vast majority of Croatia's 4.7 million people are Roman
Catholics. Muslims make a small minority. Relations between Croatia
and neighboring Bosnia have been strained since Croatia helped the
Bosnian Croats during their 1993-94 war with the Muslims.
	   The beauty contest has been highly popular with Croats in recent
years as a diversion from daily concerns: war, politics and low
wages.

A marathoner's hard run from poverty to riches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When Josia Thugwane won the 1996 Olympic
marathon, the tiny South African couldn't read or write or sign his
name. He lived in a tin shack without electricity or water. His job
was cleaning out kitchens and toilets in a mine.
	   Now Thugwane has become the flagbearer for his country's
athletes.
	   He has learned to read and write in English and Zulu and has
moved to a comfortable suburb in Johannesburg. He no longer works
in the mine and can support himself and his family.
	   ``From the day he won the Olympic Games to the next Olympics (in
2000), he wanted to make a certain amount of money,'' Jacques
Malan, Thugwane's coach and manager, said Wednesday. ``We're right
on target. Half the money is in.''
	   Malan would not disclose the target figure, but said it was in
seven figures.
	   The tremendous changes have been almost overwhelming for the
5-foot-2, 99-pound (45-kilogram) Thugwane, especially since not
everything has gone smoothly.
	   After his surprising Olympic victory, neighbors threatened to
rob him, thinking he had returned to South Africa a rich man. In
January 1997, he was hospitalized after being assaulted by another
driver who thought Thugwane was trying to run him off the road.
	   Those conflicts came after Thugwane had been shot in the face in
March 1996, when he was the victim of a carjacking. That left him
with a one-inch scar on his chin and an injured back.
	   Thugwane said Wednesday he does not want to talk about them any
longer because they are ``bad memories.'' He wants to look ahead
because his life is progressing at a pace he never could have
imagined before winning the gold medal by three seconds over Lee
Bong-ju of South Korea in the closest marathon finish in the Games'
history.
	   He is a hot commodity on the marathon circuit, with promoters
begging him to run because of the prestige he lends to a race.
Since Atlanta, he has finished third at the 1997 London Marathon in
a then-personal best of 2 hours, 8 minutes, 6 seconds. He won the
1997 Fukuoka Marathon in Japan in another career-best 2:07:28 and
he dropped out of this year's London Marathon after 10 miles.
	   Thugwane also won the Great Northern Run half-marathon Oct. 4 at
Newcastle, England, in a quick 1:02:32.
	   On Sunday, he will run the New York City Marathon for the second
time, and his performance at Fukuoka makes him the fastest
marathoner in the field of approximately 30,000.
	   He first ran New York in 1995, but dropped out between miles 21
and 22 when his legs cramped and he wound up in a hospital.
	   ``It was sad,'' said Anne Roberts, the elite coordinator for the
race.
	   ``In 1995, it was very difficult,'' Thugwane said. ``It was cold
and rainy, my legs were bothering me and all of my body felt tired.
Now, I am in the same shape as I was in Fukuoka.''
	   For the past nine weeks, he has trained in altitude in
Albuquerque, New Mexico and thinks he will make up for his poor
showing three years ago in New York.
	   He is a proud man. He is proud of the progress he has made in
learning English and Zulu since April 1997 from a teacher who comes
to his home regularly.
	   He is proud that his four children can attend school in South
Africa, something he could not do because he was forced to work as
a child on his paternal grandmother's farm after his parents
divorced when he was 6 months old.
	   He is proud that he is no longer illiterate, that he is able to
write his name without hesitation or embarrassment. He is proud
that he no longer has to clean toilets to make a living or trek a
half-mile down the road to get water for his family. And he is
proud that he can afford a house with five bedrooms, a pool and a
garage.
	   ``Everything is OK now,'' he said. ``I'm happy. Very happy.''

U.S. aid official says humanitarian crisis averted in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After several days touring Kosovo's
devastated mountain villages, a top U.S. aid official said
Wednesday that a humanitarian catastrophe in the troubled province
had been averted.
	   ``We had anticipated thousands of deaths from exposure and
illness when the snow came,'' said Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency
for International Development. ``Now, I don't think we will see any
deaths.''
	   Parmer spent several days touring Kosovo's ravaged villages and
speaking with refugees and international observers. He said the
number of ethnic Albanian refugees living in the woods without
shelter had dropped from 50,000 in early September when he last
visited, to about 10,000.
	   Many of the estimated 300,000 people who fled their homes when
Serbs began their offensive against the province's ethnic-Albanian
majority in February have returned to villages. Most are living
with friends or relatives and some have gone home.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees echoed
Parmer's remarks.
	   ``We have been saying that if people do not come down from the
hills, there will be a catastrophe,'' said Fernando del Mundo. ``We
now have evidence that tractors full of people are coming back.''
	   During a convoy ride Tuesday through the Pagarusha area, about
30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital,
Parmer expressed amazement at how few refugees were living in a
valley.
	   ``There used to be about 30,000 people in this area,'' Parmer
said.
	   In Malisevo in central Kosovo, a refugee seeing his home for the
first time in three months told Parmer that relief crews brought
supplies to him and others in the woods.
	   ``They gave us flour, oil, sugar, blankets, mattresses and a
stove,'' said 48-year-old Isuf Mazredaj, inspecting the ransacked
dwelling full of broken furniture, garbage and clothes strewn
about. ``But it is never enough.''
	   Parmer said international agencies planned to continue handing
out food and medicine, but would focus on helping refugees rebuild
their homes, many of which were shelled and vandalized by Serb
soldiers.
	   The United States has provided about dlrs 49 million in aid
since the Serb crackdown began, Parmer said.
	   Prior to the Oct. 12 accord between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Serb police frequently
blocked aid convoys trying to reach isolated villages. Now, most
are getting through.

Tour Championship to decide everything but money title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Jim Furyk didn't even bother to do the math. He
simply considered the year of David Duval, and all of a sudden his
long-shot odds of overtaking him on the money list got even longer.
	   That's not to say he doesn't think he can win the dlrs 4 million
Tour Championship, which starts Thursday on historic and
refurbished East Lake Golf Club. He just doesn't see Duval
finishing at the bottom of the pack in the 30-player field.
	   ``To come to the Tour Championship like this, pretty much have
the money title wrapped up, is kind of unheard of,'' Furyk said.
``It hasn't happened for a long while. I think that's pretty
impressive.''
	   The Tour Championship is a perk for the top 30 players on the
money list. It has been criticized by some in the past for the
prize money being too top-heavy _ dlrs 720,000 to the winner. With
four good rounds, a player who has had a solid year could win the
money title over someone who has played superbly from start to
finish.
	   Unless that someone is Duval.
	   He has won four times this year, one tournament in every season,
and already has a Tour-record dlrs 2.4 million in earnings. A
victory this week would make him golf's first dlrs 3 million man
and the only the second player since 1980 to win five tournaments
in a year (Nick Price won five in 1994).
	   ``It's been a wonderful year of golf for me,'' Duval said. ``I
will never view it in any other way. There's nothing you can
negative about it.''
	   That hasn't taken all of the drama out of the Tour Championship.
	   Still at stake is the PGA Tour player of the year award, voted
on by the players. Most players over the past few weeks are leaning
toward Mark O'Meara and his two major championships, although they
concede a victory by Duval this week could give them something more
to consider.
	   Duval is also locked in a race with Tiger Woods for the lowest
scoring average. Woods, who has won just one time this year but has
13 finishes in the top 10, has a narrow lead and Duval likely would
have to finish four strokes ahead at the end of the week.
	   Not surprisingly, Woods says he would rather win the scoring
title and Duval believes the money title is more important.
	   The biggest tournament within the tournament is the battle to
make the Presidents Cup teams. Duval, Woods, Furyk, O'Meara, Justin
Leonard, Phil Mickelson and Davis Love III have already secured a
spot on the team.
	   With a dlrs 4 million purse, and dollar amounts doubled this
year, every American in the field except Bob Estes, Scott Verplank
and Tom Watson still has an outside shot of making the team.
	   The irony of it all is that a tournament in which the rich get
richer is taking place on the home course of the late Bobby Jones,
the greatest amateur of them all.
	   East Lake, site of the 1963 Ryder Cup, had fallen into disrepair
when Atlanta developer Tom Cousins took on a project to revitalize
the neighborhood and restore the course.
	   Duval used to play East Lake when he was at Georgia Tech. The
greens would be in good shape every now and then, but the fairways
were always battered, the streets unsafe.
	   ``I certainly don't remember these houses right here on the road
being that nice,'' he said.
	   He certainly doesn't recall the course being this difficult.
	   Half of the 30-player field has won major championships, and
East Lake already has given them the feel of one _ greens that were
running close to 12 on the Stimpmeter on Wednesday, one fairway
that Furyk measured at 21 yards (19 meters) wide, and unrelenting
rough.
	   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Singh, who found the trees of
Sahalee much more forgiving. ``It's probably the hardest rough I've
ever played. It can get you really cheesed off. You can be only
100, 150 yards from the green and you can't advance the ball more
than 50 yards.''
	   And if that's not enough, East Lake has converted two par-5s
into par-4s _ the 480-yard (436-meter) fifth hole, and the 469-yard
(427-meter) 10th. And just like Congressional, site of the 1997
U.S. Open, it closes with a dastardly par-3 that plays 232 yards
(211 meters) and is guarded by a pond.
	   ``Very interesting,'' Woods said of the 18th. ``I had to smoke a
2-iron. I just landed on the front edge.''
	   With this kind of course, this kind of history and this kind of
field, the Tour Championship could turn out to be very interesting,
indeed. Even if the money title is a foregone conclusion.

NBA lockout reverberates off court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic NBA REVENUES &QL; 
 &UR; By SKIP WOLLENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The economic effects of the National Basketball
Association impasse are dribbling over to restaurants, sports
merchandise stores and TV and cable networks.
	   The first regular-season NBA game would have been played Tuesday
if not for the labor dispute. The basketball league has canceled
games at least through Nov. 30.
	   The NBA and its 29 teams had expected to generate nearly dlrs 2
billion in revenue this year through tickets, broadcast rights and
advertising signs, not counting its share of dlrs 3 billion-plus in
NBA-licensed merchandise sales worldwide.
	   Local economies could lose hundreds of millions of dollars more.
	   ``It's always who's hot, and right now nobody's hot, nobody's
playing ball, so nobody's buying,'' said assistant manager Sean
Estes at Galyan's Trading Co., a sporting goods store in Carmel,
Indiana, near Indianapolis.
	   Industry insiders said there has been a 50 percent drop in
retailer orders of NBA merchandise since the lockout began in July.
	   The Charlotte Hornets pump close to dlrs 100 million a year into
the city economy, said John Connaughton, an economics professor at
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
	   In Chicago, where the Bulls and Michael Jordan have won six NBA
titles, Chamber of Commerce executives estimate each home game
generates dlrs 8 million in local spending. NBA teams each play 41
regular-season games at home.
	   Some say such estimates are overblown.
	   ``People find other things to do,'' said Allen Sanderson, a
University of Chicago sports economist. ``If the Bulls were not
here, people would spend the same amount of time drinking beer and
going to the movies.''
	   The Charlotte Coliseum Authority, which manages the Hornets'
arena, imposed a hiring freeze and froze the salaries of its 200
full-time employees.
	   At The Loon Cafe a block from Minneapolis' Target Center,
manager Tom Matoushek plans to use seven or eight fewer busboys and
cooks on Timberwolves game nights, when the place is normally
packed two hours before the tipoff.
	   Cable channels TBS and TNT plan to run movies like ``Rain Man''
and ``The Delta Force'' in place of basketball. Executives say
advertisers are sitting tight, hoping games can be added to the TV
schedule once the season starts.
	   Some regional sports networks are planning to run classic NBA
games once a week until the season starts.
	   Coca-Cola, however, is sticking with an NBA-related Sprite
promotion offering dlrs 25,000 top prizes (roughly the average
daily NBA salary, Coke points out). The Sprite ads feature Grant
Hill of the Detroit Pistons and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles
Lakers giving irreverent advice on how to spend the money.
	   Sneaker companies are pushing ahead with new basketball shoes
tied to NBA stars. Adidas Americas is bringing out its second model
endorsed by the Lakers' Bryant, and Nike is introducing its 14th
Air Jordan.
	   ``The game is quite alive despite the lack of NBA games,'' said
Nike representative Vizhier Mooney.
	   The Topps Co., however, cut its preseason NBA card series in
half. Baseball and hockey strikes have shown ``you need having the
players out there promoting the cards by competing,'' spokesman
Marty Appel said.

Antarctic explorers repeat ski trek to South Pole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Subs 11th graf to update with team flown out of New Zealand &QL; 
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ In 1911, after trekking almost
1,750 miles (2,800 kilometers) across the Antarctic wilderness and
finding they were a month too late to be the first people at the
South Pole, English explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his team died
just a few days walk from journey's end.
	   Eighty-seven years later, three men on skis will begin their own
Antarctic odyssey Thursday, trying to recreate and complete Scott's
trek.
	   Expedition leader Peter Hillary, the son of Everest conqueror
and polar explorer Sir Edmund Hillary, says technological advances
will make their journey easier than that of Scott's ill-fated
expedition.
	   The New Zealander, with Australian companions Eric Philips and
Jon Muir, plans to cross some places _ on Shackleton Glacier, for
example _ where no one is thought to have been before.
	   ``Many aspects of this expedition are no different from ...
Scott's expedition at the beginning of the century. We're
man-hauling on skis,'' Hillary said this week.
	   Scott and his men died of starvation and weakness only a few
miles (kilometers) from a supply dump and only days from journey's
end.
	   ``Look, it will be a long, hard, cold and painful journey in
many ways, but it also will be an extraordinary adventure,''
Hillary said.
	   ``I mean to complete Scott's journey and to make the first
complete ascent of the Shackleton Glacier ... and hopefully to have
a really extraordinary time doing it makes it all worthwhile to
me.''
	   Hillary followed in his father's footsteps in climbing Mount
Everest. Sir Edmund, with Nepalese sherpa Tenzing Norgay, was the
first to reach the mountain's summit, and was knighted for his
conquest.
	   Hillary Sr. also made Antarctic history when he led a farm
tractor-and-sled expedition to the South Pole and back 40 years
ago.
	   The team was Thursday airlifted out of Christchurch to New
Zealand's Scott Base at McMurdo Sound, the starting point of their
journey. Antarctic weather will determine when they leave Scott
Base.
	   Preparations for what Hillary describes as the ``journey to end
all journeys'' have been under way for 18 months.
	   The men will use specially designed plastic sleds that are
lighter than the more commonly used fiberglass sleds, and the
wooden sleds used by Scott.
	   Each man will tow 330 pounds (150 kilograms) of food, fuel and
equipment on the sleds, and the expedition will be without the help
of outside support such as food drops.
	   Steerable kites, capable of propelling the men at 9 miles an
hour (15 kph), would be used to help speed their progress.
	   ``On the way back we hope to be able to fly the kites and
actually ski-sail most of the way back to the coast.''
	   The team will also take cameras and a satellite phone.
	   Hillary and the two Australians expect to reach the South Pole
from Scott Base about Christmas Day, after some 60 days traveling.
	   Hillary said that in the name of self-sufficiency, they would
have to ``avoid the temptation'' to share a tipple or two with
scientists at a small U.S. base at the South Pole.
	   Instead, the three would plant a small flag and turn around
again. Satellite phone calls home will be their only Christmas
treat.
	   Even a bottle of heartwarming whisky has been scratched from the
provisions list.
	   ``It's got to the stage now where, in an effort to keep down our
weight, we're removing the labels on clothing,'' Hillary said.

Lawyer: DiMaggio better after `we were fearful for his life'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARV SCHNEIDER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio will be hospitalized for three more
weeks with pneumonia and a lung infection even though his lawyer
said Wednesday he had improved from earlier this month when ``we
were fearful for his life.''
	   DiMaggio's lawyer and friend, Morris Engelberg, said he has been
with him every day since the Hall of Famer was admitted to Memorial
Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida on Oct. 12.
	   DiMaggio had been in intensive care with severe breathing
problems, and had his lungs drained at least twice, Engelberg told
The Associated Press.
	   ``Look, he will be 84 next month and he has pneumonia,'' he
said. ``It was very, very serious. We were fearful for his life.''
	   It was the first time Engelberg acknowledged that the life of
the Yankees' great had been in danger.
	   He said he got the first good sign in more than two weeks when
he visited DiMaggio at 5 a.m. Wednesday.
	   ``He was sitting in a chair watching the news on television when
I walked in,'' Engelberg said.
	   ``And I don't mind telling you that I was relieved because when
I walked into his room in intensive care, and he wasn't there, I
thought he had died.
	   ``But they had moved him to another room, and there he was,
watching television. I hugged him.''
	   DiMaggio ``was breathing much better this morning, he was out of
bed and his eyes were open,'' Engelberg said.
	   The hospital has refused to discuss DiMaggio's condition since
he was admitted, citing orders from Engeng named for DiMaggio, who has been instrumental in
raising funds for the unit.
	   Engelberg has been unyielding in barring access to DiMaggio,
even blocking delivery of food from one of the slugger's favorite
Italian restaurants.
	   A woman at the hospital switchboard during the weekend even
denied DiMaggio was a patient there.
	   DiMaggio's efforts to maintain his privacy were well known long
before he was hospitalized.
	   ``Don't say I'm a recluse,'' he said in an interview on his 80th
birthday. ``I get around a lot.''
	   He was honored at Yankee Stadium on the final day of the regular
season, and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner insisted that
DiMaggio throw out the ceremonial first ball at the World Series
opener in New York. But DiMaggio was hospitalized five days before
the game, and Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa did the honors
instead.

Ramon Martinez takes release in stride
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ENRIQUE ROJAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ For the first time in
14 years, Ramon Martinez won't be at Dodgertown in Vero Beach next
February. But the injured Dominican pitcher says he'll be back.
	   ``I'm not done. I can still be a star pitcher in the Major
Leagues and I'm going to show it,'' Martinez said a day after the
Los Angeles Dodgers declined to pick up his 1999 contract option
worth dlrs 5.6 million.
	   Martinez, a 30-year-old right-hander who has been the Dodgers'
No. 1 starter the last several years, was 7-3 with a 2.83 ERA in 15
starts last season before undergoing surgery to repair a torn
rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder June 30.
	   Martinez held opposing batters to a .206 batting average and had
96 strikeouts in 101 2-3 innings before being sidelined. He is not
expected to be ready to pitch again before the middle of next
season.
	   Martinez said he was prepared for the Dodgers' move.
	   ``It's a business,'' he said. ``I'm not angry at them. Really, I
have a lot to thank the Dodgers organization for. I hope the
changes they are making will strengthen the team.''
	   Martinez, who earned dlrs 4.8 million last season, had a 123-77
record, a 3.45 ERA and 1,314 strikeouts in his 10-year career with
the Dodgers.
	   The older brother of pitchers Pedro and Jesus Martinez, Ramon
said he had offers from other interested clubs but declined to
provide details.

UN drug program, Colombia pledge cooperation in eradicating coca
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations and Colombia have
signed an agreement for a dlrs 80 million a year crop-substitution
program to help rid the country of coca plants, the raw material
for cocaine, the top U.N. drug control officer said Wednesday.
	   Pino Arlacchi and Colombian President Andres Pastrana signed the
cooperation agreement in Bogota last week, under which the United
Nations would help raise the money for alternative development
projects for Colombia's coca farmers.
	   Already, the Inter-American Development bank has pledged dlrs 90
million for PLANTE, the Colombian-run crop-substitution program,
Arlacchi told a news conference.
	   Donor countries received the business plan for the program 10
days ago, but no firm commitments have come in yet, said Arlacchi,
head of the Vienna-based U.N. Drug Control Program.
	   Arlacchi said the current hopes for peace between rebels and the
government presented a opportunity for drug eradication that hasn't
been available for years.
	   ``As far as I understood, there is a large availability and
commitment both from the government side and from the insurgent
side to cooperate in a program of eradication of illicit crops and
alternative development in that country,'' he said.
	   The bulk of coca farms are on rebel-held lands.
	   The U.N. project calls for the eradication of coca in 10 years,
with half of the funding coming from Latin American countries.
Other provisions would try to change Colombian laws on fighting
corruption and money laundering, he said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Most stocks fell Wednesday, but bellwether
technology stocks rose sharply and the Dow industrials edged higher
after three sessions of profit-taking. The Dow Jones industrial
average finished 5.93 points higher at 8,371.97 after trading
between an early 37-point decline and a gain of 67. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's long-awaited plan to confront a
financial crisis offered a mix of spending cuts and higher taxes
that will affect corporations, civil servants and almost anyone
with a bank account. With the plan, the government hopes to save
nearly 28 billion reals (dlrs 24 billion) next year and qualify
Brazil for a rescue package of about dlrs 30 billion being
assembled by the International Monetary Fund. But the more
controversial proposals, including an unprecedented tax on social
security pensions, face an uphill battle in Congress. ``Our destiny
is in our own hands,'' said Finance Minister Pedro Malan. Pedro
Parente, executive secretary at Brazil's Finance Ministry, said the
IMF aid should become available within a month. (BRAZIL-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government presented a long-awaited plan for
pulling Russia out of its economic crisis to the International
Monetary Fund on Wednesday, in hopes of winning foreign loans to
plug holes in the budget. The IMF insisted on seeing a plan to cope
with the crisis _ and signs that it is being implemented _ before
it will release any more of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
negotiated during the summer. The Russian government desperately
needs the cash to pay its bills. The program calls for tightening
currency controls, would require Russian exporters to sell 75
percent of their foreign-currency profits to the state, and would
reduce the profit tax from 35 percent to 30 percent.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel NV
said Wednesday its third-quarter net profit fell 5 percent to 430
million guilders (dlrs 231 million), marred by financial crises in
Asia, Russia and Latin America. The company reported a net profit
of 455 million guilders (dlrs 244 million) a year ago for the same
period ending Sept. 30. For the full year, the company expects a
``slightly higher full-year net income, excluding non-recurring
items.'' Akzo shares fell sharply following the disappointing
results. By midmorning its stock was trading down 8.4 percent.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ IBM has developed the world's fastest
computer, which can perform enough complex calculations to maintain
reliability of the nation's nuclear weapons without conducting
actual bomb tests, U.S. officials say. The supercomputer _ dubbed
``Pacific Blue'' _ was being touted by the White House Wednesday at
an event highlighting technology developments. The new IBM
supercomputer, built for the Department of Energy, can perform 3.9
trillion operations a second and simulate a nuclear bomb test,
administration officials said. Such high-speed calculations will
enable U.S. scientists to maintain the reliability of atomic
weapons stockpiles without having to conduct nuclear tests, which
are prohibited by an international test ban treaty, the officials
said. (US-IBM-SUPERCOMPUTER)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, Thailand's candidate to head the World Trade
Organization, said Wednesday the trade body should continue to
promote liberalization despite the economic crisis gripping parts
of the world. Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of
Thailand, Supachai said liberalization will generate demand and
eventually reverse the current slowdown. ``We can't close markets,
because demand will be driven downward,'' he said. ``Let's try and
make the potential of world recession keep us at all times
committed to liberalization.'' (THAILAND-WORLD TRADE)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The banks coordinating the initial
share offer in telephone company Swisscom said Wednesday they have
exercised an option to issue 3.3 million more shares. The
government-controlled Swisscom, formerly the telecommunications arm
of Switzerland's postal service, began selling shares to the public
with an initial offering of about 30 percent of the firm's share
capital earlier this month. Warburg Dillon Read and J.P. Morgan
said the additional shares will bring the Swiss government another
1.1 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 810 million). They bring to 34.5
percent the total of the firm's share capital sold.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Athina Roussel, the 13-year-old heiress to the
Onassis fortune, knows a way to end the squabbling over her dlrs
600 million estate.
	   ``If I burn the money, there will be no problem. No money, no
problem,'' her stepmother, Gaby Roussel, recalled Athina once
saying. ``For Athina, it would be a way to be like everybody
else.''
	   Athina was 3 when her mother, Christina Onassis, died, leaving
her the family fortune. Her father, Thierry Roussel, has been
battling four Greek trustees of the Onassis fortune, with lawsuits
and countersuits on both sides.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ROME (AP) _ Sophia Loren is taking walks and ``ruthlessly''
trying to avoid stress as she deals with a recently diagnosed heart
condition.
	   The 64-year-old actress fell ill on an Aug. 10 flight from
Geneva to New York.
	   Doctors found an irregular heartbeat. Now she is back home in
Geneva, and has been spotted taking a walk in a botanical garden.
	   Loren told Rome's La Repubblica daily that the doctor had
ordered her to take brisk walks _ ``every day making a little
bigger effort.''
	   ``I'll take airplanes less, I'll work less, I'll do everything
to avoid every stress,'' she said. ``I'll learn to stay calm, I'll
ruthlessly avoid all kinds of emotions, any apprehension.''
	   Loren said she will return to the United States in January to
promote her new book combining memoirs and recipes.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Norwegian parachutist has jumped from the 61st
floor of the Chrysler Building, three days after he had leapt from
the Empire State building.
	   The 32-year-old daredevil, Thor Alex Kappfjell, jumped from the
art deco Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday after
plunging from the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State
building on Saturday.
	   Kappfjell told a Norwegian newspaper the Empire State Building
was his ``biggest dream'' because jumpers thought it was impossible
to sneak parachuting equipment past the building's security. But he
and friends smuggled his equipment past the guards in three bundles
made to look like camping equipment, the newspaper, DagBladet,
quoted him as saying. He put on the equipment in a bathroom.
	   He also wanted to jump from the twin towers of the World Trade
Center, the city's tallest buildings, but security was too tight.
	   ``You're always afraid,'' he told the New York Post. ``It makes
you sharper. There is no room for mistakes. One mistake and you
die.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   IRBID, Jordan (AP) _ It may be the world's longest birthday
card.
	   Some 15,000 Jordanians already have signed a 250-yard
(250-meter) paper card that wishes King Hussein a speedy return
home and aims for a place in the record books.
	   The card has been open for signatures since Tuesday and
organizers expect one million people to sign.
	   King Hussein _ the longest serving Arab ruler _ has been away
from home since July 14. He is receiving treatment for non-Hodgkins
lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   The soft paper card is one yard (one meter) wide and has been
placed in a red velvet box with tabs on both sides to flip the
pages.
	   ``It is a note of love, esteem and loyalty to His Majesty King
Hussein, may God bless him and return him safe to his home,'' said
Mashhour Sawalha, a member of a group which designed the card.
	   King Hussein's 64th birthday is on Nov. 14.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pablo Picasso's son says it sometimes took the
great master two minutes to dash off a sketch on a matchbox cover.
At the rate some of those whimsical creations sold at auction
Wednesday, that would come to about dlrs 20,000 a minute.
	   Not only matchbox covers but torn pieces of tablecloth, the top
of a shoebox, and bits of paper with cigarette holes all fetched
prices better suited to oil paintings.
	   On the second of a three-day auction featuring the legacy of
Picasso muse Dora Maar, it was not major works, but rather the
intimate evidence of a love affair that took center stage.
	   Maar and Picasso spent eight tumultuous years together before he
left her _ as was his pattern _ for another, younger woman.
	   She died last year at age 89, after steadfastly refusing to sell
or even lend out the paintings, sketches, notes and other mementos
he gave her.
	   One of Wednesday's most dramatic purchases: 1.1 million francs
(dlrs 198,915) for a set of five torn-off matchbox covers, almost
30 times the official estimate. One of the miniature sketches shows
Dora Maar with her hair in a bun; another is a colored still-life
with an oval guitar.

Brain `hitching post' influences alcohol consumption in mice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mice that lacked a particular kind of ``hitching
post'' for a brain substance were far less interested in drinking
alcohol than normal mice were, suggesting a possible anti-drinking
approach for people.
	   This D2 dopamine receptor has been implicated before in
drinking. A gene tells the body how to make it, and some studies
have suggested that a certain version of this gene may predispose
some people to alcoholism. But other studies have cast doubt on the
idea.
	   The new result suggests that a drug that blocks the D2 receptor
might be able to help people reduce their drinking, researcher
Tamara Phillips said. But that approach would have to account for
potential side effects, she said.
	   Phillips is a research geneticist at the Portland, Oregon,
Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center and a professor of
behavioral neuroscience at the Oregon Health Sciences University.
She and co-authors report the work in the November issue of the
journal Nature Neuroscience.
	   They created a strain of mice lacking the gene for the D2
receptor. It's one of several receptor types that a brain substance
called dopamine attaches to in order to exert its effects. Dopamine
helps produce pleasant feelings.
	   The mutant mice drank about half as much alcohol as normal mice
when given free access. Analysis showed they had an aversion to it,
just the opposite of normal mice.

 &UR; Artificial reef could help lessen shoreline erosion, increase surf
	   OCEANSIDE, California (AP) _ An experimental reef expected to be
built off the Southern California coastline could help restore an
eroding shore while making waves for surfers.
	   The California Coastal Commission unanimously approved a project
on Oct. 14 that will create what is believed to be the nation's
first artificial reef intended to improve the shape and swell of
waves.
	   In approving Pratte's Reef, the commission said it recognized
the implications for the future of both the sport of surfing and
for the protection of the state's highly valuable but eroding
shoreline.
	   The reef, to be built offshore of El Segundo near Los Angeles
International Airport, will be named after environmentalist and
surfing advocate Tom Pratte, who died of cancer in 1994.
	   Huge, sand-filled bags _ some as large as two railroad cars _
will form the V-shaped reef. The bags will be dropped into 15 feet
of water off Dockweiler State Beach.
	   Construction of the reef won't likely start until early next
year. However, erosion experts hired by the city of Encinitas, just
north of San Diego, already are looking at a similar project there
to protect Coast Highway 101 from high surf in winter.

 &UR; Male hormone levels lower after aerobics
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Men who do a lot of endurance exercise have
less male sex hormone than other men.
	   That's not an insult. In fact, it may indicate good news.
	   Researchers have found that men who do a lot of running have
lower levels of testosterone even when they are not running.
	   But they warn that low levels of testosterone can be a sign of
overtraining.
	   ``Testosterone levels of the endurance-trained men were found to
be 60-85 percent of the levels of matched untrained men,'' said
researcher Anthony C. Hackney of the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill.
	   Hackney's updated summary of research on the relationship of
testosterone and aerobic exercise was posted on Sportscience, the
Web site of the Royal Society of New Zealand, a scientific
organization that is prominent for its focus on sports medicine.
	   Little is known about what happens to men whose testosterone
levels apparently are driven down by exercise, the review article
said. But so far, it appears that a little less may do some good,
the article said.

Natural History museum updating scientific facts
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The biggest exhibit at the National Museum of
Natural History has a problem: It's a whale without a belly button.
	   A critique done for the museum says, ``A blue whale's umbilicus
_ roughly 8 inches (20 cms) across _ is not a subtle feature and
cannot be omitted from an accurate model.''
	   As part of a five-year, dlrs 26 million renovation, the museum
plans to replace the 92-foot-long (28-meter), 40-year-old model and
change other exhibits as well, to bring them more up-to-date
scientifically.
	   Officials also plan a new focus for the country's largest
collection of specimens, part of the Smithsonian Institution:
exploring the connections among living creatures, inanimate things
and the people studying them.
	   The new and slightly larger whale will go up in a hall devoted
to mammals instead of the hall for sea creatures and give visitors
a better idea of how it actually lived.
	   ``The first thing you want to tell about whales is that they're
mammals, not fish, so she'll be nursing her calf,'' said Robert
Sullivan, the museum's associate director for public programs.
	   The current whale model was based on 1950s science, when
builders had less information about how an active whale looks. The
original, in the British Museum, was modeled on a dead and bloated
animal.
	   Labels in the museum, one of the most popular on the national
Mall, have been continuously updated and consist largely of basic
facts of science that don't change much. But new information
accumulates over the years, such as that about humans' ancestors.
	   In the current exhibit on ``The Human Family Tree,'' officials
have put up signs warning that some material is outdated:
	   ``What's new?'' one label asks. ``Recent evidence suggests
Neanderthals lived in Europe, the Near East and Central Asia, not
in Africa or East Asia, so this map is wrong.''
	   That didn't faze Susan Bonjorno, who visited the museum recently
on her honeymoon.
	   ``They're constantly revamping what they think,'' said Bonjorno,
who teaches third grade in Paramount, California. ``Every time
somebody finds some little artifact, it changes what everybody
thinks.''
	   The section will be replaced by a larger one using practical
demonstrations to answer the question: ``What does it mean to be
human?'' It also will show the differences between humans and even
their most advanced relatives.
	   ``A chimpanzee can touch his thumb with his forefinger, but he
hasn't got the precise grip that you need to drive a nail or thread
a needle,'' Sullivan said.
	   In another major operation, the museum will move the biggest
stuffed elephant in captivity, known to the staff as Henry, about 6
feet (2 meters) from the center of the soaring rotunda where he now
stands.
	   The move will weaken Henry's imposing position as a symbol of
the museum. But it will reinforce the renovation's main theme,
putting Henry in the environment he knew when alive, with an
interactive display to help visitors learn about his world.
	   The renovation also includes brightening up the 1910 building by
removing covers from its extensive skylights and removing many
interior walls put up decades ago when the building was used for
government offices.
	   ``What's better for natural history than natural light?''
Sullivan asked.
	   The renovations are made possible by a dlrs 20 million gift, the
largest in the Smithsonian's history, from Kenneth Behring, a real
estate developer who formerly owned the Seattle Seahawks of the
U.S. National Football League.
	   Museum officials also hope to broaden their audience. Three
years ago, few people beyond the 17,000 who visit on an average day
could learn much from the museum, but now it can take as many as
65,000 students at a time on ``electronic field trips'' via the
Internet.
	   When the renovation is complete in 2003, it will be possible for
anyone to take a museum ``virtual tour'' by computer.
	   On Wednesday, 2-year-old Lindsey Concepcion of Minneapolis was
seeing the sites the old-fashioned way _ in person. She didn't much
like the whale, but that may have been because her father
threatened jokingly to feed her to it.
	   She did love the dinosaurs, said her mother, Jeannette. No
changes are being made to the dinosaur exhibit.

Jamaican government to take control of three largest sugar
</HEADLINE>
factories &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Jamaican government said Wednesday
it will take back control of three sugar factories it partially
privatized in 1993, citing production problems under the new
managers.
	   Monymusk, Frome and Bernard Lodge sugar estates _ the country's
biggest _ are suffering from mechanical breakdowns and higher
production costs than its Caribbean competitors, agriculture
minister Roger Clarke told Parliament.
	   The sugar industry employs 28,800 people full-time in Jamaica,
with employment rising to 41,000 during harvest season. Only the
government employs more people.
	   In 1993, the government sold a 51 percent stake in the sugar
farms to Manufacturers Investment Ltd., rum producer Wray and
Nephew and British management company Booker Tate Ltd.
	   None of the companies would comment on Wednesday.
	   The privatization contract gave the government the right to take
over management of the factories if they did not perform
satisfactorily.
	   A drought in 1997 led to lower sugar cane yields, Clarke said,
and the industry has failed to meet a production goal of one ton of
sugar per 9.5 metric tons of cane. Jamaican sugar factories need
about 20 metric tons of cane to produce a metric ton of sugar.
	   Clarke also said it costs more to produce a pound (half a kilo)
of sugar in Jamaica than in Guyana or Belize.
	   Jamaica produces about 3.7 metric tons of sugar per employee,
compared to 8.9 tons in Guyana, 4.1 tons in Trinidad, 12.2 tons in
Belize, 11.4 tons in Mauritius and 4.3 tons in Fiji, he said.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Just hours before the
scheduled release of a long-awaited human rights report, President
Nelson Mandela's party on Thursday sought a court injunction to
block its publication.
	   The move by the African National Congress, which led the
anti-apartheid struggle, dealt the second blow to the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission.
	   On Wednesday, apartheid's last leader, President F.W. de Klerk,
filed a lawsuit that forced the panel to strike a finding that he
was an ``accessory after the fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.
	   The ANC opposes the report because it is expected to implicate
the party in apartheid-era human rights abuses.
	   Cape Town Judge Wilfred Thring was to start studying the ANC's
urgent request at 4 a.m. local time, and to hear arguments starting
at 5 a.m. (0300 GMT), a court official said.
	   The attacks on the watershed report _ the result of two years of
testimony by thousands of witnesses _ showed just how difficult
reconciliation was in this country four years after the fall of
apartheid.
	   The moves saddened the panel's chairman, former Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
	   ``A pall hangs over most of us because we believe that this
process deserved a glorious ending and now we are speculating as to
what will happen next,'' he said at a media gathering Wednesday
night in Pretoria.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's two biggest opposition parties are
demanding that election officials annul recent voting in the border
state of Tamaulipas, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Calling Sunday's elections ``dirty and fraudulent,'' the
gubernatorial candidates from the National Action and Democratic
Revolution parties called for a civil disobedience campaign
starting on Saturday.
	   According to the newspaper El Universal, the parties said the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party had offered voters up to
1,500 pesos (dlrs 150) each in exchange for their vote.
	   According to official results, ruling party candidate Tomas
Yarrington won about 53 percent of the vote. His closest rival,
National Action's Gustavo Cardenas, got 27 percent of the vote.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Zapatista rebels in
Mexico's southern state of Chiapas say the army has been harassing
them since they've tried to resume peace talks with a congressional
committee.
	   In a letter to the committee Tuesday, Zapatista leader
Subcomandante Marcos said the decision to re-establish talks had
angered the army.
	   He said the army and air force have been staging drills _
military activity that could be tied to the rebels' decision to
negotiate with legislators and not President Ernesto Zedillo's
administration.
	   The military and the Interior Secretariat had no comment on the
charges.
	   The military's presence in Chiapas has grown steadily since the
Zapatista National Liberation Army rebelled in 1994, seeking better
treatment for Indians. Talks between the government and rebels have
stalled since 1996.

	   Adame was treated for minor injuries and later joined the
officers investigating Monday's fatal shooting in this popular
Mexican beach resort.

see their wages fall _ and will receive the same pay as Panamanian
workers after the canal is returned to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999,
President Ernesto Perez Balladares said.
	   ``There is no reason to justify wages for U.S. workers to be 15
percent higher than those of Panamanian workers,'' Perez Balladares
said Tuesday night.
	   Perez Balladares said the difference in pay represented about
dlrs 35 million, which he will spend on education programs
beginning in 2000, after the United States turns the canal over to
Panama.
	   American workers represent about 7 percent of the labor force in
the Panama Canal.
	   The canal, built in 1914, earned dlrs 545.7 million in revenues
during the 1998 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.

Parliament considers bill to ease Cable and Wireless monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson
has filed legislation aimed at easing Cable and Wireless Ltd.'s
monopoly on telecommunications in this Caribbean country.
	   The bill allows competition in value-added products, wireless
services and interconnection by newcomers to Cable and Wireless's
network, something the British company has resisted.
	   The proposal, which was filed Tuesday, also would appoint a
government regulator to oversee competition.
	   ``Globally, telecommunication is moving from a monopoly-based
industry to one that thrives on competition,'' said Phillip
Paulwell, minister of commerce and technology. ``Existing laws and
regulations governing telecommunications in Jamaica are now
outdated and need to be recast.''
	   Patterson's government gave Cable and Wireless a 25-year
exclusive license in 1988, but frictions have increased as other
telecommunications firms complain the company is trying to quash
competitors in new technologies.
	   Cable and Wireless did not immediately comment on Wednesday.
During drafting of the bill in August, it warned the proposed

Palestinian leader has huge political stake in accord's success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Yasser Arafat came home to a hero's
welcome, with cheering crowds lining his motorcade's route, a
snappy honor-guard salute and a special song of tribute played over
and over on official Palestinan radio.
	   Now it's time for him to truly face the music.
	   Arafat, who waited nearly a week after the signing of the new
peace accord in Washington to return to the Palestinian lands on
Wednesday, is embarking on a high-stakes, high-risk effort to turn
the pact's provisions into reality.
	   If he succeeds, even the interim measures envisioned under the
accord could go a long way toward easing pent-up Palestinian fury.
	   That's especially true in the Gaza Strip, where many of those
who turned out to see Arafat arrive were almost giddy over the
prospect of a working international airport, a seaport and a
so-called ``safe passage'' that would allow them to travel through
Israel to the West Bank _ all part of the new agreement.
	   ``That's what peace would mean to me _ being able to come and go
as if we lived in a normal country,'' said 55-year-old schoolmaster
Suleiman Hasan, waiting under a broiling sun in the border town of
Rafah to see the Palestinian leader's motorcade whoosh past.
	   Arafat's route from the Egyptian frontier to his Gaza City
headquarters took him the length of Gaza, past ramshackle refugee
camps and red-roofed Jewish settlements in the distance. All along
the way, people gathered at the roadside to wave and cheer as he
passed.
	   Village elders sat waiting in rows, young men smoked water pipes
and sipped coffee, and veiled women paused to look, balancing big
bundles on their heads.
	   While potential Palestinian gains from the accord are great, so
are the pitfalls. If the two sides fall to squabbling over
implementing the accord, despair could quickly reach critical
proportions in poor, crowded, angry Gaza.
	   Hamas, the radical Islamic group that opposes any peace with
Israel, has a stronger following here than elsewhere.
	   Already, there were potential snags. After Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indefinitely postponed a Cabinet
meeting to approve the accord, the United States urged both sides
to start moving next week to implement the agreement.
	   Arafat was upbeat when asked whether the postponement spelled
trouble.
	   ``No, I think that what has been signed will be implemented
accurately,'' he told reporters.
	   As he has been since the accord's signing, Arafat was careful to
characterize it as a step toward Palestinian statehood _ while at
the same time reserving the option of a unilateral statehood
declaration if the agreement fails.
	   ``No doubt,'' he said quickly when asked whether Palestinians
are closer now to their goal of statehood.
	   For the Palestinians, internal divisions are likely to intensify
as some of the pact's thornier provisions are put into force.
Particularly difficult will be steps like seizing illegal weaponry,
cutting the size of Palestinian security forces and halting
incitement against Israel.
	   In Arafat's absence, some of his supporters turned on one
another. In the West Bank, thousands of Palestinians marched
Wednesday in the funeral procession of a 16-year-old boy shot dead
in a confrontation over rivalry between Arafat's Fatah political
faction and Palestinian military intelligence agents.
	   Despite Arafat's domestic political troubles and their own
worsening plight, most Palestinians feel there is little option but
to have him stay on the peace course. The welcome-home he got in
Gaza _ his biggest in years _ was highly orchestrated, but
nonetheless heartfelt.
	   Watchers _ especially the young _ said they hoped for the best
from the accord.
	   ``We want to go to the university, have good jobs _ we need
peace to do these things,'' said Saeb Kandril, an earnest
16-year-old with a wispy mustache.
	   Mukhtal al-Arjah, a 71-year-old Bedouin with a weathered face
and traditional headdress waited on horseback by the roadside.
Leaning over, he said he was there because it was important to show
respect for a leader at a time of triumph _ or crisis.
	   ``We'll see which this will be,'' he said.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks move higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen in early
trading Thursday, while Japanese stock prices edged up on
bargain-hunting after recent declines.
	   The dollar bought 117.68 yen, down 0.20 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level overnight of 117.82
yen.
	   Traders said the dollar was moving narrowly against the yen
after briefly strengthening in New York in response to Brazil's
announcement of an austerity package.
	   But continued instability in the giant South American country
and strong interest among U.S. hedge funds and Japanese
institutional investors to sell dollars on upswings kept the
currency from rising, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices moved higher as investors
placed buy orders to cover their short, or oversold, positions
following the market's recent losses.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 148.97 points,
or 1.10 percent, to 13,665.04 in the first 30 minutes of morning
trading. On Wednesday, the index lost 304.61 points, or 2.20
percent.
	   But traders said sentiment remains poor due to worries about
corporate earnings and the direction of emerging markets, including
Brazil and Russia.
	   ``It is difficult to push the market higher from current
levels,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock
division at Tokyo Securities.
	   Worries about corporate earnings were compounded after Sony
Corp. on Wednesday lowered its group earnings forecast for the full
fiscal year through March.
	   The electronics giant also announced its earnings slipped 5.4
percent in the first half of the fiscal year, hurt by falling
prices for consumer electronics products such as computer monitors
and cellular phones.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average edged
higher after three sessions of profit-taking, closing up 5.93
points at 8,371.97.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.98 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,034.59. The
TOPIX declined 14.37 points, or 1.37 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.885 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.870 percent,
driving its price down to 108.11 yen from 108.26 yen.

Mandela's ANC seeks to suppress apartheid rights report

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Just hours before the
scheduled release of a long-awaited human rights report, President
Nelson Mandela's party on Thursday sought a court injunction to
block its publication.
	   The move by the African National Congress, which led the
anti-apartheid struggle, escalated the turmoil surrounding a
watershed document from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
	   Cape Town Judge Wilfred Thring was to start studying the ANC's
urgent request at 4 a.m. local time (0200 GMT) and to hear
arguments starting at 5 a.m. (0300 GMT), a court official said.
	   The ruling ANC, which backed setting up the panel, said it was
outraged the commission planned to blame it for human rights abuses
committed during its campaign.
	   Thenjiwe Mtintso, the party's deputy secretary-general, said on
Wednesday the report would ``criminalize the whole liberation
struggle.'' She said the commission sent a letter Wednesday morning
rejecting the ANC's appeal for last-minute revisions.
	   On Wednesday, former President F.W. de Klerk, filed a lawsuit
that forced the panel to strike a finding that he was an
``accessory after the fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.
	   Though the commission is adamant it will fight de Klerk in
court, officials said the legal move by white South Africa's last
ruler may have prompted the ANC action.
	   The attacks from both sides of the apartheid struggle showed
just how difficult reconciliation was in this country four years
after the fall of apartheid and saddened the panel's chairman,
former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
	   ``A pall hangs over most of us because we believe that this
process deserved a glorious ending and now we are speculating as to
what will happen next,'' he said at a media gathering Wednesday
night in Pretoria.
	   Commission officials said they had no immediate plans to cancel
the release of the report, planned as a solemn noontime handover
from Tutu to Mandela in Pretoria, the capital.
	   Commission spokesman John Allen said the panel would oppose the
request.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who runs the country's day-to-day
affairs and is expected to succeed Mandela after next year's
elections, backed the court move, said Mtintso.
	   As the sum of three years of often heartbreaking work, the Truth
Commission's final report is seen as a key step in healing the
racial wounds still dividing South Africa.
	   Set up in 1995, a year after all race elections ended apartheid,
the panel was charged with uncovering the truth about atrocities by
all sides in the struggle for black liberation - a difficult task
that has earned it enemies of all political persuasions.
	   The 3,500 page report is the culmination of scores of public
hearings, victim statements and amnesty cases held all over the
country. The report will make findings as to exactly what happened
in South Africa's bloody past and who is to blame.
	   It is expected to finger high profile individuals from both
sides of the conflict for specific human rights abuses, paving the
way for possible criminal prosecutions for those who did not seek
amnesty.
	   The report is expected to implicate senior figures from
apartheid governments, such as former President P. W. Botha, as
well as anti-apartheid activists such as Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
the former wife of President Mandela, for acts carried out by her
gang of personal bodyguards.

Leiter and Mets announce four-year contract
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Now that the New York Mets have Mike Piazza for
the next seven years, they need someone to throw to him.
	   Two days after signing the All-Star catcher to a record dlrs 91
million, seven-year contract, they announced today that staff ace
Al Leiter has agreed to a dlrs 32 million, four-year deal.
	   ``I'm playing for a team I truly rooted for growing up,'' Leiter
said. ``I grew up on the Jersey shore, I'm playing for my team.''
	   Leiter, a 33-year-old left-hander, came to the Mets before the
season as part of the Florida Marlins' payroll purge. He
immediately became the best pitcher on the team, going 17-6 with a
2.47 ERA, the most wins on the Mets and the top ERA in the NL among
starters.
	   ``The highlight of my dream for this upcoming season is for New
York to have another ticker tape parade, but with the team from
Queens doing the partying,'' Leiter said.
	   New York also signed a player Tuesday, and it got his name on
the dotted line for a lot less than it took to keep Piazza.
	   Infielder Luis Lopez, who would have been eligible for salary
arbitration this winter, agreed on a dlrs 1.35 million, two-year
contract.
	   Lopez, 28, hit .252 in 266 at-bats this season with two homers
and 22 RBIs. He made dlrs 375,000.
	   Lopez gets dlrs 575,000 next season and dlrs 775,000 and 2000.
He can earn dlrs 200,000 in performance bonuses during the second
year of the deal.
	   Seven Mets remain eligible for arbitration: Edgardo Alfonzo,
Butch Huskey, Jason Isringhausen, Hideo Nomo, Rey Ordonez, Todd
Pratt and Turk Wendell _ although it's likely several in this group
will be told to sign in December or get cut loose on the Dec. 20
deadline to offer 1999 contracts to players on 40-man rosters.
	   New York also is discussing a trade that would sent reliever Mel
Rojas to the Dodgers for outfielder Bobby Bonilla and possibly
second baseman Eric Young. Mets general manager Steve Phillips also
called the agent for free-agent outfielder Brian Jordan to express
interest.

Russia, China want Iraq review to have goal of ending oil embargo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Russian and Chinese proposals. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia and China want to give Iraq
assurances that a complete overview of its compliance with U.N.
resolutions could lead to the lifting of the oil embargo that has
crippled its economy for eight years.
	   The two permanent Security Council members submitted their ideas
Wednesday for how a ``comprehensive review'' would be carried out.
The council was expected to produce a final outline by Thursday or
Friday.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed the review in a bid to
persuade Iraq to rescind its Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   As envisaged by Annan and council members, the review would
start soon after Iraq resumes cooperation with the inspectors. It
would look into Iraq's progress in disarming itself while mapping
out what else it needs to do before sanctions can be lifted.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons before the council will
lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq halted cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to state that Baghdad had
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
	   All council members seem to agree that the review should be
carried out in two phases. The first would look into Iraq's
compliance with resolutions specifically dealing with disarmament.
The second would look into all other Iraq resolutions, such as
those demanding war reparations to Kuwaitis.
	   Britain and the United States have said the council shouldn't
list any ``predetermined outcomes'' of the review, particularly
whether the lifting of the oil embargo was a possible result.
	   But Russia and China, in their suggestions Wednesday, said just
that.
	   They want the first phase of the review to assess Iraq's
compliance specifically to determine whether Iraq has disarmed
itself to the extent demanded in the original 1991 resolution that
established the inspection regime. The resolution allows for the
oil embargo to be lifted once Iraq's disarmament obligations are
met.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock submitted an initial
outline last week that contains no such provisions for the lifting
of the embargo.
	   Greenstock, the council president, nevertheless was upbeat about
the discussions on the proposal Wednesday, saying he was optimistic
that consensus could be reached.
	   ``The amendments were, I think, few enough for me to feel that
the draft I put around was a good basis,'' he said. ``And we will
be moving forward over the next 24 hours or so to try and drive
that process through to a conclusion.''
	   Britain and the United States had been reluctant to give Iraq
any details of how the review would be carried out, saying it had
to reverse its Aug. 5 decision before any movement could be made on
the review.
	   However, Annan indicated to the council last week that he
couldn't proceed further in negotiations with Baghdad without some
guidance from the council of how it planned to proceed.
	   A top adviser to President Saddam Hussein, Lt. Gen. Amer
al-Saadi, said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press
and AP Television News that Iraq was still open to negotiations.
	   Asked if the talks on a comprehensive review could lead to a
reversal of the Aug. 5 decision, he said: ``We see nothing wrong in
resuming normal working relations (with U.N. inspectors) provided
it leads somewhere.''

U.N. criticizes human rights in Bosnia, Croatia and Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. report criticized the governments
of Bosnia, Croatia and Yugoslavia Wednesday for disregarding human
rights ranging from the right to life to basic democratic
principles.
	   The conflict in Kosovo and the recent wars in Bosnia and Croatia
``are clear indications that there is good reason to be concerned
about deterioration in the human rights situations in all three
countries,'' it said.
	   Jiri Dienstbier, the special rapporteur of the Commission on
Human Rights, urged the three countries to build a government based
on the rule of law instead of on a ruling party, to foster an
independent judiciary, and to promote democracy and an independent
media.
	   In Bosnia, he said, ``the apprehension, prosecution and
punishment of war criminals remains a precondition for improvement
of the human rights situation, the return of refugees and displaced
persons to their pre-war homes, and reconciliation.''
	   In his first report on human rights in the three countries,
Dienstbier said that ``independence of the judiciary and police is
not respected and mostly not understood.''
	   Some new laws have made the human rights situation worse, he
said.
	   In Yugoslavia, a new law on universities has greatly reduced
academic independence, giving government officials control over the
appointment of professors, deans and university governing boards.
In Croatia, the new penal code permits prosecution of journalists
and others who insult top government officials, he said.
	   The main problem in the region is the hundreds of thousands of
people trying to return to homes where their ethnic group is now in
the minority _ and unable to do so because of lack of security,
house burnings and open opposition, he said.
	   ``The tremendous hatred felt towards other ethnic groups in all
three countries has to be challenged, and methods for the promotion
of tolerance and reconciliation must be developed as a precondition
of sustainable peace and democratic development,'' Dienstbier said.
	   While freedom of the media is officially guaranteed, he said,
television in all three countries is mainly controlled by the
government or ruling ethnic political parties _ and some
independent media outlets have editors who promote ethnic hatred.

Netanyahu finds opposition to deal from within own party

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ His two-year old campaign jingle blared
over large hall speakers, the crowd of several hundred was mostly
hand-picked and his right-hand men praised the Israeli leader and
the new Mideast peace accord.
	   But even on his own turf _ a gathering of his Likud party
faithful _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was confronted with
growing right-wing opposition to the latest land-for-peace deal he
signed last week with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   With senior members of Likud openly attacking the deal, a
clearly angry Netanyahu took to the podium twice on Wednesday to
defend the accord and berate his political rivals for the failings
of a peace process the dovish Labor party began five years ago.
	   Since his return to Israel Sunday, at least 12 hard-liners in
Netanyahu's shaky coalition have said they will vote against the
deal in parliament. Five Cabinet members have also indicated they
would not approve the agreement, including Justice Minister Tsahi
Hanegbi, who announced his opposition on Wednesday.
	   The Cabinet was to vote Thursday on the deal, which calls for
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks
in exchange for Palestinian measures to prevent attacks on
Israelis.
	   But the session was postponed indefinitely. Netanyahu said the
Palestinians had failed to present a work sheet on fighting
terrorism and he would not carry out a troop withdrawal from the
West Bank until the document is sent.
	   Israeli media said the move was designed to give Netanyahu time
to shore up support for the accord among his mostly far-right
partners who staunchly oppose ceding land to the Palestinians.
	   Palestinian officials called the move a stalling tactic.
	   ``We will honor all the provisions of the agreement and we hope
(Netanyahu) will do the same. We should avoid exporting blame or
threats, they are not good for any of us,'' Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu, who was elected on a campaign pledge to increase
Israel's security, has used the security document as the accord's
main selling point and has referred to it again and again in public
appearances since the signing.
	   U.S. diplomats met with Palestinian officials Wednesday in an
attempt to prevent any delays in implementation, and the U.S. State
Department said the Palestinians would submit the security plan by
Friday.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, said he was confident both sides would keep
their promises and that he was not concerned about the postponement
of the Israeli Cabinet meeting.
	   ``There are American guarantees and international guarantees and
Arab guarantees,'' Arafat said.
	   But at Wednesday's rally, Benny Begin, the hawkish son of the
late prime minister Menachem Begin who is considered a keeper of
the party's right-wing ideology, harshly criticized the accord and
its signatory
	   ``Only the Likud, under the leadership of Bibi Netanyahu could
bring such a terrible agreement,'' Begin said, referring to the
prime minister by his nickname.
	   His words, carried live on Israeli television and radio
stations, were applauded by many in the Tel Aviv auditorium.
Outside, dozens of right-wing Israeli demonstrators shouted ``No to
the deal,'' and ``Resign, Resign.'' Several leaders of West Bank
Jewish settlements were escorted out of the gathering for heckling
during Netanyahu's speech.
	   Opposition to the accord reached at Maryland's Wye Plantation is
growing among the settlers and their supporters. Angry
demonstrations since Friday's signing have led to increased
security for Netanyahu and his top ministers.
	   Trying to deflect criticism, Netanyahu attacked his opponents
and warned the Palestinians in his speech. He mentioned Labor party
leader Ehud Barak by name 40 times and drew thunderous applause by
telling the crowd the Palestinians will only get land after they
make good on promises.
	   But for many in the audience, Netanyahu's continuation with a
peace process he had once voted against was an act of disloyalty.
	   ``I voted for him and I worked for him. I stood out on the
streets for months working for him and now I feel tricked,
cheated,'' said Moshe Ben Zamora, a Jewish settler in the West Bank
city of Hebron.

Moceanu attains adulthood after settlement with parents

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ A stoic 17-year-old Dominique Moceanu, her father
crying beside her, entered the adult world as a Houston judge
approved the Olympic gymnast's request for legal independence from
her parents.
	   In Wednesday's 20-minute hearing _ stalled briefly when
Moceanu's father broke into tears _ State District Judge John D.
Montgomery approved the high school senior's request and declared
her a legal adult.
	   ``I sincerely wish you all the best of luck,'' Montgomery told
Moceanu and her parents, Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu. ``It's not a
pleasant situation to come down to a court like this, since the
three of you probably would rather be just about anywhere else
doing something else than standing here today.''
	   Dumitru Moceanu had to be asked three times if he agreed with
the settlement. With tears in his eyes, he finally uttered a low
``Yes'' and signed the document.
	   ``This wasn't very easy for me,'' Moceanu, an Olympic gold
medalist in 1996, said afterward. ``This was the hardest thing I've
ever done in my life. It was something I felt I had to do.''
	   She declined to take questions from reporters but said she no
longer will live in her parents' Houston-area home.
	   ``This is a great day, but a sad day,'' she said. ``I want to
get one thing straight: I'm not living at home, I'm not going back
home.''
	   Instead, she will remain at her newly rented apartment where she
moved after running away from her parents more than a week ago.
Frustrated over unanswered questions she had about her earnings and
upset after her father threatened to have a Romanian coach
deported, she quickly filed for the right to be an adult. She also
had a restraining order slapped on her parents, whom she believed
had squandered her earnings.
	   The settlement approved Wednesday lifts the restraining order.
Now, as an adult, she legally can inquire about what has happened
to her money.
	   In her initial petition to the court, she claimed earnings in
her trust fund bankrolled unauthorized risky investments and a dlrs
4 million gym bearing her name.
	   It is not known how much was in the trust or how much has been
spent. Her step into adulthood legally gives her the right to ask
for records from her parents.
	   But the trust is structured so even with the new adult
declaration, it remains out of her hands until she is 35. However,
whatever she earns from now on is hers, Roy W. Moore, her lawyer,
said.
	   ``She has no more right today than she did as a child to that
trust,'' Moore said.
	   Moore would not answer additional questions about his client's
legal plans.
	   Last week, Moceanu's parents initially challenged their
daughter's request for adult status. But late Tuesday, after
meeting with her for a deposition, they decided to withdraw their
opposition.
	   Her parents had contended in court documents that their
daughter's coaches and a friend had convinced her to flee. The
gymnast insisted no one influenced her, saying she simply wanted
answers about how the money she earned in her seven-year career was
being spent.
	   Coincidently, the court handling the Moceanu case is the same
one that took an identical request from then underaged gymnast Mary
Lou Retton.
	   In 1985, the then 17-year-old Miss Retton asked the same 309th
District Court to declare her an adult so she could invest earnings
following her 1984 Olympic gold medal performance.
	   Retton's parents _ Lois and Ronnie Retton of Fairmont, West
Virginia _ never opposed their daughter's request and it was
granted without question four days after the petition was filed.

U.N. inspector general targets overspending, fraud, embezzlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. inspector general in his annual
report targeted overstaffed peacekeeping operations in India and
Pakistan, a dlrs 625,000 discrepancy in a fund to promote Haiti's
election, and improper financial transactions at the Rwanda war
crimes tribunal.
	   Undersecretary-General Karl Paschke also criticized serious
financial mismanagement at the 1996 U.N. conference on cities in
Istanbul, the theft of dlrs 400,000 in U.N. equipment from Somalia
and Cambodia by a U.N. contractor, and the embezzlement of nearly
dlrs 600,000 from the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development in
Geneva by a senior official.
	   In releasing the fourth annual report of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services, Paschke said Wednesday that the determination
to address weaknesses and inefficiencies at the world organization
``is proof of a better, healthier United Nations.''
	   The report said auditors had identified dlrs 21.2 million in
potential savings and recovered dlrs 10.3 million.
	   For years, the United States has been in the forefront of
complaints about management of the United Nations, and Congress has
repeatedly withheld part of the U.S. dues to demand reforms and
cutbacks in the U.N. system.
	   Since his election in 1997, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has moved to speed up reforms _ reducing staff, implementing a
``zero-growth'' budget, cutting administrative costs, and giving
strong backing to Paschke's office.
	   In an introductory note to Paschke's report, Annan agreed with
the inspector general that internal oversight in the United Nations
``has matured'' since it began in 1994. And the secretary-general
said the oversight office ``will continue to be a key element in
the ongoing reform process.''
	   The report focused on five areas: peacekeeping, humanitarian
activities, procurement, establishing new U.N. bodies and
personnel.
	   An audit of the U.N. Military Observer Group in India and
Pakistan showed that authorized staffing had been exceeded by 25
percent.
	   At the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, investigators discovered
requisitions for nonessential goods and services valued at dlrs 15
million, which the mission canceled.
	   There were violations of U.N. financial regulations in the
operation of a trust fund for Haiti elections, with a dlrs 625,000
discrepancy between the amount of money advanced and what was
accounted for.
	   Auditors discovered that the U.N. Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara lost interest income of about dlrs 19,000 a year
because it had a bank account that paid no interest.
	   As for humanitarian activities, the auditors found that two
senior staff members of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
a field office that was not identified had illegally used the
agency's satellite telecommunication system. ``Some dlrs 40,000 was
recovered from the staff members and disciplinary action has been
taken,'' the report said.
	   The inspector general urged the UNHCR to ensure that voluntary
organizations implementing its programs improve their accounting
information, and that UNHCR improve the management of more than
dlrs 200 million in assets and cash at field offices.
	   At the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, auditors said
the chief financial officer violated financial rules ``and
personally interfered in the procurement process.'' Investigators
also found that the legal adviser to the registrar improperly
received dlrs 3,000 from two defense attorneys.
	   Investigators found that two staff members had forged three
documents that had ``a negative impact'' on the secretary-general's
reform of the U.N. decolonization program, hoping to advance their
careers.
	   And in the oversight office's first investigation of personnel
practices, investigators discovered what Paschke called
``mind-boggling'': that it took the United Nations an average of
461 days to recruit a new staff member.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Having made strides toward reconciliation with
Britain over the Falklands War, Argentine President Carlos Menem
plans to get down to the real business of his trip here _ promoting
business.
	   Menem, the first Argentine leader to visit Britain officially
since the 1982 war, was scheduled to meet Thursday with Labor Prime
Minister Tony Blair and with Eddie George, president of the Bank of
England.
	   He also planned to meet with leaders of the two opposition
political parties _ the Conservative Party and the Liberal
Democrats.
	   While healing the wounds of the war topped the agenda for
Menem's six-day visit, promoting trade also is a key goal for both
countries.
	   A contingent of 70 Argentine business leaders made the visit
with Menem, and his first meeting was with a group of British
business leaders.
	   England is now the third-largest foreign investor in Argentina,
behind the United States and Spain.
	   Trade between the two countries reached dlrs 1.2 billion last
year. Statistics show it increased by 275 percent between 1991 and
1996, driven by banking, tobacco, automobile and service
industries.
	   ``My visit here is truly guided by a spirit of peace and
reconciliation,'' Menem told the business leaders Wednesday
morning. ``Without forgetting the past, I now look toward the
future.''
	   Later, he laid a wreath before a plaque at St. Paul's Cathedral
listing the 255 British soldiers slain in the 74-day Falklands
conflict. And he shook hands with Prince Andrew, the son of Queen
Elizabeth II who flew combat missions during the conflict which
claimed 970 lives, mostly Argentine soldiers.
	   British Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said Wednesday that
while the war strained the relationship between the two nations, it
was in both their interests to strengthen business ties.
	   Mandelson plans to visit Argentina in December, and his
department will sponsor seven trade missions to the South American
nation next year.
	   ``This business relationship between our two countries has been
a long one, despite setbacks and difficulties,'' he said. ``The
future looks too promising to miss.''

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ A slowly weakening Hurricane Mitch
lashed the Honduran coast, toppling trees, sweeping away bridges,
flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people.
	   The storm was almost stationary over the Bay Islands, a popular
Honduran tourist area. It also was only 25 miles (40 kilometers)
off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105
miles (165 kilometers) from the storm's center. That meant the
Honduran coast had been under hurricane conditions for more than a
day.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island who was within miles of the eye
of the hurricane. ``Few houses have remained standing.''
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph winds. By 0000 GMT, the
storm still packed a punch, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center
said its brush with land had slowed the winds to 105 mph (165 kph).
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   The rainfall _ up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) in mountain
areas _ began to take a toll. More than 50 rivers had overran their
banks, and the government evacuated more than 45,000 people from
low-lying areas, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel, chief of the
National Emergency Committee.
	   Many towns were cut off by washed-out roads and downed bridges,
and severed phone lines on the Bay Islands, making it difficult to
gauge the extent of the damage. The government said 72,000 people
were forced to flee their homes.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development announced it had
sent two helicopters each to Belize and Honduras to help in search,
rescue and relief efforts.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared the Caribbean coast a
disaster zone, and officials said 23 people had died in Honduras
alone, including 14 on Guanaja.
	   Five people were killed in La Ceiba, including three police
officers swept into a river in their car, said regional police
chief Maria Lisa Borjas.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains. In a statement, the
organization said the government ``hasn't adopted the safety
measures necessary for people to cross rivers.''
	   Mexican officials said a wave kicked up by the storm washed a
Connecticut man off a catamaran south of Cancun on Monday, and he
was presumed dead. He was identified as Robert Gates, 55, of
Niantic.
	   Both highways out of La Ceiba, a city of 40,000 people, were cut
Wednesday. To the east, the Saopin bridge sagged into the water as
the swollen river weakened its pillars. To the west, the Pico
Bonito bridge was entirely washed away.
	   Supermarkets emptied of food shut their doors on lines of
frustrated customers and people evacuated low-lying homes by wading
through chest-deep water with sodden bags of belongings of their
heads.
	   Electricity was out in the entire town and the sea moved a
half-block into town in some places. In the Barrio Ingles
shantytown, the ground was covered in white foam from the surf,
making it look as if it had snowed.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts such as Cancun and Cozumel and cutting back on
pumping oil from wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Mexican resort of Cancun, 375 miles (640 kilometers)
north of Honduras, tourists formed long lines at the airport trying
to leave before the storm arrived.
	   But as Mitch slowly moved south, Cancun Mayor Rafael Lara Lara
canceled the city's emergency alert.
	   Belize City, the nation's capital until 1961 when it was
destroyed by Hurricane Hattie, was a ghost town. Most of its 75,000
residents had fled in cars buses commandeered by the government.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people
wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company
was broadcasting only the weather channel.
	   Freddy Sikaffy stayed behind with his wife to take care of his
Hotel El Centro, which was closed. But he had stored up only enough
food for a couple of days, and that was almost gone.
	   ``We have some water, some bread and some tin stuff,'' he said.
``But we thought that by Wednesday the hurricane would be out of
here.''

A gift of life, and a race to run

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ketil Moe is not sure he'll make it to the
finish line of the New York City Marathon. Simply making it to the
starting line will be a huge accomplishment.
	   He is, after all, running with a new set of lungs.
	   Moe is one of six transplant recipients who plan to run the
marathon on Sunday, and he most likely is the first lung recipient
to tackle a course this long, according to Dick Traum, president of
the Achilles Track Club for disabled athletes.
	   Moe, a 31-year-old diabetic, had to suck oxygen and use a
wheelchair before his double lung transplant in the summer of 1997.
	   ``If I can get through the race, I know that I have my disease
under control,'' he said.
	   Speaking from his home in Kristiansand, Norway, Moe worried that
a lingering bacterial infection might prevent him from running.
	   His doctors warned him not to do it. But they also warned him
about many of the 12 marathons he had ran before his transplant,
races he sometimes entered with bleeding lungs.
	   This time he plans to run slowly, with his doctor, his physical
therapist and two Norwegian champions _ former marathoner Grete
Waitz and Johann Olav Koss, an Olympic gold medalist speedskater.
	   ``I hope I will survive,'' he said with a slightly wheezing
laugh. ``It will be the toughest race ever.''
	   Running a marathon is not a good idea for most transplant
patients, said Dr. Niloo Edwards, surgical director of heart
transplants at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. But
those healthy enough to do it are a symbol of hope for sick people
leery of the surgery.
	   ``It's a testament to how well transplantation works in the
1990s and to really how much quality of life ... the gift of these
organs brings to these patients,'' Dr. Edwards said.
	   For Donald Arthur, the transplant itself led him to the
marathon. He began race walking to counter the bone atrophy
resulting from his antirejection drugs.
	   Traum quickly persuaded him to enter last year's marathon, an
event he never cared about before his heart transplant two years
ago.
	   ``The only thing I used to do with a marathon was sit in my
chair with a beer and a cigarette and the remote control and change
the channel because I didn't want to see anyone in that pain and
agony,'' the 54-year-old New Yorker said.
	   Smoking and drinking, combined with a cocaine habit, made
Arthur's already diseased heart grow monstrously large and nearly
shut it down.
	   ``I couldn't talk anymore because I was gasping for air,'' he
said. ``It took over half an hour for me to walk a city block.''
	   He respects his body now. To do any less would dishonor the
25-year-old man he knows only as Fitzgerald. The man whose heart
keeps him alive.
	   Arthur inspired Maria Jimenez to run after she received a
transplant of her mother's kidney.
	   The 35-year-old freelance illustrator spent three years
suffering through exhaustive dialysis treatments after lupus
destroyed her kidneys. Now she wants to make sure she takes full
advantage of her mother's gift.
	   ``I just kind of want to feel life again after feeling so
limited for so long,'' she said.

	   Arthur is dedicating his race this year to them and to all the
families who have made the same painful decision, and to the
patients who died waiting for transplants.
	   ``It's all for them,'' he said. ``It's their 26.2 miles (41.9
kilometers).''

Third quake in a day rocks Indonesian islands; no injuries, damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Three earthquakes shook remote
Indonesian islands, but there were no reports of injuries or
damage, seismologists said Thursday.
	   The tremors hit northeast Indonesia on Wednesday, with the
strongest rocking Ternate Island in northern Maluku at 11:25 p.m.
(1625 GMT), Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Bureau said.
Startled residents ran out of their houses.
	   The quake was centered in the Maluku Sea, 140 kilometers (87
miles) west of Ternate. The island, 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles)
northeast of Jakarta, was also hit by 5.6 and 5.2 tremors earlier
in the day.
	   A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage if
centered near an urban area.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from North America across to Japan, through
Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and New Zealand.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After much of Serb military manpower
and hardware moved out of Kosovo, uniformed guerrilla fighters
moved openly in several areas, and the dreaded police checkpoints
had virtually disappeared.
	   But many of the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian villagers
displaced by some seven months of fighting and torching are still
afraid to return to their homes because NATO has lifted a deadline
for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with the terms
of an Oct. 12 agreement or face airstrikes.
	   The main reason for their misgivings is: they don't trust
Milosevic.
	   ``NATO, it isn't doing the job,'' red-eyed Albert Pacarizi, 24,
said at the funeral of his 18-year-old cousin, Ali Pacarizi, a
guerrilla killed Tuesday by a land mine left by Serb police. ``They
don't attack, they just give a news conference.''
	   Scores of armed guerrillas in green camouflage uniforms with the
red and yellow badge of their Kosovo Liberation Army marched in
formation at Wednesday's funeral at Dragobilje, some 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina. That was unthinkable three days
earlier, when Serb police manned a checkpoint on the road to
Dragobilje and shooting between the sides erupted nightly.
	   The police withdrew on Monday as part of a broad withdrawal of
Serb and Yugoslav forces from Kosovo under the Oct. 12 pact.
	   Under the deal, Milosevic must cut the number of troops and
police in Kosovo to the levels of last February, when he began his
crackdown on the separatist KLA. Hundreds have died in the fighting
and 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced from their homes.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO refrained from setting a
new deadline after its last one expired Tuesday night. But it kept
more than 400 warplanes on alert, and the U.S. Navy announced
Wednesday that American P-3C Orion surveillance planes will begin
regular flights over Kosovo on Sunday.
	   A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said the
withdrawal of Serb forces was incomplete but so far represented a
``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling the demands.''
	   U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke, who struck the deal with
Milosevic, said Wednesday the chances of war in the Balkans were
more than 60 percent before the Yugoslav president agreed to the
pullback.
	   NATO had threatened to bomb Serb targets if Milosevic did not
order the pullout, and ``it was no bluff,'' Holbrooke said.
	   ``All of us thought that bombing almost certainly was going to
happen,'' he told reporters at the U.S. State Department in
Washington.
	   Also Wednesday, a senior U.S. humanitarian aid official said he
believed international actions had prevented thousands of refugees
from dying this winter because the agreement enabled organizations
to rush in clothing, food and other supplies.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
said Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, speaking in Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
``I think we will see no deaths due to isolation or lack of food.''
	   A U.N. refugee agency spokesman said people were returning home
in many areas, and he expected the numbers to increase.
	   ``People can't wait to return because it is getting very cold,''
said the spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
accelerating efforts to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel to
verify compliance on the ground. A spokesman for the OSCE said
Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was due in Pristina on Thursday to take
charge of the verification operation.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence. Kosovo is a province in
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The government has offered only to discuss restoring the local
autonomy Milosevic revoked in 1989 _ a position supported by the
Americans and Europeans who also oppose Kosovo independence.

Turkey celebrates 75th anniversary of modern, secular republic

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Starting the day with a wreath-laying at
founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's ornate mausoleum, Turkey readied a
night of balls, banquets and fireworks for Thursday's 75th
anniversary of its creation as a secular republic.
	   A blimp floated over the capital on Wednesday, its sign
declaring: ``Ataturk, we are following in your footsteps.''
	   Britain's Duke of York and other dignitaries from around the
world were expected for the anniversary, marking Ataturk's Oct. 29,
1923, creation of modern Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman
Empire.
	   Foreign and Turkish leaders were to attend a parade in the day
and a banquet in the evening. Ordinary Turks celebrate with
state-organized dances, fireworks and concerts in streets adorned
with flags and Ataturk's portraits.
	   To 19-year-old Hasan Yilmaz in Ankara, the anniversary was ``an
occasion of great pride.''
	   ``It's not only a holiday, because it's important that the
Turkish republic has come this far,'' the young man said.
	   Aiming to create an up-to-date, Westward-looking state, Ataturk
curtailed religion's role in the predominantly Muslim society and
made secularism the new republic's official ideology.
	   Today, the nation is faced with a widening divide between those
determined to keep it on a secular path and supporters of an
Islamic political movement.
	   The all-powerful military _ the self-appointed guardians of the
secular system _ will use the occasion to show its might, parading
tanks and artillery before the nation and the foreign guests.
	   The military pressured an Islamic-led government into resigning
last year. The Islamic party later was forced to disband.
	   In the only overt reminder of Turkey's mighty Ottoman Empire, a
band dressed as the feared janissaries, who used to announce the
arrival of Ottoman troops in conquered lands, will also parade.
	   Prodded by the pro-secular government, millions throughout the
country marched Sunday to kick off the celebrations and to protest
Islam's influence in national politics.
	   Still, to many Turks, the pride in the anniversary was genuine,
not orchestrated.
	   ``These celebrations are what we feel as Turks,'' declared Deniz
Pekcan, a sales manager in Ankara. ``We are not making a show for
others.''
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was scheduled to arrive
early Thursday to represent the United States and renew U.S.
support for a pipeline to take Caspian oil to European markets
through Turkey.
	   With the main players in the Caspian energy issue all in town,
Turkey also has arranged a ceremony for the signing of a
declaration supporting the Turkish route by the presidents of
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan.

In rural Alberta, resource firms targeted by sabotage campaign

	   VALHALLA, Alberta (AP) _ It's called the Peace Country, a swath
of forest and farmland seemingly far from harm's way, an unlikely
setting for the most sustained campaign of anti-industry sabotage
ever waged in Canada.
	   In the past 2 1/2 years, energy and forestry companies in the
sparsely populated region of northwest Alberta have been hit by
more than 160 attacks, ranging from pesky vandalism to powerful
bombings of oil-well sites.
	   No one has been injured yet, but employees of natural resource
companies consider themselves targets of what they are calling
industrial terrorism.
	   Residents in the attack zone around the area named for the Peace
River are edgy, some even suggesting vigilante action. After the
latest bombing, hundreds crowded into public meetings last week to
be briefed by a terrorism expert, counseled by a psychologist on
coping with stress, and urged by a police officer to report
suspicious activities.
	   ``We've seen the gradual unraveling of trust, friendship and
neighborliness in recent months,'' said Roy Borstad, a county
official. ``Several times, just when we thought things couldn't get
worse, they did just that.''
	   There is little doubt in the region that the sabotage is linked
to anger among some landowners over fast-paced natural-resource
development. Though forestry companies have faced some minor
harassment, the harshest complaints have been directed at the
energy industry by farmers who say pollutants from oil and gas
sites are contaminating their land and causing serious health
problems.
	   In August, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested the most
outspoken of these farmers, former evangelical pastor Wiebo Ludwig,
along with his wife, his son and a family friend. They were accused
of bombing an oil well site, but the charges were dropped for lack
of evidence.
	   Ludwig, 56, moved to the Peace Country from Ontario 13 years
ago. He is patriarch of a clan that numbers more than 30 on a farm
in Hythe, 300 miles (480 kilometers) northwest of Edmonton.
	   An outspoken advocate of land conservation, he blames oil and
gas projects that now encircle his 316-acre farm for killing
livestock and causing three miscarriages among women in his clan.
	   Ludwig has battled in vain for government hearings on the health
effects of gas production.
	   Though he has never claimed responsibility for any attacks,
Ludwig says he is aware of ``underground activity'' and depicts
sabotage legitimate self-defense against pollution that authorities
fail to curtail.
	   The company targeted most often, Alberta Energy Co., tried to
buy out Ludwig, offering dlrs 520,000 if his clan left the
province. The deal collapsed.
	   Ludwig recently suggested that oil executives _ ``men in
pinstripe suits'' _ might become targets. Police termed the comment
``anti-Canadian,'' but took no action.
	   He later showed up in central Alberta for the court appearance
of a farmer charged with murdering an oil executive. Reminded of
his warnings about violence, Ludwig said, ``Inadvertently, I guess
it was a prophecy.''
	   Some environmental groups, while distancing themselves from the
sabotage campaign, empathize with landowners.
	   ``It's easy to discount the Ludwigs as lunatics,'' said Mike
Sawyer, director of the Calgary-based Rocky Mountain Ecosystem
Coalition. ``But the issue they're dealing with, emissions from oil
and gas facilities, is not a made-up problem. It's very real.''
	   Sawyer says many farmers are worried about emissions of toxic
sulfur dioxide from oil and gas wells. He described the provincial
government as ``captive to the industry'' because oil and gas
underpins Alberta's economy.
	   Alan Johnson, a regional manager for Alberta Energy, said the
company has appointed an ombudsmen to address complaints and gets
along well with most farmers, many of whom allow wells or pipelines
on their land.
	   Residents conveyed exasperation at the slow-moving police
investigation into the attacks.
	   ``People are getting mad,'' said rancher Wade Kyle. ``If
somebody gets killed, they're going to do something about it. I
don't think the law will have any say in what happens.''
	   Police Sgt. Dave MacKay cautioned would-be vigilantes.
	   ``It would be most unfortunate if we wound up having to
prosecute someone who took the law into their own hands,'' he told
an overflow crowd at a community hall in the tiny farming town of
Valhalla.
	   Alberta Energy estimates its losses from sabotage at dlrs 1.5
million and has posted a dlrs 30,000 reward for information leading
to the conviction of those responsible.
	   ``I wouldn't classify it so nicely as eco-terrorism; I would
just say it's terrorism,'' said company spokesman Ed McGillivray.

Malisse upsets No. 1 seed in Mexican Open

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Eighteen-year-old qualifier Xavier Malisse of
Belgium upset top-seeded Felix Mantilla 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-3
Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals of the Mexican Open tennis
tournament.
	   Malisse, ranked 361st on the ATP Tour rankings, broke the
20th-ranked Mantilla in the third game of the final set to provide
the difference. He clinched the match on his third match point.
	   ``Even though I was playing the No. 1 seed, I didn't feel
nervous at all,'' said Malisse, who fired 16 aces in a match he
called the best of his career. ``I've played (Pete) Sampras before,
so now I feel ready to face pretty much everyone.''
	   Also winning second-round matches were qualifier Jordi Burillo
of Spain and Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica. Burillo upset
seventh-seeded Fernando Meligeni 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, while Marin edged
Juan Albert Viloca 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1).

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ A slowly weakening Hurricane Mitch
lashed the Honduran coast, toppling trees, sweeping away bridges,
flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people.
	   The storm was almost stationary over the Bay Islands, a popular
Honduran tourist area. It also was only 25 miles (40 kilometers)
off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105
miles (165 kilometers) from the storm's center. That meant the
Honduran coast had been under hurricane conditions for more than a
day.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island who was within miles of the eye
of the hurricane. ``Few houses have remained standing.''
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph winds. By 0000 GMT, the
storm still packed a punch, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center
said its brush with land had slowed the winds to 105 mph (165 kph).
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   The rainfall _ up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) in mountain
areas _ began to take a toll. More than 50 rivers had overran their
banks, and the government evacuated more than 45,000 people from
low-lying areas, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel, chief of the
National Emergency Committee.
	   Many towns were cut off by washed-out roads and downed bridges,
and severed phone lines on the Bay Islands, making it difficult to
gauge the extent of the damage. The government said 72,000 people
were forced to flee their homes.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development announced it had
sent two helicopters each to Belize and Honduras to help in search,
rescue and relief efforts.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared the Caribbean coast a
disaster zone, and officials said 23 people had died in Honduras
alone, including 14 on Guanaja.
	   Five people were killed in La Ceiba, including three police
officers swept into a river in their car, said regional police
chief Maria Lisa Borjas. Four deaths were reported in Honduras
earlier in the week.

NBA cancels rest of games for November, talks continue
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern cut two more weeks off the National
Basketball Association schedule, debated the finer points of the
lockout with Michael Jordan, and then met with the players to see
if the sides could compromise on the ``guts'' of a new deal.
	   ``I feel neither optimism nor pessimism. I just think that we've
got to talk,'' the NBA commissioner said Wednesday. ``We may have
the skeleton of a deal, But in terms of a hard negotiation on the
guts of this deal, I would say we're no place yet.''
	   The cancellations, which wiped out the rest of the November
schedule, came after a meeting of the league's Board of Governors
at which some owners asked when the ``drop dead'' date would be for
losing the entire regular season.
	   Stern said he did not want to set a deadline.
	   ``One, we want to be ready to be imaginative,'' he said. ``Two,
we don't want to make threats; we want to make a deal.''
	   With that, he and the owners' negotiating committee walked out
of their news conference, took an elevator three flights up, and
went into a conference room where about 100 players had been
meeting.
	   According to several sources who were in the room and spoke to
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, Jordan, Washington
Wizards owners Abe Pollin and Stern had one of the most heated
exchanges after Jordan asked why increases in franchise values were
not being figured into profitability calculations.
	   After that 90-minute question-and-answer meeting, the sides
resumed formal negotiations on Wednesday afternoon at a Manhattan
law office and were still meeting late Wednesday.
	   ``We've been trying to take steps to bridge the gap. Now the
shoe is on the other foot,'' union president Patrick Ewing said.
``In my negotiating with the Knicks, they always told me one side
cannot monopolize the whole thing. It needs to be a win-win
situation.''
	   Two weeks' worth of games already had been scrapped, and now the
season can't begin until Dec. 1 at the earliest.
	   Stern did say, however, that the league and union would discuss
``recapturing'' games. That was a change from two weeks ago, when
the league announced the first set of cancellations and said the
games would not be made up.
	   ``They had told us about games being recaptured. We knew that,''
said Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the union. ``You
can add (games) on later, or put more into the schedule.''
	   Until this labor dispute, the league had never lost a game to a
work stoppage.
	   In all, 194 games have been lost with the latest cancellation of
95 games. Each team's 82-game schedule has now been whittled to
about 68 games, and the players have lost about dlrs 200 million in
salaries.
	   Wednesday's meetings were the third straight day of talks, and
the sides have moved closer to an agreement on the framework _ or
``skeleton _ of the next agreement. For the first two or three
years, there will be a luxury tax on the highest contracts. If that
system did not reduce the amount of revenues being devoted to
salaries, a modified hard cap would be implemented under which
players would put 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow fund.

Police probe Brazil-Israel prostitution racket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Police began probing a
prostitution racket that allegedly lures women from Brazil to
Israel after one was found dead, according to a newspaper report
Wednesday.
	   Eight Brazilian women have been ``rescued'' from the operation
in Tel Aviv since Kelly Fernanda Martins, 26, died last week, the
daily O Globo newspaper said. It was not clear how she died.
	   The women were lured to Israel under the promise of well-paid
work as nannies or bar staff but instead were drugged and forced to
prostitute themselves, the newspaper said.
	   A Rio Federal Police spokesman who declined to give his name
refused to comment on the case over the telephone, citing its
sensitive nature.
	   Television pictures on Wednesday showed Martins' mother weeping
at her daughter's funeral in Rio. Her body was flown home on
Tuesday.
	   The eight women were being protected by police and Brazilian
embassy staff in Tel Aviv, Israel, according to the newspaper.

Hoping to get IMF bailout, Brazil unveils austerity plan

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's long-awaited plan to confront
its financial crisis offers a mix of spending cuts and higher taxes
that will affect corporations, civil servants and almost anyone
with a bank account.
	   The government hopes to save nearly dlrs 24 billion next year
with the austerity plan and qualify Brazil for a rescue package
being assembled by the International Monetary Fund.
	   The IMF had insisted on a tough and realistic plan to slash
Brazil's budget deficit before going ahead with the dlrs 30 billion
rescue plan, which many see as an essential step in containing the
spreading global financial crisis that has already hit Asia and
Russia.
	   The IMF, in a statement issued in Washington, said Brazil's
measures ``represent important progress in the implementation of
Brazil's stabilization and reform program, which will be supported
by the IMF and other members of the international community.''
	   Still, the more controversial steps, including an unprecedented
tax on social security pensions, face an uphill battle in Brazil's
congress. ``Our destiny is in our own hands,'' Finance Minister
Pedro Malan said in a nationally televised address Wednesday.
	   ``We have every condition to confront the current turbulence
through our own action,'' he said. ``If we can't convince
ourselves, we won't convince others.''
	   The government hopes the austerity plan and the expected IMF aid
package will be enough to stanch the drawdown of the country's
foreign reserves, which dropped below dlrs 45 billion from dlrs 70
billion at the end of July. The outflow of foreign currency was
still strong Wednesday. Financial sources said up to dlrs 800
million left the country, doubling Tuesday's dlrs 440 million
outflow.
	   But if the outflow is slowed, the government can lower interest
rates _ which have been increased to around 50 percent a year _ and
avoid devaluating the currency.
	   ``We will guarantee the purchase power of the real ... and are
exchange policy will remain as it is,'' Malan said, denying rumors
of a devaluation that rocked Brazilian and markets Tuesday. Wall
Street was also unsettled by the rumors of a Brazilian devaluation.
	   Much of the country stopped Wednesday morning to watch Malan
speak on television. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's
largest, postponed its opening by an hour to wait for the speech.
	   Investors seemed to like what they heard. The Bovespa index was
up 3 percent after the news, although at close of trading, prices
had dropped to 0.6 percent below Tuesday's close.
	   Private economists, however, remained skeptical about the
prospects for the plan, especially given Brazil's failure to follow
through on many of the austerity measures it promised last fall.
	   ``The package of measures is not much different from so many
others that have failed in the past, said Denisard Alves, chairman
of the economics department at the University of Sao Paulo.
``Congress will most likely oppose much of the package and doom it
to failure.''
	   In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin welcomed Brazil's
efforts to get its economy back on track, but urged the government
to follow through on its promises.
	   ``It is essential that Brazil implement their program promptly
and convincingly. Confidence and stability in Brazil is very
important to American economic interests and to the economy of the
hemisphere and the world,'' Rubin said.
	   In a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso said the plan was conceived so it ``won't
burden the poor.'' He said that's why there was no increase in
income tax.
	   But the poor surely will be affected, if only indirectly. The
cuts will affect all areas, including already precarious public
schools and hospitals.
	   A big chunk of the savings would come from an increase in a tax
on all financial transactions, from checks to bank withdrawals to
stock market investments. The plan would raise the tax paid on
those transactions to 0.38 percent from 0.2 percent now, declining
to 0.3 percent in 2000.
	   A corporate tax intended for the social security system will
rise to 3 percent from 2 percent, and the government will submit a
bill to levy the tax on banks, too.
	   ``It's a hard blow, we really didn't expect this to happen,''
said Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, owner of Votorantim group, Brazil's
largest business conglomerate.
	   The most sensitive measure, however, would raise the social
security tax paid by government employees and _ for the first time
_ collect the tax from retired civil servants. The extra revenue is
expected to come to 2.6 billion reals (dlrs 2.2 billion).
	   Both Cardoso and Malan said social security payments to civil
servants was the single biggest drain on the budget. This year, the
total social security deficit for civil servants comes to dlrs 29
billion (34.4 billion reals).
	   But government employees have almost sacred-cow status in
Brazil, and the proposal is likely to face constitutional
challenges.
	   ``The package is recessive and unjust,'' said Jose Genonio a
congressman with the opposition Workers' Party. ``We are not going
to negotiate this package, we are going to oppose it all the way.''

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ A slowly weakening Hurricane Mitch
lashed the Honduran coast, toppling trees, sweeping away bridges,
flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people.
	   The storm was almost stationary over the Bay Islands, a popular
Honduran tourist area. It also was only 25 miles (40 kilometers)
off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 60 miles
(95 kms) from the storm's center by Wednesday night. That meant the
Honduran coast had been under hurricane conditions for more than a
day.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island who was within miles of the eye
of the hurricane. ``Few houses have remained standing.''
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph winds. By 0300 GMT
Thursday, the storm still packed a punch, but the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said its brush with land had slowed the winds to
100 mph (160 kph).

Nine security force members killed, 16 wounded during rebel attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ At least seven soldiers and two police
officers were killed and 16 wounded during an attack on a
northeastern town by more than 150 leftist rebels, authorities
said.
	   The rebel column attacked the police station Tuesday in Hacari,
260 miles (420 kilometers) north of Bogota, using homemade bombs
and tear gas, police said Wednesday.
	   Two police officers were killed and seven injured. The station
was destroyed.
	   A column of soldiers coming to the aid of the besieged police
entered a mine field. Seven soldiers were killed, and nine were
wounded, said Gen. Ivan Ramirez, the army's deputy commander.
	   He did not say whether the mines had been planted by the rebels
or the military.
	   The attack occurred while President Andres Pastrana, who is on
the verge of beginning peace talks with rebels, was on a state
visit to Washington. None of Colombia's rebel groups has so far
agreed to a cease-fire during planned talks.
	   Ramirez said the rebel force was composed mostly of members of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's
main guerrilla group with some 15,000 fighters. The other rebels
were from the National Liberation Army, the second-largest band,
and the smaller People's Liberation Army.
	   The army said it could not confirm Colombian media reports that
eight rebels were killed.

Hundreds of whales die after becoming stranded on New Zealand

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ More than 250 pilot whales died
after becoming stranded on a beach on New Zealand's Stewart Island,
government officials said Thursday.
	   The stranding is the second largest on record in New Zealand,
said Dave Taylor of the Department of Conservation.
	   A hunting party found about 300 whales beached at remote
Doughboy Bay in the southwest of the island, off New Zealand's
southern tip, late on Wednesday.
	   When department staff flew over the site at dawn Thursday only
60 whales were alive. Eighteen more had died by late morning.
	   ``The whales are reported to be in a tight group and are hard
aground at the southern end of the bay,'' Taylor said.
	   The remoteness of the site was inhibiting conservation officers
from assisting the remaining whales, Taylor said.
	   Pilot whales are widespread in the Pacific. They travel in large
herds of several hundred and have a tendency to strand in groups in
shallow sandy bays, he said.
	   Samples would be taken from the dead whales in an effort to
determine the cause of the stranding.
	   The mass stranding is the second by whales traveling in the
Tasman Sea within two weeks.
	   On Oct. 17, at least 100 pilot whales died after a series of
strandings at beaches on the Australian island state of Tasmania.
	   Experts remained puzzled as to why the whales blindly returned
to deadly shallows. Theories include that one whale is beached by
accident while chasing food, then attracts the others in its pod
with its distress cries.

Stolen spear may bring bad luck to thief, Aboriginal owner warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ An Aboriginal spear believed to have
been stolen from a hotel lobby in May could bring bad luck to the
thief, the spear's owner warned Thursday.
	   The spear was used as a promotional tool for The Tall
Australian, a company that sells products made from native
Australian animals, at a dinner at the Hilton Hotel, but was
missing when the organizers cleared up that night.
	   The Tall Australian director Geoff Lean said he had borrowed the
spear from a friend and that she had asked him to warn the public
that stealing the spear would bring bad luck.
	   ``She said she had a responsibility to warn the person (who
stole the spear),'' Lean said.
	   ``It's a very awkward situation for myself as she would not have
lent it to anybody else except me,'' he said.
	   Lean said he was unsure if the spear would bring bad luck, but
that he believed there were powers Aborigines understood that white
people did not.
	   ``I do believe in the spirituality of the Aborigines. They do
have an affinity with the earth that is something the white man
does not have or has not developed,'' Lean said.
	   He said the spear was about 1.2 meters (yards) long, designed
for hunting with a barbed hook and kangaroo sinews attached to one
end.
	   Lean said the spear was potentially valuable to collectors.
	   ``Anybody who knows about these things would know it's valuable,
it was the real thing, there is a huge market in Aboriginal
artifacts,'' he said.
	   He asked for anyone who knew the spear's whereabouts to return
it to a police station or to The Tall Australian, with no questions
asked.

Four North Koreans defect to Seoul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Four North Koreans arrived in Seoul
Thursday after fleeing their hunger-stricken communist homeland,
government intelligence officials said.
	   The four flew in from former Soviet republics where they had
lived in hiding after escaping North Korea a few years back, said
the officials at the Agency for National Security Planning.
	   Their flight to Seoul was coordinated by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, they said.
	   The officials did not identify the four escapees and the former
Soviet republics from which they defected.
	   About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
three years, including 56 so far this year. All complained about
severe food and fuel shortages in their country.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with magnitude of third tremor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Three earthquakes shook remote
Indonesian islands, but there were no reports of injuries or
damage, seismologists said Thursday.
	   The tremors hit northeast Indonesia on Wednesday, with the
strongest rocking Ternate Island in northern Maluku at 11:25 p.m.
(1625 GMT), Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Bureau said.
Startled residents ran out of their houses.
	   The 6.3 magnitude quake was centered in the Maluku Sea, 140
kilometers (87 miles) west of Ternate. The island, 2,400 kilometers
(1,500 miles) northeast of Jakarta, was also hit by 5.6 and 5.2
tremors earlier in the day.
	   A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage if
centered near an urban area.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from the Americas across to Japan, through
Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and New Zealand.

<TEXT>
	   SUNRISE, Florida (AP) _ Tomas Holmstrom scored two power-play
goals and Nicklas Lidstrom had a goal and two assists as the
Detroit Red Wings beat the Florida Panthers 7-2 Wednesday night.
	   Sergei Fedorov, Darren McCarty, Steve Yzerman and Kirk Maltby
also scored as the Red Wings (6-2-0) won for the second time in
three games since Scotty Bowman returned as coach.
	   Bowman, the NHL's winningest coach with 1,059 victories, missed
the season's first five games as he recuperated from offseason
angioplasty and surgery to replace his left knee.
	   The Red Wings' seven goals were a season high and the most given
up by the Panthers since a 7-3 loss to Philadelphia last April 16,
their final game at Miami Arena.
	   Radek Dvorak and Jaroslav Spacek scored for Florida (2-2-3),
which had its second straight poor outing at home. The Panthers
lost 5-0 to Vancouver last Friday.
 &UR; Hurricanes 2, Blackhawks 0
	   In GREENSBORO, North Carolina, Sami Kapanen returned from a knee
injury to score in his fourth straight game and Arturs Irbe got his
14th career shutout as the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Chicago
Blackhawks.
	   Kapanen, who sat out Sunday's 3-2 home loss against Los Angeles
with a bruised knee, scored the game-winner with 5:48 left in the
second on a feed from Ron Francis, who had knocked Christian
Laflamme off the puck behind Chicago goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick.
	   Francis scored an empty-net goal with 19.9 seconds left.
	   It was the first game coach Paul Maurice had Kapanen and Gary
Roberts paired with Francis in an attempt to create more scoring
chances.
 &UR; Bruins 9, Canadiens 2
	   In Montreal, the Boston Bruins scored three times on the power
play after defenseman Dave Manson was ejected for elbowing
Per-Johan Axelsson in the head in a win over the Montreal
Canadiens.
	   Peter Ferraro, Dmitri Khristich and Grant Ledyard scored
power-play goals in a 51-second span of the second period after
Manson was tossed for slamming Axelsson's head into the glass
behind the Montreal net.
	   The Bruins had already taken a 3-0 lead in the first period on
goals from Ted Donato, Chris Taylor and Sergei Samsonov.
	   Ferraro added his second of the game in the third period and
Jason Allison added a pair of late power-play goals for Boston.
Mark Recchi and Matt Higgins score Montreal.
 &UR; Kings 4, Devils 0
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Stephane Fiset and Manny Legace
combined to stop 40 shots and the Los Angeles Kings capitalized on
two errors by Devils defenseman Sheldon Souray to beat New Jersey.
	   Craig Johnson scored on a 2-on-1 break in the first period and
defenseman Rob Blake scored a shorthanded goal in the second by
taking advantage of Souray's mistakes.
	   Defenseman Steve Duchesne and Vladimir Tsyplakov scored in the
third period as the Kings closed out a five-game road trip with a
2-2-1 record.
	   The shutout was the first of the season for Los Angeles and it
came in a game where it was outshot 40-18. It was the second shared
shutout in Kings history. Mario Lessard and Doug Keans beat Boston
3-0 on Feb. 20, 1980.

Toronto Star owners make hostile bid for Canadian tabloid chain
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The owners of the Toronto Star, Canada's
best-selling newspaper, launched a hostile bid to take over Sun
Media Corp., owner of a chain of popular tabloids, in the latest
phase of an upheaval in Canada's newspaper industry.
	   The bid Wednesday by Torstar Corp., offering dlrs 486 million,
came a day after Canada's biggest newspaper group, Southam Inc.,
entered the Toronto market with publication of a new national
daily, the National Post.
	   The National Post is expected to be a major competitor to the
all three of the established Toronto dailies _ the nationally
circulated Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star and the Toronto Sun,
flagship of the Sun chain.
	   Toronto Star publisher John Honderich said the takeover would
help Torstar compete with Conrad Black, the publishing magnate
whose Hollinger and Southam companies control 58 of Canada's 105
daily newspapers.
	   ``At the current time we have one very large newspaper chain,
Southam-Hollinger,'' Honderich told a news conference. ``What this
does is create the opportunity for a very viable alternative.''
	   Sun Media, Canada's second-largest newspaper chain in terms of
circulation, publishes 15 dailies, including tabloids in Toronto,
Edmonton, Ottawa and Calgary.
	   Paul Godfrey, Sun Media's chief executive, said he was surprised
by Torstar's announcement.
	   ``We have a responsibility, a legal responsibility, to call our
boards together to present what the Star has offered and take a
look at it,'' Godfrey said.
	   If successful, Torstar's bid would give it 26 percent of the
average weekly circulation of daily newspapers in Canada. This
compares with the 42 percent for the papers owned by Black's
Hollinger and Southam groups.
	   ``This initiative is good for both companies,'' Torstar
president David Galloway told a news conference. ``It strengthens
the long-term position of two of the most distinctive voices on the
Canadian print media scene.''
	   If the takeover succeeds, the Sun tabloids would operate as a
separate division of Torstar, he said.
	   The Toronto Star's daily circulation is about 450,000, while the
Toronto Sun's is about 240,000.

European Commission president arrives in China for 6-day visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques Santer
arrived in Beijing Thursday for a six-day visit to strengthen ties
between China and Europe.
	   Santer was scheduled to begin his trip with a speech to the
National School of Administration and a meeting with the country's
central bank chief, Dai Xianglong. He was to meet Premier Zhu
Rongji, who directs China's economic reforms, on Friday.
	   Talks on China's bid to join the World Trade Organization were
likely to be on the agenda. Senior EU officials previously have
tried to coax Beijing into concessions to further its bid to enter
the global trade rules-making body.
	   Foreign Ministry and EU officials would not immediately comment
on whether Santer would discuss the question of WTO entry.
	   Over the past two years, China has aggressively wooed European
countries to improve trade and investment.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang recently said that
under a global economy and in a multipolar world, it made good
sense for Beijing to strengthen cooperation with Europe.
	   Santer also was scheduled to visit the industrial city of Wuhan
in central China; Shanghai, the country's commercial and industrial
center; and Hong Kong.

Teased about being gay, Thai father suffocates son
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai man, angered over teasing by
friends that he might be homosexual, beat and then suffocated his
11-year-old son, local papers reported on Thursday.
	   Thavorn Kulsuwan, 37, was arrested and charged with murder on
Wednesday. He had beaten his son Apirat, suffocated him with a
pillow, then tied up the already dead boy in wires and gave him
electric shocks, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   Rates of child abuse in Thailand are very high, according to
children's rights activists. One reason they have cited is that in
many Thai families children are viewed as property.
	   Thavorn told police he was under stress because friends had
teased him that he might be gay and because he suspected his
estranged wife was seeing another man, the Post said.
	   Police said the father appeared to be very drunk when they
arrived at his home, according to the paper. His estranged wife
told police he was mentally ill and an alcoholic, the paper said.

Australian fullback Burke out for an extra six weeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Injured Australian rugby union fullback
Matthew Burke will return to action six weeks later than expected
in a bid to be fit for next year's World Cup.
	   Burke had a shoulder reconstruction after badly dislocating his
right shoulder while scoring the match-winning try against New
Zealand in Sydney in August.
	   He was forced out of the Australian team for three World Cup
qualifiers in September and will miss November's short tour of
France and England.
	   The normal recovery time from such an operation is six months,
which meant Burke was originally expected to play for New South
Wales in the second round of the Super 12 in early March.
	   But Australian rugby union doctor John Best said Burke would now
wait at least an extra six weeks before returning. He is now
expected back for New South Wales' eighth round clash with ACT
Brumbies in Canberra on April 17.
	   Burke is expected to be fully fit for the Rugby World Cup, to be
held in Britain and France in October, 1999.
	   ``The World Cup is obviously very important and the main thing
is that I get the strength back in the shoulder and the confidence
to use it, so if that means missing some Super 12 matches then
that's how it has to be,'' Burke said.
	   The injury-plagued fullback had a similar reconstruction on his
left shoulder earlier in his career.
	   Meanwhile, Australian winger Ben Tune, who had surgery on his
knee a month ago for tendinitis, expects to return for Queensland's
opening Super 12 match against Wellington in Brisbane on Feb. 27.

High Court overturns Pinochet's arrest

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite winning his first battle against
extradition to Spain, Gen. Augusto Pinochet's hopes of being
whisked home to Chile immediately must wait.
	   The High Court on Wednesday rejected two arrest warrants from a
Spanish magistrate seeking Pinochet's extradition to face charges
of murder, torture and kidnapping of political opponents during his
17-year rule. The court said the former dictator is immune from
criminal prosecution in Britain because the alleged crimes occurred
while he was head of state. Pinochet also won repayment of his
legal costs, estimated to be 350,000 pounds (dlrs 560,000).
	   Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said, however, that Pinochet
must remain in custody pending an appeal by prosecutors to the
House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   Prosecutors said they will file an urgent appeal Monday. It is
uncertain how long the ruling will take. Predictions in the British
media ranged from next week to several weeks.
	   Meantime, Pinochet's lawyers asked for his release on bail. A
bail hearing was scheduled for Friday. Magistrates said they would
consider holding the hearing at the private London hospital where
Pinochet is recovering from back surgery Oct. 9.
	   He has been detained there since his arrest by British
authorities Oct. 16 at the request of a Spanish judge who alleges
Pinochet, during his rule from 1973 until 1990, was responsible for
up to 4,000 murders, including at least one in the United States,
and sent agents to Spain to kill opponents.
	   In his ruling, Britain's most senior judge said it was ``of
course a matter for acute public concern that those who abuse
sovereign power to commit crimes against humanity should not escape
trial and appropriate punishment.''
	   But nothing, including the charter establishing the
International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945, invalidated
the principle ``that one sovereign state will not impugn another in
relation to its sovereign acts,'' Bingham said.
	   Bingham said he gave British prosecutors permission to appeal
because of the ``obvious public importance and international
interest ... as to the outcome'' of the case.
	   In editorials Thursday, The Times newspaper said ``the Lords
have a duty to issue an unambiguous judgment as swiftly as
possible.'' The Guardian newspaper said ``given the unanimity of
the High Court judges, it is unlikely that their view will be
overturned.''
	   In Madrid, Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon had no immediate
comment. His lawyers criticized the ruling but hoped for a reversal
on appeal.
	   Arguing that international law clearly rules out immunity in
cases of crimes against humanity, Virginia Diaz said lawyers
working for Pinochet's extradition were surprised by the ruling.
	   Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramon de Miguel expressed the
government's ``profound institutional respect'' for the British
decision, the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
	   The Chilean deputy foreign minister, Mariano Fenandez, said his
country does not blame Britain for detaining Pinochet. Chile is
``not a culture for victories and defeats,'' he said.
	   Chile is just happy the court recognized the immunity claim, he
said.
	   Amnesty International called the decision ``an alarming setback
in the struggle against impunity.''
	   Demonstrators angered by the ruling jeered Wednesday as
Pinochet's wife, Lucia, and their three children entered the
clinic. Some yelled ``asesina'' _ Spanish for ``killer.''
	   Outside the Chilean Embassy, several scuffles broke out as
police prevented jeering protesters from entering the building or
blocking the path of Chilean government officials.
	   In Chile, reaction was divided. In the affluent neighborhoods of
Santiago, drivers honked their horns in celebration, while young
members of the Communist Party chanted anti-Pinochet slogans
outside the downtown presidential palace.
	   The British government, which has defended its handling of the
case, refused comment..
	   Pinochet won another victory Wednesday, when Britain's Attorney
General rejected a bid by four Chilean exiles to have him tried in
Britain on torture charges, saying there was ``insufficient
admissible evidence.''
	   Similar filings are being pursued in Sweden, Switzerland and
France.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern cut two more weeks off the NBA
schedule, debated the finer points of the lockout with Michael
Jordan, and then met with the players to see if the sides could
compromise on the ``guts'' of a new deal.
	   ``I feel neither optimism nor pessimism. I just think that we've
got to talk,'' the NBA commissioner said. ``We may have the
skeleton of a deal, But in terms of a hard negotiation on the guts
of this deal, I would say we're no place yet.''
	   The cancellations, which wiped out the rest of the November
schedule, came after a meeting of the league's Board of Governors
at which some owners asked when the ``drop dead'' date would be for
losing the entire regular season.
	   Stern said he did not want to set a deadline.
	   ``One, we want to be ready to be imaginative,'' he said. ``Two,
we don't want to make threats; we want to make a deal.''
	   With that, he and the owners' negotiating committee walked out
of their news conference, took an elevator three flights up, and
went into a conference room where about 100 players had been
meeting.
	   According to several sources who were in the room and spoke to
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, Jordan, Washington
Wizards owners Abe Pollin and Stern had one of the most heated
exchanges after Jordan asked why increases in franchise values were
not being figured into profitability calculations.
	   After that 90-minute question-and-answer meeting, the sides
resumed formal negotiations at 2200 GMT Wednesday at a Manhattan
law office and were still meeting six hours later.
	   Asked if a deal could be completed by the end of the night, a
source involved in the talks said: ``It's conceivable, but not
likely.''
	   ``We've been trying, 9th graf pvs.

Japanese pro-soccer clubs to merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokohama Marinos and Yokohama Flugels, two clubs in
Japan's 18-team first-division professional soccer league, have
agreed to merge and form a new team for next season, a spokeswoman
said Thursday.
	   Marinos is wholly owned by Nissan Motor Co., while Flugels is
owned by All Nippon Airways and major construction company Sato
Kogyo Co. Both clubs are based in Yokohama, just west of Tokyo.
	   Marinos spokeswoman Kaori Yuo declined to comment on the deal,
but said details will be disclosed at a news conference scheduled
for later Thursday.
	   The new club, whose name has yet to be announced, will be owned
70 percent by Nissan and the rest by ANA, while Sato plans to
relinquish its stake, the mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper
reported.
	   The clubs say the merger aims to create a stronger team ahead of
the 2002 World Cup, which Japan and South Korea will co-host, but
the deal is widely believed to be an effort to restructure amid
Japan's prolonged economic slump, the Yomiuri said.
	   Marinos, who clinched the J-League title in 1995, have a number
of World Cup team players on their roster, including Shoji Jo and
Masami Ihara. The club currently ranks fourth in the league, while
Flugels are 14th.

	   VALHALLA, Alberta (AP) _ It's called the Peace Country, a swath
of forest and farmland seemingly far from harm's way, an unlikely
setting for the most sustained campaign of anti-industry sabotage
ever waged in Canada.
	   In the past 2 1/2 years, energy and forestry companies in the
sparsely populated region of northwest Alberta have been hit by
more than 160 attacks, ranging from pesky vandalism to powerful
bombings of oil-well sites.
	   No one has been injured yet, but employees of natural resource
companies consider themselves targets of what they are calling
industrial terrorism.
	   Residents in the attack zone around the area named for the Peace
River are edgy, some even suggesting vigilante action. After the
latest bombing, hundreds crowded into public meetings last week to
be briefed by a terrorism expert, counseled by a psychologist on
coping with stress, and urged by a police officer to report
suspicious activities.
	   ``We've seen the gradual unraveling of trust, friendship and
neighborliness in recent months,'' said Roy Borstad, a county
official. ``Several times, just when we thought things couldn't get
worse, they did just that.''
	   There is little doubt in the region that the sabotage is linked
to anger among some landowners over fast-paced natural-resource
development. Though forestry companies have faced some minor
harassment, the harshest complaints have been directed at the
energy industry by farmers who say pollutants from oil and gas
sites are contaminating their land and causing serious health
problems.
	   In August, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested the most
outspoken of these farmers, former evangelical pastor Wiebo Ludwig,
along with his wife, his son and a family friend. They were accused
of bombing an oil well site, but the charges were dropped for lack
of evidence.
	   Ludwig, 56, moved to the Peace Country from Ontario 13 years
ago. He is patriarch of a clan that numbers more than 30 on a farm
in Hythe, 300 miles (480 kilometers) northwest of Edmonton.
	   An outspoken advocate of land conservation, he blames oil and
gas projects that now encircle his 316-acre farm for killing
livestock and causing three miscarriages among women in his clan.
	   Ludwig has battled in vain for government hearings on the health
effects of gas production.
	   Though he has never claimed responsibility for any attacks,
Ludwig says he is aware of ``underground activity'' and depicts
sabotage legitimate self-defense against pollution that authorities
fail to curtail.
	   The company targeted most often, Alberta Energy Co., tried to
buy out Ludwig, offering dlrs 520,000 if his clan left the
province. The deal collapsed.
	   Ludwig recently suggested that oil executives _ ``men in
pinstripe suits'' _ might become targets. Police termed the comment
``anti-Canadian,'' but took no action.
	   He later showed up in central Alberta for the court appearance
of a farmer charged with murdering an oil executive. Reminded of
his warnings about violence, Ludwig said, ``Inadvertently, I guess
it was a prophecy.''
	   Some environmental groups, while distancing themselves from the
sabotage campaign, empathize with landowners.
	   ``It's easy to discount the Ludwigs as lunatics,'' said Mike
Sawyer, director of the Calgary-based Rocky Mountain Ecosystem
Coalition. ``But the issue they're dealing with, emissions from oil
and gas facilities, is not a made-up problem. It's very real.''
	   Sawyer says many farmers are worried about emissions of toxic
sulfur dioxide from oil and gas wells. He described the provincial
government as ``captive to the industry'' because oil and gas
underpins Alberta's economy.
	   Alan Johnson, a regional manager for Alberta Energy, said the
company has appointed an ombudsmen to address complaints and gets
along well with most farmers, many of whom allow wells or pipelines
on their land.
	   Residents conveyed exasperation at the slow-moving police
investigation into the attacks.
	   ``People are getting mad,'' said rancher Wade Kyle. ``If
somebody gets killed, they're going to do something about it. I
don't think the law will have any say in what happens.''
	   Police Sgt. Dave MacKay cautioned would-be vigilantes.
	   ``It would be most unfortunate if we wound up having to
prosecute someone who took the law into their own hands,'' he told
an overflow crowd at a community hall in the tiny farming town of
Valhalla.
	   Alberta Energy estimates its losses from sabotage at dlrs 1.5
million and has posted a dlrs 30,000 reward for information leading
to the conviction of those responsible.
	   ``I wouldn't classify it so nicely as eco-terrorism; I would
just say it's terrorism,'' said company spokesman Ed McGillivray.

Cuba says budget deficit may be lower than forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban officials said the country may achieve
a lower budget deficit than originally forecast.
	   The domestic Agencia de Informacion Nacional on Wednesday quoted
unnamed sources in the Finance Ministry. The report was summarized
by the government's Prensa Latina news agency, monitored here.
	   It did not specify what the deficit might be, but noted that
earlier projections had been for a 710 million peso deficit _ equal
to the same number of dollars at the official rate and to roughly
dlrs 36 million at the free market rate.
	   The projected figure was expected to be 2 to 3 percent of gross
domestic product.
	   Battered by the loss of socialist aid and trading partners at
the start of the decade, Cuban officials have tried to slash
subsidies to the dominant state sector and encourage state
companies to try to sell to the growing tourist and export markets.
	   The budget deficit in 1993, at the pit of the country's economic
crisis, was more than 5 billion pesos _ 35.5 percent of gross
domestic product.
	   Prensa Latina also quoted Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos as
saying that income from his sector was expected to reach dlrs 1.8
billion this year, up from dlrs 1.5 billion last year.
	   Last year's figure represented 42 percent of the country's hard
currency income, Cienfuegos noted at a news conference in Havana,
though the industry also spends heavily in hard currency.
	   Cuba hopes to receive 2 million visitors in the year 2000 after
heavily promoting the sector.

Singapore economy shrinks, unemployment rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Releasing data showing a shrinking economy and
rising unemployment, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Thursday his country is under increasing external pressure.
	   Goh said preliminary data showed gross domestic product shrank
1.5 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last
year, Singapore's first such contraction since its last recession
in the mid-1980s.
	   ``Every now and then, a people is faced with a crucial test,''
Goh told a gathering of union leaders. ``We are now faced with such
a test.''
	   Singapore's economy has steadily slowed since the start of the
regional crisis. GDP grew 6.1 percent in the first quarter and 1.6
percent in the second. As the economy weakens, joblessness has
increased.
	   Minister for Manpower Lee Boon Yang said that based on early
data, unemployment rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.5
percent in September, nearly double the 2.3 percent in June.
	   About 20,000 workers lost their jobs in the first nine months of
the year, equaling the record number of layoffs during Singapore's
last recession, said Lee, who described the figure as ``extremely
high'' compared with last year's total of 9,874 layoffs.
	   Goh identified three main culprits for Singapore's recent pain:
shrinking regional demand for its products and services; a global
downturn in industries like electronics, which accounts for 77
percent of Singapore's domestic manufacturing exports; and slumping
demand hurting corporate earnings, which have on average plunged 55
percent in the first half of 1998.
	   The government's most recent forecast for 1998 estimated growth
between 0.5 to 1.5 percent, well off the healthy 7.8 percent
increase last year.
	   Speaking to reporters at the union gathering, Trade and Industry
Minister Lee Yock Suan said the economy should meet the official
forecast, though many private economists have predicted a slight
overall contraction for the year.
	   Goh said the government's ``top priority is to help companies
survive the harsh market conditions'' in order ``to save and create
jobs.''
	   Since much of Singapore's problems are external and therefore
out of its control, Goh said the government must focus on
``sharply'' reducing the cost of doing business here, which has
risen compared to many of its Asian competitors.
	   Ruling out a competitive devaluation of its currency or the
adoption of market and capital controls, he recommended slashing
labor costs ``substantially'' by scrapping most pay raises and
other variable pay components, and reducing by half the 20 percent
salary contribution from employers to the state-run mandatory
pension fund.
	   Goh said odds were 1-in-5 that another ``financial typhoon''
will sweep through the region, also saying that Singapore must
prepare for that eventuality.
