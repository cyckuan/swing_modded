Williams joins Davenport in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Williams defeating Seles. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Venus Williams slammed 12 aces,
including one on the first point of the match and another on the
final point, to beat Monica Seles 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday night in the
Bank of the West semifinals.
	   Williams, seeded third, will face top-seeded Lindsay Davenport
on Sunday in the final of the dlrs 450,000 tournament. Davenport
beat Steffi Graf 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3 in an afternoon match.
	   Williams dominated on her serve throughout the match. Even when
she wasn't piling up aces, Williams was hitting service winners and
forcing the second-seeded Seles to virtually bunt back other
serves.
	   The only time Seles threatened to break Williams' serve was in
the fourth game of the second set, but Williams fought off three
break points to hold her serve.
	   Williams, 17-1 in tournaments in the United States this year,
went to the side of the court to receive congratulations from her
father, Richard Williams, immediately after the match.
	   It was the first meeting between the players.
	   In the first semifinal, Graf was undermined by unforced errors
and an erratic backhand. Graf's serve remains strong and her
forehand is as dangerous as ever, but a long layoff following knee
surgery has robbed her of the consistency that once was among
Graf's trademarks.
	   Davenport, ranked third in the world, had lost in the semifinals
of this tournament five of the previous six years. She reached her
first final in the event by using her consistent play to take
advantage of Graf's mistakes.
	   ``I think I've picked up my game a lot, I'm a little more
consistent,'' Davenport said. ``People say she (Graf) has been out
for a year and a half and she's not ranked that high anymore, but
it's still a good win.''
	   Graf was seeded fourth despite falling to No. 57 in the world
since having reconstructive left knee surgery last year. The
women's tour has given her a special co-ranking of No. 7 until the
U.S. Open, allowing Graf to be seeded at this and two other
tournaments.
	   Graf has had a difficult recovery from the knee surgery. Her
comeback has been stalled by other injuries, and she became so
frustrated earlier this year that she considered retiring.
	   She said Saturday's match, which lasted more than two hours in
intense heat, was a good way of judging how far she still has to go
in her comeback.
	   ``I haven't had a lot of matches or three setters in the past 1{
years, so it's definitely something that makes me realize what I
have to work on,'' said Graf, who was cramping in both legs in the
third set. ``There are a few things that I have to work on _
definitely return of serve.''
	   Graf said she just ran out of energy in the final set.
	   ``I wish I would have had something left in the third set,'' she
said. ``In the third set, from 3-all on I didn't know how to move
anymore.''
	   The players stayed on serve in the third set until Davenport
broke in the eighth game to go up 5-3. She then served out the
match, getting to match point on a net cord and wrapping up the
victory with an overhead putaway.
	   ``It's sometimes just a matter of a few points that make the
difference in the match,'' Davenport said. ``I was really
struggling to hold my serve the whole third set, but luckily I got
one break and it was all over.''

UNDATED: victories snapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Tigers 8, Devil Rays 0 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, switch-hitter Tony Clark set an AL
record by homering from both sides of the plate for the third time
this year and Brian Moehler pitched his league-leading third
shutout for Detroit.
	   Moehler (12-7) pitched a five-hitter as the Tigers stopped a
four-game losing streak and ended the Devil Rays' six-game home
winning string.
	   Clark hit a two-run homer right-handed off Wilson Alvarez (5-9)
during a four-run first inning. He added a left-handed solo shot
off Rick White in the seventh.
	   Clark extended his hitting streak to a career-best 13 games.
	   Moehler has won three of his past five road starts after
starting the season 0-5 away from Tiger Stadium. He struck out four
and walked one.
	   Gabe Alvarez drove in four runs, his fourth four-RBI game since
being recall from Triple-A Toledo on June 22.
 &UR; Rangers 8, White Sox 1
	   In Arlington, Texas, newly-acquired Todd Zeile went 3-for-4 with
a homer and three RBIs as the Rangers moved into a first-place tie
with Anaheim in the AL West.
	   Royce Clayton, who came to the Rangers with pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre in a trade with St. Louis, singled, stole second and
scored in the first, and added a fourth-inning sacrifice fly.
	   Rick Helling (14-6) allowed eight hits but only one run over
five innings as the White Sox stranded eight runners. Helling
struck out six and walked two.
	   Mike Sirotka (10-10) allowed five runs and nine hits over five
innings, struck out two and walked one.
	   The Rangers scored three in the eighth on an RBI single by Lee
Stevens and a two-run homer by Bill Haselman.
 &UR; Royals 9, Orioles 5
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Dean Palmer had four RBIs for the
second straight night and Jose Offerman extended his hitting streak
to 21 games and stole half of Kansas City's team-record eight
bases.
	   Palmer's three-run homer off Scott Kamieniecki (2-4) in the
third gave him four homers in three games and 14 RBIs in seven.
	   The eight steals tied the 33-year-old record against Baltimore.
	   Eric Davis had an RBI single in the seventh, extending his
hitting streak to a career-high 19 games and making him the only
Oriole with 10 or more RBIs in three consecutive calendar weeks.
	   The loss was Baltimore's fifth in 22 games since the All-Star
break.
	   The winner was Chris Haney (4-4), who pitched two-plus innings,
yielding three hits and one unearned run.
	   Johnny Damon hit a two-run homer in the eighth, his 12th home
run of the season. Damon scored four runs.
 &UR; Blue Jays 10, Twins 9
	   In Minneapolis, Pat Hentgen (10-8) improved his lifetime record
against the Twins to 11-1, including 6-1 in the Metrodome, and Jose
Canseco hit his seventh home run in 11 games for Toronto.
	   Hentgen, who has won 10 or more games six straight years, gave
up seven hits and four runs in six innings. He struck out three and
walked three.
	   Canseco hit his 31st homer in the third, a two-run shot off
LaTroy Hawkins (7-10), giving Toronto a 4-0 lead.
	   Minnesota rallied for five runs in the ninth on two-run doubles
by Paul Molitor and Javier Valentin, and a run-scoring single by
Pat Meares. Randy Myers got Otis Nixon to ground out for his 27th
save.
	   Jose Cruz Jr. had three hits and drove in three runs for Toronto
with a two-run single and a solo homer.
	   Minnesota's Todd Walker went 3-for-4 to lift his average to a
major league-leading .350.

U.S. group to hold anti-sex rally in Tokyo, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S.-based group that urges abstinence from sex
outside marriage will hold its first rally in Japan when 300 young
people march in Tokyo later this week, a news report said Sunday.
	   The Pure Love Alliance, whose members include students and
church groups, plans rallies in four other Japanese cities in the
first two weeks of August, according to the Kyodo News agency.
	   Young people from the United States, Europe and South Korea will
join Japanese marchers in the Tokyo rally on Tuesday, the report
said.
	   The alliance gained attention last year when it led 500 people
claiming to be virgins on a 25-city tour in the United States to
end what it calls the stigma of virginity.
	   The tour ended with a rally in front of the White House in
Washington, where marchers called for people to abstain from
premarital sex and remain faithful to their spouses.
	   After Tokyo, the marchers will hold rallies in the cities of
Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and Hiroshima, the report said.

Report: Flood kills at least four in Borneo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least four people were killed in
floods from heavy rains that struck the Indonesian island of
Borneo, a report said Sunday.
	   A week of incessant rains caused flood waters up to two-meters
(6.5-feet) deep that paralyzed the city of Samarinda, 1,340
kilometers (837 miles) northeast of Jakarta, the official Antara
news agency said.
	   The flood, which began Thursday, was described as the worst to
hit the area in the past 30 years.
	   It inundated 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) in Samarinda,
affecting 450,000 inhabitants, covering the landing strip of the
city's airport and bringing economic activity to a halt.

Social critic plans to sue prime ministers over gas pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A prominent social critic says he will
sue three past and present Thai prime ministers over human rights
violations and environmental damage involving a gas pipeline from
Myanmar, newspapers said Sunday.
	   The Yadana pipeline, due to be officially opened this month, has
been dogged by criticism and lawsuits by democracy and
environmental activists.
	   They variously charge that Myanmar's military used forced labor
in its construction and that Thai authorities destroyed pristine
forest and endangered wildlife.
	   The companies involved deny all the charges, and the Thai
government has defended the project as economically viable and
beneficial.
	   Sulak Sivaraksa said he would take court action within seven
days against Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and ex-premiers Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh and Banharn Silpa-archa, according to the daily
Bangkok Post.
	   The dlrs 1.2 billion project, owned by Total of France, Unocal
of the United States, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and
Myanmar's military government, will carry gas from the coastal
waters of Myanmar, also known as Burma, to a power plant in
Ratchaburi, Thailand.
	   Sulak, who earlier staged a sit-in protest at the pipeline,
reportedly accused the three leaders and the Thai petroleum
authority of lying to the public about the project and violating
the law by producing an incomplete environmental impact assessment.
	   Sulak was quoted as saying he would also cooperate with
international environmental groups in pushing for compensation for
people affected by the pipeline construction.
	   ``I want this lawsuit to make the country's leaders realize and
respect more the rights and freedom of the people and not to
undertake any action without first consulting the people,'' he
said.

Cambodia's election results still in limbo a week after voting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's National Election
Committee on Sunday feted observers and other participants in last
week's polls _ but made no apparent progress in delivering a final
vote tally or resolving complaints about election fraud.
	   A cultural show was held at the home just outside the capital of
committee chairman Chheng Phon ``to thank the foreign and national
observers who have contributed so much to the success of the
Cambodian elections.''
	   But even though voting went smoothly at last Sunday's polls, no
final results have yet been issued, and charges of irregularities
and fraud continued to emerge.
	   The committee on Saturday released preliminary official results
for just seven of 23 constituencies. A spokesman for the committee
said that the complete final tally had been delayed as results were
being sent in by fax and radio, keyed into computers and then
rechecked with officials from communal and provincial counting
stations.
	   The delayed count has caused concern about opportunities for
tampering with the vote count.
	   There are 122 parliamentary seats at stake, and from unofficial
projections it appears that Co-Premier Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian
People's Party will win a majority of them.
	   The opposition parties have asked for a recount in areas where
they suspect irregularities.
	   A statement from an independent Cambodian poll watching body,
the Neutral and Impartial Committee for Free Elections in Cambodia,
listed several otherwise unpublicized incidents of manipulation and
fraud.
	   The group, affiliated with the human rights organization, noted
three violent election-day incidents in the central province of
Kampong Cham, one the most heavily contested areas.
	   In two districts, the group said in a statement issued Saturday,
it appeared that shooting in the air discouraged people from
voting, and in a third district a woman was shot dead early in the
day.
	   ``Initial reports indicate that voters were severely intimidated
(by the shooting), such that only five people who cast their votes
before the shooting were able to vote,'' it said.
	   In some areas, particularly the provinces of Kampot and Takeo,
its observers were not allowed to enter polling stations or were
asked to leave by officials, it said. In one district of Kampot
province, a NICFEC observer was threatened and resigned out of
fear.
	   The group reported its observers had witnessed at least one case
of fraud, also in Kampot, where the chief of one polling station
was seen inserting ballots into the ballot box after voting had
closed.
	   It noted as well that in some vote-counting centers only one
party agent or observer was allowed in, preventing effective
monitoring because several ballot boxes were tallied
simultaneously.
	   In a counting station in Kampot, an official misread ballots in
favor of one party although the ballots were marked for another
party, it said.
	   Opposition parties last Tuesday asked that new votes be taken in
disputed precincts if their charges of wrongdoing were found to be
valid.
	   The FUNCINPEC party of former co-premier Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and the Sam Rainsy Party threatened to boycott the
National Assembly if their complaints were not heeded.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any business.
	   Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen meanwhile responded to another
opposition concern Saturday, calling on his security forces not to
terrorize members of the opposition in acts of political revenge.
	   Scores of scared supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy Party have fled to Phnom Penh
from the countryside, seeking refuge at their parties'
headquarters.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup
d'etat a year ago.

Green Bay beats Kansas City 27-14
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ryan Longwell kicked a 27-yard field goal 10
minutes into sudden death overtime Sunday, giving Green Bay a 27-24
victory over Kansas City in a comeback from what looked like
disastrous mistakes.
	   Green Bay fumbled on both of its first two possessions of the
game. Kansas City cashed in on both for a 14-0 lead midway through
the first quarter.
	   In overtime, Green Bay's Brett Conway missed a 25-yard field
goal attempt. But the Packers got a second chance when the Chiefs'
Pete Stoyanovich missed from 42 yards.
	   In both Packer overtime drives, the key plays were passed from
Green Bay's fourth quarterback, David Klingler, to Bill Schroder,
for 28 yards the first time and 38 the second. Schroder also scored
a second-quarter touchdown on a 26-yard pass from No. 2 quarterback
Doug Pederson.
	   Glyn Milburn returned a kickoff 76 yards to set up another Green
Bay touchdown, and Brett Conway kicked the 27-yard field goal that
gave Green Bay the tie with 8:41 left to play in the American Bowl
exhibition game.
	   In Green Bay's disastrous start, the Chiefs first got the ball
on the Green Bay 18 after Packers starting quarterback Brett
Favre's fumble was recovered by Chester McGlockton. Elvis Grbac's
10-yard pass to Tony Gonzalez covered much of the distance, and
Grbac passed 2 yards to Tony Richardson for the score just 3:40
into the game.
	   On Green Bay's next play, William Henderson fumbled after a pass
from Favre, and the Chiefs' Mark McMillian recovered at the Green
Bay 41. Again, the Chiefs needed just six plays, including a
13-yard pass from Grbac to Gonzalez. Kimble Anders went the final 7
yards at 7:42.
	   But the second quarter belonged to Green Bay.
	   Travis Jervey's 48-yard run to the Kansas City 38 set up a
51-yard field goal by Longwell, Mike Prior's interception of a pass
by Billy Joe Tolliver led to a 38-yard field goal by Conway, and a
recovery by Antonio London of Jesse Haynes's fumble on a touchdown
try at the Green Bay 3 led to a 97-yard scoring drive led by No. 2
quarterback Pederson.
	   Pederson completed a succession of passes to Jeff Thomason and
Bill Schroeer, hitting Schroeder for the final 26 yards. Pederson
hit Derrick Mayes for a two-point conversion, tying the game 14-14
with 1:38 left in the half.
	   Kansas City threatened at the end of the half, but Pete
Stoyanovich missed a 40-yard field goal with 22 seconds left.
	   He soon had another chance. Kansas City's third quarterback, Pat
Barnes, hit Joe Horn with passes of 36 and 22 yards, and then
Stoyanovich made it 17-14 with a 24-yarder 4:24 into the second
half.
	   The Packers went ahead for the first time, 21-17, three minutes
later thanks to a 76-yard kickoff return by Glyn Milburn to the
Kansas City 17. The Packers' third quarterback, Matt Hasselbeck,
passed to Schroeder for 8 yards and Ramont Harris went the final 1
in the short drive.
	   But the Chiefs drove right back, with Barnes passing 16 yards to
James Bostick and scrambling for 12 yards before hitting Willy Tate
for 30 yards and a touchdown that put Kansas City up 24-21 in the
closing seconds of the third quarter.
	   An exchange of interceptions, by Kansas City's Robert Williams
and Green Bay's Anthony Fogle, left Green Bay at the Kansas City
14, but a holding penalty nullified Milburn's later 3-yard
touchdown run and the Packers had to settle for a 27-yard field
goal by Conway, tying the game 24-24.
	   The Packers had another chance to win in regulation when Milburn
ran 33 yards to the Kansas City 22. But a tripping penalty set them
back, and Longwell missed a 45-yard field goal attempt with 56
seconds left.

Shepherd and Williams win gold for the United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRA PODELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Teaunce Shepherd and Ricardo Williams Jr. won
gold medals for the United States on Saturday night, the final
night of boxing in the Goodwill Games.
	   Shepherd, a featherweight from Marquette, Michigan, gave the
United States its first gold medal of the night, defeating Russia's
Andrei Kozlovsky 9-6 at the Theater at Madison Square Garden.
	   ``I can't explain how it felt,'' Shepherd said. ``It was great.
It was all worth it. Even in your imagination you don't know what
it's going to be like when they play that anthem and everyone is
responding to you as the champion.''
	   Williams, a 17-year-old from Cincinnati, routed Ebo Elder of
Newman, Georgia, 16-4 in an all-American light welterweight bout.
	   ``I thought I would just use my speed, because he's a real
strong guy and I knew he would try to overpower me,'' Williams
said.
	   Williams also beat Elder en route to the U.S. Championships and
U.S. Challenge titles.
	   ``His style is never to be predictable,'' Elder said. ``He makes
things different every time he fights, but I have gotten used to
his style.''
	   American fighters had dropped four consecutive Goodwill finals,
including three Friday night.
	   Roberto Benitez, from New York, lost an exciting 18-14 decision
to Kazakstan's Yersin Jailauov in the flyweight final.
	   The fighters were tied twice in the last two minutes, but
Jailauov scored enough easy points to grab the victory.
	   ``The early rounds hurt me,'' said Benitez, who trailed 8-2
going into the third. ``I should have picked it up a little faster
in the first round.''
	   Three-time world champion Juan Hernandez of Cuba won the light
middleweight title with an easy 16-5 victory over Gaidarbek
Gaidarbekov of Russia in the card's first bout.
	   Cuba _ which won four golds in five fights Friday night _ earned
its second gold of the night when Isael Alvarez beat Olanda
Anderson of Fort Carson, Colorado, 12-6 in the light heavyweight
bout.
	   Another Cuban, Alexis Rubalcaba, dropped a 9-3 decision to
Italian super heavyweight Paolo Vidoz in the final fight of the
night.
	   The United States team earned 17 medals in the tournament, nine
of which were bronze.

Agassi beats Gimelstob for 10th straight win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andre Agassi cranked up his famed return of
serve to beat Justin Gimelstob 6-0, 7-6 (7-2) on Saturday in the
Mercedes Cup semifinals, his 10th consecutive victory without
dropping a set.
	   Agassi, the fifth seed, advanced to the final here for the first
time since 1988. He'll face No. 2 seed Tim Henman of Britain, a
7-5, 6-3 winner over Frenchman Guillaume Raoux in the night
semifinal.
	   ``It's not about winning to me at the moment,'' Agassi said.
``It's about execution and dedicating myself to my goals day after
day.''
	   Agassi raced through the first set in 22 minutes under a
cloudless sky and blazing sun on the UCLA campus, where Gimelstob
won the U.S. collegiate doubles title for the university before
turning pro in 1996.
	   After surprising top-seeded Patrick Rafter 6-4, 6-3 in Friday's
quarterfinals, Gimelstob proclaimed, ``This is my house.''
	   On Saturday, he conceded that Agassi had invaded.
	   ``It's still my place,'' Gimelstob said, ``but he can lease it
from me this year.''
	   Last year, Gimelstob shocked Agassi 7-5, 6-2 in the first round
for his biggest victory as a pro. Ranked 98th in the world,
Gimelstob topped that by sending Rafter home Friday.
	   ``In every single department, I'm a better player than I was
last year,'' said Agassi, ranked 13th in the world. He was 32nd at
this time last year and headed to a low of 122nd by year's end.
	   Henman has been on a roll since Wimbledon, where he was the
toast of Britain for making the semifinals despite losing to
eventual champion Pete Sampras.
	   Raoux, a semifinalist last year, blew a 3-1 lead in losing the
first set. Down 1-2 in the second, he was broken by one of Henman's
huge forehands for the only break of the set. Henman closed out the
match with two consecutive 130 mph-plus (209 kph-plus) serves.
	   ``Today was the best I've played this week,'' Henman said. ``My
serve is something that's improved a lot.''
	   Agassi showed his improvement in the first set, breaking
Gimelstob three times with laser-like returns of the second-year
pro's big serves. Gimelstob's major weapon failed him most of the
time, including a double-fault on triple break point to trail 0-5.
	   ``I was really struggling to see on one side of the court,''
said Gimelstob, bothered by serving into the sun. ``I didn't come
out firing at the beginning of the match. He's going to make you
hit winners.''
	   During the first changeover of the second set, both players had
their coaches on court to talk strategy as part of a
five-tournament ATP Tour experiment. What did Brad Gilbert tell
Agassi?
	   ``He says, `Ditto. Do that one more time,''' Agassi said of his
easy first set. ``Brad knows a 6-0 set is sometimes the worst thing
that can happen to you because it conditions you to think things
are going to be easy.''
	   Gimelstob made it tougher in the second set, cutting back on his
errors as neither player broke serve en route to the tiebreaker.
	   Agassi moved to a quick 4-0 in the breaker when he hit a
backhand passing shot and Gimelstob committed three straight
errors. He netted a forehand on match point.
	   ``I didn't put together a return game against him, which was
shockingly disappointing,'' he said. ``When you play the top
players and you lose, you see the things you need to improve.''
	   The players backed off from the comments each made about the
other on Friday. Agassi said Gimelstob could be among the world's
top 30 players, but he picked Jan-Michael Gambill as an American
with more potential than Gimelstob.
	   That rankled Gimelstob, who said Agassi had shown disrespect him
with his opinionated comments.
	   ``I'm opinionated, I guess,'' Agassi said Saturday. ``He can get
better. How better, time will tell. Maybe he has plans to be No. 1
in the world. I wish him all the best.''

Green Bay beats Kansas City 27-24
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS score in headline
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ryan Longwell kicked a 27-yard field goal 10
minutes into sudden death overtime Sunday, giving Green Bay a 27-24
victory over Kansas City in a comeback from what looked like
disastrous mistakes.
	   Green Bay fumbled on both of its first two possessions of the
game. Kansas City cashed in on both for a 14-0 lead midway through
the first quarter.
	   In overtime, Green Bay's Brett Conway missed a 25-yard field
goal attempt. But the Packers got a second chance when the Chiefs'
Pete Stoyanovich missed from 42 yards.
	   In both Packer overtime drives, the key plays were passed from
Green Bay's fourth quarterback, David Klingler, to Bill Schroder,
for 28 yards the first time and 38 the second. Schroder also scored
a second-quarter touchdown on a 26-yard pass from No. 2 quarterback
Doug Pederson.
	   Glyn Milburn returned a kickoff 76 yards to set up another Green
Bay touchdown, and Brett Conway kicked the 27-yard field goal that
gave Green Bay the tie with 8:41 left to play in the American Bowl
exhibition game.
	   In Green Bay's disastrous start, the Chiefs first got the ball
on the Green Bay 18 after Packers starting quarterback Brett
Favre's fumble was recovered by Chester McGlockton. Elvis Grbac's
10-yard pass to Tony Gonzalez covered much of the distance, and
Grbac passed 2 yards to Tony Richardson for the score just 3:40
into the game.
	   On Green Bay's next play, William Henderson fumbled after a pass
from Favre, and the Chiefs' Mark McMillian recovered at the Green
Bay 41. Again, the Chiefs needed just six plays, including a
13-yard pass from Grbac to Gonzalez. Kimble Anders went the final 7
yards at 7:42.
	   But the second quarter belonged to Green Bay.
	   Travis Jervey's 48-yard run to the Kansas City 38 set up a
51-yard field goal by Longwell, Mike Prior's interception of a pass
by Billy Joe Tolliver led to a 38-yard field goal by Conway, and a
recovery by Antonio London of Jesse Haynes's fumble on a touchdown
try at the Green Bay 3 led to a 97-yard scoring drive led by No. 2
quarterback Pederson.
	   Pederson completed a succession of passes to Jeff Thomason and
Bill Schroeer, hitting Schroeder for the final 26 yards. Pederson
hit Derrick Mayes for a two-point conversion, tying the game 14-14
with 1:38 left in the half.
	   Kansas City threatened at the end of the half, but Pete
Stoyanovich missed a 40-yard field goal with 22 seconds left.
	   He soon had another chance. Kansas City's third quarterback, Pat
Barnes, hit Joe Horn with passes of 36 and 22 yards, and then
Stoyanovich made it 17-14 with a 24-yarder 4:24 into the second
half.
	   The Packers went ahead for the first time, 21-17, three minutes
later thanks to a 76-yard kickoff return by Glyn Milburn to the
Kansas City 17. The Packers' third quarterback, Matt Hasselbeck,
passed to Schroeder for 8 yards and Ramont Harris went the final 1
in the short drive.
	   But the Chiefs drove right back, with Barnes passing 16 yards to
James Bostick and scrambling for 12 yards before hitting Willy Tate
for 30 yards and a touchdown that put Kansas City up 24-21 in the
closing seconds of the third quarter.
	   An exchange of interceptions, by Kansas City's Robert Williams
and Green Bay's Anthony Fogle, left Green Bay at the Kansas City
14, but a holding penalty nullified Milburn's later 3-yard
touchdown run and the Packers had to settle for a 27-yard field
goal by Conway, tying the game 24-24.
	   The Packers had another chance to win in regulation when Milburn
ran 33 yards to the Kansas City 22. But a tripping penalty set them
back, and Longwell missed a 45-yard field goal attempt with 56
seconds left.

Defense Secretary Cohen leaves for Manila
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
left Sunday for the Philippines after a wrapping up two days of
talks with Indonesian leaders.
	   Cohen and entourage flew from Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusumah
airport directly for Manila, the Philippines capital, an official
at the airport in eastern Jakarta said.
	   In his meeting Saturday with President B.J. Habibie, Cohen urged
the Indonesian leader to push ahead with democratic reforms and
efforts to rebuild its shattered economy.
	   Cohen also appealed for swift investigations of alleged human
rights violations by Indonesian military units, some of them
U.S.-trained.
	   The Indonesian military has been tainted by its involvement in
the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists earlier this year, when
former President Suharto was still in power. Eleven officers of an
elite army unit have been arrested.
	   Cohen, who arrived Friday night, also met with his Indonesian
counterpart, commander of Indonesian armed forces Gen. Wiranto, and
with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.

Flanker surprised by porous New Zealand defense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian flanker David Wilson
said Sunday he was surprised with the way New Zealand's defense
shattered in his team's 27-23 rugby union win Saturday at Lancaster
Park,.
	   The veteran Queensland captain said although the Australians
worked hard for victory, the New Zealand defense opened up rather
easily for three of their four tries.
	   ``I think we recycled about a dozen times for Matt's (Burke) try
and that was most satisfactory because we pounded away constantly
and they finally folded,'' Wilson, 31, said after their four tries
to two win.
	   ``That was hard work on our part and the All Blacks held on
magnificently before we got through. The other three times the guys
just slipped through because the screen just split.
	   ``I was a bit surprised then. But I suppose we did the hard
grind leading up to them.''
	   The Wallabies' win clinched the Bledisloe Cup, emblematic of the
countries' fierce and traditional rivalry, was also the first
victory by Australia at Lancaster Park in 40 years.
	   Wilson, one of the senior Australian players savoring the
victory more than the others, won against New Zealand for the fifth
time in his 12 matches against them.
	   Center Tim Horan, who said the win felt similar to their 1991
World Cup triumph, made it six from 18 and hooker Phil Kearns eight
from 16.
	   ``We have been on the back foot after some real beltings from
New Zealand,'' Wilson said.
	   ``At halftime the score was close (10-3) and we knew these guys
could hit back any time. They've always come back strongly. So we
decided we'd keep attacking them, and attack we did.''
	   Australia, which beat New Zealand 24-16 at Melbourne on July 11,
clinched the three-match series with a match to play in Sydney
later this month. The Wallabies had not won the Bledisloe Cup since
taking a on-off test in Sydney in 1994.
	   The win moved Australia into the lead in the Tri Nations series
with a match to be played against second-place South Africa in
Johannesburg on Aug. 22. New Zealand closes out the series a week
earlier in Durban against South Africa. (djp)

Williams joins Davenport in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Williams and Seles quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Venus Williams slammed 12 aces,
including one on the first point of the match and another on the
final point, to beat Monica Seles 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday night in the
Bank of the West semifinals.
	   Williams, seeded third, will face top-seeded Lindsay Davenport
on Sunday in the final of the dlrs 450,000 tournament. Davenport
beat Steffi Graf 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3 in the afternoon semifinal.
	   Williams dominated on her serve throughout the match. Even when
she wasn't piling up aces, Williams was hitting service winners and
forcing the second-seeded Seles to virtually bunt back other
serves.
	   ``I really can't remember when I served this well,'' Williams
said. ``The whole time it was consistent serving.''
	   The only time Seles threatened to break Williams' serve was in
the fourth game of the second set, but the 6-foot-1.5 (1.87-meter)
Williams fought off three break points to hold her serve.
	   ``Obviously, I've never played anyone as tall as Venus. She
mixed it up very well,'' Seles said. ``She does a very good variety
on her serve. I really love that part of her game. I wish I had
that serve and that athletic ability.''
	   Williams, 17-1 in tournaments in the United States this year,
went to the side of the court to receive congratulations from her
father, Richard Williams, immediately after the match.
	   Williams said she was happy with the spin on her serves, and on
the way she showed Seles several different types of serves.
	   ``You have to work on that, because it's easy to become
one-dimensional and just serve to your favorite space and the
person is just waiting there,'' she said. ``You have to take risks
and serve out wide sometimes.''
	   It was the first meeting between the two players.
	   In the first semifinal, Graf was undermined by unforced errors
and an erratic backhand. Graf's serve remains strong and her
forehand is as dangerous as ever, but a long layoff following knee
surgery has robbed her of the consistency that once was among
Graf's trademarks.
	   Davenport, ranked third in the world, had lost in the semifinals
of this tournament five of the previous six years. She reached her
first final in the event by using her consistent play to take
advantage of Graf's mistakes.
	   ``I think I've picked up my game a lot, I'm a little more
consistent,'' Davenport said. ``People say she (Graf) has been out
for a year and a half and she's not ranked that high anymore, but
it's still a good win.''
	   Graf was seeded fourth despite falling to No. 57 in the world
since having reconstructive left knee surgery last year. The
women's tour has given her a special co-ranking of No. 7 until the
U.S. Open, allowing Graf to be seeded at this and two other
tournaments.
	   Graf has had a difficult recovery from the knee surgery. Her
comeback has been stalled by other injuries, and she became so
frustrated earlier this year that she considered retiring.
	   She said Saturday's match, which lasted more than two hours in
intense heat, was a good way of judging how far she still has to go
in her comeback.
	   ``I haven't had a lot of matches or three setters in the past 1
1/2 years, so it's definitely something that makes me realize what
I have to work on,'' said Graf, who was cramping in both legs in
the third set. ``There are a few things that I have to work on _
definitely return of serve.''
	   Graf said she just ran out of energy in the final set.
	   ``I wish I would have had something left in the third set,'' she
said. ``In the third set, from 3-all on I didn't know how to move
anymore.''
	   The players stayed on serve in the third set until Davenport
broke in the eighth game to go up 5-3. She then served out the
match, getting to match point on a net cord and wrapping up the
victory with an overhead putaway.
	   ``It's sometimes just a matter of a few points that make the
difference in the match,'' Davenport said. ``I was really
struggling to hold my serve the whole third set, but luckily I got
one break and it was all over.''

Howell native advances to Western Amateur semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BENTON HARBOR, Michigan (AP) _ Shawn Koch survived two
sudden-death matches Saturday, including one against the qualifying
medalist, to advance to the semifinals of the Western Amateur.
	   Koch, 21, of Howell, who needed a 55-foot (16.76-meter) eagle
putt to win a seven-man playoff Friday to earn the final qualifying
spot, beat medalist Alberto Ochoa, of Edinburg, Texas, in 22 holes
Saturday morning.
	   In the afternoon round, Koch ousted 18-year-old Adam Scott of
Australia in 19 holes, winning with an 8-foot (2.44-meter) birdie
putt.
	   Koch, a senior at East Tennessee State, won the Michigan Amateur
and Golf Association of Michigan championships earlier this summer.
	   In Sunday's first semifinal match, he will face Terry Noe of
Fullerton, California, who advanced to the quarterfinals of the
1996 Western Amateur by beating Tiger Woods in 20 holes.
	   On Saturday, Noe beat Randy Leen of Dayton, Ohio, 2 and 1, and
Travis Perkins of Lewis Center, Ohio, 7 and 6.
	   Michael Henderson of Raleigh, North Carolina, will face Don
Padgett III of Akron, Ohio, in the other semifinal.
	   Henderson beat Rob Rashell of Everett, Michigan, 5 and 4, and
Cameron Percy of Australia 3 and 2. Padgett III beat Jeff Kern of
Tucson, Arizona, 4 and 3, and Steve Sheehan of Reno, Nevada, 3 and
2.
	   The championship match is Sunday afternoon.

Kidnap case becomes latest cross-strait political issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chinese reaction in grafs 7-8
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The kidnapping and killing in China of a
local Taiwanese official has become the latest hot point in the
long and intricate political dispute across the Taiwan Strait.
	   Both China and Taiwan, estranged for nearly 50 years, have tried
to win political points in the high-profile case of Lin Ti-chuan.
The body of the city council member from the southern Taiwanese
city of Kaohsiung was found Thursday in a hospital in the northern
Chinese town of Haicheng.
	   She died of a drug overdose after being kidnapped, purportedly
by business associates of her Taiwanese boyfriend. The kidnappers
left her body at the hospital. Lin's boyfriend was kidnapped with
her but managed to escape.
	   Vice Premier Liu Chao-hsuan warned China on Saturday that
mishandling of the case could outrage Taiwanese and hurt efforts to
improve relations.
	   Su Chi, an official of President Lee Teng-hui's office, said the
case underscored the need for the two sides to quickly establish
``systematized negotiations.''
	   Taiwan wants to use the case to highlight its position that
practical matters, such as the safety of Taiwanese in China, should
take precedence over the talks about bigger political issues that
China has sought.
	   China insists the murder was an isolated incident that shouldn't
be allowed to take on political overtones or disrupt relations.
	   Liu Gangqi, a deputy secretary general of China's semiofficial
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, denounced
``some people in Taiwan'' for making a political issue out of the
killing, the official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday.
	   The two sides split politically in 1949 and are moving slowly to
resume a dialogue which was suspended in 1995.
	   After the kidnapping, China mobilized hundreds of policemen in a
nationwide hunt for the abductors. When Lin turned up dead, it set
up an altar at the Haicheng hospital for her relatives to mourn
her.
	   But it also used the case to push its point that China and
Taiwan can have direct contacts without semiofficial negotiating
bodies.
	   China has repeatedly rejected requests by the Straits Exchange
Foundation, Taiwan's semiofficial body handling exchanges in the
absence of formal ties, to let Taiwan send five officials to China
to assist the investigation and help Lin's relatives bring her body
home.
	   Taiwan has accused China of trying to sideline the foundation
because of its tough stand in negotiations.
	   The Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition party
of which Lin was a member, accused China of trampling on human
rights by barring officials from the foundation and the party from
China.
	   It threatened to have its legislators introduce a motion urging
the government to sever all exchanges with China pending Beijing's
agreement to let the officials in.
	   The opposition party was further angered by Chinese officials
who ignored a Taiwanese custom to keep a body intact by insisting
on performing an autopsy on Lin. Party officials threatened a
hunger strike together with Lin's relatives if the autopsy is
performed.

American women swimmers win team gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Boxing. &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The money will come in handy for the
four U.S. women swimmers who won it. The team gold was worth its
weight in memories for the others Saturday night.
	   The American team, led by Jenny Thompson and Cristina Teuscher,
won the team gold after defeating Germany 78-44, its third straight
dual-meet win at the Goodwill Games.
	   The gold medal is worth dlrs 50,000 to the winning team, and
since only four of the 18 team members are out of college, those
four get to share the loot.
	   Thompson of Dover, New Hampshire; captain Lea Maurer of
Crestwood, New York; Richelle Fox of Scotia, New York; and Ashley
Tappin of New Orleans will take home dlrs 12,500 each for the team
gold medal.
	   With an additional dlrs 1,000 going to the best time in each
event during the three dual meets, Thompson ultimately won dlrs
14,000 and three gold medals.
	   Teuscher, of New Rochelle, New York, ineligible for prize money
because she still attends Columbia University, won the 200
freestyle and the 200 individual medley against Germany.
	   Teuscher had a chance for five gold medals: the team gold, the
800 and 400 freestyles, the 200 IM and the freestyle relay. But the
World All-Star team, in an 86-35 dual-meet victory over China, took
away her golds in all but the 800 and the team event.
	   ``It was a fairy tale week _ an emotional roller-coaster,
intense and exciting,'' Teuscher said. ``I think this will make me
stronger and more confident. I wanted to prove it to myself more
than anybody else.''
	   Thompson won the 100 freestyle and swam a leg of the winning 400
medley relay against Germany.
	   Saturday night's U.S. freestyle relay team was disqualified for
an early start, and the World team surpassed an earlier United
States time later Saturday.
	   Even with the relay disqualification, the United States won 10
of the 14 events against the Germans, including the first six to
give it a 38-14 lead.
	   Thompson also had the best time in the 100 freestyle going into
the final World Team-China matchup, but Martina Moravcova of
Slovakia topped Thompson with a time of 55.46 seconds, .10 better
than Thompson, who won the silver.
	   Maurer, with the best time in the 100 backstroke, won an
additional dlrs 1,000.
	   Penny Heyns of South Africa, who won two gold medals, set a
world record in the 50-meter breaststroke Saturday night, but
because it is not an official event, she will not earn the dlrs
50,000 offered to anyone setting a world record in swimming.
	   Heyns was timed in 30.95 seconds on the first lap of the 100
breaststroke event. Because the 50 breaststroke is not an event in
itself, Heyns will not earn the dlrs 50,000, a ruling that Heyns
disputed after the race, saying, ``there was no fine print.''
	   Figure skating finished, and Michelle Kwan added a Goodwill
Games gold medal to her two world and U.S. titles.
	   The Olympic silver medalist easily beat the field, bouncing back
from a rare fall to get solid 5.9s for presentation before a
near-capacity crowd that included former President Jimmy Carter.
Russia's Maria Butryskaya and Victoria Volchkov were 2-3.
	   World champions Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won the
ice dance gold with an energetic free dance, which earned two
perfect scores. The silver medal went to another Russian couple,
Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh, with Elena Grushina and Rusian
Goncharov of Ukraine taking the bronze.
	   The dream matchup in women's beach volleyball fell one match
short.
	   Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce, the No. 2 team, were upset by
Australia's Kerri Pottharst and Pauline Manser, 12-11, 11-12, 12-6,
in the semifinals.
	   That deprived the games of a final-day gold-medal meeting
between the top two teams. The No. 1 duo, Brazil's Shelda Bede and
Adriana Behar, made it with a 12-5, 12-7 victory over Laura
Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy.
	   McPeak and Arce have won three international tournaments and
finished second in last year's world championship. After
squandering two set points in the opener, they put together an
impressive rally from 10-3 down to win the second set, but never
were really in the decisive set, which was played under rally rules
_ a point on every serve.
	   The U.S. team led 3-2 in the third set, but the Australians took
the lead for good with the next three points, then closed out the
match by scoring the last five points.
	   This was the first match of either the men's or women's
competition to go to the deciding set.
	   In boxing, Teaunce Shepherd and Ricardo Williams Jr. won gold
medals for the United States.
	   Shepherd, a featherweight from Marquette, Michigan, beat
Russia's Andrei Kozlovsky 9-6 at the Theater at Madison Square
Garden.
	   Williams, a 17-year-old from Cincinnati, routed Ebo Elder of
Newman, Georgia, 16-4 in an all-American light welterweight bout.
	   Roberto Benitez, from New York, lost an exciting 18-14 decision
to Kazakstan's Yersin Jailauov in the flyweight final.

Iran says new missile guided by its technology
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Sunday that the medium-range
missile it tested last month was guided by an Iranian-made system
that gives it great accuracy.
	   The Shahab-3 missile is 16 meters (53 feet) long and can travel
at a speed of 7,000 kilometers (more than 4,300 miles) per hour,
said Gen. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, head of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps' air wing.
	   ``It is a ballistic missile and can carry a one ton warhead at a
cruising altitude of 250 kilometers above sea level,'' said
Qalibaf. That's an altitude of 155 miles.
	   It was the first time Iran had given such details about the
Shahab-3.
	   On July 25, an Iranian official confirmed that the country had
successfully tested a medium-range missile with a range of 1,300
kilometers (800 miles).
	   The test launch and path had been tracked July 22 by Western
intelligence agencies.
	   ``The final test of every weapon is in a real war situation but,
given its warhead and size, the Shahab-3 is a very accurate
weapon,'' said Qalibaf, adding that its guidance system was
produced by Iranian engineers.
	   U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed concern about the
Iranian missile because it would be capable to hitting Israel and
U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.
	   Iranian officials have said the missile is for defense.
	   According to CIA reports, Iran has received substantial missile
technology from Russia, and some from China and North Korea. The
Shahab-3 is believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong ballistic
missile.
	   Last week, Martin Indyk, assistant U.S. secretary of state,
warned that Iran was working on a long-range missile that could be
deployed in two to five years.
	   Indyk said this missile, the Shahab-4, ``will present an even
greater threat'' than the Shahab-3 and pledged that the United
States would redouble its efforts to curb the transfer of
technology Iran needs to develop it.
	   On Saturday, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said his country
was determined to continue to strengthen its armed forces,
regardless of international concern.
	   ``Iran will not seek permission from anyone for strengthening
its defense capability, which has a deterrent aspect,'' Khatami
said during a Defense Ministry exhibition in Tehran.
	   ``A strong Iran is a backing for the security of friends,
neighbors and all the regional countries,'' said Khatami.
	   Iran had virtually no arms industry under the U.S.-supported
shah because Washington supplied nearly all of Iran's defense
needs. The shah was ousted during the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   The Iranians launched an ambitious arms development program
during the 1980-88 war with Iraq to compensate for weapons
shortages caused by a U.S. embargo.
	   They realized the strategic value of possessing ballistic
missiles near the end of the war with Iraq, when Baghdad rained
more than 160 Al-Hussein stretch-Scud missiles on Tehran.
	   Iran claims it is nearly self-sufficient in arms. Since 1992, it
has unveiled its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, missiles,
and even a fighter plane.

Kwan, Russian couple win skating Goodwill golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ One fall wasn't going to spoil
Michelle Kwan's last skate of the summer.
	   Kwan, looking forward to a vacation in Hawaii, took an
unexpected detour Saturday night, falling to the ice on a triple
loop in the middle of her free program at the Goodwill Games.
	   She got right up like nothing had happened and skated away with
the gold medal.
	   ``I felt great up to the loop, and the fall shook me up,'' Kwan
said. ``After the mistake, I knew what I had to do. In practice
when you make a mistake, you always want to do the next thing
great.''
	   That's what Kwan did, and it made her the easy winner. Waiting
for her when she left the ice was her longtime coach, Frank
Carroll.
	   It was a tip from him that carried Kwan through her crisis.
	   ``Frank always tells me to use my legs to get boost and that's
what I did,'' she said.
	   ``If you divide up the program, the first section was good, the
middle section was ehhh and the third section was good. If you cut
out the middle section, it was very good.''
	   With many of the 10,558 fans in the largest Nassau Coliseum
crowd of the competition waving signs of support, Kwan finished her
program flawlessly, including a triple lutz near the end.
	   ``That last triple lutz,'' she sighed. ``I felt like I had to
land it. I saw Frank abd I said I'd better land it. I knew what he
taught me and what he said. I knew what I had to do.''
	   Kwan took off as the crowd watched. ``I could hear them holding
their breath,'' she said.
	   She completed the jump and the program without any more
problems.
	   Russians Maria Butyrskaya and Victoria Volchkova won the silver
and bronze. Butyrskaya fell twice and Volchkova went down once.
	   Earlier, world champions Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov
won the ice dance gold medal with an emotional and energetic free
dance, which earned two perfect scores.
	   The dance silver medal went to another Russian couple, Irina
Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh, while Elena Grushina and Rusian
Goncharov of Ukraine took the bronze.
	   Kwan was the next-to-last skater of the night and the crowd _
including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife,
Rosalynn, sitting next to Goodwill Games founder Ted Turner and his
wife, Jane Fonda _ was ready for her.
	   They cheered as Kwan skated, and urged her on as she bounced
back from the rare fall. The judges awarded her five 5.8s for
technical elements and a sweep of seven 5.9s for presentation.
	   Later, the Carters presented the gold medal to Kwan.
	   Cut-rate dlrs 5 upper-level seats swelled the attendance to
twice as large as the crowd that watched Todd Eldredge win the
men's gold Friday night. They came to see Kwan, and she responded
with her personal exclamation point on a grueling season that
included the Olympic silver medal and her second world and national
championships.
	   ``It looked so full out there,'' said Kwan, whose short program
Thursday night was performed before less than 5,000 people.
	   American Angela Nikodinov finished fourth.
	   The dance gold was the second straight major international title
for the Russians, who live and train in Newark, Delaware. They won
the world championship in March after six straight second-place
finishes in European, world and Olympic competitions dating back to
1996.
	   Skating to Bizet's ``Carmen,'' Krylova and Ovsiannikov were the
last pair of their competition and dazzled the crowd.
	   The couple, who have been skating together since May 1994 and
are coached by 1980 Olympic champions Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi
Karponosov, received two perfect 6.0 scores for presentation from
the Austrian and Russian judges.
	   ``When we're out there, we don't think about getting a 6.0,''
Ovsiannikov said. ``We hope, but we don't think about it.''
	   Teen-agers Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler represented the
United States and were crowd favorites, even though they received
no mark higher than 5.5 and finished fourth and last.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No. 1 will play for the women's gold medal, but
No. 2 will not. Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce of Manhattan Beach,
California, were upset in the semifinals by Australia's Julian
Manser and Kerri Pottharst 12-11, 11-12, 12-6. McPeak and Arce
wasted two set points in the first set, battled back from a 10-3
deficit to win the second, but gave up the final five points in the
third. Manser and Pottharst will play for the title against
top-ranked Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil, winners over
Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy 12-5, 12-7.

Marquette, Michigan, beat Russia's Andrei Kozlovsky 9-6. Williams,
a 17-year-old from Cincinnati, routed Ebo Elder of Newman, Georgia,
16-4 in an all-American light welterweight bout. Isael Benitez,

Games gold to her two world and U.S. titles. The Olympic silver
medalist easily beat the field, bouncing back from a rare fall to
get solid 5.9s for presentation before a near-capacity crowd that
included former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Russia's Maria
Butryskaya and Victoria Volchkov were 2-3. World champions Anjelika

against Germany and went on to a 78-44 victory, its third straight
dual-meet win, to take the gold medal. The title is worth dlrs
50,000 to the winning team, and since only four of the 18 team
members _ Thompson, Lea Maurer, Richelle Fox and Ashley Tappin _
are out of college, those four get to share the loot. Teuscher won
the 200 freestyle and the 200 individual medley. Thompson won the
100 freestyle and swam a leg of the winning medley relay.

Slain Tajik official's widow gunned down on husband's grave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The widow of a customs official killed in a car
bomb attack last week was herself gunned down and killed early
Sunday as she visited his grave, a news agency reported.
	   The widow, Said Emomnazarova, went to the cemetery about 5 a.m.
to visit the new grave, according to Muslim tradition, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Two masked gunmen opened fire on her, and she died shortly
thereafter at a hospital, the report said.
	   Her husband, deputy customs chief Ali Emomnadzarov, was killed
Thursday when his car exploded just 100 meters (yards) from a
presidential residence.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for either attack.
	   ITAR-Tass said police and security officials are investigating
both killings. The report did not suggest a motive for either.
	   Tajikistan has been torn by violence since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. The government and mostly Islamic opposition formally
ended a five-year civil war last year, but sporadic clashes have
continued.
	   Four United Nations military observers were killed in an ambush
in mountainous eastern Tajikistan earlier this month.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No. 1 will play for the women's gold medal, but
No. 2 will not. Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce of Manhattan Beach,
California, were upset in the semifinals by Australia's Julian
Manser and Kerri Pottharst 12-11, 11-12, 12-6. McPeak and Arce
wasted two set points in the first set, battled back from a 10-3
deficit to win the second, but gave up the final five points in the
third. Manser and Pottharst will play for the title against
top-ranked Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil, winners over
Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy 12-5, 12-7.

 &UR; Boxing &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Teaunce Shepherd and Ricardo Williams Jr. won
gold medals for the United States. Shepherd, a featherweight from
Marquette, Michigan, beat Russia's Andrei Kozlovsky 9-6. Williams,
a 17-year-old from Cincinnati, routed Ebo Elder of Newman, Georgia,
16-4 in an all-American light welterweight bout. Roberto Benitez,
from New York, lost an exciting 18-14 decision to Kazakstan's
Yersin Jailauov in the flyweight final.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Michelle Kwan added the Goodwill
Games gold to her two world and U.S. titles. The Olympic silver
medalist easily beat the field, bouncing back from a rare fall to
get solid 5.9s for presentation before a near-capacity crowd that
included former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Russia's Maria
Butryskaya and Victoria Volchkov were 2-3. World champions Anjelika
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won the ice dance gold with an
energetic free dance, which earned two perfect scores. The silver
medal went to another Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia
Averbukh, with Elena Grushina and Rusian Goncharov of Ukraine
taking the bronze.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The American women's team, led by
Jenny Thompson and Cristina Teuscher, won the first six events
against Germany and went on to a 78-44 victory, its third straight
dual-meet win, to take the gold medal. The title is worth dlrs
50,000 to the winning team, and since only four of the 18 team
members _ Thompson, Lea Maurer, Richelle Fox and Ashley Tappin _
are out of college, those four get to share the loot. Teuscher won
the 200 freestyle and the 200 individual medley. Thompson won the
100 freestyle and swam a leg of the winning medley relay.

Iran says new missile guided by home-grown technology
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Sunday that the medium-range
missile it tested last month was guided by an Iranian-made system
that gives it great accuracy.
	   The Shahab-3 missile is 16 meters (53 feet) long and can travel
at a speed of 7,000 kilometers (more than 4,300 miles) per hour,
said Gen. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, head of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps' air wing.
	   ``It is a ballistic missile and can carry a one ton warhead at a
cruising altitude of 250 kilometers (155 miles) above sea level,''
said Qalibaf.
	   It was the first time Iran had given such details about the
Shahab-3.
	   On July 25, an Iranian official confirmed that the country had
successfully tested a medium-range missile with a range of 1,300
kilometers (800 miles).
	   The test launch and path had been tracked July 22 by Western
intelligence agencies.
	   ``The final test of every weapon is in a real war situation but,
given its warhead and size, the Shahab-3 is a very accurate
weapon,'' said Qalibaf, adding that its guidance system was
produced by Iranian engineers.
	   U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed concern about the
Iranian missile because it would be capable of hitting Israel and
U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.
	   Iranian officials have said the missile is for defense.
	   According to CIA reports, Iran has received substantial missile
technology from Russia, and some from China and North Korea. The
Shahab-3 is believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong ballistic
missile.
	   Last week, Martin Indyk, assistant U.S. secretary of state,
warned that Iran was working on a long-range missile that could be
deployed in two to five years.
	   Indyk said this missile, the Shahab-4, ``will present an even
greater threat'' than the Shahab-3 and pledged that the United
States would redouble its efforts to curb the transfer of
technology Iran needs to develop it.
	   On Saturday, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said his country
was determined to continue to strengthen its armed forces,
regardless of international concern.
	   ``Iran will not seek permission from anyone for strengthening
its defense capability, which has a deterrent aspect,'' Khatami
said during a Defense Ministry exhibition in Tehran.
	   ``A strong Iran is a backing for the security of friends,
neighbors and all the regional countries,'' said Khatami.
	   Iran had virtually no arms industry under the U.S.-supported
shah because Washington supplied nearly all of Iran's defense
needs. The shah was ousted during the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   The Iranians launched an ambitious arms development program
during the 1980-88 war with Iraq to compensate for weapons
shortages caused by a U.S. embargo. Since 1992, it has unveiled its
own tanks, armored personnel carriers, missiles, and even a fighter
plane.

Lockett moves up in career points race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Sydney spearhead Tony Lockett became
the second-highest goals scorer in Australian Football League
history on Saturday as the Swans beat Geelong in an Australian
Rules match.
	   Lockett booted nine goals to surpass injured Hawthorn full
forward Jason Dunstall's career total of 1,252 goals. And with a
career total of 1,256, he is just 43 short of Gordon Coventry's
61-year record of 1,299 goals.
	   Eight of Lockett's goals came in a brilliant first half as the
Swans built a 76-point lead over the Cats before surviving a
second-half comeback attempt to win 19.7 (121) to 12.15 (87).
	   Lockett ended the day on 90 goals for the season, just 10 short
of what will be his sixth century of goals in a season.
	   ``He was on fire in the first half,'' Sydney coach Rodney Eade
said of Lockett. ``I thought he had the ability to kick 16 for the
day, but we starved him (of chances) in the second half.''
	   In three matches on Sunday, Essendon beat Carlton 12.12 (84) to
11.12 (78), the West Coast defeated West Australian foes Fremantle
15.9 (99) to 8.12 (60) and Hawthorn had an easy time beating
Richmond 10.10 (70) to 4.10 (34).
	   Andrew McLeod returned from injury to kick three goals as the
Adelaide Crows beat St. Kilda 19.23 (137) to 10.7 (67) on Saturday.
	   Melbourne's goal-kicking wizard Jeff Farmer and veteran Garry
Lyon combined for an 11-goal haul as the Demons trounced Brisbane
by 95 points. Farmer booted six goals and Lyon five as the Demons
won 22.19 (151) to 8.8 (56) to stay in the hunt for a top-eight
finish.
	   North Melbourne's Canberra experiment proved an overwhelming
success when it beat Port Adelaide by 55 points in a match at
Manuka Oval in Australia's capital. The Kangaroos, who opted to
transfer the match from Melbourne in a bid to boost its membership
and corporate support, shut down the Power to win 18.23 (131) to
10.16 (76).
	   On Friday night, the first-place Western Bulldogs scored eight
goals in the second quarter while Collingwood managed just one en
route to a 43-point win, 16.14 (110) to 10.7 (67). (djp)

Colorful businessman faces calls to resign from legislature
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A businessman who rides around Hong Kong in a
gold Rolls Royce faced the prospect of losing his seat in the
legislature on Sunday after being convicted of plotting forgery in
a multi-million dollar property deal.
	   Chim Pui-chung's conviction Saturday creates further controversy
for the new 60-member legislature, which has had a series of
disputes with the government since it convened a month ago.
	   It also could tarnish the reputation of the majority of the
legislature that is not chosen by direct, popular vote at a time
when there are increasing calls for broadening democracy in Hong
Kong.
	   Chim, 50, represents the financial services industry in the
legislature, and won his seat in an election restricted to members
of the profession. Only about 300 people voted. He is the first
lawmaker to be convicted of a criminal offense since Hong Kong
returned to Chinese rule last year.
	   After deliberating for a day and a half, a nine-member jury
found Chim guilty of plotting to forge share transfer documents,
but innocent on five other charges in connection with a 350-million
Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 44.8 million) property deal in 1992.
	   Chim faces up to 14 years in prison in the sentencing, which
takes place this week. He said he would appeal the conviction.
	   Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-handover constitution,
legislators may be removed by a vote of two-thirds of their
colleagues if they are convicted of offenses and sentenced to more
than a month in jail. A new election would then be held.
	   The South China Morning Post quoted Christine Loh of the
Citizens Party as saying she hoped Chim would resign.
	   Martin Lee, leader of the largest party, the Democrats, and
Emily Lau of the Frontier movement, were quoted as saying there was
no need for the legislature to wait for the result of Chim's appeal
if he is sentenced to more than a month in jail.
	   Lee was quoted as saying that it would ``discredit the
legislature if a convicted ... member is not disqualified.''
	   Lee said the appeal could take at least a year.
	   Only 20 members of the legislature were chosen by direct,
popular vote in May 24 elections. The number is to increase slowly
in the next 10 years.
	   Thirty members of the legislature were chosen by elections
within specified professions, and the final 10 by an 800-member
election committee. Those 40 seats are dominated by pro-Beijing
elites.
	   Lee, the defacto opposition leader to Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa and his government, has been pushing along with his allies
for a faster transition to democracy.
	   Only a month old, the new legislature has confronted the
government on a series of issues including the poor start of Hong
Kong's new multi-billion dollar airport, legislative rules of
procedure and the government's desire to scrap local councils.

U.N., Taliban no closer, but more talks planned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban officials discussed what they
don't like about the international aid groups they expelled from
the Afghan capital last month, but a disappointed U.N. negotiator
said Sunday he was unable to make progress in resolving the
dispute.
	   ``We unfortunately were not given too much of an option to
discuss alternatives for the (aid groups') eventual return,'' said
Bronek Szynalski, acting coordinator of U.N. humanitarian projects
in Afghanistan. He spoke a day after some four hours of meetings
with representatives of the Taliban religious regime that controls
most of Afghanistan.
	   ``It was very disappointing for us,'' he said. ``We really have
a very short time because the winter is coming. People here depend
on international assistance.''
	   No date was set for resuming talks.
	   A Taliban official who participated had put a much more positive
spin on the meeting, raising questions about whether the two sides
have much common ground for understanding. Both Taliban Planning
Minister Khalid Din Mohammed and Szynalski said talks would
continue.
	   ``We are ready to negotiate anything which will benefit our
people. Both sides are willing to resolve the crisis,'' Mohammed
told reporters Saturday.
	   In the past, Taliban has accused international groups of
flouting the country's laws and traditions.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
confining most women to their homes.
	   International aid groups say they are committed to providing
education and other services to all.
	   While Mohammed said talks were interrupted only because
Szynalski had to go to Rome to attend to other business, Szynalski
said he was going on vacation and had planned for lower-ranking
officials to take up the negotiations. It was not clear whether
Mohammed would be willing to meet with a team led by anyone other
than Szynalski.
	   Szynalski would not elaborate on the objections Taliban
officials raised during Saturday's talks.
	   Taliban officials last month demanded that aid groups move from
homes and offices scattered throughout Kabul to dormitories on a
university campus heavily damaged in Afghanistan's long civil war.
About 200 aid workers from 38 independent humanitarian agencies who
had been carrying out or supplementing U.N. projects were expelled
July 20 after refusing to move.
	   Aid workers say that the dormitories are unsafe and
uninhabitable, and that the order to move may have been a pretext
to get them out of Kabul after months of tension.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Brisbane, Melbourne and Newcastle share
the top of the National Rugby League table after the 21st round on
the weekend, a point ahead of the western Sydney club Parramatta.
	   The Broncos and Melbourne won on the weekend while Newcastle
lost a squeaker to Illawarra, leaving the three on 31 points from
15 wins, a draw and five losses.
	   Parramatta, which also won on the weekend, has 30 points, with
North Sydney two back on 28 and three more clubs _ Sydney City,
Canberra and St. George _ another two back on 26 points in the
league's tight race for playoff spots.
	   On Sunday, the first-year Storm from Melbourne beat Sydney City
32-20, Manly edged Balmain 20-18, Canterbury beat Western Suburbs
56-14 and Canberra defeated Penrith 48-26.
	   Steve Renouf, Darren Smith and Wendel Sailor scored two tries
each as Brisbane beat the Adelaide Rams 46-12 on Saturday.
	   Illawarra five-eighth Trent Barrett scored his third try with 35
seconds left to beat Newcastle 28-26. The Knights came back from a
16-4 halftime deficit to lead 26-22 inside the final minute before
Barrett's match-winner.
	   Parramatta might have paid a high price for its 16-8 win over
South Sydney as Eels playmaker Jim Dymock was carried off the field
13 minutes from the end after being injured tackling Souths
frontrower Michael Francis.
	   North Sydney scrambled to a controversial 19-14 win over the
Gold Coast.
	   In the dying minutes, referee Moghseen Jadwat sin-binned
Chargers center Graham Mackay for dissent and then appeared to fail
to hear the siren, allowing Bears winger Nigel Roy to go over the
line.
	   The crowd jeered Jadwat, who later said he did not hear the
siren until the ball was in play.
	   On Friday, center Nigel Vagana scored three tries as Auckland
beat North Queensland 34-18. And Cronulla pair David Peachey and
Nick Graham led the Sharks to a 38-10 win over St. George. (djp)

Green Bay beats Kansas City 27-24
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ It was a day of second chances for Green Bay, and
Ryan Longwell cashed in on the biggest of them, kicking a 27-yard
field goal 10 minutes into sudden death overtime to give the
Packers a 27-24 victory over Kansas City Sunday.
	   At the start, the Packers had spotted the Chiefs a 14-0 lead by
fumbling on their first two possessions.
	   In the closing minute of regulation time, with the score 24-24,
a tripping penalty stalled a good scoring chance and Longwell
missed a 45-yard field goal attempt.
	   In overtime, it was teammate Brett Conway's turn to miss what
would have been the winning field goal, from 25 yards.
	   Then Longwell came through after Kansas City's Pete Stoyanovich
had missed from 42 yards.
	   Except for starter Brett Favre, each of Green Bay's four
quarterbacks was on the field for at least one scoring drive.
	   David Klingler led the two drives in overtime, setting up the
field goal attempts with passes to Bill Schroeder of 28 yards the
first time and 38 the second. Klingler, who came on in the fourth
quarter, hit on 6 of 7 attempts for 102 yards.
	   ``There some moments when I got mad, but most of the time they
were stable,'' Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren said of his
quarterbacks.
	   No. 2 quarterback Doug Pederson led the Packers' comeback from
14-0 to 14-14 at halftime, finishing his stint with a 26-yard
touchdown pass to Schroeder and a throw to Derrick Mayes for a
two-point conversion. He hit on 6 of 12 tries for 91 hards.
	   Matt Hasselbeck had the easiest drive. Glyn Milburn put him on
the Kansas City 17 with a 76-yard kickoff return, he passed to
Schroder for 8 yards, and a moment later Raymont Harris carried the
final yard.
	   ``Doug had a nice throw on that touchdown,'' Holmgren said.
``Defensively, we hung in there and had a nice goal-line stand with
that fumble recovery. Overall, though, we still made too many
mistakes _ fumbles and penalties.''
	   The goal-line stand was Antonio London's recovery on the Green
Bay 3 when Vonnie Holliday forced a fumble by the Chiefs' Jesse
Haynes as he was heading for the end zone.
	   Pederson then led his 97-yard touchdown drive. Earlier on his
watch, Travis Jervey's 48-yard run to the Kansas City 38 set up a
51-yard field goal by Longwell and Mike Prior's interception of a
pass by Billy Joe Tolliver led to a 38-yard field goal by Conway.
	   Kansas City threatened at the end of the half, but Stoyanovich
missed a 40-yard field goal with 22 seconds left.
	   The Chiefs scored their first two touchdowns on a 2-yard pass
from Elvis Grbac to Tony Richardson and a 7-yard run by Kimble
Anders after fumbles by Favre, recovered by Chester McGlockton at
the Green Bay 18, and by William Henderson, grabbed by Mark
McMillian at the Green Bay 41.
	   Their other scoring came on a 30-yard pass from Pat Barnes, the
Chiefs' second-half quarterback, to Willy Tate and a 34-yard field
goal by Stoyanovich. Barnes completed 10 of 24 attempts for 206
yards and was intercepted once.
	   Conway kicked the 27-yard field goal that tied the game for
Green Bay at 24 with 8:41 left in regulation after an exchange of
interceptions.
	   Grbac, who hit on five of six passes in the first quarter, but
for just 30 yards, said of the opening touchdowns, ``Obviously the
defense set us up, but it was a good sign for our team. We get
turnovers like that and can capitalize and get seven points.''
	   An opportunity to drive the whole field would have been nice, he
added, but ``it really kind of heightens all your senses when
you're in the red zone.''
	   Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer said, ``The defense
played very strong. The offense had some opportunities but made too
many mistakes.''
	   Late in the second quarter, he said, ``we had an opportunity to
take charge down here, as we were penetrating the end zone, and we
fumbled the ball, which took a big play away.''
	   Some of the biggest cheers went to Japanese player Masato Itai,
a temporary addition to the Chiefs' roster. Toward the end of the
third quarter, he brought down Green Bay kickoff returner Roell
Preston with an open-field tackle.
	   ``I've reached a goal now that I've experienced a top-rated
game,'' he said.

Hart says his job may be on the line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ After three consecutive New
Zealand rugby union losses _ the first time that's happened since
1949 _ All Black coach John Hart admits his job may be on the line.
	   Hart said Sunday that if New Zealand lost its two matches
remaining matches in its international rugby program this season _
against South Africa in Durban on Aug. 15 and against Australia in
Sydney on Aug. 29 _ he would understand why the New Zealand union
might review his position.
	   New Zealand has suffered consecutive losses to Australia,
including Saturday's 27-23 decision which gave the Wallabies the
Bledisloe Cup, and to South Africa in the Tri Nations series.
	   ``Obviously I'm under pressure because the buck invariably stops
with the coach,'' Hart said Sunday. ``That makes it a difficult
time for me.
	   ``I believe in the All Blacks, my resolve's harder. I've just
got to go forward. We've got to get up and go. We're not on the
canvas.''
	   ``I'm sure the (New Zealand) union will review my position,'' he
said, responding to a question regarding the coaching staff's
future if New Zealand lost the next two games.
	   ``They understand what is happening. They understand what we're
going through, I know I got the full support and confidence of all
last night, which I appreciated.''
	   Hart will name a fresh All Black test 15 in a squad of 26 on
Tuesday for the remaining two matches. He confirmed changes would
be made to the team with the World Cup in mind.
	   Hart intends to name 40 players in October in his World Cup
squad for next year.
	   ``This is a really dark time for us, it's a difficult time,'' he
added. ``What I knew was an issue has become a major issue _ that's
losing Sean Fitzpatrick and Frank Bunce at the same time.
	   ``I knew it was going to be difficult without them, but I
thought I had the capacity and experience in the team to step up.
That has not happened.'' (djp)

Butler due in Iraq as country marks 1990 invasion of Kuwait

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad papers on Sunday marked the eighth
anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait by accusing the oil-rich
emirate of working with the West to maintain punishing trade
sanctions against the country.
	   Meanwhile, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was
due in Baghdad at mid-afternoon with a team of experts to discuss
Iraq's disarmament efforts.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it needs to do to comply with U.N.
resolutions calling for the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that trade sanctions imposed
to punish Iraq for its Aug. 2, 1990, invasion, which set off the
1991 Gulf War, cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify the
weapons have been eliminated.
	   Butler was expected to be accompanied by 19 specialists,
including Nikita Smidovich, chief U.N. missile investigator; Horst
Reeps, head of chemical weapons teams, and Cabreile Kraatz-Wadfack,
responsible for biological weapons inspections.
	   Iraq's Parliament has scheduled a special session Monday to
review Iraq's relations with the U.N. inspectors and to discuss
power shortages that have plagued the country in recent weeks.
	   On Sunday, Al-Thawra, the official newspaper of the ruling Baath
party, said in an editorial that Kuwait was to blame for the 1990
invasion.
	   It accused the emirate of provoking the invasion by producing
over its OPEC quota, thus driving down prices at a time Iraq was
trying to recover from its 1980-88 war with Iran. It also accused
Kuwait of ``speaking in mean ways'' to Iraqi envoys about
production from a disputed field near the Iraq-Kuwait frontier.
	   It said Kuwait has become a servant of the West.
	   ``Kuwait is an American base,'' Al-Thawra said, referring to
U.S. troops stationed there. ``The rulers are hiding behind the
borders of the Security Council, supplying the agents and
mercenaries with what they need to plot against our country ... to
prolong sanctions.''
	   It called on Kuwaitis ``to stop harming Iraq, to look at the
future with an open mind.''
	   The state-run Al-Jumhuriya said in an editorial that ``since
1991, Kuwaiti rulers have put their territories under the use of
American and British forces in order to threaten Iraq's
independence.''
	   It also accused Kuwait of being the base for an anti-Iraq radio
station and said this occurred despite Iraq's ``willingness to
forget the past for the sake of safety and security of the
region.''
	   Babil, a daily owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai,
said in its editorial that Kuwait, in alliance with Western powers,
has used its resources to make war on Iraq and ``to bribe this
international official or that to prolong the sanctions.''
	   Kuwait has said that sanctions _ including an air travel ban and
limits on oil sales _ should not be lifted until Iraq accounts for
some 600 Kuwaitis and foreign nations missing since the invasion.
	   Kuwaiti Information Minister Yousef al-Sumait, currently on a
visit to Cairo, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Sunday that
``Kuwait is the country that was attacked and, as such, when there
are initiatives (for reconciliation), they should come from the
attacker, not the country that was attacked.''
	   He said his country ``is not responsible for what happens in
Iraq,'' which are the result of U.N. sanctions. He added that ``the
Kuwaiti people do not bear any hatred for the Iraqi people.''

Investigators to visit Jaffna and look for mass graves

	   JAFFNA, Sri Lanka (AP) _ State-appointed human rights officials
and police will visit Jaffna this week to investigate the claim of
a soldier and convicted killer that he helped bury hundreds of
Tamil civilians in northern Sri Lanka.
	   ``The soldier also is likely to visit Jaffna,'' Major-General
Lionel Balagalle, commander of the Sri Lankan security forces, told
a group of visiting journalists on Saturday. The investigations by
police and the Human Rights Commission and were to start in a few
days.
	   The soldier, Corporal Dewage Somaratne, claims he knows where
nearly 400 ethnic Tamils were killed by government forces and
buried on the outskirts of Jaffna, a predominately Tamil town 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Colombo.
	   Rebel forces are fighting a guerrilla war for an independent
homeland for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority, who they claim suffer
discrimination by the island nation's Sinhalese majority.
	   Between 500 and 600 Tamil civilians have disappeared in northern
Jaffna Peninsula, which includes the town of Jaffna, since the
military drove out Tamil rebels and took control in May 1996.
	   Local residents say that the question of the missing civilians
should be settled quickly to avoid a setback in efforts to restore
faith in the government among the Tamils of Jaffna.
	   The government last month ordered an inquiry into Somaratne's
claim. He is one of five soldiers and a policeman who were
sentenced to death in July for raping and murdering a teen-age
Tamil student and later killing her mother, brother and a neighbor
who had tried to find her.
	   As he was sentenced, Somaratne told the court that the soldiers
sentenced to death merely buried the victims and could show
authorities the graves of Tamil civilians.

Banned newspaper keeps publishing under new name

 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A pro-democracy daily ordered shut twice
came out under a new name Sunday, setting the stage for a clash
with powerful hard-liners opposed to reformist President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   The paper's editor, Mahmoud Shams, said it was published under
the name Aftab'e Emrooz,'' or ``The Sun Today,'' with the lead
story an account of an attack on the newspaper's offices by thugs
believed tied to ultra-conservative politicians.
	   He said told The Associated Press that the paper was the same in
tone as Tous, which was ordered closed by the hard-line judiciary
Saturday. Tous began publication without missing an issue when its
predecessor, Jameah, was ordered shut July 25.
	   The papers gained popularity, especially among the young, for
frank criticism and analyses of Iranian politics. But they angered
the ultra-conservatives who were the focus of the criticisms.
	   The paper's defiance placed it at the center of a power struggle
between the deeply unpopular hard-liners and the popular Khatami.
	   The power to close down the paper rests with the judiciary. But
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, run by a Khatami
loyalist, issues permits for newspapers.
	   Hours after Tous was ordered closed, Islamic Guidance officials
urged judicial authorities to allow the paper to keep publishing,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Something should be done to enable this newspaper to continue
publication,'' IRNA quoted the ministry as saying in a letter to
the judiciary.
	   Shortly before the ban on Tous was served Saturday, militants
believed allied to the hard-liners assaulted the paper's editor and
threatened to kill him. They also beat two Associated Press
reporters who arrived on the scene.
	   ``The attack both on me and the AP reporters has raised the
price of seeking freedom in this country,'' Shams said Saturday.
	   ``What is dangerous is that the fate of Mr. Khatami's government
will be determined in the streets, where militants are taking the
law into their own hands,'' he added.
	   On Sunday, the daily Tehran Times said in an editorial that an
immediate investigation should be conducted into who carried out
Saturday's attack on the newspaper.
	   ``The law should not be allowed to be taken into hands by those
who want to impose their own will by force,'' the English-language
paper said.
	   The Justice Department justified its banning of the newspaper
Tous by citing ``several articles of the press law,'' IRNA said. It
gave no details.
	   Hard-liners were angered because the newspaper questioned the
authority of Iran's spiritual guide, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, asking
how an unelected person could wield more power than the president,
who won more than 20 million votes in last year's elections.
	   In a Friday sermon, Iran's chief judge, Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, attacked the minister of culture and Islamic guidance,
Ataollah Mohajerani, for granting licenses to ``newspapers that
have sprouted like mushrooms and write whatever they want.''
	   ``The people will not tolerate such newspapers,'' he warned.
	   Tous replied with a scathing column on Saturday, entitled ``Mr.
Yazdi, please calm down.''
	   Tous was not the only paper to come under pressure from
hard-liners. Earlier, the managing director of the weekly Khaneh,
Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, was arrested for printing a letter by an
anonymous woman who criticized Iran's late spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

Israeli opposition's Washington visit attacked by ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's ruling Likud party accused opposition
leaders on Sunday of trying to enlist American pressure against
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his conduct of negotiations
with the Palestinians.
	   A Labor Party delegation headed by party leader Ehud Barak was
headed to Washington for talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, and
members of Congress. The delegation may also meet U.S. President
Clinton.
	   Uzi Landau, a senior Likud lawmaker, said the Labor leaders were
trying to get the Americans to put pressure on Netanyahu to make
concessions at a critical stage of negotiations with the
Palestinians.
	   ``Conducting a campaign there against the government of Israel
is something which I think should make us all feel humiliated,''
Landau told Israel's Army Radio.
	   The Israeli ambassador in Washington, Zalman Shoval, suggested
the Labor delegation would urge the U.S. administration to make
public the details of its proposal _ submitted several months ago _
for bridging the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians over the
size of the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Shoval, a political appointee of the Netanyahu government, told
Israel Radio that if a Knesset member on an overseas visit ``calls
on the host government to publish something which is contrary to
the policy of his own government and country, this is improper and
ought to be avoided,''
	   The U.S. initiative is widely believed to call on Israel to hand
over another 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians. The
Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel has so far
rejected it.
	   The Labor legislators denied that they would ask the United
States to publish the initiative or to pressure the Netanyahu
government for concessions.
	   Ephraim Sneh said he and his colleagues had come to the U.S.
``so that they (the Americans) will know that in Israel at least
half the nation has a different view ... on the issue of peace from
that of the government of Israel.''
	   The Labor Party, which oversaw the signing of the
Israel-Palestinian peace agreements in 1993 and 1995, narrowly lost
Israel's 1996 elections to Likud by less than 1 percent of the
vote. The party's chances in the next elections, in 2000, were
shaken last week after a party leader, Ori Orr, was quoted in a
newspaper interview as making racist comments about Moroccan Jews
	   Orr was dropped from the delegation to the United States after
the interview, in which he was quoted as saying that Moroccan Jews
have no curiosity about what is going on around them. Orr said his
comments were distorted.
	   Veteran Labor lawmaker Shevah Weiss, said Orr's comments were
``a terrible blow'' to Labor's chances in the next election.
	   The Moroccans are one of Israel's largest immigrant groups,
second only to Jews from the former Soviet Union. The Moroccans
have traditionally voted for Likud, but Weiss said Labor needs to
make at least some inroads into the Moroccan vote to win the
election.

Fukushima defends Golf 5 Ladies title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIZUNAMI, Japan (AP) _ Akiko Fukushima shot a final round of
3-under-par 69 Sunday to defend her Golf 5 Ladies title by one
stroke for her first victory of the season.
	   Fukushima, Japan LPGA Tour's top player in the last two years,
birdied the first two holes and sank three more birdies against two
bogeys en route to an 8-under 208 total.
	   Fukushima, who has a 300-yard drive, birdied the four longest
holes.
	   For her 12th career victory, the 25-year-old Fukushima earned 9
million yen (dlrs 64,200) from a purse of 50 million yen (dlrs
357,000).
	   ``I feel like it took so long before today's breakthrough,''
said Fukushima, winner of six tournaments last season alone.
	   ``I wasn't hitting the ball close and well today. So, the
birdies on the final two holes yesterday were the key for this
victory,'' she said.
	   With the victory, Fukushima leaped from 15th to sixth place on
this year's money list with 24.5 million yen (dlrs 175,000).
	   Kaori Harada now leads the list with 35.8 million yen (dlrs
255,700), followed by South Korean Ku Ok-hee's 35.2 million yen
(dlrs 251,000).
	   Ku, winner of the Chukyo TV-Bridgestone Ladies in May, also
fired a 69 for 209. Ku was seeking her 15th title in Japan.
	   Overnight leader Marnie McGuire of New Zealand shot a 72 and was
alone in third place at 210.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad newspapers on Sunday marked the
eighth anniversary of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by accusing the
oil-rich emirate of colluding with Western powers to maintain
strict trade sanctions against Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was
due in Baghdad with a team of experts to discuss Iraq's disarmament
efforts.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it needs to do to comply with U.N.
resolutions calling for the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that trade sanctions imposed
to punish Iraq for its Aug. 2, 1990, invasion, which set off the
1991 Gulf War, cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify the
weapons have been eliminated.
	   Butler, expected to arrive by mid-afternoon, was to be
accompanied by 19 specialists.
	   Iraq's Parliament has scheduled a special session Monday to
review Iraq's relations with the U.N. inspectors and to discuss
electricity shortages that have plagued the country in recent
weeks.
	   On Sunday, Al-Thawra, the official newspaper of the ruling Baath
party, said in an editorial that neighboring Kuwait was to blame
for the 1990 invasion.
	   It accused the emirate of provoking the invasion by producing
more oil than it was allowed under its OPEC quota, thus driving
down prices at a time Iraq was trying to recover from its 1980-88
war with Iran. It also accused Kuwait of ``speaking in mean ways''
to Iraqi envoys about production from a disputed oil field near the
Iraq-Kuwait frontier.
	   It said Kuwait has become a servant of the West.
	   ``Kuwait is an American base,'' Al-Thawra said, referring to
U.S. troops stationed there. ``The rulers are hiding behind the
borders of the Security Council, supplying the agents and
mercenaries with what they need to plot against our country ... to
prolong sanctions.''
	   It called on Kuwaitis ``to stop harming Iraq, to look at the
future with an open mind.''
	   The state-run Al-Jumhuriya said in an editorial that ``since
1991, Kuwaiti rulers have put their territories under the use of
American and British forces in order to threaten Iraq's
independence.''
	   It also accused Kuwait of being the base for an anti-Iraq radio
station and said this occurred despite Iraq's ``willingness to
forget the past for the sake of safety and security of the
region.''
	   Babil, a daily owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai,
said in its editorial that Kuwait, in alliance with Western powers,
has used its resources to make war on Iraq and ``to bribe this
international official or that to prolong the sanctions.''
	   Kuwait has said that sanctions _ including an air travel ban and
limits on oil sales _ should not be lifted until Iraq accounts for
some 600 Kuwaitis and foreigners missing since the invasion.
	   Kuwaiti Information Minister Yousef al-Sumait, currently on a
visit to Cairo, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Sunday that
``Kuwait is the country that was attacked and, as such, when there
are initiatives (for reconciliation), they should come from the
attacker, not the country that was attacked.''
	   He added that ``the Kuwaiti people do not bear any hatred for
the Iraqi people.''

Ruling party attacks Israeli opposition's Washington visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's ruling Likud party accused opposition
leaders on Sunday of trying to generate American pressure against
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his conduct of negotiations
with the Palestinians.
	   A Labor Party delegation headed by party leader Ehud Barak was
headed to the United States for talks in Washington with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger, and members of the U.S. Congress. The delegation may
also meet U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Uzi Landau, a senior Likud lawmaker, said the Labor leaders were
trying to persuade the Americans to pressure Netanyahu to make
concessions at a critical stage of negotiations with the
Palestinians.
	   ``Conducting a campaign there against the government of Israel
is something which I think should make us all feel humiliated,''
Landau told Israel's Army Radio.
	   The Israeli ambassador in Washington, Zalman Shoval, suggested
the Labor delegation would urge the U.S. administration to make
public the details of its proposal _ submitted several months ago _
for bridging the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians over the
size of the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the
West Bank.
	   Shoval, a political appointee of the Netanyahu government, told
Israel Radio that if a Knesset member on an overseas visit ``calls
on the host government to publish something which is contrary to
the policy of his own government and country, this is improper and
ought to be avoided,''
	   The U.S. initiative is widely believed to call on Israel to hand
over an additional 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel has so far
rejected it. Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   The Labor legislators denied that they would ask the United
States to publish the initiative or to pressure the Netanyahu
government for concessions.
	   Ephraim Sneh said he and his colleagues had come to the U.S.
``so that they (the Americans) will know that in Israel at least
half the nation has a different view ... on the issue of peace from
that of the government of Israel.''
	   The Labor Party, which oversaw the signing of the
Israel-Palestinian peace agreements in 1993 and 1995, narrowly lost
Israel's 1996 elections to Likud by less than 1 percent of the
vote. The party's chances in the next elections, in 2000, were
shaken last week after a party leader, Ori Orr, was quoted in a
newspaper interview as making racist comments about Moroccan Jews
	   Orr was dropped from the delegation to the United States after
the interview, in which he was quoted as saying that Moroccan Jews
have no curiosity about what is going on around them. Orr said his
comments were distorted.
	   Veteran Labor lawmaker Shevah Weiss, said Orr's comments were
``a terrible blow'' to Labor's chances in the next election.
	   The Moroccans are one of Israel's largest immigrant groups,
second only to Jews from the former Soviet Union. The Moroccans
have traditionally voted for Likud, but Weiss said Labor needs to
make at least some inroads into the Moroccan vote to win the
election.

Over 5 million Chinese enter ranks of newly wealthy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Economic reforms have created a substantial class
of newly wealthy Chinese, with more than 5.3 million families
boasting annual incomes of 50,000 yuan (U.S. dlrs 6,097) or more, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Private businessmen and managers make up the core of the newly
affluent, the Beijing Daily said, quoting a recent study.
	   Stood next to China's population of 1.2 billion people, the
numbers of those considered well off _ an estimated at 30 million
men, women and children _ remain tiny. But their emergence
indicates that liberalized economic policies are creating wealth on
a broader scale.
	   Others entering the wealthy class include teachers who tutor
privately at home, securities traders, entertainers, and
advertising executives, the paper said.
	   China is counting on those with cash to drive a market for
private housing and consumer goods. Increased consumption is
considered vital to keeping the economy on an even keel, as export
growth slows due to Asia's economic crisis.
	   Burdened with huge numbers of people and limited arable land,
China's population was overwhelming poor before the Communist Party
took power in 1949.
	   Under Mao Tse-tung's leadership, disastrous economic development
drives and a lumbering state industrial sector kept most at just
above the subsistence level. Mao's successor, Deng Xiaoping, made
economic development a priority, instituting reforms and permitting
private businesses in the early 1980s.
	   The economy exploded again in 1993 after Deng urged more lending
and investment as a rebuff to conservative opponents who were
calling for a return to a state planned economy. Deng's
encouragement created jobs and whole new industries, but also led
to speculation and a construction glut that saddled state banks
with huge amounts of unrecoverable loans.
	   Wealth has been concentrated heavily in urban areas and along
the southern coast, the favored location for foreign investment.
City dwellers made an average of 4,839 yuan (dlrs 590) per capita
per year in 1996, compared with 1,926 yuan (dlrs 234) for rural
residents.
	   That income gap is expected to widen due to difficulties in
increasing agricultural production and prices for farm goods that
are already considered high. Disparities between rich and poor in
the cities are also expected to increase as millions of workers are
laid off from struggling state enterprises.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad papers on Sunday marked the eighth
anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait by accusing the oil-rich
emirate of working with the West to maintain punishing trade
sanctions against the country.
	   Meanwhile, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was
due in Baghdad at mid-afternoon with a team of experts to discuss
Iraq's disarmament efforts.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it needs to do to comply with U.N.
resolutions calling for the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that trade sanctions imposed
to punish Iraq for its Aug. 2, 1990, invasion, which set off the
1991 Gulf War, cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify the
weapons have been eliminated.
	   Butler was accompanied by 13 specialists, including Nikita
Smidovich, the chief U.N. missile investigator, and Scott Ritter,
an American who has angered the Baghdad regime with unannounced
inspections.
	   Butler's deputy, Charles Duelfer, told The Associated Press in
Bahrain shortly before the team flew to Baghdad that talks with
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, and others on ``a wide
range of issues'' would begin Monday.
	   Duelfer denied Iraqi allegations last week that one of the U.N.
inspectors was caught spying. Iraqi newspapers reported that the
inspector, Jason Gilbert, took pictures of a passing train and was
ordered by his Iraqi minders to destroy the film.
	   ``There is no base to what the Iraqis are saying,'' Duelfer
said. ``The guy was just doing his job.'' He declined further
comment.

Some suburbs approved to drink tap water, but 92 percent still
</HEADLINE>
unsafe
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Water in 8 percent of Sydney households
was declared fit to drink Sunday, though the rest of the city's 3.7
million residents must continue to boil their water for up to a
week before a dangerous parasite is flushed from the system.
	   The outbreak of the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium, has
been an international embarrassment to the city that will host the
summer Olympics in two years.
	   ``If Sydney can't guarantee clean water for major sporting
events, what will the world sporting community think about our
capacity to hold the year 2000 Olympics?' asked opposition Sport
and Recreation spokesman Brad Hazzard.
	   New South Wales Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles said Sunday
that some suburbs in the city's south and a few in Sydney's west
had tested clear of the parasites.
	   He said there may be further announcements Sunday night on other
suburbs, as the situation was improving.
	   ``Sydney's water supply continues to improve, fresh clean water
is flushing through the Sydney water system,'' he told reporters.
	   Most people in Sydney have been using boiled or bottled drinking
water since the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium were
belatedly announced to be in the city's water supply last week.
	   No illnesses have been reported. But the parasites have an
incubation period of a week or more, so it may take several more
days for any serious health problems to develop.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, including
the very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee in 1993,
contributing to the deaths of about 100 people. More than 400,000
others were sickened.
	   The breakdown of the water system is a blow to Sydney, a city
whose water often ranked high or won international taste tests when
compared with premium bottled waters.
	   ``I don't think you will see people drinking tap water again for
a while, if at all. It's going to take a very long time for Sydney
Water to restore people's faith,'' said Diane Morgan, managing
director of Da Vinci marking consultants.
	   An independent inquiry set up by the government was examining
why only southern Sydney residents were warned about the
contamination on Thursday, even though the filtration plant at
fault served all of Sydney.
	   The north side of Sydney, which received a warning later,
includes many middle- and upper-class neighborhoods and the Sydney
residences of Prime Minister John Howard and the governor-general,
the representative of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The cause of the contamination is unclear. Officials have not
found evidence that the carcasses of dogs and foxes found in or
near an open canal leading to a filtration plant were the source.
	   Sydney Water Managing Director Chris Pollett has said the
contamination may have come from contaminated run-off.

Kawamura wins second career victory in NST Niigata
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOYOURA, Japan (AP) _ Masayuki Kawamura fired a course record of
9-under-par 63 Sunday and won the NST Niigata Open by eight strokes
for his second career victory.
	   Kawamura, who last won the 1995 Tokai Classic, scored 10
birdies, including three straight from No. 11, against a single
bogey for a 20-under 268 total.
	   The 31-year-old Kawamura earned 10.8 million yen (dlrs 77,000)
from a purse of 60 million yen (dlrs 428,000).
	   ``It was like someone else was putting for me throughout the
tournament,'' said Kawamura. ``I've been using a new putter this
year which I felt suits me well. Today, I was putting relaxed and
it gave confidence to the game.''
	   Shingo Katayama shot a 68 and shared second place at 12-under
276 with Kiyoshi Murota, who had a 69.
	   Another two strokes behind at 278 were South Korean Kim
Jong-duk, Nobuhito Sato and overnight leader Daisuke Serizawa.
	   Defending champion Kazuhiko Hosokawa shot a 69 and placed
seventh at 279.

Hart says his job may be on the line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds at end of story that brother has terminal illness,
mother's comments, deletes extraneous word in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ After three consecutive New
Zealand rugby union losses _ the first time that's happened since
1949 _ All Black coach John Hart admits his job may be on the line.
	   Hart said Sunday that if New Zealand lost its two remaining
matches in its international rugby program this season _ against
South Africa in Durban on Aug. 15 and against Australia in Sydney
on Aug. 29 _ he would understand why the New Zealand union might
review his position.
	   New Zealand has suffered consecutive losses to Australia,
including Saturday's 27-23 decision which gave the Wallabies the
Bledisloe Cup, and to South Africa in the Tri Nations series.
	   ``Obviously I'm under pressure because the buck invariably stops
with the coach,'' Hart said Sunday. ``That makes it a difficult
time for me.
	   ``I believe in the All Blacks, my resolve's harder. I've just
got to go forward. We've got to get up and go. We're not on the
canvas.''
	   ``I'm sure the (New Zealand) union will review my position,'' he
said, responding to a question regarding the coaching staff's
future if New Zealand lost the next two games.
	   ``They understand what is happening. They understand what we're
going through, I know I got the full support and confidence of all
last night, which I appreciated.''
	   Hart will name a fresh All Black test 15 in a squad of 26 on
Tuesday for the remaining two matches. He confirmed changes would
be made to the team with the World Cup in mind.
	   Hart intends to name 40 players in October in his World Cup
squad for next year.
	   ``This is a really dark time for us, it's a difficult time,'' he
added. ``What I knew was an issue has become a major issue _ that's
losing Sean Fitzpatrick and Frank Bunce at the same time.
	   ``I knew it was going to be difficult without them, but I
thought I had the capacity and experience in the team to step up.
That has not happened.''
	   As if things weren't bad enough on the field for Hart, the New
Zealand coach is also facing personal trauma _ his brother, Graeme,
is battling terminal cancer and pneumonia.
	   Their mother, Joan Hart, said the family was struggling through
a difficult period, regardless of what was happening to the All
Blacks.
	   ``These are hard times for us,'' Joan Hart said Sunday.
``Football is nothing when something like this happens.''
	   But she said she and her husband Joe are concerned about
52-year-old John as well.
	   ``We don't like hearing the snipes about our son _ he's trying
his best,'' she said. ``Joe and I get upset watching it on TV.''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ William ``Blinky'' Rodriguez turned his grief
over a son killed by the bullets of gang warfare into a mission to
stop street violence.
	   The Californian has become a gang peacemaker of sorts, making
friends out of foes and teaching enemies to give unity a chance.
	   His efforts in the northeast corner of the city's San Fernando
Valley have not gone unnoticed. The United Nations will honor him
this week with a medal of excellence _ one of only 14 chosen
worldwide.
	   The award comes from years of activism. His most heralded effort
was a 1993 peace pact, the Valley Unity Peace treaty, that
Rodriguez organized among 75 Latino street gangs in the San
Fernando Valley.
	   Rodriguez combed the streets with peace treaty volunteers,
arranging meetings with gang leaders and taking action when a
shooting occurred to stem the tide of retaliatory attacks. He even
called gang members on the phone and kept tabs on progress.
	   After only five months, the truce brought gang-related homicides
in the San Fernando Valley down by 70 percent, city officials said.
	   Violence among youth gangs plagues economically depressed
neighborhoods of many U.S. cities. Drive-by shootings and the use
of military-style submachineguns have increased the risk to
non-participants as well as gang members.
	   Rodriguez' work has essentially saved lives, a luxury he did not
have with his son, Sonny. In 1990, the teen-ager was killed in a
gang-related drive-by shooting.
	   ``When my kid got killed, it just ignited the passion and
compassion to do the work,'' Rodriguez said. ``It was either that
or become a time bomb. We chose this route, and it's not been
easy.''
	   Before brokering the treaty, Rodriguez _ a former kick-boxing
champion _ and his wife, Lilly, worked with youths and gang members
who they trained in their Van Nuys kick-boxing and martial arts
gym.
	   Rodriguez, 44, now travels to schools and juvenile camps in an
attempt to reach potential gang members before they get sucked into
crime on the streets. He also has developed a program at Universal
City Walk that provides middle and upper management mentors for
youths considered to be especially at risk.
	   On Friday, Rodriguez was notified of his being selected to
receive the prestigious Fete d' Excellence for 1998, a medal issued
by the Beverly Hills-based nonprofit World Wins Corporation and the
United Nations.
	   Rodriguez and his wife will accept the award and speak before a
United Nations round table in Geneva, Switzerland. Rodriguez will
be presented with his medal in a ceremony on Thursday.
	   Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose 7th Council District includes
many of the gang-plagued neighborhoods Rodriguez deals with, said
the award is appropriate recognition for Rodriguez' hard work.
	   ``I know he has a deep, deep passion for trying to improve our
community,'' Alarcon said.
	   Wilda Spalding, president of World Wins Corp., became aware of
Rodriguez's work and nominated him for the award.
	   Rodriguez said he was ``totally blown away'' by the honor. He
has stayed motivated despite suffering a heart attack a few months
ago.
	   ``I'm going to go there and tell them there's hope _ that it's
not over till it's over,'' Rodriguez said.

Group seeking residence papers occupies Vatican mission a second
</HEADLINE>
day &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 15 illegal immigrants occupied the Vatican
mission to France for a second day Sunday, waiting for French
authorities to grant residence permits, or for Pope John Paul II to
intervene on their behalf.
	   ``The situation is still blocked,'' said the protesters'
spokesman, Madjyguene Cisse.
	   On Saturday, authorities proposed a meeting with Paris Police
Chief Philippe Massoni, on condition the mainly African protesters
leave the mission in the chic 16th district.
	   ``We refused,'' Cisse said.
	   The group entered the Vatican mission about 10:30 a.m. Saturday
saying they wanted a ``morally viable mediator'' for their cause.
	   Vatican representative to France, Mario Tagliaferri, proposed to
act as mediator, but it was not clear what efforts may have been
made on behalf of the occupiers.
	   The group was served Sunday breakfast as well as dinner
Saturday.
	   The occupiers say they are seeking papers for 17 comrades who
were part of a group of some 300 African illegal immigrants who
occupied the Saint Bernard church for two months in 1996.
	   Police stormed the church and expelled the group, but many since
then have become legal residents of France.
	   The Saint Bernard group now serves as a model for other illegal
immigrants seeking papers to remain in France.
	   Last week, several hundred Asians held a street protest to press
their demands for residence permits.

Army says eight killed in rebel attack; newspapers say 17
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army Sunday put the death toll at
eight in a rebel attack on the western town of Kasese, but
government and private newspapers said it was as high as 17.
	   In a statement read Sunday morning on Radio Uganda, western
region commander Brig. James Kazini said eight people, including
two soldiers, were killed in the attack early Friday (cq) by rebels
from the Alliance of Democratic Forces, who also burned two hotels
and 20 vehicles.
	   ``The bandits burned down the hotels and vehicles as they
retreated in the mountains. They had infiltrated from the mountains
with the aim of looting food, drugs and other essential items,''
the statement said.
	   Kazini added that the situation in the mining town 380
kilometers (235 miles) west of Kampala in the foothills of the
Rwenzori mountains was under control.
	   But the government-owned New Vision, Uganda's largest newspaper,
put the death toll at 16, including a private and a sergeant in the
Ugandan army and two policemen.
	   The newspaper said the rebels hit the town from three sides,
attacking the officers' mess at the local army barracks, the
airstrip and the town center.
	   The private Monitor newspaper said 17 people, including three
soldiers, two policemen, two rebels and 10 civilians, were killed
in the first attack ADF rebels have launched on an urban target.
	   The newspaper, quoting an army officer identified as Lt. Col.
Rwangombe, said five others, including four Filipinos working at a
nearby cobalt processing plant who were staying in one of the
hotels, were rushed to hospital with serious burns.
	   The private Radio Simba said 11 Filipinos had been hospitalized.
	   On Saturday, travellers arriving in Kampala from Kasese
identified several of the injured as South Koreans working at the
cobalt plant. It was not immediately possible to confirm this.
	   Bus conductor Herbert Mugisha, whose partially burned bus
arrived in Kampala Saturday, said the rebels threw gasoline on the
vehicles and the Kagesera and Moonlight Hotels where workers from
the cobalt plant were staying.
	   ``They first burned things before shooting, and when the army
came to defend the town, an exchanged ensued, but they (the rebels)
retreated towards the mountains,'' said Mugisha. ``We were so
frightened.''
	   ``The rebels attacked at night, and we scattered in all
directions. The people in the hotels were trapped. We do not know
the number who died,'' said Deo Tibasiima, who also managed to
escape from Kasese and arrived in Kampala Saturday.
	   The Alliance of Democratic Forces is made up of remnants of the
former Ugandan army which was defeated by President Yoweri
Museveni's guerrilla forces in 1986. Analysts say its members come
from several tribes, but it is dominated by members of a Muslim
fundamentalist group known as Tabliq.
	   There have been reports that some members of the army of the
former Zaire (now Congo) and the former Rwandan Hutu army have
joined the ADF, which has bases at the foot of the Rwenzori and
also inside Congo.
	   It is not known whether the ADF has a formal ideology, other
than wanting to destabilize Museveni's government. They are
believed to receive arms and supplies from the Islamic Front
government in neighboring Sudan.
	   Until the Kasese attack, the rebels hit isolated civilian
targets in rural areas. Two months ago they set fire to a technical
training school outside Fort Portal, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north
of Kasese, killing at least 80 students and carrying off about 100
others.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad newspapers on Sunday marked the
eighth anniversary of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by accusing the
oil-rich emirate of colluding with Western powers to maintain
strict trade sanctions against Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was
due in Baghdad with a team of experts to discuss Iraq's disarmament
efforts.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it needs to do to comply with U.N.
resolutions calling for the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that trade sanctions imposed
to punish Iraq for its Aug. 2, 1990, invasion, which set off the
1991 Gulf War, cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify the
weapons have been eliminated.
	   Butler, due in Baghdad at mid-afternoon, was accompanied by 13
specialists, including Nikita Smidovich, the chief U.N. missile
investigator, and Scott Ritter, an American who has angered the
Baghdad regime with unannounced inspections.
	   Butler's deputy, Charles Duelfer, told The Associated Press in
Bahrain shortly before the team flew to Baghdad that talks with
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, and others on ``a wide
range of issues'' would begin Monday.
	   Duelfer denied Iraqi allegations last week that one of the U.N.
inspectors was caught spying. Iraqi newspapers reported that the
inspector, Jason Gilbert, took pictures of a passing train and was
ordered by his Iraqi minders to destroy the film.

<TEXT>
	   PREK HO, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's National Election Committee
on Sunday feted observers and other participants in last week's
polls, but made no progress in delivering a final vote tally or
resolving complaints about election fraud.
	   The country's currency, however, continued strengthening in an
apparent indicator of public confidence that the country is heading
towards political stability after last Sunday's general election.
	   Shopkeepers on Sunday morning were quoting an exchange rate of
3,100 riels to the U.S. dollar compared to a short-term low of
about 4,300 just before the election.
	   A cultural show was held at the home just outside the capital of
committee chairman Chheng Phon ``to thank the foreign and national
observers who have contributed so much to the success of the
Cambodian elections.''
	   Representatives from the United Nations, the European Union, and
foreign diplomats _ whose countries provided over dlrs 34 million
in assistance for the elections _ joined international observers in
the morning's ceremony of thanks.
	   Most of the groups representing 700 international election
observers certified the polls as free and fair enough to be
considered legitimate even though no final results have yet been
issued.
	   ``I have the feeling and hope that a new chapter was opened in
the book of Cambodia's long history,'' said Sven Linder, the chief
observer for the European Union, which donated over dlrs 11.5
million.
	   The elections were held one year after Cambodian leader Hun Sen
ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent
coup, shattering a tense dual premiership formed after
U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party is the main opposition grouping.
	   ``A year ago we weren't sure we would make it to elections, let
alone free and fair elections,'' said Gordon Longmuir, Canada's
ambassador, adding that he was ``proud'' his country had been able
to participate in the process.
	   The National Election Committee on Saturday released preliminary
official results for just seven of 23 constituencies but said that
the final tally would be delayed because the figures from various
communes and provinces were being rechecked.
	   There are 122 parliamentary seats at stake, and from unofficial
projections it appears that Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's
Party will win a majority of them.
	   The opposition parties, who have alleged election fraud, have
asked for a recount in areas where they suspect irregularities.
	   A statement from an independent Cambodian poll watching body,
the Neutral and Impartial Committee for Free Elections in Cambodia
listed several otherwise unpublicized incidents of manipulation and
fraud.
	   The group, affiliated with the human rights organization
Licadho, noted three violent election day incidents in the central
province of Kampong Cham, one the most heavily contested areas.
	   In two districts, the group said in a statement issued Saturday,
it appeared that people firing shots in the air discouraged others
from voting, and in a third district a woman was shot dead early in
the day.
	   ``Initial reports indicate that voters were severely
intimidated'' by the shooting, it said.
	   The group reported its observers had witnessed at least one case
of fraud in the southern province of Kampot, where the chief of one
polling station was seen inserting ballots into the ballot box
after voting had closed.
	   In a counting station in Kampot, an official misread ballots in
favor of one party although the ballots were marked for another
party, it said.
	   Benny Widyono, an observer representing Indonesia, said that the
international community had done its job by ensuring that the polls
were violence-free and that Cambodia would have to iron out
problems that have since surfaced.
	   ``We cannot micro-manage the problems of every country,'' said
Widyono, formerly the U.N. Secretary General's Representative in
Cambodia.
	   Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen meanwhile responded to another concern
Saturday, calling on his security forces not to terrorize members
of the opposition in acts of political revenge.
	   Scores of scared activists from FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy
Party have fled to Phnom Penh from the countryside, seeking refuge
at their parties' headquarters.

Police launch manhunt for attackers who killed police commander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police have launched a manhunt in
northern Tanzania for a group of Somali cattle raiders disguised as
Maasai warriors who killed a district police commander near
Loliondo, 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the Kenyan border, the
Sunday News said Sunday.
	   The government-owned newspaper quoted Arusha regional
commissioner Daniel ole Njoolay saying 30 soldiers and the Arusha
army commander were searching the area for half a dozen Somali
raiders.
	   But he denied earlier reports that policemen had been captured
by the raiders, saying they had returned safely to their base.
	   He said Ngorongoro district commander Venance Kong'oa was shot
by raiders when he began coughing after he and his men had
encircled a hut in an attempt to capture the men who have been
terrorizing villages in the area.
	   Earlier news reports quoted residents in the area, which is
north of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and is inhabited by
nomadic Maasai, saying the Somalis, who had been in the area for
some time and had crossed over from Kenya, had disguised themselves
as Maasai with the characteristic red cloth cloaks known as
``shuga.''
	   President Banjamin Mkapa recently visited the Loliondo area _
which lies between major game reserves and tourists sites in Kenya
and Tanzania _ and promised residents a massive operation would be
launched to capture the raiders who were terrorizing villages.
	   Mkapa was quoted as saying the operation would also involve
Kenya to end the harrassment.

	   CHINARI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani farmer Syed Mushtaq Hussain
waited until darkness provided some cover from Indian gunners
across the border, then he picked his way along the narrow mountain
paths to safety.
	   Hussain said Sunday he had to retrace the rugged route from this
town _ roads are closed because they are easy targets for the
Indians. His mother and cousin, both hit by shell fragments the day
before, were waiting for him in his village on the Kashmiri front
line.
	   ``We cannot bring them here because there is no transport,''
said Hussain, his words rushed with fear. ``I've just come to get
medicine and bandages.''
	   Villagers on both sides of Kashmir have borne the brunt of days
of military gunfire that India and Pakistan accuse each other of
starting. Pakistani military sources, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said five more villagers were killed by
Indian shells or bullets Saturday, bringing the civilian total in
four days to 48.
	   Indian army officials counter that 29 Indians, most of them
civilians, were killed by Pakistani forces.
	   Explosions were heard late into Saturday night, but the fighting
appeared to have subsided by Sunday morning.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the
Himalayan territory now divided between them, since each gained
independence from colonial Britain in 1947. Spurts of artillery and
mortar fire are common across the region that both India and
Pakistan claim in its entirety, although the exchanges that erupted
the middle of last week were unusually heavy.
	   ``The Indians are bombing the civilians. They're not targeting
the army positions,'' farmer Hussain said.
	   Many villages lie in a no-man's land between Indian and
Pakistani artillery. Pakistani officials also charge that India is
trying to terrorize villagers so they won't shelter and feed Muslim
militants who sneak across the border to join a separatist uprising
in Indian-held Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority province in
predominately Hindu India.
	   India accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of arming and training
the militants, but Pakistani officials say they provide only moral
support. Muslim militants were accused of killing four Hindus
Friday in a remote, mountainous area of Indian-held Kashmir. In two
incidents earlier last week, gunmen stormed into houses in the
region and sprayed the occupants with bullets, killing a total of
16 Hindus and wounding five others.
	   The attacks on Hindu villages may have prompted the firing,
though Pakistani officials claim the shelling was aimed at
undermining peace talks their prime minister had with his Indian
counterpart last week. The talks, seen as particularly urgent
because both India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in May, were
declared a failure on Friday.
	   Whatever the cause, the effect of the latest outbreak of gunfire
in places like Chinari has been devastating. On Sunday, displaced
families overwhelmed Chinari, just a few kilometers (miles) from
villages worst-hit by Indian shells and 50 kilometers from
Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani-held Kashmir.
	   Salima, who uses one name only, said her house was destroyed and
her family's cattle killed in the bombardment, and her 6-year-old
daughter was hit in the shoulder by a bullet. Her daughter was
being treated in Chinari's small hospital, while the rest of the
family sheltered in a school.
	   Some Chinari residents opened their brick or mud homes to
strangers or collected money to buy food for them. Some survivors
had fled with nothing, saying entire villages were set ablaze by
Indian shells.

Magnitude 6.0 earthquake strikes China's far west
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake struck western China just
after noon on Sunday, but there were no immediate reports of damage
or injuries.
	   The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0, hit at 12:40 p.m.
Beijing time (0440 GMT), the China Seismological Bureau said.
	   Its epicenter was located near the city of Kashgar in the far
western Xinjiang region, a vast, thinly populated area 3,500
kilometers (2,170 miles) from Beijing.
	   Investigators are traveling to the area to study the quake's
effects, the bureau said.
	   It said information on possible casualties and damage are still
unavailable.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
Albanian homes west of Pristina on Sunday in what appeared to be a
campaign to drive ethnic Albanian civilians from part of Kosovo
which had been under rebel control.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said a Yugoslav army unit came under
attack Sunday by the Kosovo Liberation Army in the Djakovica area
southwest of here. Serb sources also said Police were fired on
along the highway between Pristina and Pec, which government troops
secured last week.
	   The new fighting raged despite promises last week by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that his latest offensive against the
KLA was over. The offensive delivered a strong blow against
independence-seeking Albanian rebels and drove tens of thousands of
civilians from their homes.
	   The rebels are expected to announce this week whether they will
endorse a U.S.-plan for peace talks between Milosevic and Albanian
politicians led by Ibrahim Rugova, whom the KLA had rejected
because of his non-violent stand.
	   Despite Milosevic's promise that the offensive was over, mortar
fire could be heard Sunday near this village where the KLA
maintains its headquarters. The explosions grew ever louder,
indicating the Serbs were on the march.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, convoys of panicked refugees fled
by foot, tractor or car along rocky dirt roads. There were headed
toward Likovac, where they hoped to find KLA protection.
	   Many said they had no where else to go. All told the same story
of Serb destruction, credible in its simplicity and consistency:
Serbs fired indiscriminately at the villages; terrified civiliand
gathered family members together and fled for their lives, leaving
behind all their possessions.
	   Serb troops them moved into the villages, looted anything of
value they could find, doused the homes with gasoline and set them
afire.
	   ``My house was burned today,'' Sanje Berisha, 33, sobbed as she
and about 100 others sheltered in a courtyard of a house near
Likovac.
	   The tactics were reminiscent of the campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' or the forced removal of rival ethnic groups, which
marked brutal conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia _ which had been part
of Yugoslavia.
	   At Likovac, a dusty, hilltop cluster of a dozen buildings around
a rockey open square, a KLA commander boasted that ``we have not
been defeated'' and that ``Serb attacks only make us stronger.''
	   But other KLA members, who refused to give their names for fear
of punishment by their commanders, admitted that they have been
unable to blunt the Serb advance and protect Albanian villages.
	   ``We are underarmed and we cannot defend them,'' one rebel said
of the dozen villages in the area which have come under Serb attack
since Milosevic declared the offensive over.
	   Despite reports last month that the rebels were receiving heavy
weapons, none were in sight. KLA fighters were carrying mostly
rifles and machine guns _ ineffective against government tanks,
armored personnel carriers, mortars and artillery.
	   Although Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million Kosovo
population, the province is part of Serbia, which along with
Montenegro forms Yugoslavia. Milosevic has promised to restore
autonomy which he withdrew in 1989.
	   But he and the major powers oppose independence, as demanded by
the KLA and most Kosovo Albanian leaders, fearing it would spread
the ethnic conflict to other Balkan countries with large Albanian
communities.

Banned newspaper keeps publishing under new name
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A pro-democracy newspaper that authorities
have twice tried to close was published under a new name Sunday,
defying powerful hard-liners opposed to reformist President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   The paper's editor, Mahmoud Shams, said it was published under
the name ``Aftab'e Emrooz,'' or ``The Sun Today.'' Appearing on the
front page, he said, was an account of an attack on the newspaper's
offices by thugs believed tied to ultraconservative politicians.
	   Shams told The Associated Press that the paper echoed the
newspaper Tous, which was ordered closed by the hard-line judiciary
Saturday. Tous began publication without missing an issue when its
predecessor, Jameah, was ordered shut July 25.
	   The papers gained popularity, especially among the young, for
frank criticism and analyses of Iranian politics. But they angered
the ultraconservatives who were the focus of the criticisms.
	   The pro-democracy newspaper's defiance placed it at the center
of a power struggle between the deeply unpopular hard-liners and
the popular Khatami.
	   The power to close down the paper rests with the judiciary. But
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, run by a Khatami
loyalist, issues permits for newspapers.
	   Hours after Tous was ordered closed, culture ministry officials
urged judicial authorities to allow it to keep publishing, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Shortly before the ban on Tous was served Saturday, militants
believed allied to the hard-liners assaulted the paper's editor and
threatened to kill him. They also beat two Associated Press
reporters who arrived on the scene.
	   ``The attack both on me and the AP reporters has raised the
price of seeking freedom in this country,'' Shams said Saturday.
	   ``What is dangerous is that the fate of Mr. Khatami's government
will be determined in the streets, where militants are taking the
law into their own hands,'' he added.
	   Shams said Sunday that the paper had secured life and health
insurance for all its employees after the attack, saying he felt
``there is a threat against our lives.''
	   The daily Tehran Times said in an editorial Sunday that an
investigation should be conducted immediately into who carried out
Saturday's attack on the newspaper.
	   ``The law should not be allowed to be taken into hands by those
who want to impose their own will by force,'' the English-language
paper said.
	   The Justice Department justified its banning of Tous by citing
``several articles of the press law,'' IRNA said. It gave no
details.
	   Hard-liners were angered because the newspaper questioned the
authority of Iran's spiritual guide, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, asking
how an unelected person could wield more power than the president,
who won more than 20 million votes in last year's elections.

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army Sunday put the death toll at
eight in a rebel attack on the western town of Kasese, but
government and private newspapers said it was as high as 17.
	   In a statement read Sunday morning on Radio Uganda, western
region commander Brig. James Kazini said eight people, including
two soldiers, were killed in the attack early Saturday by rebels
from the Alliance of Democratic Forces, who also burned two hotels
and 20 vehicles.
	   ``The bandits burned down the hotels and vehicles as they
retreated in the mountains. They had infiltrated from the mountains
with the aim of looting food, drugs and other essential items,''
the statement said.
	   Kazini added that the situation in the mining town 380
kilometers (235 miles) west of Kampala in the foothills of the
Rwenzori mountains was under control.
	   But the government-owned New Vision, Uganda's largest newspaper,
put the death toll at 16, including a private and a sergeant in the
Ugandan army and two policemen.
	   The newspaper said the rebels hit the town from three sides,
attacking the officers' mess at the local army barracks, the
airstrip and the town center.
	   The private Monitor newspaper said 17 people, including three
soldiers, two policemen, two rebels and 10 civilians, were killed
in the first attack ADF rebels have launched on an urban target.
	   The newspaper, quoting an army officer identified as Lt. Col.
Rwangombe, said five others, including four Filipinos working at
the nearby Kasese Cobalt Co. Ltd. processing plant who were staying
in one of the hotels, were rushed to hospital with serious burns.
	   The private Radio Simba said 11 Filipinos had been hospitalized.
	   On Saturday, travellers arriving in Kampala from Kasese
identified several of the injured as South Koreans working at the
cobalt plant. It was not immediately possible to confirm this.
	   Bus conductor Herbert Mugisha, whose partially burned bus
arrived in Kampala Saturday, said the rebels threw gasoline on the
vehicles and the Kagesera and Moonlight Hotels where workers from
the cobalt plant were staying.
	   ``They first burned things before shooting, and when the army
came to defend the town, an exchanged ensued, but they (the rebels)
retreated towards the mountains,'' said Mugisha. ``We were so
frightened.''
	   ``The rebels attacked at night, and we scattered in all
directions. The people in the hotels were trapped. We do not know
the number who died,'' said Deo Tibasiima, who also managed to
escape from Kasese and arrived in Kampala Saturday.
	   The Alliance of Democratic Forces is made up of remnants of the
former Ugandan army which was defeated by President Yoweri
Museveni's guerrilla forces in 1986. Analysts say its members come
from several tribes, but it is dominated by members of a Muslim
fundamentalist group known as Tabliq.
	   There have been reports that some members of the army of the
former Zaire (now Congo) and the former Rwandan Hutu army have
joined the ADF, which has bases at the foot of the Rwenzori and
also inside Congo.
	   It is not known whether the ADF has a formal ideology, other
than wanting to destabilize Museveni's government. They are
believed to receive arms and supplies from the Islamic Front
government in neighboring Sudan.
	   Until the Kasese attack, the rebels hit isolated civilian
targets in rural areas. Two months ago they set fire to a technical
training school outside Fort Portal, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north
of Kasese, killing at least 80 students and carrying off about 100
others.

Death toll from floods rises to 34; at least 70 still missing

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The death toll from flash floods rose
to 34 on Sunday as rescuers resumed searching rugged mountain
valleys where hundreds of sleeping campers were swept away by
swollen streams.
	   But heavy rains and raging currents hampered the search for 70
people missing in the Chiri Mountains, a popular hiking and camping
site 220 kilometers (135 miles) south of Seoul, disaster relief
officials said.
	   Rescue officer Lee Jong-kun, 46, died in a hospital and another
rescuer remained in critical condition after jumping into the water
to save a man trapped in a car swept by flood water.
	   The bodies of two small children were pulled up early Sunday by
police and soldiers searching downstream with flood lights.
	   Disaster officials feared the casualty figures could rise as
families reported more missing people.
	   ``Because the streams are so rapid and studded with razor-sharp
rocks, we believe nearly all those missing are dead,'' said a
disaster official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Family members gathered at makeshift relief centers in mountain
valleys awaiting word on their missing relatives. The hopes of many
seemed to fall as torrential rains poured down again Sunday morning
in the thickly wooded mountains.
	   ``The flood overwhelmed our tent in the twinkling of an eye. I
held on to a tree branch. But my two boys, I could not find them.
What should I do? How can I find them?'' a father, identified only
by his surname Kim, told MBC-TV in a quavering voice.
	   A rain front moving east from China dumped up to 30 centimeters
(12 inches) of rain early Saturday in southern Korea. Lighter rain
continued in the region throughout Saturday and into Sunday.
	   The hardest hit was the Chiri mountains, where a record 14
centimeters (5.6 inches) of rain poured down in less than one hour.
Campers compared the experience to ``the heaven dumping rain with
buckets.''
	   Weather forecasters had failed to predict the heavy rain, and
the sudden rise in the gushing streams caught unawares hundreds of
vacationers camping along the scenic gorges.
	   ``The weather forecasters said the monsoon was over and we went
on vacation. Only if they warned us of the rain one hour earlier,''
Choi Jong-il, 39, told the national news agency Yonhap. He lost his
wife and two children to the floods.
	   Hundreds remained stranded. Rescuers used helicopters and ropes
to guide the marooned campers across raging streams to safety.
	   The downpours also submerged homes and farmland, washed away
roads and triggered landslides. Disaster officials estimated
tentative property damage dlrs 12 million.
	   TV footage showed large stretches of rice fields underwater and
crumpled cars swept away in flood water.
	   Police said a number of people were killed in nearby villages.
	   A family of four were crushed to death when their home collapsed
under a landslide Saturday.
	   Also Sunday, a dead North Korean civilian was found floating off
the South Korean east coast. The military suspected the man was
drowned and floated to the south.
	   After working overnight to clear a landslide that covered a
large section of rail, authorities restored normal train service in
the southwestern Cholla province early Sunday.
	   Two airports closed Saturday because of the rains resumed
operations. But coastal ferry routes halted operations because of
storm and high-wave warnings, stranding thousands of summer
vacationers.

Kosovo fighting continues despite pledges, flood of refugees grows

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with attacks continuing despite Milosevic
pledge; refugees tell of homes burning; KLA fighters admit they
cannt stop the onslaught &QL;

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
ethnic Albanian homes west of Pristina on Sunday in what appeared
to be a campaign to drive ethnic Albanian civilians from part of
Kosovo that had been under rebel control.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said ethnic Albanian separatists in the
Djakovica area attacked a Yugoslav army unit Sunday. Serb sources
also said police were fired on along the highway between Pristina
and Pec, which government troops secured last week.
	   The new fighting raged despite promises last week by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that his latest offensive against the
Kosovo Liberation Army was over. The offensive delivered a strong
blow to independence-seeking Albanian rebels and drove tens of
thousands of civilians from their homes.
	   The rebels are expected to announce this week whether they will
endorse a U.S.-plan for peace talks between Milosevic and Albanian
politicians led by Ibrahim Rugova, whom the KLA had rejected
because of his nonviolent stand.
	   Many ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, the stronger of two republics that form Yugoslavia. But
Serbs consider the province the cradle of their culture, and
Western powers prefer to see it remain part of Serbia, as border
changes in the Balkans often lead to further bloodshed.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants
of Kosovo.
	   Mortar fire could be heard Sunday near the village of Likovac,
where the KLA maintains its headquarters. The explosions grew
louder, indicating the Serbs were on the march.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, convoys of panicked refugees fled
by foot, tractor or car along rocky dirt roads. They were headed
toward Likovac, where they hoped to find KLA protection.
	   Many said they had nowhere else to go. All told the same story
of Serb destruction: Serbs fired indiscriminately at the villages;
terrified civilians gathered family members and fled for their
lives, leaving behind all their possessions.
	   Serb troops then moved into the villages, looting everything of
value, dousing the homes with gasoline and setting them on fire.
	   ``My house was burned today,'' Sanje Berisha, 33, sobbed as she
and about 100 others took refuge in a courtyard of a house near
Likovac.
	   The tactics were reminiscent of the campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' or the forced removal of rival ethnic groups, that
marked brutal conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia, which had been part
of Yugoslavia.
	   At Likovac, a dusty, hilltop cluster of a dozen buildings around
a rocky, open square, a KLA commander boasted that ``we have not
been defeated'' and that ``Serb attacks only make us stronger.''
	   But other KLA members, who refused to give their names for fear
of punishment by their commanders, admitted that they have been
unable to blunt the Serb advance and protect Albanian villages.
	   ``We are underarmed and we cannot defend them,'' one rebel said
of the dozen villages in the area that have come under Serb attack
since Milosevic declared the offensive over.
	   Despite reports last month that the rebels were receiving heavy
weapons, none were in sight. KLA fighters were carrying mostly
rifles and machine guns _ ineffective against government tanks,
armored personnel carriers, mortars and artillery.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Government forces shelled and burned
ethnic Albanian homes west of Pristina on Sunday in what appeared

Kosovo that had been under rebel control. Elsewhere, Serb sources
said ethnic Albanian separatists in the Djakovica area attacked a

	   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran said Sunday that the medium-range missile it
tested last month was guided by an Iranian-made system that gives
it great accuracy. The Shahab-3 missile is 16 meters (53 feet) long
and can travel at a speed of 7,000 kilometers (more than 4,300
miles) per hour, said Gen. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, head of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' air wing. ``It is a ballistic
missile and can carry a one ton warhead at a cruising altitude of
250 kilometers (155 miles) above sea level,'' said Qalibaf. It was
the first time Iran had given such details about the Shahab-3. On
July 25, an Iranian official confirmed that the country had
successfully tested a medium-range missile with a range of 1,300
kilometers (800 miles). (Iran-Missile)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad newspapers on Sunday marked the
eighth anniversary of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by accusing the
oil-rich emirate of colluding with Western powers to maintain
strict trade sanctions against Iraq. Meanwhile, the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was due in Baghdad with a team
of experts to discuss Iraq's disarmament efforts. During his
previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a ``blueprint'' of what it
needs to do to comply with U.N. resolutions calling for the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction. The U.N. Security
Council has said that trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for
its Aug. 2, 1990, invasion, which set off the 1991 Gulf War, cannot
be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify the weapons have been
eliminated. (Iraq)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban officials discussed what they
don't like about the international aid groups they expelled from
the Afghan capital last month, but a disappointed U.N. negotiator
said Sunday he was unable to make progress in resolving the
dispute. ``We unfortunately were not given too much of an option to
discuss alternatives for the (aid groups') eventual return,'' said
Bronek Szynalski, acting coordinator of U.N. humanitarian projects
in Afghanistan. He spoke a day after some four hours of meetings
with representatives of the Taliban religious regime that controls
most of Afghanistan. ``It was very disappointing for us,'' he said.
``We really have a very short time because the winter is coming.
People here depend on international assistance.'' (Afghanistan-UN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's ruling Likud party accused opposition
leaders on Sunday of trying to generate American pressure against
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his conduct of negotiations
with the Palestinians. A Labor Party delegation headed by party
leader Ehud Barak was headed to the United States for talks in
Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, and members of the U.S.
Congress. The delegation may also meet U.S. President Bill Clinton.
Uzi Landau, a senior Likud lawmaker, said the Labor leaders were
trying to persuade the Americans to pressure Netanyahu to make
concessions at a critical stage of negotiations with the
Palestinians. (Israel-US)

Sakhalin prepares for power outage as miners continue blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Energy officials on the Pacific island of Sakhalin
prepared Sunday for an electricity blackout as coal miners refused
to lift a blockade of the island's main power station, a news
agency reported.
	   Power will be cut to all consumers and all but the most critical
life support systems, such as hospitals and the water system, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   For nine days the miners have blocked roads and rail lines
leading to the station, preventing coal deliveries needed to keep
it running. The miners have vowed not to lift the blockade until
they are paid eight months of overdue wages.
	   The strike is one of many periodic miners protests that have
taken place across Russia since May to demand overdue wages.
However, the protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not
inflicted significant damage on the economy.
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant's operation for
electricity.
	   Most of Russia's coal mines have been losing money for years,
and the government has been trying to shut them down. Many coal
companies have been nominally privatized, but still depend on
significant government subsidies in order to pay their workers.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
Albanian homes west of Pristina on Sunday in what appeared to be a
campaign to drive ethnic Albanian civilians from part of Kosovo
which had been under rebel control.
	   Serb sources confirmed clashes in the area but blamed the Kosovo
Liberation Army for starting it by shooting at police checkpoints
along the road between Pristina and Pec, which government forces
cleared last week.
	   Elsewhere, both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting
Sunday in the Djakovica area southeast of the provincial capital
Pristina. Again, each side the other started it.
	   Albanian sources also reported fierce shelling near Junik and
other rebel-controlled villages in southwest Kosovo near the
Albanian border. The report could not be confirmed.

French yacht embarks on attempt at fastest Pacific crossing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) _ A twin-hull yacht skippered by French
adventurer Bruno Peyron set sail from Japan bound for San Francisco
on Sunday in an attempt to break the world record for crossing the
Pacific.
	   The 26-meter (86-foot) catamaran ``Explorer'' with its crew of
seven, including American James V. Novak from Chicago, is trying to
reach San Francisco in 12-14 days, said Hiroshi Katada, an official
of Ocean Dream Inc. of Japan, which is helping with the project.
	   American adventurer Steve Fossett set the current record for a
Pacific crossing in an 18-meter (59-foot) yacht in August 1995 when
he made the voyage from Yokohama port to San Francisco in 16 days.
	   Peyron carried a letter from Yokohama mayor Hidenobu Takahide
addressed to the mayor of San Francisco, said Katada.
	   ``Everything depends on winds, but we will try to hand the
letter to San Francisco's mayor as quickly as possible,'' Katada
quoted Peyron as saying at Kanazawa Bayside Marine in Yokohama.
	   Yokohama is a major port city 29 kilometers (18 miles) south of
Tokyo.
	   The other five crew members are Frenchman Nicolas Pichelin,
Australian Paul Larsen, Italian Elena Caputo, Japanese Tooru
Kikuchi and Japanese Kojiro Shiraishi, Katada said.

Gonzalez to defend Basque ``dirty war'' convicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has
joined the defense team of two of his former government officials
convicted of ``dirty war'' activities against Basque separatists, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Gonzalez, a lawyer, registered with the Madrid Bar Association
on Friday so he can assist the defense team when it appeals the
convictions before the Constitutional Court later this month, El
Pais said, quoting people close to Gonzalez.
	   The Supreme Court last week handed down 10-year jail terms
against former Interior Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo and his
former aide Rafael Vera for the 1983 kidnapping of a businessman
who was mistaken for a Basque separatist hitman and held for 10
days.
	   Ten other former officials who had pleaded guilty got lesser
sentences.
	   The kidnapping was the first action attributed to the so-called
Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, death squads that killed 27
people between 1983 and 1987 in a drive against members and
sympathizers of the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
	   Many of the victims turned out to be mistaken targets.
	   Gonzalez, a Socialist who ruled from 1982 to 1996, has long
denied allegations that his government created the death squads. An
investigating magistrate for the Supreme Court concluded in 1996
that there was insufficient evidence to try Gonzalez himself in the
kidnapping case.
	   El Pais said Gonzalez decided to join the Barrionuevo and Vera
defense team as soon as the guilty verdicts were handed down last
Wednesday but it took three days for him to gather the necessary
papers.
	   He was already a member of the Madrid bar but not an active one
with the right to argue cases in court, it said.
	   In his first public reaction to the sentences, Gonzalez said
Friday that the Supreme Court had come under political pressure
from the current conservative government of Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar and that the convictions were ``radically unjust.''
	   He also said: ``I will defend Barrionuevo and Vera until the
end.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli soldier whose patrol was ambushed by
Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon last week was saved from
serious injury by his cigarette lighter, his mother said Monday.
	   A smiling Marcus Zanona, 20, showed reporters the lighter with a
bullet hole in it. ``It was in my pocket, and I think it saved my
leg,'' he said.
	   The bullet penetrated Zanona's leg, but the lighter absorbed
much of its force, his mother Yvonne told The Associated Press.
	   The soldier is recovering at a hospital in northern Israel.

Diplomats press Eritrea-Ethiopia mediation efforts

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso _ Feuding neighbors Ethiopia and
Eritrea began a second day of separate discussions with African
mediators Sunday after refusing to compromise in their border
standoff on the first day of meetings.
	   Although the foreign ministers of both East African countries
shared a plane Saturday to the meetings in Burkina Faso's capital
of Ouagadougou, they are refusing to meet face-to-face to end the
dispute, which sparked fighting that took several hundred lives in
May and June.
	   Talks hosts Burkina Faso, however, continued to express optimism
about the chances for a border agreement.
	   Burkina Faso's Foreign Affairs Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo told
reporters after emerging from a meeting Sunday morning with his
Ethiopian counterpart Haile Woldetensae that the ``atmosphere is
improving ... much more positive.''
	   The Ethiopian minister declined comment.
	   The so-called Contact Group of African diplomats led by
Organization of African Unity secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim
meanwhile met amongst themselves to modify a set of proposals given
to the feuding parties a day earlier.
	   Both Eritrea's Foreign Affairs Minister Seyoum Mesfin and his
Ethiopian counterpart were expected to meet separately later Sunday
with Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore in his capacity as
chairman of the OAU.
	   The talks seemed to hinge on the unwillingness of Ethiopia to
meet their foes face-to-face unless Eritrea withdraws troops from
disputed territory. The Eritreans have refused the demand and
called for direct talks and an immediate cease fire to formalize
the end of hostilities.
	   Fighting which flared in early May has subsided since mid-June,
following a U.S.-brokered deal to stop deadly air raids. Several
hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before the fighting
abated.
	   Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge and his Djibouti
counterpart, Mohammed Musa Sheahim, were also mediating in Sunday's
discussions after their countries hashed out the proposals
presented to the feuding neighbors.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of two districts on the
western end of the 960-kilometer (600-mile) border between the East
African countries in early May that precipitated the crisis and
subsequent fighting.
	   Both countries have amassed troops along their border and the
situation is at a stalemate.
	   Eritrea has accused Ethiopia of trying to maneuver the
international community into pressuring Eritrea to withdraw from
land Eritrea regards as its own. The two countries were one until
Eritrea gained independence in 1993.
	   As many as 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting,
according to one U.N. estimate.

South Africa set to recognize Iraq and North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa will establish
diplomatic relations with Iraq and North Korea within weeks, an
official said Sunday.
	   The decision to forge ties with the two countries was linked to
the Non-Aligned Movement summit scheduled in the coastal city of
Durban later this month, Foreign Affairs spokesman Marco Boni said.
	   ``But it's also a question of normalizing our relations across
the world,'' Boni said. ``Establishing relations between states
does not automatically signal a green light'' for current
government policies.
	   An additional motivation for recognizing Iraq was an outstanding
1 billion rand (dlrs 164 million) debt for weapons sold by South
Africa's government arms industry during apartheid, Johannesburg's
Sunday Independent reported.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will only be
lifted after U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of
banned weapons.
	   ``We are not the only country in the world to have relations
with these two states,'' Boni said.
	   In diplomatic documents to be signed at the United Nations over
the next weeks, South Africa will also recognize Gambia, Bhutan and
the South Pacific island of Vanuatu.
	   Since 1994's first all-race elections, Mandela's government has
recognized many countries that aided the anti-apartheid struggle,
including China earlier this year.

M.C. Beaton, aka Marian Chesney, keeps two fictional detectives

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marian Chesney had returned from vacation in
remote northern Scotland, where the wind screamed across the
landscape, and she mentioned the trip to a book editor during a
walk in Manhattan. It would be a good setting, she remarked, for a
murder mystery.
	   ``Who would your detective be?'' the editor asked.
	   ``The village policeman,'' popped out of the writer's mouth.
	   ``What's his name?''
	   ``Hamish Macbeth.''
	   Thus, Hamish Macbeth, laid-back constable of tiny, fictional
Lochdubh, Scotland, was born in an instant on Fifth Avenue in New
York in 1983.
	   A Scottish name for the author, too, would be nice, suggested
her editor. So, M.C. Beaton was created, the initials Marian
Chesney's own and the surname drawn from a line in a Scottish
ballad, ``The queen she had four Marys, Mary Seton, Mary Beaton,
Mary Carmichael and me.''
	   Scottish-born Beaton based Macbeth's personality on a part-time
worker at her first job, in a Glasgow book store. ``He was a
divinity student called Donald McKenzie, 6 feet (1.8-meter) tall
and very gangly, his bony wrists sticking out of his sleeves. He
had absolutely no airs or pretensions. This is the charm of the
Highlands people. They think they're equal to everyone. It's not an
arrogance. They treat everyone the same. It stuck in my mind as an
amiable characteristic.''
	   Now, Beaton produces one Macbeth mystery a year; her 14th,
released in June, is ``Death of a Scriptwriter.''
	   A second series of her detective novels follows the exploits of
Agatha Raisin, whom the 55-year-old Beaton describes as ``a pushy
middle-aged woman. Guess who that's based on.''
	   Raisin acts out some of her creator's impulses. Recently, when
Beaton parked just over the line on a day ``bucketing with rain,''
she says, a woman berated her long and loud. Beaton, who wasn't
blocking traffic or other cars' parking, politely said nothing but
thought plenty. In a book, Raisin would have said it all, ending
with, ``Sod off.''
	   In addition to her annual Macbeth book for Mysterious Press,
Beaton produces two Agatha Raisins for St. Martin's Press. The
latest is ``Agatha Raisin and the Wellspring of Death,'' the
seventh in that series.
	   Both new books were reviewed favorably by The New York Times.
Mysterious Press is about to bring all the Hamish Macbeth mysteries
back into print.
	   Three books a year isn't difficult, Beaton says, because she was
trained as a journalist. ``You get used to crystalizing your ideas
very quickly and you do your own editing. In the old days, you had
to phone in stories and you had to be lucid.''
	   Beaton worked on newspapers and wrote Regency romances before
she starting writing mysteries. She worked for the London Daily
Express, and married a fellow journalist, Harry Gibbons, Middle
East correspondent for the Daily Mail. (Gibbons has written about
his brief stint as a British spy before his cover was blown by
George Blake, ``master spy, master traitor,'' as Beaton calls him.)
	   In the 1970s they brought their journalistic skills to America,
to a small paper on New York's Long Island.
	   A difficult time followed, as they tried and failed to find
newspaper jobs in Washington, D.C. They ended up taking jobs at
Steve's Diner. Gibbons worked an all-night, 12-hour shift. At 6
a.m., Beaton arrived, handed him their infant son and worked in the
diner for eight hours.
	   ``It wasn't pleasant at the time,'' Beaton says, ``but it's all
right. You're surviving. It takes the fear and snobbery away that
you're a journalist and you can't do anything else.''
	   After a short time on Rupert Murdoch's Star in Manhattan, they
left for an 18-acre (7-hectare) croft in Scotland, where Gibbons
raised sheep and Beaton got ideas for Hamish Macbeth stories. Then
it was back to London to place their son, Charlie, who had a
Brooklyn accent, in high school at Westminster.
	   Beaton tells the story of a charity bake sale at that school.
	   ``I wasn't going to let the side down and say I can't bake
anything,'' she recalls. ``I bought a quiche and put it in my own
wrappings and they sold it. It was a great success.''
	   It gave her the idea for the first Agatha Raisin adventure,
``Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death.''
	   ``In the book, Agatha buys a quiche, puts her own wrappings on
it and a judge drops dead of poisoning. The police come around,
asking `How did you cook this?' and she makes an awful fool of
herself. To save face, she has to prove who murdered the judge.''
	   The latest Agatha Raisin book also was inspired by real events.
``A bottled water company wanted to come every morning to get
spring water. The villagers didn't want lorries coming through the
village every morning. I thought, what would happen if you had a
parish council and half wanted that and half didn't and the
chairman was found dead.''
	   Beaton and her husband moved from London to an 1807 house in a
Cotswold village when Charlie's high school house master said their
son would surely go to Oxford, so why not move nearby? ``Our son
went to Cambridge, on the other side of the country,'' Beaton says.
``It's just as well _ instead of having doting parents around his
neck.''
	   An upcoming Agatha Raisin idea came in a beauty parlor visit.
``My hairdresser was very upset. A rival had poached all her staff
away. I began to get into the jealousies and feuds in hairdressing.
Women talk to their hairdresser as if they're talking to a
psychiatrist.
	   ``I thought: What a wonderful job for a blackmailer. I haven't
figured out how to bump somebody off with a beauty treatment. I'm
sure you could electrocute somebody. They won't tell me how.
	   ``For `Death of a Hussy,' for Hamish, my local garage mechanics
worked out how to get a car to burst into flames when you turned
the key in the ignition,'' she said. ``They were very helpful.''

Foreign minister says peace talks `waste of time'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday
accused Israel of impeding Middle East peace negotiations and
described the recent talks between Israelis and Palestinians as a
``waste of time.''
	   Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been a broker in Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
	   Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in
March 1997 after Israel began construction of a new Jewish
neighborhood in Arab east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want the Arab
sector, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war,
as the capital of their would-be state.
	   The two sides have been holding talks for the past two weeks on
a U.S. proposal to get the peace process back on track, but there
have been no signs of a breakthrough.
	   ``What is going on now is merely a matter of procrastination,
delay and waste of time without any signs of real progress,''
Moussa told reporters after presenting a report on the situation to
President Hosni Mubarak.
	   The two sides have been discussing a compromise proposed by the
United States that calls for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank territory it controls.
	   The Palestinian Authority has accepted the U.S. initiative, but
Israel says it jeopardizes its security.
	   Moussa told reporters Sunday there has been no progress in
getting Israeli approval of the American initiative.
	   ``The international community should not stand as a spectator to
the peace initiative as it collapses,'' Moussa said.
	   He added: ``The situation has entered a vicious circle without
any hope of progress now or, according to logic, in the future. ...
The elements and potentials of such progress are not clear under
the current Israeli policy.''
	   After meeting with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in
Cairo on Saturday, Moussa said Israel was not taking the talks
seriously.
	   ``It is obvious that they (the Israelis) are wasting time and
the ... result (of recent negotiations) is in actuality zero,'' he
said.
	   He said the Palestinians believe the Israelis ``were not
speaking with any seriousness and did not put forth any new
suggestions.''

Faction leaders accuse Ethiopia of interferring in Somali affairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ The main faction leaders in the
war-torn Somali capital on Sunday accused Ethiopia of meddling in
Somali affairs by trying to undermine a peace agreement brokered
last December by Egypt.
	   Ethiopia and Egypt are traditional rivals for influence in
Somalia. Both Addis Ababa and Cairo seek to have Somali governments
favorable to them in power.
	   Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the principal warlord in north Mogadishu,
Sunday accused Addis Ababa of being responsible for the continued
delays in attempts to create an inclusive adminstration for
Mogadishu _ one of the pre-conditions for national reconciliation.
	   The accusation came after Ethiopia invited Hussein Hajii Bod,
who has emerged as a serious rival to Ali Mahdi in north Mogadishu,
to a meeting in the Ethiopian capital with several other Somali
faction leaders from the south, the center and the northeast.
	   Also on Sunday, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, the main warlord in south
Mogadishu, accused Ethiopia of being behind the announcement of an
autonomous regional administration in northeastern Somalia to be
known as Puntland.
	   Aidid, who was marking the second anniversary of the death of
his father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, also blamed Ethiopia for
backing the creation in 1991 of the breakaway republic of
Somaliland in the northwest of the country.
	   Gen. Mohamed Abshir Musa, whose Somali Salvation Democratic
Front is the main faction in the northeast, accuses Ethiopia of
helping Col. Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed to hijack the meeting in the
north central town of Garoe where the Puntland administration was
proclaimed.
	   After a month in Cairo late last year, 24 faction leaders,
including Ali Mahdi and Aidid, agreed to form a transition
government and to hold a national reconciliation conference, which
has now been postponed three times.
	   A meeting of 26 faction leaders in Ethiopia early last year that
was boycotted by Aidid and his backers established a National
Salvation Council whose aim was to end factional fighting in
Somalia and set up a functioning state.
	   Somalia has had no central government since 1991 when Ali Mahdi
and Mohamed Farah Aidid joined forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad
Barre. They later turned on each other, and the country dissolved
into warring fiefdoms of clan-based factions.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ EgyptAir will add new routes to 12 African
countries and extend existing routes to at least four others,
EgyptAir's chairman, Mohammed Rayan, was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   The new routes will be to member states of the Common Market for
East and Central Africa, or COMESA, he told Al-Gumhuriya newspaper.
The extended routes will service Djbouti, the Congo, Swaziland and
Mauritius, he said.
	   Rayan also said that EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, lost
200 million pounds (dlrs 60 million) as a result of the attack by
Muslim extremists in Luxor last November that killed 58 foreign
tourists and four Egyptians.
	   The attack led to cancellations by thousands of would-be
tourists and weak bookings through the spring.
	   The loss by EgyptAir was not as great as anticipated, Rayan
said. He said initial estimates predicted a loss of 600 million
pounds (dlrs 176 million).
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's Investment Authority is negotiating
with the French auto-maker Peugot about the possibility of the
company setting up a factory to manufacture engines in the free
zone at Ismailiya, the authority's chairman said Sunday.
	   The government also is studying a proposal from the Investment
Authority to provide export companies operating in the zone with a
variety of tax exemptions and other investment incentives, the
authority's chairman, Ibrahim Fawzy, said in a statement.
	   The statement gave no further details.
	   In a meeting with Alexandria businessmen, Fawzy said foreign
holdings in investment companies set up in the first half of 1998
totaled more than dlrs 651 million, a 25 percent increase over the
same period. The figure excludes Arab investment.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will soon resume manufacturing some
electrical appliances that it stopped making during the 1990-91
Gulf crisis, an Iraqi official was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   Ahmad Abdul Rafa, director of the state-run Electronics
Industries Manufacturing Co., told Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly that
the company would build ``television sets with new specifications
and developed to allow users to play video games.''
	   He said the company also would build radios, cassette recorders
and telephones starting in the final quarter this year.
	   There was no information on where the company would obtain the
components.
	   The company stopped manufacturing electronic appliances after
the United Nations imposed trade sanctions to punish Iraq for its
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which set off the 1991 Gulf War.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi dinar slipped Sunday on fears
that current disarmament talks between Iraq and the United Nations
may fail to result in lifting U.N. sanctions soon, traders said.
	   They said the dinar was trading at 1,725 to the dollar, down
from 1,650 to the dollar last week.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed trade sanctions after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. It has said they will only be removed only
after U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The chief U.N. inspector, Richard Butler, started a four-day
visit to Iraq on Sunday to press Baghdad to reveal more about its
weapons programs.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Foreign investments in Jordan's stock
exchange were about 10 percent lower in the first half of this year
than in the same period in 1997, an official at the stock market
said Sunday.
	   Brokers attributed the drop to political uncertainty in the
region, including the stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   The stock market official, who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition his name not be used, said that net investments by
non-Jordanians totaled 35.6 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 50.1
million) during the first half of this year compared with 39.8
million dinars (dlrs 56 million) a year earlier.
	   He added that Arab investors bought shares worth 2.3 million
dinars (dlrs 3.2 million) in the first half this year compared with
13 million dinars (dlrs 18.3 million) a year earlier.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan plans to set up a truck terminal in
Amman to stimulate road transport in the kingdom, Transportation
Minister Sami Gammo said Sunday.
	   He called on private sector companies and financial institutions
to contribute to the project, which he estimated would cost 10
million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 14 million).
	   The plan calls for construction of parking and service
facilities for trucks and trailers as well as cargo storage areas.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Securities House Co. on Sunday announced net
profits of 1.4 million dinars (dlrs 4.57 million) for the first
half of the year, down 33 percent from 2.09 million dinars (dlrs
6.83 million) in the same period of 1997.
	   Walid al-Buaijan, assistant general manager of the company, told
The Associated Press the drop was due in part to the sluggish
performance of the Kuwait Stock Exchange. He said the company has
moved from investing in the exchange toward buying other companies
outright.
	   The Securities House is one of Kuwait's smaller investment
companies. Its paid-up capital is 12 million dinars (dlrs 39.21
million).

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
ethnic Albanian homes west of Pristina on Sunday in what appeared
to be a campaign to drive ethnic Albanian civilians from part of
Kosovo that had been under rebel control.
	   Serb sources confirmed clashes in the area but blamed the Kosovo
Liberation Army for starting it by shooting at police checkpoints
along the road between Pristina and Pec, which government forces
cleared last week.
	   Elsewhere, both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting
Sunday in the Djakovica area southeast of the provincial capital
Pristina. Each side blamed the other for starting it.
	   Albanian sources also reported fierce shelling near Junik and
other rebel-controlled villages in southwest Kosovo near the
Albanian border. The report could not be confirmed.

Italian suspected of double murder arrested in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss police said Sunday they have
arrested a suspected mafia member who, according to press reports,
is wanted in Italy on suspicion of a double murder, illegal arms
possession and kidnapping.
	   The Italian was arrested Friday night in the central Swiss
lakeside city of Lucerne after an international warrant was issued,
a spokesman for the cantonal (state) police said.
	   The spokesman didn't name the man or give further details. But
Swiss mass circulation weekly newspaper SonntagsBlick and Italian
news agency ANSA identified him as 37-year-old Tommaso Atterritano.
	   Investigators were quoted in an ANSA report Saturday as
describing Atterritano as one of the more dangerous on Italy's list
of 500-wanted suspected mobsters.
	   He is wanted by police for the double murder of Carlo Rotundo
and Salvatore Altamore, killed in Calabria in 1981, ANSA reported.
Apparently Rotundo was the target and Altamore accidentally got in
the way and was killed, the agency said.
	   Investigators said Atterritano was a top killer for the
Piromalli crime family, a powerful clan based in Gioia Tauro,
Calabria, the ``toe'' of Italy and a region where the 'ndrangheta
crime syndicate operates.
	   The syndicate is a version of the Sicilian Mafia, which is
blamed for drug and arms trafficking, extortion rackets and
kidnappings.
	   Atterritano was arrested in a joint Swiss-Italian police
operation at a villa on the banks of Lake Lucerne, where
Atterritano has been living for the last four years, the press
reports said.
	   Police discovered three automatic rifles, an air rifle, two
pistols and ammunition in the building, according to ANSA.
	   To tail him, two police officers pretended to be a couple
staying with friends in a nearby apartment building. They watched
the suspect from a terrace.
	   While the two officers stayed on the terrace and sipped soda, a
signal was given to move in, and the police captured Atterritano as
he was leaving his house, ANSA reported.

Roman Catholic nun killed in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Unidentified attackers shot dead a Roman
Catholic nun in northwestern Rwanda under yet unclear
circumstances, a church official said Sunday.
	   Sister Valens Mukanoheli, a Rwandan, was fatally shot on Friday
in front of her Benebikira mission at Nyundo near Gisenyi, 90
kilometers (55 miles) northwest of Kigali, the official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``We don't know if she was murdered by the rebels or criminal
elements. She is being buried today,'' he said.
	   In his public appearance at the Vatican Sunday, Pope John Paul
II prayed for the nun.
	   ``Let's continue to faithfully ask the Lord for the gift of
peace for Africa and the entire world,'' the pontiff said.
	   Church workers are often targeted in Rwanda, a predominantely
Roman Catholic country, where thousands of people have died in
rebel attacks since November 1996 when former Hutu soldiers and
militiamen mingled with more than 1 million refugees returning from
exile.
	   The were responsible for the 1994 Hutu government-organized
genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus. The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power
in July 1994.
	   Last month, the rebels abducted and then released unharmed a
Canadian nun and two Belgian priests in two separate incidents.

New hope for 10 men buried for 16 days in Austrian mine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hopes for 10 men buried in an Austrian
mine for more than two weeks rose Sunday after rescuers drilled a
narrow shaft down to a 130-meter-deep (430 foot) cavern where the
victims may have taken refuge.
	   A spokesman for the mine, Alfred Zechling, said drillers broke
through to the cavern late Sunday morning but it was unclear
whether there was enough oxygen or whether the men were actually
there.
	   Rescuers planned to lower a camera and a microphone down the
20-centimeter (8-inch) wide shaft into the cavern later Sunday at
the talc mine in Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of
Vienna.
	   Austrian Radio said five members of a German rescue team would
be brought to the mine to try to determine if there were signs of
life.
	   The 10 men were themselves part of a rescue team which was sent
into the mine July 17 when a landslide buried miner Georg Hainzl.
But a second, stronger mudslide buried them too, and officials
declared there was no chance anyone survived.
	   But rescue efforts intensified July 26 when Hainzl was found
alive and in relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Hainzl,
however, was in a different part of the mine closer to the surface.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said the shaft might have to
be reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process which could
take days.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one could be completed.

Sakhalin prepares for power outage as miners continue blockade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 5th graf to ADD population of Sakhalin. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Energy officials on the Pacific island of Sakhalin
prepared Sunday for an electricity blackout as coal miners refused
to lift a blockade of the island's main power station, a news
agency reported.
	   Power will be cut to all consumers and all but the most critical
life support systems, such as hospitals and the water system, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   For nine days the miners have blocked roads and rail lines
leading to the station, preventing coal deliveries needed to keep
it running. The miners have vowed not to lift the blockade until
they are paid eight months of overdue wages.
	   The strike is one of many periodic miners protests that have
taken place across Russia since May to demand overdue wages.
However, the protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not
inflicted significant damage on the economy.
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant's operation for
electricity. About 650,000 people live on the island.
	   Most of Russia's coal mines have been losing money for years,
and the government has been trying to shut them down. Many coal
companies have been nominally privatized, but still depend on
significant government subsidies in order to pay their workers.

	   CHINARI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani farmer Syed Mushtaq Hussain
waited until darkness provided some cover from Indian gunners
across the border, then he picked his way along the narrow mountain
paths to safety.
	   Hussain said Sunday he had to retrace the rugged route from this
town _ roads are closed because they are easy targets for the
Indians. His mother and cousin, both hit by shell fragments the day
before, were waiting for him in his village on the Kashmiri front
line.
	   ``We cannot bring them here because there is no transport,''
said Hussain, his words rushed with fear. ``I've just come to get
medicine and bandages.''
	   Villagers on both sides of Kashmir have borne the brunt of days
of military gunfire that India and Pakistan accuse each other of
starting. Pakistani military sources, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said five more villagers were killed by
Indian shells or bullets Saturday, bringing the civilian total in
four days to 48.
	   Indian army officials counter that 29 Indians, most of them
civilians, were killed by Pakistani forces.
	   Military officials said firing subsided after a two-hour
bombardment early Sunday morning of Chokoti, a village of mud and
brick houses scattered in a valley at the border less than 10
kilometers (6 miles) from Chinari. No one was hurt, because most of
Chokoti's 20,000 small farmers and herders had fled, leaving behind
crumbled houses and businesses and blackened corn fields.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the
Himalayan territory now divided between them, since each gained
independence from colonial Britain in 1947. Spurts of artillery and
mortar fire are common across the region that both India and
Pakistan claim in its entirety, although the exchanges that erupted
the middle of last week were unusually heavy.
	   ``The Indians are bombing the civilians. They're not targeting
the army positions,'' farmer Hussain said.
	   Many villages lie in a no-man's land between Indian and
Pakistani artillery. Pakistani officials also charge that India is
trying to terrorize villagers so they won't shelter and feed Muslim
militants who sneak across the border to join a separatist uprising
in Indian-held Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority province in
predominately Hindu India.
	   India accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of arming and training
the militants, but Pakistani officials say they provide only moral
support. Muslim militants were accused of killing four Hindus
Friday in a remote, mountainous area of Indian-held Kashmir. In two
incidents earlier last week, gunmen stormed into houses in the
region and sprayed the occupants with bullets, killing a total of
16 Hindus and wounding five others.
	   The attacks on Hindu villages may have prompted the firing,
though Pakistani officials claim the shelling was aimed at
undermining peace talks their prime minister had with his Indian
counterpart last week. The talks, seen as particularly urgent
because both India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in May, were
declared a failure on Friday.
	   Whatever the cause, the effect of the latest firing has been
devastating. Scores of Pakistani families were walking away from
border villages Sunday morning, driving herds of buffalo or goats
before them and carrying a few belongings in suitcases or bundled
in cloth on their heads.
	   ``We can't say when they will start again,'' Imtiaz Ahmed said
as he prepared to leave Chokoti to head to Chinari.
	   Displaced families overwhelmed Chinari, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northwest of Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani-held Kashmir.
	   Salima, who uses one name only, said her house was destroyed and
her family's cattle killed in the bombardment, and her 6-year-old
daughter was hit in the shoulder by a bullet. Her daughter was
being treated in Chinari's small hospital, while the rest of the
family stayed in a school.
	   Some Chinari residents opened their brick or mud homes to
strangers or collected money to buy food for them. Some survivors
had fled with nothing, saying entire villages were set ablaze by
Indian shells.

Sultan replaces younger brother as head of collapsed company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ In another royal family
shakedown, the sultan of Brunei has stripped his brother Prince
Jefri Bolkiah of control of the collapsed conglomerate Amedeo, the
Prime Ministers office said in a statement Sunday.
	   Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has appointed two international
accountants to serve as executive managers of Amedeo, the
government's flagship investment company, and nine of its
subsidiaries.
	   Two partners in the London office of the Arthur Anderson firm
were chosen to oversee Amedeo as part of ``a continuing effort to
ensure, in the public interest, proper control and protection of
companies and their business,'' the statement said.
	   Prince Jefri formerly headed Amedeo, which collapsed recently
under losses estimated at dlrs 16 billion. He is believed to have
fled to Europe.
	   ``The appointment of the executive managers is a temporary
measure to allow for investigation, submission of report to the
Minister of Finance, on the affairs, business and property of the
companies as provided for in the Companies Act,'' the statement
said.
	   Under Brunei's Companies Act, the sultan, who is both prime
minister and finance minister, has authority to restructure the
leadership of troubled companies.
	   Last week, the sultan dismissed Jefri as chairman of the
powerful Brunei Investment Agency, which puts the sultanate's oil
riches into hotels, banks, businesses and U.S. Treasury bonds, and
head of a huge telecommunications company.
	   The collapse of Amedeo has raised concern of the financial
soundness of the BIA, whose riches are kept secret by the
government but estimated at up to dlrs 60 billion.
	   Independent auditors were hired last month to examine the books
of Amedeo, whose prestigious international holdings include
London's Dorchester Hotel, New York's Palace Hotel and the Plaza
Athenee in Paris.
	   The Arthur Anderson partners, who were not named, will serve as
executive managers of Amedeo Corp, the parent company, as well as
Amedeo Development Corp., Amedeo Fishing, Amedeo Insurance and
Amedeo Manpower.
	   They were also appointed executive managers of Jerudong Park
Inc, Jerudong Park Hotel, Jerudong International School, Jerudong
Park Trading and AMS Technologies.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The widow of a customs official killed in a car
bomb attack last week was herself gunned down and killed early
Sunday as she visited his grave, a news agency reported.
	   The widow, Said Emomnazarova, went to the cemetery about 5 a.m.
to visit the new grave, according to Muslim tradition, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Two masked gunmen opened fire on her, and she died shortly
thereafter at a hospital, the report said.
	   Her husband, deputy customs chief Ali Emomnadzarov, was killed
Thursday when his car exploded just 100 meters (yards) from a
presidential residence.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for either attack.
	   ITAR-Tass said police and security officials are investigating
both killings. The report did not suggest a motive for either.
	   Tajikistan has been torn by violence since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. The government and mostly Islamic opposition formally
ended a five-year civil war last year, but sporadic clashes have
continued.
	   Four United Nations military observers were killed in an ambush
in mountainous eastern Tajikistan last month.

Report: Iraqi mines have killed, maimed over 4,000
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Mines laid on the land and in the sea by Iraqi
troops after their invasion eight years ago have claimed more than
1,700 lives, according to a government study published Sunday.
	   Al-Anba said the study also indicated that 2,300 civilians have
been maimed, most of them children.
	   The figures were announced on the eighth anniversary of Iraq's
Aug. 2, 1990, invasion of Kuwait. A U.S.-led coalition ended Iraq's
occupation seven months later.
	   The newspaper said that the figures did not include 84
mine-clearing experts killed on the job or 200 who were injured.
	   Since Kuwait's liberation in February 1991, teams from the
United States, Britain, France, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan and
Turkey have removed around 1.64 million mines out of an estimated 2
million that were left by the Iraqis.
	   Al-Anba quoted the report as saying that the work of the
mine-clearing teams was made more difficult because the Iraqis did
not provided maps or other information on the mine fields. Shifting
desert sand has buried some 5 meters (yards) deep.

Australia denies Cambodian poll deal for arrest of Khmer Rouge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A former Khmer Rouge guerrilla
wanted for ordering the killing of three Western tourists in 1994
spent a second day in jail Sunday, while Australia's foreign
minister denied his long-sought arrest would influence his
country's evaluation of Cambodia's recent election.
	   Nuon Paet headed a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who halted a
train going south from the capital and abducted three Western
travelers: David Wilson, 29, of Australia, Mark Slater, 28, of
Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, of France.
	   They were slain while in captivity on rugged Vine Mountain in
the southern province of Kampot.
	   Nuon Paet, the former guerrilla commander, was arrested Saturday
in Phnom Penh after being lured to the capital by Cambodian police.
	   ``This is a success for our national police,'' Cambodia's top
leader, Hun Sen, told reporters Saturday after briefing the
ambassadors of Australia, Britain and France.
	   In Canberra, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
welcomed the arrest, saying it followed ``from the Australian
government's numerous and high level representations to the
Cambodian government.''
	   On Sunday, he denied speculation the arrest was a part of any
deal for Australia's acceptance of Hun Sen's apparent election
victory last week.
	   The opposition has charged that there was election fraud by Hun
Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, and has appealed to
international election observers to pressure the government to
investigate.
	   The foreign observer groups have given a more-or-less clean bill
of health to the election, although no comprehensive results have
been released a week after voting.
	   The timing of the arrest raised some eyebrows because it is
widely believed Hun Sen's government has been aware of Nuon Paet's
whereabouts for at least the past year but was unwilling to
apprehend him.
	   Downer said Australia's decision to recognize the election
outcome would be based on the assessment of the Joint International
Observers Group _ which included 22 Australians _ once all counting
was complete and results announced.
	   ``The arrest of Nuon Paet doesn't play into that as far as we
are concerned,'' he said.
	   Asked about the timing of the arrest, the diplomat who served as
Australia's ambassador to Cambodia during the kidnapping saga said
that ``In Cambodia, many things are possible.''
	   ``But I think the important thing now is that he has been
arrested, and provided that's followed by a proper criminal
investigation and judicial process, I think that's the most
important thing to focus on,'' said Tony Kevin, who was in Phnom
Penh serving as an election observer.
	   The case had caused considerable controversy, especially in
Australia, because it was believed that the Cambodian government
had mishandled the negotiations.

Archaeologist salvaging Napoleon's fleet sunk 200 years ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two centuries after a historic battle
destroyed Napoleon's hopes of crushing the British Empire, the
French emperor's fleet has been discovered entombed in the depths
of an artifact-rich Mediterranean bay.
	   French marine archaeologist Franck Goddio said his team is
salvaging the flagship of Napoleon's fleet, L'Orient, along with
two other French frigates submerged 25 kilometers (15 miles) off
the coast of Egypt's port city of Alexandria.
	   ``It is a magnificent find,'' Goddio told The Associated Press
on Saturday in a telephone interview from Paris. ``The explosion
that sank L'Orient left it scattered all over the bottom of Abu Qir
Bay.''
	   The 120-cannon, roughly 2,000-ton ship was lost on August 1,
1798, in a battle with the British fleet of Admiral Horatio Nelson.
Cannon shot set the ship ablaze and an ensuing explosion in a
gunpowder magazine sank the ship, Goddio said. All 1,000 sailors
and officers aboard died.
	   ``The explosion was heard all the way in Alexandria,'' Goddio
said.
	   The first trace of L'Orient came in 1983 with the discovery of
the bronze name plate of a ship called ``Royal Dauphin.'' But
Goddio said it was only later that Royal Dauphin was found to be
the pre-French Revolution name of L'Orient.
	   ``The discovery, unfortunately, was forgotten for years,'' he
said.
	   Goddio's team began surveying the eastern harbor of Alexandria
in 1996. Its first and most dazzling find was the 2,000-year-old
ruins of Cleopatra's palace and the home and temple of her Roman
lover, Marc Antony, which had sunk into the harbor after an
earthquake.
	   But for Goddio, the discovery of Napoleon's fleet 12 meters (36
feet) below the surface at Abu Qir east of Alexandria yielded a new
sense of excitement.
	   ``This is where the fate of Europe was decided,'' said Goddio,
referring to the battle in which Nelson destroyed a French fleet
bent on crushing the British Empire by striking at Egypt and,
ultimately, India.
	   Among the remains of the ship found are ``parts of the hull and
an 11-meter-long (33-foot-long) rudder which weighed about one ton
and the ship's riggings,'' Goddio told the AP.
	   Part of the ship's mast was also found. Nelson had ordered
another part of the mast salvaged and it was used in making the
admiral's coffin after his death in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar,
Goddio said.
	   ``Touching that wood is like being an eyewitness to history,''
said an elated Goddio.
	   The team, which included archaeologists from Egypt's Supreme
Council for Antiquities, also found the crew's skeletons and many
coins ``which, interestingly, bear the effigy of (kings) Louis XIV,
Louis XV and Louis XVI, as well as coins from the (French)
revolution,'' Goddio said.
	   Also excavated were ``very well preserved'' buttons bearing the
regiment insignia, cannons, bottles and sabers, all of which were
buried under one to two meters (yards) of sediment, he said.
	   The second ship to be salvaged, La Seriuse, was a 42-cannon,
frigate weighing roughly 800 tons and measuring 40-45 meters
(yards).
	   ``La Seriuse was sunk by cannon fire, and went down straight
unlike L'Orient, whose remains were scattered over more than 500
meters (yards),'' he said.
	   The third ship, La Artemise, was burned and ``there is very
little left of it.''
	   Goddio said work on the sunken ships is expected to go on ``for
a number of years.'' After that, he said, there is still much to
discover in the bay from Egypt's history.
	   ``There are thousands of years of heritage that have been
swallowed up by the sea near Alexandria,'' Goddio said.

Millions maintain flood vigil as Yangtze waters remain high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After weeks of constant battle with the Yangtze
river, local officials Sunday were exhorted to maintain discipline
and threatened with harsh punishment for abuses, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   ``Officials who harm flood relief efforts through negligence,
quibbling, delays, being unsympathetic to suffering, or avoiding
duties will be investigated and punished,'' Xinhua said, quoting
orders issued by the Personnel Ministry.
	   The stern order hints at malfeasance in the relief effort among
local officials, widely regarded in China as corrupt and inept. A
number of officials have already been punished for negligence in
flood preparations or fleeing their posts ahead of rising waters.
	   The Public Security Ministry in charge of the police, also
issued a circular ordering officers to ``strike hard'' against
looting and other crimes in flooded areas, Xinhua said. The report
did not mention any specific instances of such crimes.
	   Rains that began earlier and fell harder than usual have raised
the Yangtze to its highest level since 1954. Flooding has killed at
least 1,268 people this year, mostly in heavily populated areas of
central China along the river.
	   With the Yangtze still dangerously high, over 2 million soldiers
and civilians kept a vigil for leaks or signs of collapse on
waterlogged levees in central China, Xinhua said.
	   Water levels fell slightly from historical highs in Dongting
lake, which feeds into the Yangtze in central Hunan province, as
well as down river near the industrial center of Wuhan, the Xinhua
News Agency reported.
	   But waters continued to rise in Poyang lake further east in
Jiangxi province, which flows into the Yangtze near the city of
Jiujiang, it said.
	   Torrential rains upriver in Sichuan province over the weekend
could bring even higher waters, Xinhua said.
	   Dikes have been breached in several places, and authorities
worry others weakened by near incessant rain could collapse under
pressure from the swollen river.
	   Families flooded out of their homes have lived on top of
embankments in lean-tos covered with plastic sheeting for weeks.
Health workers have distributed medicines and disinfected flooded
streets, limiting disease to infections from direct contact with
filthy river water, according to Red Cross field teams in the area.

Foreign minister says peace talks `waste of time'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday
accused Israel of impeding Middle East peace negotiations and
described the recent talks between Israelis and Palestinians as a
``waste of time.''
	   Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been a broker in Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
	   Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in
March 1997 after Israel began construction of a new Jewish
neighborhood in Arab east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want the Arab
sector, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war,
as the capital of their would-be state.
	   The two sides have been holding talks for the past two weeks on
a U.S. proposal to get the peace process back on track, but there
have been no signs of a breakthrough.
	   ``What is going on now is merely a matter of procrastination,
delay and waste of time without any signs of real progress,''
Moussa told reporters after presenting a report on the situation to
President Hosni Mubarak.
	   The two sides have been discussing a compromise proposed by the
United States that calls for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank territory it controls.
	   The Palestinian Authority has accepted the U.S. initiative, but
Israel says it jeopardizes its security.
	   Moussa told reporters Sunday there has been no progress in
getting Israeli approval of the American initiative.
	   ``The international community should not stand as a spectator to
the peace initiative as it collapses,'' Moussa said.
	   He added: ``The situation has entered a vicious circle without
any hope of progress now or, according to logic, in the future. ...
The elements and potentials of such progress are not clear under
the current Israeli policy.''
	   After meeting with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in
Cairo on Saturday, Moussa said Israel was not taking the talks
seriously.
	   ``It is obvious that they (the Israelis) are wasting time and
the ... result (of recent negotiations) is in actuality zero,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) - Marco Pantani wore the leader's yellow
jersey as riders set off on Sunday's final stage of the Tour de
France, dogged by a doping scandal likely to continue long after
the cycling classic ends.
	   Pantani started the final 147 kilometers (91 miles) from Melun
to Paris with a lead of more than 3 minutes over defending champion
Jan Ullrich. American Bobby Julich is third.
	   Barring injury or accident, the top three should remain the same
after the nine laps up and down the Champs-Elysees.
	   Pantani would become the first Italian winner of the Tour since
Felice Gimondi captured the race in 1965.
	   Usually the final day brings revelry as riders race into Paris
to end the grueling three-week competition. But this year, there
was a sense the end could not come soon enough for a pack whose
numbers dwindled as the race moved forward.
	   Nearly each day since the start of the Tour July 11 in Dublin,
Ireland, there have been new doping revelations, police searches
and rider protests.
	   Only 14 of the 21 teams are ending the race and the pack has
been reduced to less than 100 riders from the original 189.
	   While riders criss-crossed France, seven people were placed
under investigation -- one step short of being charged -- on
doping-related charges: three officials of the Festina team, two
from TVM, a doctor from ONCE and one rider, Italian Rodolfo Massi
of the Casino team, the Tour's leading mountain climber.
	   Festina was expelled on July 17, after Festina team director
Bruno Roussel admitted to an organized system of providing
performance-enhancing drugs to his riders.
	   Six other teams dropped out in protest over police tactics and
treatment during the Tour, leaving 14 in the competition.
	   On Monday, TVM team riders are to be questioned by judicial
police in Reims in the ongoing doping investigation.
	   The 1999 Tour de France is scheduled to begin in Puy-du-Fou.

	   If the claim is true, the next Taliban target is likely to be
Mazar-e-Sharif, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Shebergan.
	   Mazar-e-Sharif is the headquarters of Ahmed Shah Masood, the
military chief the Taliban army ousted from the Afghan capital in
1996.
	   The Taliban religious militia, which rules in most of
Afghanistan, has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory it controls.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

New hope for 10 men buried for 16 days in Austrian mine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hopes for 10 men buried in an Austrian
mine for more than two weeks rose Sunday after rescuers drilled a
narrow shaft down to a 130-meter-deep (430 foot) cavern where the
victims may have taken refuge.
	   A spokesman for the mine, Alfred Zechling, said drillers broke
through to the cavern late Sunday morning but it was unclear
whether the men were there or if there was enough oxygen.
	   Rescuers planned to lower a camera and a microphone down the
20-centimeter (8-inch) wide shaft into the cavern later Sunday at
the talc mine in Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of
Vienna.
	   Austrian Radio said five members of a German rescue team would
be brought to the mine to try to determine if there were signs of
life.
	   The 10 men were themselves part of a rescue team that was sent
into the mine July 17 when a landslide buried miner Georg Hainzl.
But a second, stronger mudslide buried them too, and officials
declared there was no chance anyone survived.
	   But rescue efforts intensified July 26 when Hainzl was found
alive and in relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Hainzl,
however, was in a different part of the mine closer to the surface.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said the shaft might have to
be reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process that could take
days.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one could be completed.

Bossi backs off from his call for secession from Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Umberto Bossi, the Northern League leader, has
backed off a bit from his call for secession for the Italian north.
	   Bossi in the past has declared ``independence'' for what he
calls Padania, roughly the region north of the Po River. But
Italian newspapers on Sunday quoted him as saying: ``Padania
doesn't necessarily mean secession.''
	   ``Padania means having local representatives in institutions,''
Bossi added, apparently referring to previous calls by the party
for more regional autonomy.
	   Opinion polls have shown that the vast majority of Bossi's
backers opposes attempts to split the relatively affluent north
from the rest of the country but does want lower taxes and more
accountability from the central government in Rome.
	   Asked if the League was changing, Bossi replied: ``It's like a
haircut -- the shape changes but the substance doesn't.''
	   But Bossi seemed to want to hold on to his image of his
imaginary state called Padania.
	   Chatting with reporters, Bossi went on to add that Padania's
``provisional government'' would take office on Sept. 13.
	   Then he added: ``in 2000, the presidents of the regions of the
north will launch autonomy'' to region.

Spanish highways turn to gridlock as vacationers head to beach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Monster traffic jams clogged Spain's
highways this weekend as vacationers clogged the roads, forming
bumper-to-bumper caravans up to 50 kilometers (30 miles) long.
	   The worst nightmare came Saturday morning for Madrid residents
fleeing southeast to beaches in the Valencia region at the start of
their August vacation.
	   The drive to the city of Valencia normally takes about three
hours, but this time it was six, due in part to a 50-kilometer
stretch of stop-and-go traffic just outside Madrid.
	   Officials reported another bottleneck of 16 kilometers (10
miles) in Cuenca province, also on the way to Valencia, on
Saturday.
	   They said traffic was flowing smoothly Sunday but that the mass
exodus had seen 18 accidents that left a total of 20 people dead.

Taliban army claims major victory

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia claimed it captured the stronghold of warlord Rashid Dostum
on Sunday, putting it on the doorstep of the main headquarters of
the opposition coalition.
	   Spokesman Abdul Hay Muttmayan, speaking from Taliban
headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, had few details on
the battle for Shebergan.
	   A day earlier, the Taliban claimed to be just 100 kilometers (60
miles) across flat desert from the town where Dostum had assembled
an arsenal of tanks, fighter jets and other equipment.
	   Dostum's whereabouts were unknown. Attempts to reach him and his
allies were not immediately successful.
	   If the claim is true, the next Taliban target is likely to be
the key city of Mazar-e-Sharif, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
east of Shebergan.
	   Mazar-e-Sharif is the headquarters of Ahmed Shah Masood, the
military chief who the Taliban army chased from the Afghan capital
in 1996.
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif in May, but
retreated after street battles that left several hundred of them
dead. It's believed that as many as 2,000 Taliban soldiers who were
taken prisoner in that fighting were later massacred.
	   Taliban officials have reported advances in recent days through
neighboring Faryab, a remote province from where independent
reports have been unavailable.
	   Fighting has been fierce in Faryab since early July, with both
sides claiming the upper hand as the anti-Taliban coalition
struggles to hold onto its last shreds of territory.
	   The Taliban religious militia, which rules in most of
Afghanistan, has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory it controls.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from water authority official in 6th
graf, details thruout
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Water in 8 percent of Sydney households
was declared fit to drink Sunday, though the rest of the city's 3.7
million residents must still boil their water before a dangerous
parasite is flushed from the system.
	   The outbreak of the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium has
been an international embarrassment to the city that will host the
summer Olympics in two years.
	   ``If Sydney can't guarantee clean water for major sporting
events, what will the world sporting community think about our
capacity to hold the year 2000 Olympics?' asked opposition state
Sport and Recreation spokesman Brad Hazzard.
	   New South Wales Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles said Sunday
that some suburbs in the city's south and a few in Sydney's west
had tested clear of the parasites.
	   ``Sydney's water supply continues to improve, fresh clean water
is flushing through the Sydney water system,'' he told reporters.
	   ``The latest series of test results for the areas that have been
cleansed, analyzed and validated record zero levels of
cryptosporidium and zero levels of giardia,'' he said.
	   Most people in Sydney have been using boiled or bottled drinking
water since the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium were found in
the city's water supply last week.
	   Bottled water sales soared 300 percent on Thursday and Friday,
supermarkets said. There have been no reports of price gouging.
	   The contamination has been an inconvenience, since residents
must boil or buy bottled water to drink or cook safely, to brush
their teeth, or to make ice.
	   Showering and bathing is safe only if people are careful to keep
their mouths shut.
	   Veterinarians advised pet owners that young puppies and kittens
could be susceptible to parasitic illnesses, though older pets are
hardier and able to resist serious disease.
	   Since the water system is being flushed out and runoff is
entering the harbor, the Environmental Protection Authority has
warned sailors and winter swimmers against swallowing harbor, river
or creek water.
	   No illnesses have been reported. But the parasites have an
incubation period of a week or more, so it may take several more
days for health problems to develop.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, including
the very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee in 1993,
contributing to the deaths of about 100 people. More than 400,000
others were sickened.
	   The cause of the contamination is unclear. Officials have not
found evidence that the carcasses of dogs and foxes found in or
near an open canal leading to a filtration plant were the source.

Chronology of Tour de France doping scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cycling-Tour de France &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Some key dates in the doping scandal surrounding
the Tour de France:
	   July 8 _ A masseur for the Festina team, Willy Voet, is stopped
at the France-Belgium border. His car is found to contain more than
400 doping products, including EPO, a drug that increases oxygen in
red blood cells.
	   July 10 _ A court in the northern city of Lille puts Voet under
formal investigation _ one step short of being charged.
	   July 11 _ Tour de France begins in Dublin, Ireland.
	   July 14 _ Voet changes his story and admits the doping products
were for team use, not his own.
	   July 15 _ Festina director Bruno Roussel and team doctor Erik
Ryckaert are detained and questioned by police.
	   July 16 _ Roussel is suspended by the International Cycling
Union.
	   July 17 _ Roussel admits he systematically supplied illegal
drugs to the team to improve performances under strict medical
control. Roussel and Ryckaert are placed under formal investigation
and detained. The Tour expels the Festina team.
	   July 21 _ Ryckaert's lawyer says there was a system of funding
illegal drugs through team members' winnings.
	   July 23 _ Under questioning, five Festina riders admit taking
drugs. The Dutch TVM team comes under the spotlight too, and its
team director and doctor are detained and questioned.
	   July 24 _ Roussel, Ryckaert and Voet meet in a Lille court. At
the start of the 12th stage, the remaining Tour riders protest,
delaying the start two hours.
	   July 28 _ Police search hotel rooms of team members. Riders for
TVM are taken to the hospital and given lengthy medical tests
including the taking of blood, urine and hair samples.
	   July 29 _ The remaining Tour riders stop the stage to
Aix-les-Bains twice to protest the treatment of TVM. Three teams
drop out of the race. The Tour decides to annul the stage. A rider
from Casino, Rodolfo Massi, is detained by police for questioning
along with ONCE team doctor Nicolas Terrados.
	   July 30 _ Two more teams drop out along with some individuals,
including former world champion Luc Leblanc. Massi, who was the
leading mountain climber in the Tour, does not start in the 18th
stage, the first time a rider is barred from competing due to
police questioning.
	   July 31 _ Massi and Terrados are placed under formal
investigation. The remaining riders of the TVM team drop out. There
are 14 teams left from the original 21, and less than 100 riders
from the original 189.
	   Aug. 2 _ The Tour ends in Paris.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two centuries after a historic battle
destroyed Napoleon's hopes of crushing the British Empire, the
French emperor's fleet has been discovered entombed in the depths
of an artifact-rich Mediterranean bay.
	   French marine archaeologist Franck Goddio said his team is
salvaging the flagship of Napoleon's fleet, L'Orient, along with
two other French frigates submerged 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) off
the coast of Egypt's port city of Alexandria.
	   ``It is a magnificent find,'' Goddio told The Associated Press
Saturday in a telephone interview from Paris. ``The explosion that
sank L'Orient left it scattered all over the bottom of Abu Qir
Bay.''
	   The 120-cannon, roughly 2,000-ton (1,800-metric ton) ship was
lost on August 1, 1798, in a battle with the British fleet of
Admiral Horatio Nelson. Cannon shot set the ship ablaze and an
ensuing explosion in a gunpowder magazine sank the ship, Goddio
said. All 1,000 sailors and officers aboard died.
	   ``The explosion was heard all the way in Alexandria,'' Goddio
said.
	   The first trace of L'Orient came in 1983 with the discovery of
the bronze name plate of a ship called ``Royal Dauphin.'' But
Goddio said it was only later that Royal Dauphin was found to be
the pre-French Revolution name of L'Orient.
	   ``The discovery, unfortunately, was forgotten for years,'' he
said.
	   Goddio's team began surveying the eastern harbor of Alexandria
in 1996. Its first, and most dazzling, find was the 2,000-year-old
ruins of Cleopatra's palace and the home and temple of her Roman
lover, Marc Antony, which had sunk into the harbor after an
earthquake.
	   But for Goddio, the discovery of Napoleon's fleet 12 meters (36
feet) below the surface at Abu Qir east of Alexandria yielded a new
sense of excitement.
	   ``This is where the fate of Europe was decided,'' said Goddio,
referring to the battle in which Nelson destroyed a French fleet
bent on crushing the British Empire by striking at Egypt and,
ultimately, India.
	   Among remains of the ship found are ``parts of the hull and an
11-meter-long (33-foot) rudder which weighed about one ton and the
ship's riggings,'' Goddio told the AP.
	   Also found was part of the ship's mast, another section of which
had been ordered salvaged by Nelson and was used in making the
admiral's coffin after his death in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar,
Goddio said.
	   ``Touching that wood is like being an eyewitness to history,''
said an elated Goddio.
	   The team, which included archaeologists from Egypt's Supreme
Council for Antiquities, also found the crew's skeletons and many
coins ``which, interestingly, bear the effigy of (kings) Louis XIV,
Louis XV and Louis XVI, as well as coins from the (French)
revolution,'' Goddio said.
	   Also excavated were ``very well preserved'' buttons bearing the
regiment insignia, cannons, bottles and sabers, all of which were
buried under one to two meters (yards) of sediment, he said.
	   The second ship to be salvaged, La Seriuse, was a 42-cannon,
frigate weighing roughly 800 tons (720 metric tons) and measuring
40-45 meters (yards).
	   ``La Seriuse was sunk by cannon fire, and went down straight
unlike L'Orient, whose remains were scattered over more than 500
meters (yards),'' he said.
	   The third ship, La Artemise, was burned and ``there is very
little left of it.''
	   Goddio said work on the sunken ships is expected to go on ``for
a number of years.'' After that, he said, there is still much to
discover in the bay from Egypt's history.
	   ``There are thousands of years of heritage that have been
swallowed up by the sea near Alexandria,'' Goddio said.

	   After his worst qualifying performance of the season when he had
only the ninth fastest time, Schumacher did well to finish in the
points. But he was unable to challenge the McLarens.
	   Hakkinen started from the pole position and never lost the first
place except for during his only pit stop in the 45-lap race.
	   He covered the 307.022-kilometer (190.774-mile) race distance in
one hour, 20 minutes, 47.984 seconds.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard of Britain came in
second, to repeat the finish from the Austrian Grand Prix one week
ago.
	   For McLaren, it was the seventh victory of the season and the
fifth time Hakkinen and Coulthard finished 1-2, in that order.
Coulthard has also won one race.
	   On the high-speed 6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) circuit, the McLarens
simply outclassed the field, powered by their Mercedes engines.
	   For Mercedes, it was the first Formula One home victory since
1954.
	   Defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve of Canada posted his
best finish of the season by coming in third in his Williams.
	   Former champion Damon Hill of Britain also had his best result
of the year by finishing fourth in his Jordan.

Japanese professor calls for grassroots movement

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese professor called for a grassroots
movement against nuclear weapons on Sunday at the opening session
of the 1998 World conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.
	   Ikuro Anzai, professor of Ritsumeikan University, made the
comments in the keynote speech before 300 peace activists from 21
nations in the western Japan city of Hiroshima, the site of the
first atomic bombing.
	   ``I am confident that the very first step for changing the world
can be made when we reflect on global issues at a human level and
raise our voices from local communities, workplaces and school
campuses, calling for an international treaty for the total ban and
elimination of nuclear weapons,'' Anzai said.
	   During the three-day session, activists will discuss ways to
abolish nuclear weapons by the 21st century, said a Japanese
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Attending the meeting were activists from New Zealand,
Australia, Marshal islands, Palau, Polynesia, Philippines, Vietnam,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Kazakstan, Russia,
Norway, France, Britain, Canada, the United States, Cuba and Japan.
	   About 140,000 people were killed by the atomic bomb dropped on
Hiroshima by the U.S. on Aug. 6, 1945 and 70,000 more people were
killed by a bomb dropped three days later in Nagasaki. Japan
surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945.

England selectors name unchanged team for series decider
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England cricket selectors have stuck with a
winning formula for the fifth and deciding test against South
Africa at Headingly starting Thursday.
	   Selectors announced the team Sunday, keeping the same 12-man
team which beat South Africa by eight wickets in the fourth test at
Trent Bridge last week and levelled the series 1-1.
	   Leg-spinner Ian Salisbury was considered lucky to retain his
place in the 12 after an ordinary performance with the ball in the
fourth test after he replaced off-spinner Robert Croft.
	   Croft _ who batted for 190 minutes and scored an unbeaten 37 to
help England salvage a draw in the third test and prevent South
Africa from taking an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series _ was again
bypassed by selectors.
	   England chairman of selectors David Graveney suggested he did
not want to tempt fate by changing the winning combination.
	   ``Sometimes you make changes and they don't work. Twelve months
ago at Trent Bridge we did just that and lost heavily but now we've
played well and won,'' he said.
	   Although, England could change tactics and go into the match
without a spinner in favor of a four-pronge seamer attack.
	   If the conditions are suitable, left-arm seamer Alan Mullally is
expected to be elevated from 12th man duties into the starting side
at the expense of Salisbury.
	   England has not won a five-test series on home soil since
beating Australia 3-1 to claim the Ashes in 1985.

Cigarette lighter saves Israeli soldier's leg

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli soldier says his smoking habit
helped save his leg.
	   The soldier was shot in the leg last week by Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon. Although the bullet penetrated his
leg, it didn't go far because his cigarette lighter absorbed much
of its force.
	   A smiling Marcus Zanona, 20, showed reporters on Sunday the
lighter with a bullet hole in it. ``It was in my pocket, and I
think it saved my leg,'' he said.
	   The soldier is recovering at a hospital in northern Israel.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Monster traffic jams clogged Spain's
highways this weekend as vacationers clogged the roads, forming
bumper-to-bumper caravans up to 50 kilometers (30 miles) long.
	   The worst nightmare came Saturday morning for Madrid residents
fleeing southeast to beaches in the Valencia region at the start of
their August vacation.
	   The drive to the city of Valencia normally takes about three
hours, but this time it was six, due in part to a 50-kilometer
stretch of stop-and-go traffic just outside Madrid.
	   Officials reported another bottleneck of 16 kilometers (10
miles) in Cuenca province, also on the way to Valencia, on
Saturday.
	   They said traffic was flowing smoothly Sunday but that the mass
exodus had seen 18 accidents that left a total of 20 people dead.

Strong quake hits central Philippine provinces, causing minor

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.7 struck several central Philippine provinces early
Sunday, causing cracks in houses and canned goods to tumble off
store shelves, officials said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, officials said.
	   The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the
quake, which struck at 5:21 a.m. (2121 GMT), was centered at sea
about 13 kilometers (8 miles) northeast of Masbate town in the
central island province of Masbate.
	   A local police officer said some Masbate town residents ran from
their homes in fright after the temblor caused canned goods to
tumble off shelves and knocked out power for 10 minutes.
	   Jess Vargas of the institute said the earthquake was caused by a
movement in the Philippine Fault and was followed by several milder
aftershocks. The fault runs off-shore along the country's eastern
coast.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions of the world.

U.S. Navy ships visit China in sign of closer military ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A pair of U.S. Navy ships arrived at the northern
Chinese port of Qingdao on Sunday in a sign of growing contacts
between the two nation's militaries.
	   The USS Blue Ridge, the flagship of the U.S. 7th Fleet, and the
guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain began a four visit to
the northern port city, the fourth call at a mainland Chinese port
by U.S. ships since the resumption of such visits in 1995.
	   Zhang Defa, commander of China's northern fleet, told a
welcoming ceremony the visit would ``add a new chapter'' to
exchanges between the U.S. Navy and China's People's Liberation
Army Navy, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The visit is an ``indication of that relations between the two
countries and two armies are improving,'' it quoted 7th Fleet
Commander Vice Admiral Robert Natter responding.
	   Visits to Chinese ports by U.S. ships were frozen following
China's violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in 1989.
	   Relations grew tense again in 1996, when China launched missile
tests and war games near Taiwan in a bid to intimidate supporters
of the island's independence. Washington stationed two aircraft
carrier battle groups near Taiwan as a warning to China, and the
two navies found themselves operating in dangerously close
proximity to each other.
	   China considers Taiwan a break away province to be reunited with
by force if necessary.
	   Also Sunday, Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian met with his
Laotian counterpart, Choumali Saignakon in Kunming city, the
capital of Yunnan province which borders Laos to the north, Xinhua
reported.
	   Chi pledged to strengthen friendship and cooperation between the
two communist nations and their armed forces.

Divers find black boxes, more bodies, of two planes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Navy divers have recovered the black boxes
of a commuter plane and a Cessna that collided last week off
France's Atlantic coast, killing 15 people, officials said Sunday.
	   Three more bodies also were recovered Saturday, and only one
remained missing.
	   The black boxes of the Beechcraft and Cessna that collided on
Thursday off Brittany were found Saturday night and transferred to
Paris for analysis, said Gerard Brout, maritime police commander.
	   A Navy minesweeper located three more bodies near the sunken
wreckage of the Beechcraft, which belonged to Proteus Airlines, a
commuter line, Brout said.
	   The search for the remaining body continued on Sunday.
	   The Beechcraft, with 12 passengers and two crew members aboard,
collided with the Cessna when the Proteus pilot shifted course to
fly over an ocean liner during a commercial flight from Lyon to
Lorient, a coastal city near Quiberon. Only one person was aboard
the Cessna.
	   Proteus Airlines president Franklin Devaux said last week that
the pilot apparently did not obey flight procedures by detouring to
give passengers a better look at the oceanliner the Norway.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector traveled
to Baghdad Sunday to determine progress in Iraq's disarmament
efforts, the key to lifting eight years of U.N. sanctions.
	   Richard Butler arrived on the eighth anniversary of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, and Baghdad newspapers marked the occasion by
accusing Kuwait of working with the West to maintain the sanctions.
	   Butler will begin talks with Iraqi officials Monday. He
expressed hope that the discussions would ``bear good results,''
the official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as saying on his arrival
at Habaniya military airport, 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of
Baghdad.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it must do to comply with U.N. resolutions
that call for the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that devastating trade
sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its Aug. 2, 1990, invasion,
which set off the 1991 Gulf War, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify the weapons have been eliminated.
	   Butler was accompanied by 19 specialists, including Nikita
Smidovich, the chief U.N. missile investigator, and Scott Ritter,
an American who has angered Iraq with unannounced inspections.
	   Iraq's Parliament has scheduled a special session Monday to
review Iraq's relations with the U.N. inspectors and to discuss
power shortages that have plagued the country in recent weeks.
	   On Sunday, Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath party,
said in an editorial that Kuwait was to blame for the invasion.
	   It accused it of provoking the invasion by producing over its
OPEC quota, thus driving down prices at a time Iraq was trying to
recover from its 1980-88 war with Iran.
	   It said Kuwait has become a servant of the West.
	   ``Kuwait is an American base,'' Al-Thawra said, referring to
U.S. troops stationed there. ``The rulers are hiding behind the
borders of the Security Council, supplying the agents and
mercenaries with what they need to plot against our country.''
	   Babil, a daily owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai,
said in its editorial that Kuwait, in alliance with Western powers,
has used its resources to make war on Iraq and ``to bribe this
international official or that to prolong the sanctions.''
	   Kuwait has said that sanctions _ including an air travel ban and
limits on oil sales _ should not be lifted until Iraq accounts for
some 600 Kuwaitis and foreign nations missing since the invasion.
	   Kuwaiti Information Minister Yousef al-Sumait, on a visit to
Cairo, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Sunday that ``Kuwait
is the country that was attacked and, as such, when there are
initiatives (for reconciliation), they should come from the
attacker, not the country that was attacked.''
	   He said his country ``is not responsible for what happens in
Iraq,'' which are the result of U.N. sanctions.

Hakkinen wins German Grand Prix

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of Finland overcame
late engine problems and captured the German Grand Prix on Sunday
to move closer to his first Formula One championship.
	   Hakkinen led for virtually all the race in his McLaren-Mercedes
to clinch his second straight victory and his sixth of the season.
	   The Finn extended his lead in the drivers standings to 16 points
over, Michael Schumacher, who finished fifth. There are five races
left in the season.
	   ``There are still plenty of races left and anything can
happen,'' Hakkinen said. ``You have to keep pushing and go flat out
and that's what I intend to do.''
	   After his worst qualifying performance of the season when he had
only the ninth fastest time, Schumacher did well to finish in the
points. But he was unable to challenge the McLarens.
	   Hakkinen started from the pole position and never lost the first
place except for during his only pit stop in the 45-lap race.
	   He covered the 307.022-kilometer (190.774-mile) race distance in
one hour, 20 minutes, 47.984 seconds.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard of Britain came in
second, 0.427 seconds behind, to repeat the finish from the
Austrian Grand Prix one week ago.
	   ``It's fantastic to finish 1-2,'' Hakkinen said.
	   The Finn said he was worried at the end of the race because his
car suddenly started losing power.
	   ``My car was just losing performance, some oil was leaking
too,'' he said.
	   For McLaren, it was the seventh victory of the season and the
fifth time Hakkinen and Coulthard finished 1-2, in that order.
Coulthard has also won one race.
	   Coulthard said he he could hardly see in the last few laps
because of the leakage from Hakkinen's car.
	   ``I don't think I really could have had a go at him. There was
too much at stake,'' Coulthard said.
	   On the high-speed 6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) circuit, the McLarens
simply outclassed the field, powered by their Mercedes engines.
	   For Mercedes, it was the first Formula One home victory since
1954.
	   Defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve of Canada posted his
best finish of the season by coming in third in his Williams.
	   ``I was trying to put pressure on the McLarens and I noticed
that Mika was having some problems. But then something broke in my
car as well and I had to slow down,'' Villeneuve said.
	   ``But we kept pace with them and it's good to be on the
podium,'' said the Canadian, who was 2.5 seconds behind Hakkinen.
	   Former champion Damon Hill of Britain also had his best result
of the year by finishing fourth in his Jordan.
	   The younger Schumacher brother, Ralf, was sixth, also in a
Jordan,
	   Ralf Schumacher was third after the start but he opted for two
pit stops and dropped back.

Gillespie joins Gascoigne at Middlesbrough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Northern Ireland international
Keith Gillespie has signed a five-year 3.5 million pound (dlrs 5.75
million) deal to join Middlesbrough.
	   Gillespie left Newcastle to partner ex-England star Paul
Gascoigne in midfield for Middlesbrough.
	   The deal was subject to a medical on Sunday but the 23-year-old
was expected to link with his new team for training on Tuesday.
	   The signing was a boost for Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson
after Italian World Cup winger Francesco Moriero rejected a 5
million pound (dlrs 8.2 million) offer to join Boro from AC Milan
last Thursday.
	   Gillespie played at Manchester United before moving to Newcastle
in 1995 but his contract at St James' Park was due to run out this
season.
	   Robson described Gillespie as a first-class winger.
	   ``He's just the sort of player I was looking to add to our
squad,'' he said.
	   Gillespie is Middlesbrough's third major signing of the summer
following the arrival of defenders Gary Pallister and Dean Gordon.
	   Argentine full-back Gustavo Lombardi, 22, has joined Boro on
loan from River Plate and will play until the end of December.

	   Butler was accompanied by 19 specialists, including Nikita
Smidovich, the chief U.N. missile investigator, and Scott Ritter,
an American who has angered Iraq with unannounced inspections.
	   Iraq's Parliament has scheduled a special session Monday to
review Iraq's relations with the U.N. inspectors and to discuss
power shortages that have plagued the country in recent weeks.
	   On Sunday, Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath party,
said in an editorial that Kuwait was to blame for the invasion.
	   It accused it of provoking the invasion by producing oil over
its OPEC quota, thus driving down prices at a time Iraq was trying
to recover from its 1980-88 war with Iran.
	   It also said Kuwait was a servant of the West.
	   ``Kuwait is an American base,'' Al-Thawra said, referring to
U.S. troops stationed there. ``The rulers are hiding behind the
borders of the Security Council, supplying the agents and
mercenaries with what they need to plot against our country.''
	   Babil, a daily owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai,
said in its editorial that Kuwait, in alliance with Western powers,
has used its resources to make war on Iraq and ``to bribe this
international official or that to prolong the sanctions.''
	   Kuwait has said that sanctions _ including an air travel ban and
limits on oil sales _ should not be lifted until Iraq accounts for
some 600 Kuwaitis and foreign nationals missing since the invasion.
	   Kuwaiti Information Minister Yousef al-Sumait, on a visit to
Cairo, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Sunday that ``Kuwait
is the country that was attacked and, as such, when there are
initiatives (for reconciliation), they should come from the
attacker, not the country that was attacked.''
	   He said his country ``is not responsible for what happens in
Iraq,'' as a result of U.N. sanctions.

China's Yin wins second gold; Kaouch triumphs in men's 1,500
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANNECY, France (AP) _ Lili Yin of China claimed her second gold
medal of the World Junior Championships Sunday when she won the
5,000 meters.
	   Yin, an 18-year-old from Liaoning province, lifted gold in the
3,000 meter race Thursday, and had little trouble in the 5,000,
crossing the line in 15 minutes 29.65 seconds, nearly five seconds
ahead of silver medalist Faith Jemutai of Kenya.
	   On the final day of the junior games another Chinese athlete,
Lan Lixin, won the women's 1,500 meter race.
	   Lixin, the reigning Asian junior 3,000 meter champion and the
second fastest junior of all time at 5,000, posted a time of
4:10.05, easily beating Yimenashu Taye of Ethiopia into second
place.
	   In the other women's final Sunday, Julie Pratt of Britain won
the 100 meter hurdle.
	   In the men's events, there was a surprise in the 1,500 meters as
Morocco's Adil Kaouch won gold ahead of Kenya's Benjamin Kipkurui,
the African champion at 800 and 1,500 meters.
	   In the 110 meter hurdle, 1997 European junior silver medalist
Stanislav Olijar of Latvia won impressively ahead of U.S. runner
Sharif Paxton.
	   Britain's David Parker won the javelin gold with a throw of
72.85 meters.

Border incident prompts Chechen protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with gang seizing arms, freeing prisoners from police
post

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya filed a formal protest against the
Russian government Sunday, accusing Russian troops of firing on
Chechen territory for four hours a day earlier, a news agency
reported.
	   The protest came a day after Chechnya's president and Russia's
premier held an unusual meeting to smooth over relations between
Moscow and the separatist Muslim republic.
	   Chechen officials accused Russian troops of opening fire early
Saturday from a border post in Dagestan's Kargalinsky Dam region,
which neighbors on Chechnya, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The report quoted the document, which accused the Russians of
firing on Chechnya from 2:40 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. using ``rifles,
high-caliber firearms and armored vehicles.''
	   However, the NTV network, citing Russian Interior Ministry
officials, gave a conflicting account.
	   The NTV report said a gunfight was triggered after Russian
troops refused Friday evening to let a Chechen man cross the border
without documents. The man and several companions left, threatening
violence.
	   Shortly after midnight, the checkpoint was fired upon. Russian
troops returned fire and the shootout continued on and off until 7
a.m.
	   Efforts to confirm the reports were unsuccessful. Spokesmen for
Russia's Foreign and Interior Ministries could not confirm Sunday
that a protest had been filed. They also declined to confirm the
news reports or provide information about the incident.
	   Violence continues to keep Chechnya on edge. On Sunday, a gang
of 40 people raided a police post in northwestern Chechnya, freeing
three criminal suspects from jail and seizing dozens of rifles and
other guns, Chechen Prosecutor General Khavazh Serbiyev said,
according to Interfax. Police have launched a search, Serbiyev
said.

Israel's Holocaust memorial: remove crosses at Auschwitz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial demanded
Sunday that Polish authorities immediately remove dozens of wooden
crosses put up by Polish Catholics outside the former Auschwitz
death camp.
	   A statement from Yad Vashem called the erection of the crosses a
``provocative act'' by ``extreme groups.''
	   Yad Vashem said the act violated an agreement reached earlier
this year by the Israeli memorial, the U.S. Holocaust Museum in
Washington and Polish government and church authorities,
``according to which no religious, ideological or political symbols
would be erected on the site.''
	   ``The placing of the crosses, after special efforts have been
made to reduce tensions, may aggravate the situation and may
prevent further dialogue between the sides about the future of the
site,'' the statement said.
	   No response was available Sunday from Polish officials.
	   Last week, several dozen Catholics from Silesia placed a
three-meter (10-foot) cross and about 50 smaller ones outside the
walls of the camp.
	   The wooden crosses surround an 8-meter (26-foot) cross erected
outside the camp to commemorate a 1979 papal Mass. Jewish groups
have said the large cross, which is visible from the former death
camp, disturbs the memory of the 1.5 million Jews who died there.
	   Yad Vashem director Avner Shalev said Sunday that the placement
of the new crosses was ``a clear provocation'' that was ``very
painful for any member of the Jewish people and many others.''
	   ``I'm really worried that this kind of provocation will bring
other attacks,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Shalev said he hoped government and church officials in Poland
would act immediately to remove the crosses.
	   ``Everyone agrees and understands that Auschwitz should be kept
in the authentic way that it was left,'' he said.
	   Shalev said Auschwitz was a symbol to the world ``of the
infinity of evil that has been inflicted by human beings.''
	   The agreement reached earlier this year between Polish
authorities and Jewish groups did not resolve the dispute over
whether the papal cross should be left at the site.

Governing party hopes for sweep in Mexican gubernatorial elections

<TEXT>
	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In an important test of its clout
less than two years before presidential balloting, Mexico's ruling
party battled Sunday to retain three governorships and prove it can
win truly competitive elections.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party was favored to win easily
in the gulf coast state of Veracruz and hold off a challenge from
the center-left Democratic Revolution Party in Oaxaca in the
southwest.
	   But it faced a strong challenge in Aguascalientes, a small and
relatively prosperous central state, where polls showed its
candidate, Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, in a virtual tie with
Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of the center-right National Action Party.
	   The three main parties are looking to this year's 10
gubernatorial elections to gain momentum ahead of the 2000
presidential race. The opposition hopes to wrest the presidency
from the governing party, known as the PRI, which has dominated
Mexican politics throughout its 69-year history.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of the three gubernatorial
elections last month, recapturing the governor's seat in Chihuahua
it had lost in 1992 to National Action.
	   With its loss in Chihuahua _ and following a weak showing in the
Mexico City race _ National Action needed a win in Aguascalientes,
its best chance of capturing a governor's seat this year.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes, which has recently become more urban and middle
class. The party controls the mayoral seat in the capital and has a
majority in the local congress.
	   For the PRI, a win in Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as
essential. With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's
third-largest electorate and could be crucial in the presidential
election.
	   The PRI candidate, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and son
of a former president, has united a fractured state party that
suffered heavy losses in last year's municipal elections. A strong
showing Sunday could make Aleman a top contender for the PRI's
presidential nomination, although he has insisted he's not
interested in it.
	   In Oaxaca, Democratic Revolution Party candidate Hector Sanchez
made gains on the PRI candidate, Jose Nelson Murat Casab, but
wasn't expected to overtake him.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia claimed it captured the stronghold of warlord Rashid Dostum
on Sunday, putting it on the doorstep of the main headquarters of
the opposition coalition.
	   Spokesman Abdul Hay Muttmayan, speaking from Taliban
headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, had few details on
the battle for Shebergan.
	   A day earlier, the Taliban claimed to be just 100 kilometers (60
miles) across flat desert from the town where Dostum had assembled
an arsenal of tanks, fighter jets and other equipment.
	   Azizullah Shasaq, a spokesman for the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia,
one of Dostum's partners, confirmed Shebergan had fallen. Shasaq
said Dostum had retreated south to the nearby town of Saritul and
reported by satellite phone late Sunday that he had suffered few
casualties and that fighting continued.
	   Mullah Omar, another Taliban spokesman, said his fighters had
captured numerous opposition soldiers, but he had no figures.
	   The next Taliban target is likely to be the key city of
Mazar-e-Sharif, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Shebergan.
	   Omar said Taliban fighters were already making gains around
Mazar-e-Sharif. Shasaq said Mazar-e-Sharif was calm.

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. airman shopping off base because a
strike at Incirlik air base has shut down stores there was
assaulted in the parking lot of a supermarket here, U.S. military
officials said Sunday.
	   The airman was attacked from behind by at least four persons
while unlocking his vehicle Saturday. He was thrown to the ground,
kicked and punched, said Capt. Max Torrens, spokeswoman for
Incirlik airbase. The man's wife, three-year daughter and a friend
were with him.
	   The assailants ran away when crowds began to form outside the
supermarket. ``He sustained non-life threatening injuries,''
Torrens added, declining to identify the airman.
	   But police in Adana identified him as Robert Rodriguez. His
hometown was not immediately known.
	   Incirlik will increased security outside grocery stores the
personnel are allowed to shop in to avoid any possible further
attacks, Torrens said.
	   Military personnel have been forced to use grocery stores in
Adana since a strike shut down most facilities on base.
	   Incirlik, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of Adana, is
home to ``Operation Northern Watch,'' which patrols the no-fly zone
north of the 36th parallel in northern Iraq. More than 45 U.S. and
British planes monitor Iraq's treatment of the Kurds there.
	   The strike, begun July 23 by 1,400 Turkish employees of U.S.
military facilities, has disrupted dining halls, laundry services
and military taxis at bases in three cities.
	   Strikers are demanding better pay and fringe benefits.
	   An Adana police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said n investigation was being carried out to catch the assailants.
He would not speculate on the likely cause of the attack.

India claims 5 new deaths from Pakistani shelling at border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Five Indian civilians were killed in
Pakistani shelling Sunday as the rival armies resumed the
four-day-old artillery exchange along their disputed border in
Kashmir after a brief lull, officials said.
	   Three people including two women were killed in the Uri region
of the Jammu-Kashmir frontier and two men were killed near
Baramulla town, United News of India said quoting an official
spokesman.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations became independent in 1947. It is divided between them by
the 400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control monitored by the
United Nations. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir.
	   The shelling had stopped Sunday morning in several border
positions but resumed in the evening, the spokesman said, adding
that the Indian toll in four days of fierce firing had risen to 34
with Sunday's deaths.
	   Pakistan had on Saturday accused Indian troops of unleashing
mortars in the disputed territory of Kashmir in a three-day
face-off that killed a reported 85 Pakistanis.
	   Majeed Malik, the Pakistani minister in charge of Kashmir
policy, said Saturday that 37 soldiers and 48 civilians were killed
in Indian shelling that he said was part of New Delhi's plan to
derail the possible resumption of peace talks to end 50 years of
hostility. Those talks failed. but India denied the allegation.
	   In Pakistan on Sunday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accused India
of bringing the region to the brink of war with its artillery
barrage.
	   ``New Delhi will be responsible for war in South Asia if Indians
continue ... killing innocent Kashmiris,'' he told reporters in
Lahore.
	   Exchanges of mortar and gunfire in Kashmir are almost a daily
occurrence, but casualties of the magnitude of the past week are
rare. In September, at least 39 people died in a similar increase
of tension.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors want to wrap up
their work ``as soon as possible'' so the United Nations can
consider lifting sanctions, the chief inspector said Sunday.
	   Richard Butler arrived in Baghdad on the eighth anniversary of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to determine progress in Iraq's
disarmament efforts. Baghdad newspapers marked the occasion by
accusing Kuwait of working with the West to maintain the sanctions.
	   Butler will begin talks with Iraqi officials Monday.
	   ``Our steadfast aim is to get this done as soon as possible to
get to the end of the disarmament phase so the Security Council can
consider the sanctions issue,'' Butler said in Baghdad.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it must do to comply with U.N. resolutions
that call for the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
On Sunday, he called the plan ``an accelerated program of work.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that devastating trade
sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its Aug. 2, 1990, invasion,
which set off the 1991 Gulf War, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify the weapons have been eliminated.
	   Butler was accompanied by 19 specialists, including Nikita
Smidovich, the chief U.N. missile investigator, and Scott Ritter,
an American who has angered Iraq with unannounced inspections.
	   Iraq's Parliament has scheduled a special session Monday to
review Iraq's relations with the U.N. inspectors and to discuss
power shortages that have plagued the country in recent weeks.
	   On Sunday, Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath party,
said in an editorial that Kuwait was to blame for the invasion.
	   It accused it of provoking the invasion by producing over its
OPEC quota, thus driving down prices at a time Iraq was trying to
recover from its 1980-88 war with Iran.
	   It said Kuwait has become a servant of the West.
	   ``Kuwait is an American base,'' Al-Thawra said, referring to
U.S. troops stationed there. ``The rulers are hiding behind the
borders of the Security Council, supplying the agents and
mercenaries with what they need to plot against our country.''
	   Babil, a daily owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai,
said in its editorial that Kuwait, in alliance with Western powers,
has used its resources to make war on Iraq and ``to bribe this
international official or that to prolong the sanctions.''
	   The embargo has devastated the country's oil-based economy. Iraq
blames the sanctions for widespread poverty, malnutrition and
illnesses that have mounted over the past eight years.
	   Kuwait has said that sanctions _ including an air travel ban and
limits on oil sales _ should not be lifted until Iraq accounts for
some 600 Kuwaitis and foreign nations missing since the invasion.
	   Kuwaiti Information Minister Yousef al-Sumait, on a visit to
Cairo, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Sunday that ``Kuwait
is the country that was attacked and, as such, when there are
initiatives (for reconciliation), they should come from the
attacker, not the country that was attacked.''
	   He said his country ``is not responsible for what happens in
Iraq,'' which are the result of U.N. sanctions.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors want to wrap up
their work ``as soon as possible'' so the United Nations can

Sharif says Indians must desist, or be responsible for war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Pakistan-Kashmir &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on
Sunday accused India of bringing the region to the brink of war
with its barrage of artillery fire in the disputed Kashmir region
in recent days.
	   Speaking to reporters, Sharif called on the international
community to pressure India to desist. Otherwise, he said, ``New
Delhi will be responsible for war in South Asia if Indians continue
... killing innocent Kashmiris.''
	   Pakistan says unprovoked firing from Indian-held Kashmir has
killed 48 villagers and 37 soldiers in Pakistani-held Kashmir over
the last four days. India said Pakistan started the exchange that
killed 34 Indians, mostly civilians.
	   The exchanges broke out as Sharif met his Indian counterpart
Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the Indian Ocean island of Sri Lanka. The
talks, the first since India and Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons
tests in May, failed to bring the two neighbors closer to peace.
	   Kashmir is at the heart of the Indo-Pakistani rivalry. They have
fought two wars over the Himalayan territory divided between them
since each gained independence from Britain in 1947.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
Albanian homes Sunday in what appeared to be a campaign to drive
ethnic Albanian civilians from part of Kosovo which had been under
rebel control.
	   Serb sources confirmed clashes in the Drenica area west of
Pristina 0ut blamed the Kosovo Liberation Army for starting it.
Serb sources said fighting erupted after rebels fired on police
checkpoints along the road between Pristina and Pec, which
government forces cleared last week.
	   Elsewhere, both Serb and Albanian sources also reported fighting
Sunday in the Djakovica area southeast of Pristina. Again, each
side the other started it.
	   In southwestern Kosovo, police used 20-milimeter anti-aircraft
weapons to fire on houses and KLA fighters in the village of
Prilep. Police eventually drove guerrillas from the village,
located along the main highway in the area.
	   Albanian sources also reported fierce shelling near Junik and
other rebel-controlled villages near the Albanian border. The
report could not be confirmed.
	   The new fighting raged despite promises last week by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that his latest offensive against the
KLA was over. The offensive delivered a strong blow against
independence-seeking Albanian rebels and drove tens of thousands of
civilians from their homes.
	   The rebels are expected to announce this week whether they will
endorse a U.S.-plan for peace talks between Milosevic and Albanian
politicians led by Ibrahim Rugova, whom the KLA had rejected
because of his non-violent stand.
	   In a lengthy commentary Sunday, the government's Tanjug news
agency said the ``efficient action'' by Serb forces had ``almost
entirely broken down terrorist gangs of the so-called Liberation
Army of Kosovo.''
	   On Sunday, explosions from mortar fire could be heard Sunday
near this village where the KLA maintains its headquarters. The
blasts grew ever louder, indicating the Serbs were on the march.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, convoys of panicked refugees fled
by foot, tractor or car along rocky dirt roads. There were headed
toward Likovac, where they hoped to find KLA protection.
	   Many said they had no where else to go. All told the same story
of Serb destruction, credible in its simplicity and consistency:
Serbs fired indiscriminately at the villages; terrified civiliand
gathered family members together and fled for their lives, leaving
behind all their possessions.
	   Serb troops them moved into the villages, looted anything of
value they could find, doused the homes with gasoline and set them
afire.
	   ``My house was burned today,'' Sanje Berisha, 33, sobbed as she
and about 100 others sheltered in a courtyard of a house near
Likovac.
	   The tactics were reminiscent of the campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' or the forced removal of rival ethnic groups, which
marked brutal conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia _ which had been part
of Yugoslavia.
	   At Likovac, a dusty, hilltop cluster of a dozen buildings around
a rockey open square, a KLA commander boasted that ``we have not
been defeated'' and that ``Serb attacks only make us stronger.''
	   But other KLA members, who refused to give their names for fear
of punishment by their commanders, admitted that they have been
unable to blunt the Serb advance and protect Albanian villages.
	   ``We are underarmed and we cannot defend them,'' one rebel said
of the dozen villages in the area which have come under Serb attack
since Milosevic declared the offensive over.
	   Despite reports last month that the rebels were receiving heavy
weapons, none were in sight. KLA fighters were carrying mostly
rifles and machine guns _ ineffective against government tanks,
armored personnel carriers, mortars and artillery.
	   Although Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million Kosovo
population, the province is part of Serbia, which along with
Montenegro forms Yugoslavia. Milosevic has promised to restore
autonomy which he withdrew in 1989.
	   But he and the major powers oppose independence, as demanded by
the KLA and most Kosovo Albanian leaders, fearing it would spread
the ethnic conflict to other Balkan countries with large Albanian
communities.

	   CHINARI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani farmer Syed Mushtaq Hussain
waited until darkness provided some cover from Indian gunners
across the border, then he picked his way along the narrow mountain
paths to safety.
	   Hussain said Sunday he had to retrace the rugged route from this
town _ roads are closed because they are easy targets for the
Indians. His mother and cousin, both hit by shell fragments the day
before, were waiting for him in his village on the Kashmiri front
line.
	   ``We cannot bring them here because there is no transport,''
said Hussain, his words rushed with fear. ``I've just come to get
medicine and bandages.''
	   Villagers on both sides of Kashmir have borne the brunt of days
of military gunfire that India and Pakistan accuse each other of
starting. Pakistani military sources, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said five more villagers were killed by
Indian shells or bullets Saturday, bringing the civilian total in
four days to 48.
	   Indian army officials counter that 34 Indians, most of them
civilians, were killed by Pakistani forces.
	   Military officials said firing subsided after a two-hour
bombardment early Sunday morning of Chokoti, a village of mud and
brick houses scattered in a valley at the border less than 10
kilometers (6 miles) from Chinari. No one was hurt, because most of
Chokoti's 20,000 small farmers and herders had fled, leaving behind
crumbled houses and businesses and blackened corn fields.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the
Himalayan territory now divided between them, since each gained
independence from colonial Britain in 1947. Spurts of artillery and
mortar fire are common across the region that both India and
Pakistan claim in its entirety, although the exchanges that erupted
the middle of last week were unusually heavy.
	   ``The Indians are bombing the civilians. They're not targeting
the army positions,'' farmer Hussain said.
	   Many villages lie in a no-man's land between Indian and
Pakistani artillery. Pakistani officials also charge that India is
trying to terrorize villagers so they won't shelter and feed Muslim
militants who sneak across the border to join a separatist uprising
in Indian-held Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority province in
predominately Hindu India.
	   India accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of arming and training
the militants, but Pakistani officials say they provide only moral
support. Muslim militants were accused of killing four Hindus
Friday in a remote, mountainous area of Indian-held Kashmir. In two
incidents earlier last week, gunmen stormed into houses in the
region and sprayed the occupants with bullets, killing a total of
16 Hindus and wounding five others.
	   The attacks on Hindu villages may have prompted the firing,
though Pakistani officials claim the shelling was aimed at
undermining peace talks their prime minister had with his Indian
counterpart last week. The talks, seen as particularly urgent
because both India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in May, were
declared a failure on Friday.
	   Returning to Pakistan Sunday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
accused India of bringing the region to the brink of war and called
on the international community to pressure New Delhi to desist.
	   Whatever the cause, the effect of the latest firing has been
devastating. Scores of Pakistani families walked away from border
villages Sunday morning, driving herds of buffalo or goats before
them and carrying a few belongings in suitcases or bundled in cloth
on their heads.
	   Displaced families overwhelmed Chinari, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northwest of Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani-held Kashmir.
	   Salima, who uses one name only, said her house was destroyed and
her family's cattle killed in the bombardment, and her 6-year-old
daughter was hit in the shoulder by a bullet. Her daughter was
being treated in Chinari's small hospital, while the rest of the
family stayed in a school.
	   Some Chinari residents opened their brick or mud homes to
strangers or collected money to buy food for them. Some survivors
had fled with nothing, saying entire villages were set ablaze by
Indian shells.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Skating with emotion and enthusiasm,
Russia's world champion ice dance team of Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov won the Goodwill Games gold medal Saturday night.
	   Attracted by cut-rate dlrs 5 upper level seats, the largest
Nassau Coliseum crowd of the games cheered Krylova and Ovsiannikov
through their energetic free dance, which earned two perfect
scores.
	   Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were among
the fans, sitting next to Goodwill Games creator Ted Turner and his
wife, Jane Fonda.
	   The silver medal went to another Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva
and Ilia Averbukh, with Elena Grushina and Rusian Goncharov of
Ukraine taking the bronze.
	   Later Saturday night, Olympic silver medalist Michelle Kwan went
for the Goodwill gold in the women's final.
	   It was the second straight major international title for the
Russians, who live and train in Newark, Del. They won the world
championship in March after six straight second-place finishes in
European, world and Olympic competitions dating back to 1996.
	   Skating to Bizet's ``Carmen,'' Krylova and Ovsiannikov were the
last pair of the night and dazzled the near-capacity crowd.
	   The couple, who have been skating together since May 1994 and
are coached by 1980 Olympic champions Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi
Karponosov, received two perfect 6.0 scores for presentation from
the Austrian and Russian judges.
	   Teen-agers Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler represented the
United States and were crowd favorites, even though they received
no mark higher than 5.5 and finished fourth and last.

Saudi King Fahd to undergo medical checkup

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
will undergo medical tests after suffering an undisclosed illness,
diplomats in Saudi Arabia said Sunday.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, will be admitted to the King Faisal
Specialist Hospital in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, the diplomats
said on condition of anonymity.
	   The king will be flown from the Red Sea city of Jiddah to Riyadh
later Sunday, the diplomats said by telephone.
	   Last week's Cabinet session was chaired by Crown Prince
Abdullah, not Fahd, who usually heads the weekly meetings.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to Abdullah, his half-brother.
	   The crown prince is known to be far less pro-American than Fahd
and has been critical of Washington's support for Israel. He
essentially remains in command following the stroke that left Fahd
with short-term memory loss and the inability to concentrate for
any stretch of time.
	   Fahd, who is the head of the world's largest oil-producing
nation, has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   Since the stroke, Fahd has used a wheelchair and is able to take
a few steps or stand to meet visitors only with the help of a cane.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

Chechen presidents visits Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who
has been seeking support for Chechnya's recognition as an
independent state, arrived in Turkey Sunday for a four-day visit.
	   Speaking to reporters, Maskhadov would not spell out his agenda.
	   Chechnya maintains it is an independent country and runs its own
affairs since the end of the 1994-1996 Chechen war. But its
political status remains unresolved. Moscow and the rest of the
world treat the territory as part of Russia.
	   Although many here sympathize with largely Muslim Chechnya's
demands for independence, Turkey, which is fighting
autonomy-seeking Kurdish insurgents itself, does not recognize
Chechnya's independence.
	   Turkey has a Chechen community of about 25,000.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Romania is looking into the possibility
of modernizing old helicopters as an alternative to a purchasing
new ones from the United States, Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile said Sunday.
	   The first stop on Vasile's four-day visit to Israel was a tour
of Israel Aircraft Industries, which specializes in upgrading
American Cobra attack helicopters.
	   Vasile confirmed that Romania was considering renovating older
helicopters instead of going through with a controversial deal to
purchase American ones.
	   ``That is one of the main considerations'' for visiting IAI, he
said.
	   Vasile's Israel visit is to focus on economic cooperation
between the two countries. Conspicuously absent from his delegation
is Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, who has criticized the
government's plan to purchase 96 Dracula helicopters from the U.S.
manufacturer Bell Textron.
	   Daianu has refused to sign the dlrs 1.45 billion loan to
purchase the helicopters because it would cripple Romania's weak
economy.
	   Asked about the Bell Textron deal, Vasile said it was ``not
final.''
	   He said he had invited three teams from IAI to Romania in
December to discuss several projects, which he did not elaborate
on.
	   During his tour of IAI, Vasile was greeted by a group of
Romanian workers who excitedly surrounded the prime minister and
shook his hand.
	   Some 60,000 Romanians work in Israel, mainly in construction,
earning salaries as much as 10 times higher than the average salary
in Romania.
	   He was shown the company's new Galaxy airplane and pilotless
drones, and both he and his wife posed for photographs in a Cobra
helicopter.
	   Vasile is scheduled to meet Monday with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Israel's Holocaust memorial: remove crosses at Auschwitz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Officials of Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial demanded Sunday that Polish authorities immediately remove
dozens of wooden crosses put up by Polish Catholics outside the
former Auschwitz death camp.
	   A statement from Yad Vashem called the erection of the crosses a
``provocative act'' by ``extreme groups.''
	   Yad Vashem said the act violated an agreement reached earlier
this year by the Israeli memorial, the U.S. Holocaust Museum in
Washington and Polish government and church authorities,
``according to which no religious, ideological or political symbols
would be erected on the site.''
	   ``The placing of the crosses, after special efforts have been
made to reduce tensions, may aggravate the situation and may
prevent further dialogue between the sides about the future of the
site,'' the statement said.
	   No response was available Sunday from Polish officials.
	   Last week, several dozen Catholics from Silesia placed a
three-meter (10-foot) cross and about 50 smaller ones outside the
walls of the camp.
	   The wooden crosses surround an 8-meter (26-foot) cross erected
outside the camp to commemorate a 1979 papal Mass. Jewish groups
have said the large cross, which is visible from the former death
camp, disturbs the memory of the 1.5 million Jews who died there.
	   Yad Vashem director Avner Shalev said Sunday that the placement
of the new crosses was ``a clear provocation'' that was ``very
painful for any member of the Jewish people and many others.''
	   ``I'm really worried that this kind of provocation will bring
other attacks,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Shalev said he hoped government and church officials in Poland
would act immediately to remove the crosses.
	   ``Everyone agrees and understands that Auschwitz should be kept
in the authentic way that it was left,'' he said.
	   Shalev said Auschwitz was a symbol to the world ``of the
infinity of evil that has been inflicted by human beings.''
	   The agreement reached earlier this year between Polish
authorities and Jewish groups did not resolve the dispute over the
papal cross.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The widow of a customs official killed in a car
bomb attack last week was herself gunned down and killed early
Sunday as she visited his grave, a news agency reported.
	   The widow, Said Emomnazarova, went to the cemetery in the
capital Dushanbe at about 5 a.m. to visit the new grave, according
to Muslim tradition, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Two masked gunmen opened fire on her, and she died shortly
thereafter at a hospital, the report said.
	   Her husband, deputy customs chief Ali Emomnazarov, was killed
Thursday when his car exploded just 100 meters (yards) from a
presidential residence.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for either attack.
	   ITAR-Tass said police and security officials are investigating
both killings. The report did not suggest a motive for either.
	   Tajikistan has been torn by violence since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. The government and mostly Islamic opposition formally
ended a five-year civil war last year, but sporadic clashes have
continued.
	   Four United Nations military observers were killed in an ambush
in mountainous eastern Tajikistan last month.

	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Italy's Marco Pantani won the Tour de
France on Sunday, a race likely to be best remembered for the
doping scandal that dogged it from the start.
	   Pantani, riding for the Mercatone Uno team, is the first Italian
to win the Tour since Felice Gimondi captured the top honor in
1965.
	   Tom Steels of Belgium took the 21st and final stage on the
Champs-Elysees in Paris.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, the defending champion, came in second
by 3:21, and American Bobby Julich came in third, at 4:08.
	   Pantani finished the 147-kilometer (91-mile) stage from Melun to
Paris in the pack.
	   Julich, riding with the French Cofidis team, became the second
American to finish in the top three, after three-time winner Greg
LeMond.

Albanians had been killed Sunday by Serb shelling of villages in
the Drenica area west of the provincial capital Pristina. The

Court overturns publishing ban criticized by journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Cairo court declared Sunday that a ban on
printing in Egypt's free-trade zones hurt free speech and would not
curb ``sensationalist journalism,'' court officials said.
	   In its ruling, the court reversed the ban imposed in April by
Egypt's Investment Authority. The decision, however, is largely
symbolic since the Cabinet rescinded the decree in May.
	   It does, however, provide publishers with a legal precedent
should the government attempt to impose a similar ban again, said
Hisham Qassem, publisher of the English-language Cairo Times.
	   The ban virtually shut down about 40 magazines and newspapers,
including Cairo Times, which had taken advantage of high-quality
printing and cheaper prices in the zones. Many were forced to print
abroad and then bring the copies into Egypt.
	   The ban came amid a crackdown on what officials described as
``sensationalist reporting'' that hurt Egypt's image, such as
publishing threats by Islamic militant groups. The crackdown
included the arrests of several journalists on charges of libel.
	   In its decision, the court said that ``sensationalist journalism
is not controlled by restricting the press,'' adding that it
``complicates the issue'' and runs counter to democracy.
	   The court said the printers operating in the free zone had not
violated any investment law and that their licenses were still
valid. Thus, it ruled, the ban was unconstitutional.
	   The plaintiffs, Sahar Printing and the International Printing
House, were not immediately available for comment.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
ethnic Albanian homes Sunday in what appeared to be a campaign to
drive ethnic Albanian civilians from part of Kosovo that had been
under rebel control.
	   Serb sources confirmed clashes in the Drenica area west of
Pristina, but said the fighting erupted only after rebels fired on
police checkpoints along the road between Pristina and Pec, which
government forces cleared last week.
	   Elsewhere, both Serb and Albanian sources also reported fighting
Sunday in the Djakovica area southeast of Pristina. Each side
accused the other of starting it.
	   In southwestern Kosovo, police used 20-millimeter anti-aircraft
weapons to fire on houses and Kosovo Liberation Army fighters in
the village of Prilep. Police eventually drove guerrillas from the
village, located along the main highway in the area.
	   Albanian sources also reported fierce shelling near Junik and
other rebel-controlled villages near the Albanian border. The
report could not be confirmed.
	   The new fighting raged despite promises last week by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that his latest offensive against the
KLA rebels was over. The offensive delivered a strong blow against
independence-seeking Albanian rebels and drove tens of thousands of
civilians from their homes.
	   The rebels are expected to announce this week whether they will
endorse a U.S.-plan for peace talks between Milosevic and Albanian
politicians led by Ibrahim Rugova, whom the KLA had rejected
because of his nonviolent stand.
	   Many ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, the stronger of two republics that form Yugoslavia. But
Serbs consider the province the cradle of their culture, and
Western powers prefer to see it remain part of Serbia, as border
changes in the Balkans often lead to further bloodshed.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants
of Kosovo.
	   In a lengthy commentary Sunday, the government's Tanjug news
agency said the ``efficient action'' by Serb forces had ``almost
entirely broken down terrorist gangs of the so-called Liberation
Army of Kosovo.''
	   Mortar fire could be heard Sunday near the village of Likovac,
where the KLA maintains its headquarters. The explosions grew
louder, indicating the Serbs were on the march.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, convoys of panicked refugees on
foot in tractors or cars headed toward Likovac, where they hoped to
find KLA protection.

Mandela helps Zulu king celebrate birthday

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In a scene unimaginable four
years ago, President Nelson Mandela has helped King Goodwill
Zwelethini, ceremonial leader of the rival Zulu people, celebrate
his 50th birthday in the seaport of Durban.
	   Mandela's African National Congress and the Zulu nationalist
Inkatha Freedom Party have waged a bitter power struggle that has
claimed more than 11,000 lives since the mid-1980s in KwaZulu-Natal
province.
	   Violence has returned with the approach of elections in 1999,
but the 40 people killed in political infighting in July
represented a fraction of the monthly tolls earlier this decade.
	   ``I am aware, Your Majesty, that there are sinister forces
fomenting war and mayhem among your people,'' Mandela said at the
party. ``They are determined to delay progress in the country.''
	   Shortly before 1994's first all-race elections that ended
apartheid, Mandela canceled a meeting with Zwelethini out of fear
for his safety in the lush coastal province.
	   Mandela reminded Saturday's gathering of steps being taken to
stop the current violence.
	   Last week, hundreds of additional troops and soldiers arrived in
the Richmond area, scene of most of the killings, to erect lights
over darkened areas and to patrol remote areas on horseback.
	   Zwelethini's uncle, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who represents the ANC, have also
been meeting about the clashes.
	   The most recent shootings are blamed on a simmering feud between
the ruling ANC and a new opposition party, the United Democratic
Movement, which has become a beacon for disaffected ANC supporters.
	   KwaZulu-Natal's 7 million Zulus are split in their support of
the three parties.
	   Buthelezi threatened to boycott the 1994 elections, insisting on
autonomy for KwaZulu Natal. But at the last minute he relented, and
his party won 10 percent of national Parliament seats and dominion
in the provincial government.

English soccer teams face ban for joining super league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Premier League giants Manchester United, Liverpool
and Arsenal could be banned from the Premiership if the clubs
joined a rebel European super league, English soccer's governing
body warned Sunday.
	   Football Association chairman Keith Wiseman said the proposed
super league would be an unsanctioned competition.
	   ``If it came into existence... I think clubs and players might
well find themselves excluded from a whole world of sanctioned
football,'' he told the BBC radio.
	   Wiseman also said a super league was destined for failure.
	   ``I don't think the fan in this country would have the slightest
interest in what would be exhibition games. It would be Harlem
Globetrotters stuff,'' he said.
	   ``People (will) tire of it. It's maybe interesting for a year
but it would fade away,'' he said.
	   FA chief executive Graham Kelly was quoted in the Mail on Sunday
newspaper saying the major clubs ``could not have it both ways.''
	   ``If they go outside the FA or UEFA, they risk being shut out of
the major competitions,'' he said.
	   Kelly said there was room for an organized competition, such as
a super league, but any breakaway competition was doomed without
the blessing of the world's major soccer bodies.
	   ``Clubs must understand that they can't set up a midweek
competition among themselves and still expect to be involved in the
traditional competitions,'' he said.
	   Speculation about a European super league involving high profile
teams from England, France, Italy, Germany and Holland has
increased since Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi added his
weight to the concept.
	   Berlusconi, chief of Italian Serie A club AC Milan, was quoted
in the Mail on Sunday saying the EUFA Champions League was an
``under performing asset'' and he could do better.
	   Rodolfo Hecht, believed to be the man Berlusconi wants to head a
super league competition, was reportedly in London for secret
meetings with top clubs last week.
	   However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said players
and managers had not been approached about any proposed super
league.
	   Ferguson, boss at Britain's most powerful soccer club, said he
did not support a super league and England's Premier League
competition must not be broken up.
	   ``When you assess English football, with all the traditional
teams and the great matches you can get, is there anybody who
really wants it changed?'' he told the News of the World newspaper.

Hakkinen wins German Grand Prix, extends Formula One lead

	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ In his greatest rival's home race,
Mika Hakkinen moved closer to clinching his first Formula One
championship.
	   Hakkinen overcame late engine problems and held off McLaren
teammate David Coulthard to capture the German Grand Prix on
Sunday.
	   The Finn's second straight victory and his sixth of the season
extended Hakkinen's lead in the drivers' standings to 16 points
over Michael Schumacher, who had to settle for fifth place in his
Ferrari.
	   ``There are still plenty of races left and anything can
happen,'' Hakkinen said. ``You have to keep pushing and go flat out
and that's what I intend to do.''
	   Defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve of Canada posted his
best finish of the season by coming in third in his Williams.
	   After his worst qualifying performance of the season that put
him only in the ninth place on the starting grid, Schumacher did
well to finish in the points.
	   But by picking up only two points for his fifth place,
Schumacher now faces an uphill battle to give Ferrari its first
drivers' championship since Jody Scheckter in 1979.
	   ``I am sorry that I was unable to do better in front of my home
crowd,'' Schumacher said. ``But after qualifying ninth and being
off the pace all weekend, there was no reason to expect a miracle
during the race.''
	   ``Finishing fifth was the best I could do,'' said the German, a
two-time champion who has won four races this season.
	   More than 100,000 fans still had something to cheer about.
	   The McLarens are powered by Mercedes engines and for Mercedes it
was the first victory in the home race since 1954. Mercedes had
quit racing for 30 years after one of its cars killed more than 80
people in Le Mans, France in 1955.
	   Hakkinen started from the pole and lost the lead only once
briefly following his one pit stop in the 45-lap race on the
high-speed 6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) circuit.
	   ``In the end, I was quite worried about the situation,''
Hakkinen said.
	   ``Jacques was pushing quite hard in third place and catching us.
There was some oil on the track and at the same time I started to
lose speed in the car. I was obviously concerned about all this,''
he said.
	   Hakkinen covered the 307.022-kilometer (190.774-mile) race
distance in one hour, 20 minutes, 47.984 seconds.
	   Although he was just 0.427 seconds behind at the finish,
Coulthard said he had no real chance of overtaking Hakkinen.
	   ``It may look like a walk in the park to anyone who is watching,
but believe me, when you are doing 350 kph (210 mph) into the
braking area while following another car and losing downforce, it's
very difficult,'' the Briton said.
	   Coulthard said oil leaking from Hakkinen's car impaired his
vision.
	   ``There is far too much at stake to go for glory and get it all
wrong. I don't need it for my championship and Mika doesn't need it
for his,'' said Coulthard, who is third in the standings with 42
points.
	   Hakkinen has 76 and Schumacher 60, with five races left. A
victory is worth 10 points.
	   Villeneuve said he tried to close in when he noticed Hakkinen
struggling over the last couple of laps.
	   ``I was trying to put pressure on the McLarens and I noticed
that Mika was having some problems. But then something broke in my
car as well and I had to slow down,'' Villeneuve said.
	   ``But we kept pace with them and it's good to be on the
podium,'' said the Canadian, who was 2.5 seconds behind Hakkinen.
	   Villeneuve said he was also bothered by Hakkinen's oil leak and
had too much oversteer on his first set of tires.
	   For McLaren, it was the seventh victory of the season and the
fifth time Hakkinen and Coulthard finished 1-2, in that order.
Coulthard has won one race.
	   Over the weekend, the two drivers extended their contracts with
McLaren for the next season.
	   ``It's fantastic to finish 1-2,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Former champion Damon Hill of Britain also had his best result
of the year by finishing fourth in his Jordan.
	   The younger Schumacher brother, Ralf, was sixth, also in a

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
ethnic Albanian homes Sunday in what appeared to be a campaign to
drive ethnic Albanian civilians from part of Kosovo that had been
under rebel control.
	   In neighboring Albania, the state-run ATA news agency said eight
ethnic Albanians had been killed Sunday in Serb shelling of
villages in Kosovo's Drenica area west of the provincial capital
Pristina. The figure could not be verified.
	   Serb sources confirmed the clashes, but said the fighting
erupted only after rebels fired on police checkpoints along the
road between Pristina and Pec, which government forces cleared last
week.

New Japanese leaders pledge action on economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Leading officials in Japan's new government took to
the airwaves Sunday with promises to move quickly to put the
economy on a recovery track.
	   Top members of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet and ruling
party leaders appeared on political TV shows to try to win voter
confidence for a series of economic policies that the party plans
to initiate in the next six months.
	   The appeals came as a public opinion poll showed that the new
administration is one of the least popular in decades.
	   Critics charge that Obuchi filled his Cabinet with party
loyalists instead of economics or policy experts.
	   The policymakers' promises included cleaning up the debt-ridden
banking system by October, tax cuts of 6 trillion yen (dlrs 41.7
billion) in 1999, and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 69.4 billion) in
additional public spending next year to give the economy a quick
boost.
	   ``The government has to prop up the economy so that it may
expand 2 percent next year'' Liberal Democratic Party
Secretary-General Yoshiro Mori said.
	   Mori's post is one of the most powerful in Obuchi's ruling
party.
	   The leaders also said they would suspend for three years a law
that commits the government to cutting its budget deficit. That
would give them the room they need to increase spending in order to
stimulate growth.
	   ``It is important to have the economy bottom out as soon as
possible,'' said Yukihiko Ikeda, who as chairman of the Liberal
Democratic Party's policy research council is the new government's
top policy maker.
	   ``We must make (the economy) turn up from next year,'' he said.
	   Obuchi is likely to describe his programs to U.S. President Bill
Clinton at a summit meeting this autumn. Clinton called Obuchi on
Saturday and proposed that the summit be held on September 21, when
he will be in New York for a United Nations meeting.
	   Obuchi was elected prime minister last week by the lower house
of parliament, where the LDP has a majority. His predecessor,
Ryutaro Hashimoto, stepped down after the LDP suffered a major
setback in July 12 elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   There were indications Sunday that the Japanese public remained
highly skeptical of the government's ability to deliver major
economic change.
	   Only 33 percent of voters approved of the Cabinet that Obuchi
unveiled Thursday, according to a poll conducted by Yomiuri
Shimbun, the nation's largest circulation newspaper. Some 52
percent disapproved.
	   The newspaper said it quizzed about 1,000 voters nationwide on
Friday and Saturday. It provided no margin of error.
	   The rating was the third lowest for a new Cabinet since such
surveys began in the early 1970s, the paper said.

Workers party withdraws support for former Miss Universe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The Radical Cause workers party has
withdrawn its support for local mayor and former Miss Universe
Irene Saez, whose presidential bid is losing momentum.
	   The party said Saez has made a pact with a discredited
traditional political party, undermining her claim of being an
independent candidate.
	   ``Irene is no longer an option for change, she's lost her status
as an independent,'' Radical Cause leader Andres Velasquez said
Saturday after the party held an emergency meeting. ``We simply
feel betrayed.''
	   Last week, Saez backed a coalition of congressional candidates
in Caracas that includes members of Democratic Action, the
country's largest political party. Her supporters said the move did
not represent an overall strategy of aligning herself with the
party.
	   Saez is backed by the Social Christian COPEI, Venezuela's second
largest party, and her own political organization, IRENE. Radical
Cause is the fifth largest party.
	   Once the front-runner for the December race, Saez has slid into
third place in the polls. Former coup leader Hugo Chavez has a 2-1
lead over his closest competitor, former state governor Henrique
Salas Romer.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Italy's Marco Pantani won the Tour de
France on Sunday, a race likely to be best remembered for the
doping scandal that dogged it from the start.
	   Pantani, riding for the Mercatone Uno team, is the first Italian
to win the Tour since Felice Gimondi captured the top honor in
1965.
	   Tom Steels of Belgium took the 21st and final stage on the
Champs-Elysees in Paris.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, the defending champion, came in second
by 3:21, and American Bobby Julich came in third, at 4:08.
	   Pantani finished the 147-kilometer (91-mile) stage from Melun to
Paris in the pack.
	   Julich, riding with the French Cofidis team, became the second
American to finish in the top three, after three-time winner Greg
LeMond.
	   Pantani, who also won the Tour of Italy this year, took over the
lead last Monday after Ullrich lost nine minutes in one day.
	   The Italian came in third in both 1994 and 1997, and lost by
more than 14 minutes to Ullrich last year. Pantani had a severe
accident at the end of 1995 and did not race in 1996, recovering
from a leg broken in two places.
	   After a heavy rainshower, the sun came out for the final minutes
and the traditional nine laps up and down the Champs-Elysees, from
the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde.
	   Usually the finale of the grueling three-week competition is
cause for revelry. But this year, there was a sense that the end
could not come soon enough for a pack whose numbers dwindled as the
race went on.
	   Nearly each day since the start of the Tour July 11 in Dublin,
Ireland, there have been new doping revelations, police searches
and rider protests.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams ended the race; six dropped out
and one, Festina, was expelled. The pack was reduced to less than
100 riders from the original 189.
	   While riders criss-crossed France, seven people were placed
under investigation _ one step short of being charged _ on
doping-related charges: three officials of the Festina team, two
from TVM, a doctor from ONCE and one rider, Italian Rodolfo Massi
of the Casino team, the Tour's leading mountain climber.
	   Festina was expelled on July 17, after team director Bruno
Roussel admitted to an organized system of providing
performance-enhancing drugs to his riders.
	   The six other teams dropped out in protest over police tactics
and treatment during the Tour, leaving 14 in the competition.
	   On Monday, TVM team riders are to be questioned by judicial
police in Reims.
	   The 1999 Tour de France is scheduled to begin in Puy-du-Fou.

Foreign mercenaries crowding Kashmir guerrilla ranks

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Kashmir's 9-year-old guerrilla war for
independence has become a battle between foreign mercenaries and
Indian soldiers as militants struggle with a shortage of young
local recruits, the army said Sunday.
	   ``Local recruitment has become almost nonexistent. Foreign
mercenaries form about 70 percent of their ranks,'' Major General
P.P.S Bindra, who heads the army command in Udhampur in southern
Jammu-Kashmir, said quoting intelligence reports.
	   ``They are just not getting recruits here _ not volunteers, not
by the coercive measures they used earlier,'' Bindra told The
Associated Press by telephone from Udhampur.
	   India's military, which announced a new offensive against
insurgent groups Saturday after a spate of killings in the
mountainous northern province, has identified a large number of
militants killed in recent encounters as foreigners, mostly from
neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   The military denied that India's recent shelling of Pakistani
border positions was an attempt to scare away Pakistani villagers
from sheltering infiltrators as part of the new offensive.
	   In four days of heavy artillery exchanges that flared up as the
leaders of the two countries held peace talks in the Indian Ocean
nation of Sri Lanka, 85 Pakistanis and 34 Indians were said to have
been killed.
	   India accuses Pakistan of providing material and men to
militants operating in Jammu-Kashmir, mainly Hindu India's only
Muslim-majority province. Pakistan says it only gives moral and
political support to the movement.
	   The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir since gaining
independence from colonial British rulers in 1947.
	   The insurgency that has killed over 15,000 people has raged
since 1989, when militant groups whipped up religious passion among
local Kashmiri Muslims, describing their fight to carve out an
independent state as a ``jihad'' or holy war.
	   ``The percentage of locals in insurgent groups was very high
then. Now, the fight is mostly between mercenaries and the army,''
said retired army general M.M. Lakhera, who headed army operations
in Kashmir when the violent separatist movement began.
	   Nearly a decade after the insurgency began, a string of Kashmiri
separatist leaders face charges of illegal money laundering and
separatist groups are bitterly divided among themselves.
	   Military officials say this has blunted the militants'
operations in the Kashmir Valley, once the hub of their operations,
and forced them to carry out attacks in new areas where the army
has yet to respond powerfully.

Saudi King Fahd to undergo medical checkup

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
will undergo medical tests after suffering an undisclosed illness,
diplomats in Saudi Arabia said Sunday.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, will be admitted to the King Faisal
Specialist Hospital in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, the diplomats
said on condition of anonymity.
	   The king will be flown from the Red Sea city of Jiddah to Riyadh
later Sunday, the diplomats said by telephone.
	   Last week's Cabinet session was chaired by Crown Prince
Abdullah, not Fahd, who usually heads the weekly meetings.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to Abdullah, his half-brother. The
crown prince has essentially remained in command since then.

Court overturns publishing ban criticized by journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Cairo court declared Sunday that a ban on
printing in Egypt's free-trade zones hurt free speech and would not
curb ``sensationalist journalism,'' court officials said.
	   In its ruling, the court reversed the ban imposed in April by
Egypt's Investment Authority. The decision, however, is largely
symbolic since the Cabinet rescinded the decree in May.
	   It does, however, provide publishers with a legal precedent
should the government attempt to impose a similar ban again, said
Hisham Qassem, publisher of the English-language Cairo Times.
	   The ban virtually shut down about 40 magazines and newspapers,
including Cairo Times, which had taken advantage of high-quality
printing and cheaper prices in the zones. Many were forced to print
abroad and then bring the copies into Egypt.
	   The ban came amid a crackdown on what officials described as
``sensationalist reporting'' that hurt Egypt's image, such as
publishing threats by Islamic militant groups. The crackdown
included the arrests of several journalists on libel charges.
	   In its decision, the court said that ``sensationalist journalism
is not controlled by restricting the press.''
	   The court said the printers operating in the free zone had not
violated any investment law and that their licenses were still
valid.
	   The plaintiffs, Sahar Printing and the International Printing
House, were not immediately available for comment.

Hurricane Estelle expected to weaken far off Mexican coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with new info on Hurricane Estelle. At 1500 GMT, storm
was centered near 17.3 N, 119.2 W.

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Hurricane Estelle moved further into the Pacific on
Sunday and meteorologists expected the storm to slowly weaken.
	   Sunday morning, the center of the storm was about 710 miles
(1,140 kilometers) west-southwest of the tip of the Baja California
Peninsula, the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said.
	   Estelle was generating maximum winds of 130 mph (210 kph). It
was moving at 14 mph (23 kph) to the west-northwest, a path
expected to continue through Monday.
	   The hurricane center said the storm's eye was losing its
definition, but it was unclear whether this was a temporary
development or a sign of long-term weakening. Estelle was beginning
to cross cooler waters, so further weakening appeared possible, it
said.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A upper-level high pressure system is established over the
eastern Caribbean. This system will combine with a very dry air
mass to inhibit the development of clouds and showers over our
area, at least through Monday.
	   However, scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms are
possible over the interior sections of Puerto Rico this afternoon
as diurnal heating interacts with the sea breeze. The U.S. Virgin
Islands will enjoy plenty of sunshine with only a few passing
showers, mainly during the morning.
	   Tropical storm Alex continued to move west-northwest across the
Atlantic during the night.
	   At 5 a.m. Alex was located about 440 miles east-northeast of the
U.S. Virgin Islands. Although this system is disorganized and the
forecast track passes it well north of the islands, residents and
visitors in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should continue
to monitor this system until it moves away from our area.
	   San Juan and the northern sections of Puerto Rico:
	   This afternoon... Partly cloudy with a 20 percent chance of

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya filed a formal protest against the
Russian government Sunday, accusing Russian troops of firing on
Chechen territory for several hours a day earlier, a news agency
reported.
	   The protest came a day after Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
and Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko held an unusual meeting
to smooth over relations between Moscow and the separatist Muslim
republic.
	   The meeting drew praise Sunday from Russian Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, who voiced hope that it would help stem the wave
of violence in the Caucasus region, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   However, former Chechen president and Maskhadov rival Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev criticized the meeting. He said that instead of
discussing the possibility for Chechnya to be turned into a special
economic zone, the two leaders should have been talking about
Russia's payment for damage inflicted during the 1994-96 war,
Interfax said.
	   Chechen officials accused Russian troops of opening fire early
Saturday from a border post in Dagestan's Kargalinsky Dam region,
which neighbors on Chechnya, and shooting for close to four hours,
Interfax said.
	   The NTV network, citing Russian Interior Ministry officials,
said the gunfight went on for about 7 hours, off and on. It said it
was triggered after Russian troops refused Friday evening to let a
Chechen man cross the border without documents. The man and several
companions left, threatening violence, and the checkpoint was fired
on shortly after midnight. Russian troops returned fire.
	   Violence continues to keep Chechnya on edge. On Sunday, a gang
of 40 people raided a police post in northwestern Chechnya, freeing
three criminal suspects from jail and seizing dozens of rifles and
other guns, Chechen Prosecutor General Khavazh Serbiyev said,
according to Interfax. Police have launched a search, Serbiyev
said.

Yugoslavia continues unbeaten run; Australia beats Lithuania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, dubbed the ``Americans from
Europe'' and emerging as the favorite to win the World Basketball
Championship, continued its unbeaten run in a rout of Canada 95-55
in second-round play Sunday.
	   Not such good news for Lithuania, which fell from the unbeaten
ranks with a 71-61 loss to Australia behind Andrew Gaze's game-high
24. The Boomers, Goodwill Games silver medalists last month,
improved to 2-3 and kept their chances alive for a coveted
quarterfinal berth.
	   Yugoslavia (4-0), which had three players in double figures, was
topped by Miroslav Beric with 13 and got 14 rebounds from Dejan
Tomasevic.
	   Yugoslavia barged to a 44-23 halftime advantage, a lead it
racked up with trademark dominating defense as it ran off to a
28-10 lead. It added the dagger with a 19-2 run against Canada
(1-3) early in the second half and led by as many as 43 late in the
game.
	   The loss means Canada has virtually no chance of making the
quarters.
	   Lithuania was up 37-35 at halftime after Australia led by as
many as six early in the game. But Australia used a 14-2 run early
in the second half _ capitalizing on tenacious defense and inside
play _ to take control.
	   Gaze took charge in the last five minutes, scoring all 10 of
Australia's points in one stretch _ two on 3-pointers.
	   The Aussies also put the wraps on Lithuanian forward Arturas
Karnisovas who had only 10 points after averaging a tournament-high
22.7 in the first three games.
	   In late second-round game, the United States (2-1) faced
Argentina (2-1), Russia (2-1) played Italy (1-2), Puerto Rico (1-2)
was against Greece (3-0) and Spain (3-0) played Brazil (1-2).
	   In consolation games, Nigeria (1-3) defeated South Korea (0-4)
89-65 and Japan (1-3) edged Senegal (0-4) 66-55 after trailing by
seven early. Kenichi Sako led Japan with 12 points and seven
rebounds and Senegal was topped by Assane Ndiaye with 14 and 10
rebounds.
	   Nigeria's Awojobi Tunji had 24 and Acha Mohammed had 20. South
Korea's Hyun Joo Yup had 16 to lead his team.

 &UR; Rwandan rebels kill as many as 110 people, army says

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels armed with machetes and clubs
hacked to death as many as 110 people in attacks northwest of the
Rwandan capital, an army commander said Sunday.
	   Col. Fred Ibingira said soldiers had counted 110 bodies of those
killed in attacks late Friday at Buheta and Raba communes, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) northwest of the capital Kigali.
	   The news of the attacks was not reported until Sunday.
	   Ibingira said the attackers, who included residents from the
area, had burned down a local official's house. It wasn't clear
whether the official had been killed.
	   Ibingira, the military commander responsible for Kigali and
Kigali Rural prefectures, spoke to reporters at a festival in the
countryside outside Kigali marking the beginning of the harvest
season. He said he had no other details.
	   Wallis Gasamagera, the top official in Kigali Rural prefecture,
said the local Hutu population had asked for guns to defend
themselves against Hutu rebel attacks.
	   Gasamagera said people had recognized some of the attackers and
had captured one. Soldiers in the area were searching for the
rebels, who had probably escaped towards the heavily forested
northwest corner of the country, he said.
	   The attack was the worst since the rebels _ former Hutu soldiers
and militiamen _ killed, hacked to death and then burned 34 people
last month at a roadside inn on the main road from Kigali to the
northwest.
	   The rebels rely on Rwanda's majority Hutu population for food,
shelter and money. But Hutus have increasingly complained of rebel
harassment and intimidation and have often sought army protection.
	   The attackers are among those responsible for the 1994 genocide
of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus. The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July
1994.
	   Rebel attacks have been on increase since November 1996 when
Hutu fighters mingled with more than 1 million refugees who
returned from exile from neighboring countries.

UN envoy prepares for talks with leaders of Angola's conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. envoy on an emergency mission to
avert the return of civil war to Angola kept a low profile over the
weekend as he prepared for talks with the two main figures in the
simmering conflict.
	   Lakhdar Brahimi was due to meet President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos at 2 p.m. (1300GMT) Monday in the capital Luanda.
	   On Tuesday he was to travel 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast
to the highland base of the former guerrilla movement UNITA to meet
veteran rebel chief Jonas Savimbi.
	   Dos Santos and Savimbi sealed a tenuous end to two decades of
civil war, fueled by Cold War geopolitics, with a U.N.-brokered
peace accord in 1994.
	   Since then, successive deadlines for full implementation of the
agreement have passed unheeded, and UNITA has ignored U.N.
sanctions imposed because of the former rebels' reluctance to
relinquish control of rural strongholds.
	   But it was a sudden surge in tension in recent weeks, including
the massacre of over 100 civilians in a remote northern village,
that prompted U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send in Brahimi.
	   Both the government and UNITA have also been accused of
preparing for another war with forced recruitment drives in this
vast southwest African country.
	   As Brahimi landed in Luanda Friday, each side blamed the other
for the rising tension.
	   Following a meeting Saturday with the U.N. mission in Angola and
diplomats from the United States, Portugal and Russia _ the
``troika'' monitoring the fragile peace _ Brahimi said he believed
Angola's problems could be overcome.
	   Careful to avoid jumping the gun, he told reporters, ``Together
with the observers and both sides we will look for a solution.''
	   Brahimi was due to leave the former Portuguese colony Wednesday
for a tour of neighboring states and talks with leaders close to
either Dos Santos or Savimbi. Details of his itinerary were not
available.

 &UR; By TAREK AL-ISSAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ King Fahd of Saudi Arabia was
admitted to a hospital Sunday to undergo medical tests, the
official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   The agency gave no further details but diplomats in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh, said the king suffered an undisclosed illness.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was admitted to the King Faisal
Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, the agency reported.
	   The king was flown from the Red Sea city of Jiddah to Riyadh. He
was accompanied by two of his sons and his brothers Defense
Minister Prince Sultan and Prince Salman, the agency said.
	   Crown Prince Abdullah was due to arrive in Riyadh soon, said the
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Last week's Cabinet session was chaired by Abdullah, not Fahd,
who usually heads the weekly meetings.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to Abdullah, his half-brother.
	   The crown prince is known to be far less pro-American than Fahd
and has been critical of Washington's support for Israel. He
essentially remains in command following the stroke that left Fahd
with short-term memory loss and the inability to concentrate for
any stretch of time.
	   Fahd, who is the head of the world's largest oil-producing
nation, has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   Since the stroke, Fahd has used a wheelchair and is able to take
a few steps or stand to meet visitors only with the help of a cane.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

Volkswagen may start making it beetles in Germany again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen may start manufacturing its
popular new Beetle models in Germany, Der Spiegel magazine said
Sunday.
	   The magazine said Volkswagen's works council chief, Klaus
Volkert, has hopes the company will start producing the Beetles at
its headquarters in Wolfsburg.
	   Management has already signaled it may start producing the
Beetles locally in 1999, if employees give up part of their extra
pay for working on Saturdays, the Hamburg-based weekly said.
	   Currently the new Beetles are produced at Volkswagen's factory
in Puebla, Mexico. They have been selling like hotcakes since
deliveries started in March in the United States.
	   The company has said it plans to start selling the cars in
Germany in November.
	   In April, Volkswagen said it had surveyed its employees in
Germany and 2,000 were interested in buying a Beetle, a strong
indication of its public appeal.

	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Italy's Marco Pantani won the Tour de
France on Sunday, a race likely to be best remembered for the
doping scandal that dogged it from the start.
	   Pantani, riding for the Mercatone Uno team, is the first Italian
to win the Tour since Felice Gimondi captured the top honor in
1965.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, the defending champion, came in second
by 3 minutes, 21 seconds, and American Bobby Julich came in third,
at 4:08.
	   Tom Steels of Belgium took the 21st and final stage on the
Champs-Elysees in Paris. It was Steels' fourth stage win of this
Tour. He won the first stage in Dublin, three weeks ago.
	   The usual final day crowd, populated by many vacationing
Italians, cheered Pantani every time he passed, easily spotted in
the leader's yellow jersey.
	   Pantani finished the 147-kilometer (91-mile) stage from Melun to
Paris in the pack, coming in 45th for the day. He lost no time to
Ullrich and Julich.
	   Julich, riding with the French Cofidis team, became the second
American to finish in the top three, after three-time winner Greg
LeMond.
	   LeMond was third in his first year on the Tour in 1984 before
winning in 1986, 1989 and 1990. This is Julich's second Tour.
	   Julich knows it will be hard to beat Pantani.
	   ``This year I had little chance to win. Pantani was on another
planet. When he attacks the mountains, no one can match him,''
Julich said.
	   Pantani, who also won the Tour of Italy this year, took over the
lead last Monday after Ullrich lost nine minutes in one day on the
15th stage to Les Deux Alpes.
	   He also won another mountain stage and came in second in
another.
	   The Italian came in third in both 1994 and 1997, and lost by
more than 14 minutes to Ullrich last year. Pantani had a severe
accident at the end of 1995 and did not race in 1996, recovering
from a leg broken in two places.
	   After a heavy rainshower, the sun came out for the final minutes
and the traditional nine laps up and down the Champs-Elysees, from
the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde.
	   Usually the finale of the grueling three-week competition is
cause for revelry. But this year, there was a sense that the end
could not come soon enough for a pack whose numbers dwindled as the
race went on.
	   Nearly each day since the start of the Tour July 11 in Dublin,
Ireland, there have been new doping revelations, police searches
and rider protests.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams ended the race; six dropped out
and one, Festina, was expelled. The pack was reduced to less than
100 riders from the original 189.
	   While riders criss-crossed France, seven people were placed
under investigation _ one step short of being charged _ on
doping-related charges: three officials of the Festina team, two
from TVM, a doctor from ONCE and one rider, Italian Rodolfo Massi
of the Casino team, the Tour's leading mountain climber.
	   Festina was expelled on July 17, after team director Bruno
Roussel admitted to an organized system of providing
performance-enhancing drugs to his riders.
	   The six other teams dropped out in protest over police tactics
and treatment during the Tour, leaving 14 in the competition.
	   On Monday, TVM team riders are to be questioned by judicial
police in Reims.
	   The 1999 Tour de France is scheduled to begin in Puy-du-Fou.

Boardman glad he crashed out of Tour de France.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Chris Boardman revealed Sunday _ the
same day Marco Pantani crossed the line to win the Tour de France _
that he was glad he quit the race early.
	   The drug scandal which dominated the 1998 Tour de France had
tarnished the race and the riders, Boardman said in an Independent
on Sunday report.
	   ``It's sad to say it and I never believed I would, but I'm very
glad to be out of the whole thing,'' he said.
	   ``If (the drug scandal) continued in the same way for another
year, sponsors would pull out, the next generation of riders would
go elsewhere and I _ and a lot of riders _ would pack it in,'' he
added.
	   Boardman was wearing the leader's yellow jersey when he crashed
into a stone wall near Cork, Ireland, in the second stage of the
Tour on July 13.
	   At the time, the 1992 Olympic pursuit gold medalist said he was
disappointed to crash out so early _ he was knocked unconscious and
spent a night in hospital _ but he has changed his attitude in the
meantime.
	   The drugs controversy has overshadowed the Tour de France since
a Festina team staff member was caught by customs officers with
performance enhancing drugs in his car.
	   The scandal continued to mar this year's Tour as leading teams,
doctors and cyclists were either banned or under suspicion for
doping.
	   ``The Tour is big enough to handle one scandal like this, but
maybe not another,'' Boardman said.
	   Boardman, who said he had never been offered performance
enhancing drugs in his four years as a professional, said it was
unfair that every rider had to be affected.
	   ``I don't want to sound holier than thou about it, but it's been
really disappointing that you've followed the ethics of sport, yet
when the mud starts to fly, you get implicated anyway,'' he said.
	   He said for the reputation of cycling to survive, it was up to
the sport's administrators to make the risk of using drugs greater
than the rewards.

Yugoslavia continues unbeaten run; Australia beats Lithuania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Australia coach &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, dubbed the ``Americans from
Europe'' and emerging as the favorite to win the World Basketball
Championship, continued its unbeaten run in a rout of Canada 95-55
in second-round play Sunday.
	   Not such good news for Lithuania, which fell from the unbeaten
ranks with a 71-61 loss to Australia behind Andrew Gaze's game-high
24. The Boomers, Goodwill Games silver medalists last month,
improved to 2-3 and kept their chances alive for a coveted
quarterfinal berth.
	   Yugoslavia (4-0), which had three players in double figures and
saw all 12 score, was topped by Miroslav Beric with 13 and got 14
rebounds from Dejan Tomasevic.
	   Yugoslavia barged to a 44-23 halftime advantage, a lead it
racked up with trademark dominating defense as it ran off to a
28-10 lead. It added the dagger with a 19-2 run against Canada
(1-3) early in the second half and led by as many as 43.
	   Greg Newton led the losers with 14 and the loss means Canada has
virtually no chance of making the quarters.
	   Lithuania was up 37-35 at halftime after Australia led by as
many as six early in the game. But Australia used a 14-2 run early
in the second half _ capitalizing on tenacious defense and power
inside play _ to take control.
	   Gaze, a 6-foot-7 (2.01) forward, took charge in the last five
minutes, scoring all 10 of Australia's points in one stretch _ two
on 3-pointers.
	   The Aussies, who have lost two games here by a combined five
points, also put the wraps on Lithuanian forward Arturas Karnisovas
who had only 10 points after averaging a tournament-high 22.7 in
the first three games.
	   ``Lithuania started a small group and we felt we could go and
exploit that,'' said assistant coach Alan Black. ``After the two
close losses, hopefuloly this will give us the confidence we
need.''
	   In late second-round games, the United States (2-1) faced
Argentina (2-1), Russia (2-1) played Italy (1-2), Puerto Rico (1-2)
was against Greece (3-0) and Spain (3-0) played Brazil (1-2).
	   In consolation games, Nigeria (1-3) defeated South Korea (0-4)
89-65 and Japan (1-3) edged Senegal (0-4) 66-55 after trailing by
seven early. Kenichi Sako led Japan with 12 points and seven
rebounds and Senegal was topped by Assane Ndiaye with 14 and 10
rebounds.
	   Nigeria's Awojobi Tunji had 24 and Acha Mohammed had 20. South
Korea's Hyun Joo Yup had 16 to lead his team.

India claims 5 new deaths from Pakistani shelling at border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES 6th and 7th graf with Pakistani government saying
report 37 soldiers killed incorrect, CORRECTS figure given by Malik
Saturday to 43. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Five Indian civilians were killed in
Pakistani shelling Sunday as the rival armies resumed the
four-day-old artillery exchange along their disputed border in
Kashmir after a brief lull, officials said.
	   Three people including two women were killed in the Uri region
of the Jammu-Kashmir frontier and two men were killed near
Baramulla town, United News of India said quoting an official
spokesman.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations became independent in 1947. It is divided between them by
the 400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control monitored by the
United Nations. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir.
	   The shelling had stopped Sunday morning in several border
positions but resumed in the evening, the spokesman said, adding
that the Indian toll in four days of fierce firing had risen to 34
with Sunday's deaths.
	   Pakistan had on Saturday accused Indian troops of unleashing
mortars in the disputed territory of Kashmir in a three-day
face-off that killed a reported 85 Pakistanis.
	   Majeed Malik, the Pakistani minister in charge of Kashmir
policy, said Saturday the dead included 43 civilians killed in
firing by Indian troops that he said was part of New Delhi's plan
to derail peace talks. India denied the allegation.
	   Another five Pakistani civilians were reported killed Saturday,
bringing the total to 48. The Information Ministry said Sunday that
three soldiers were also killed, adding that Malik apparently
misheard a question Saturday when he said 37 soldiers were killed.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Kashmir's 9-year-old guerrilla war for
independence has become a battle between foreign mercenaries and
Indian soldiers as militants struggle with a shortage of young
local recruits, the army said Sunday.
	   ``Local recruitment has become almost nonexistent. Foreign
mercenaries form about 70 percent of their ranks,'' Major General
P.P.S Bindra, who heads the army command in Udhampur in southern
Jammu-Kashmir, said quoting intelligence reports.
	   ``They are just not getting recruits here _ not volunteers, not
by the coercive measures they used earlier,'' Bindra told The
Associated Press by telephone from Udhampur.
	   India's military, which announced a new offensive against
insurgent groups Saturday after a spate of killings in the
mountainous northern province, has identified a large number of
militants killed in recent encounters as foreigners, mostly from
neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   The military denied that India's recent shelling of Pakistani
border positions was an attempt to scare away Pakistani villagers
from sheltering infiltrators as part of the new offensive.
	   In four days of heavy artillery exchanges that flared up as the
leaders of the two countries held peace talks in the Indian Ocean
nation of Sri Lanka, 54 Pakistanis and 34 Indians were said to have
been killed.

Italian generals scoff at accusations over Italian tragedy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It took prosecutors 18 years and 900 pages to
conclude that whatever caused an Italian jetliner to crash into the
Mediterranean -- bomb, missile or something else -- is still a
mystery.
	   But failure to finger the cause of the disaster in which all 81
people aboard the DC-9 perished did not stop Rome prosecutors from
formally seeking trial for four retired Italian air force generals
and six other officers for an alleged cover-up.
	   Italian newspapers Sunday, reporting the indictment requests
announced a day earlier, focused heavily on the angle that whoever
caused the tragedy -- if someone did -- is still unknown.
	   ``What a joke, they say that I lie and they still don't known
the truth,'' La Repubblica newspaper headlined its interview with
one of the retired generals.
	   ``If the investigating magistrates say that no one can be
prosecuted for the crime of massacre, than for what, why and how
would I have thrown them off the trail?'' the Rome daily quoted
Gen. Franco Ferri as saying.
	   The prosecutors called a news conference for Monday which could
shed light on whether investigators intend to keep on searching for
a possible culprit for the June 27, 1981 crash near Ustica, a tiny
island north of Sicily.
	   ``The investigations into the context in which the tragedy took
place didn't lead to any definite elements of clarification,'' the
prosecutors said in their 900-page request for indictment.
	   The prosecutors added that there was no conclusive proof that
the plane, on a Bologna-Palermo flight of now-defunct Itavia
airlines, was deliberately brought down nor was there proof of the
much-debated Libyan connection.
	   Since the tragedy occurred when Italy was gripped by domestic
terrorism, theories have included a bomb going off. Others
theorized that a missile -- possibly fired by an Allied war plane
trying to hit an aircraft flying Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi --
brought down the Itavia jet.
	   But while admitting they still don't know what caused the crash,
the prosecutors contended there was a cover-up, and they suggested
American planes might have been in the area, according to newpaper
accounts of the indictment request.
	   Mechanical failure was previously ruled out, and traces of TNT
were found in the wreckage.
	   In 1989, a panel concluded the jet was struck by a missile. A
year later, a new inquiry by experts concluded that a bomb had
blown apart the aircraft. The latest investigation hoped to settle
the question.
	   French, U.S. and NATO officials have long denied any military
activity in the skies that night.
	   Italian experts even differed about one of the most intriguing
elements, the discovery of the wreckage of a Libyan Mig in the
mountains of Calabria a few weeks after the Ustica crash.
	   At first, a coroner dated the death of the Libyan pilot to about
the time of the Itavia crash. Later, a report put the date of death
to approximately when the Libyan jet's wreckage was found.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on
Sunday accused India of bringing the region to the brink of war
with its barrage of artillery fire in the disputed Kashmir region
in recent days.
	   Speaking to reporters, Sharif called on the international
community to pressure India to desist. Otherwise, he said, ``New
Delhi will be responsible for war in South Asia if Indians continue
... killing innocent Kashmiris.''
	   Pakistan says unprovoked firing from Indian-held Kashmir has
killed 48 villagers and 3 soldiers in Pakistani-held Kashmir over
the last four days. India said Pakistan started the exchange that
killed 34 Indians, mostly civilians.

Yugoslavia continues unbeaten run; Australia beats Lithuania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Yugoslavian and Canadian coaches &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, dubbed the ``Americans from
Europe'' and emerging as the favorite to win the World Basketball
Championship, continued its unbeaten run in a rout of Canada 95-55
in second-round play Sunday.
	   Not such good news for Lithuania, which fell from the unbeaten
ranks with a 71-61 loss to Australia behind Andrew Gaze's game-high
24. The Boomers, Goodwill Games silver medalists last month,
improved to 2-3 and kept their chances alive for a coveted
quarterfinal berth.
	   Yugoslavia (4-0) had three players in double figures and saw all
12 score, topped by Miroslav Beric with 13 points and Dejan
Tomasevic with 14 rebounds.
	   ``It was a good old-fashioned butt-kicking by a very good
basketball team,'' Canadian coach Steve Konchalski said.
	   Yugoslavia barged to a 44-23 halftime advantage with trademark
dominating defense. It added the dagger with a 19-2 run against
Canada (1-3) early in the second half and led by as many as 43.
	   Greg Newton led the losers with 14 and the loss means Canada has
virtually no chance of making the quarters.
	   ``My team managed to get into the game from the first minute and
we didn't allow Canada to be dangerous,'' said Yugoslavia coach
Zeljko Obradovic.
	   Lithuania was up 37-35 at halftime after Australia led by as
many as six early in the game. But Australia used a 14-2 run early
in the second half _ capitalizing on tenacious defense and power
inside play _ to take control.
	   Gaze, a 6-foot-7 (2.01) forward, took charge in the last five
minutes, scoring all 10 of Australia's points in one stretch _ two
on 3-pointers. Saulius Stombergas led Lithuania with 17.
	   The Aussies, who have lost two games here by a combined five
points, also put the wraps on Lithuanian forward Arturas Karnisovas
who had only 10 points after averaging a tournament-high 22.7 in
the first three games.
	   ``Lithuania started a small group and we felt we could go and
exploit that,'' said assistant coach Alan Black. ``After the two
close losses, hopefuloly this will give us the confidence we
need.''
	   In late second-round games, the United States (2-1) faced
Argentina (2-1), Russia (2-1) played Italy (1-2), Puerto Rico (1-2)
was against Greece (3-0) and Spain (3-0) played Brazil (1-2).
	   In consolation games, Nigeria (1-3) defeated South Korea (0-4)
89-65 and Japan (1-3) edged Senegal (0-4) 66-55 after trailing by
seven early.

Hurricane Estelle expected to weaken far off Mexican coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE information on Alex. At 1500 GMT,
Estelle was centered near 17.3 north, 119.2 west; Alex was at 20.1
north, 59.0 west. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Hurricane Estelle moved farther into the Pacific on
Sunday and meteorologists expected the storm to weaken slowly.
	   Sunday morning, the center of the storm was about 710 miles
(1,140 kilometers) west-southwest of the tip of the Baja California
peninsula, the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said.
	   Estelle was generating maximum winds of 130 mph (210 kph). It
was moving at 14 mph (23 kph) to the west-northwest, a path
expected to continue through Monday.
	   Meanwhile, a weakened Tropical Storm Alex was moving northwest,
which should take it well north of the Leeward Islands, forecasters
at the National Hurricane Center said.
	   At 1500 GMT, Alex was about 300 miles (480 kilometers)
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands at 20.1 north, 59.0
west.
	   The storm, with maximum sustained winds of about 40 mph (64
kph), was moving northwest at about 13 mph (21 kph).
	   On its current path, rough weather from Alex should pass well to
the northeast of the Lesser Antilles chain in the eastern
Caribbean, forecasters said.

Civilian plane crashes in northern Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)_ The crash of a civilian airplane in
northern Afghanistan has killed all five people aboard, Taliban
radio reported Sunday.
	   The report said the Russian-made Antonov 32 had taken off from
Kabul on Saturday night and crashed a few kilometers (miles) from
its destination, the airport at Kanduz, about 250 kilometers (150
miles) north.
	   The brief report said the plane was carrying civilians,
including a pilot and one flight attendant. Civilian flights to
Kanduz are unusual because Taliban fighters are staging attacks on
their northern-based opposition from the town.

Italian generals scoff at accusations over Italian tragedy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR ALL NEEDING &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It took prosecutors 18 years and 900 pages to
conclude that whatever caused an Italian jetliner to crash into the
Mediterranean -- bomb, missile or something else -- is still a
mystery.
	   But failure to finger the cause of the disaster in which all 81
people aboard the DC-9 perished did not stop Rome prosecutors from
formally seeking trial for four retired Italian air force generals
and six other officers for an alleged cover-up.
	   Italian newspapers Sunday, reporting the indictment requests
announced a day earlier, focused heavily on the angle that whoever
caused the tragedy -- if someone did -- is still unknown.
	   ``What a joke, they say that I lie and they still don't know the
truth,'' La Repubblica newspaper headlined its interview with one
of the retired generals.
	   ``If the investigating magistrates say that no one can be
prosecuted for the crime of massacre, than for what, why and how
would I have thrown them off the trail?'' the Rome daily quoted
Gen. Franco Ferri as saying.
	   The prosecutors called a news conference for Monday which could
shed light on whether investigators intend to keep on searching for
a possible culprit for the June 27, 1981 crash near Ustica, a tiny
island north of Sicily.
	   ``The investigations into the context in which the tragedy took
place didn't lead to any definite elements of clarification,'' the
prosecutors said in their 900-page request for indictment.
	   The prosecutors added that there was no conclusive proof that
the plane, on a Bologna-Palermo flight of now-defunct Itavia
airlines, was deliberately brought down nor was there proof of the
much-debated Libyan connection.
	   Since the tragedy occurred when Italy was gripped by domestic
terrorism, theories have included a bomb going off. Others
theorized that a missile -- possibly fired by an Allied war plane
trying to hit an aircraft flying Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi --
brought down the Itavia jet.
	   But while admitting they still don't know what caused the crash,
the prosecutors contended there was a cover-up, and they suggested
American planes might have been in the area, according to newpaper
accounts of the indictment request.
	   Mechanical failure was previously ruled out, and traces of TNT
were found in the wreckage.
	   In 1989, a panel concluded the jet was struck by a missile. A
year later, a new inquiry by experts concluded that a bomb had
blown apart the aircraft. The latest investigation hoped to settle
the question.
	   French, U.S. and NATO officials have long denied any military
activity in the skies that night.
	   Italian experts even differed about one of the most intriguing
elements, the discovery of the wreckage of a Libyan Mig in the
mountains of Calabria a few weeks after the Ustica crash.
	   At first, a coroner dated the death of the Libyan pilot to about
the time of the Itavia crash. Later, a report put the date of death
to approximately when the Libyan jet's wreckage was found.

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ King Fahd of Saudi Arabia was
admitted to the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh hospital
Sunday to undergo medical tests, the official Saudi Press Agency
reported.
	   The agency gave no further details. Diplomats in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh, said Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, suffered an
undisclosed illness.
	   The king was flown from the Red Sea city of Jiddah to Riyadh.
	   Last week's Cabinet session was chaired by Crown Prince
Abdullah, not Fahd, who usually heads the weekly meetings.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to Abdullah, his half-brother. The
crown prince has essentially remained in command since then.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ ``Man-mountain'' contestants from nine
countries heaved and hoed, grunted and groaned, and in the end,
Riku Kiri of Finland emerged the winner Sunday in the In-Kal Cup
``strongest man'' contest.
	   The other contestants were Berend Veneberg (Netherlands), Heinz
Olesch (Germany), Regin Vagadal (Faeroe Islands), Gerrit Badenhorst
(South Africa), Bill Lyndon (Australia), Flemming Rasmusson
(Denmark), Laszlo Fekete (Hungary).
	   On Saturday, there was the millstone lift, the farmer's walk -
250 kilogram (550 lbs) weights and walk as far as you can and Kiri
managed to walk 70 meters (yards) - the throw-for-height, and the
stone ball lift.
	   Sunday's events were pulling two armored vehicles, with a
combined weight of nine tons, for l6 meters (yards); the crucifix
(holding two logs); and the power stairs, which calls for walking
up and down six stairs with weights up to 275 kilograms (605 lbs).
	   ``Man, this heat really saps your energy,'' said Lyndon, with
temperature officially 36 degrees Celsius (97 F), but the vent was
in an open stadium, with the sun pushing the real temperature well
above that.
	   An ambulance was on standby, but no serious injuries were
reported.

Flood situation improves but disease kills 27 in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The raging floodwaters that submerged
much of Bangladesh for three weeks began to recede Sunday, leaving
over 30,000 people suffering from diarrhea and other waterborne
diseases, officials said.
	   At least 27 people died of diseases linked to impure water since
the flooding started July 10, said Shamul Islam, Joint Secretary at
the Disaster and Relief Ministry.
	   Islam said over 400 medical teams with almost 20,000 doctors,
paramedics and voluntary health workers had spread out across the
country to fight further spread of the disease. Water purifying
tablets were being distributed in the affected areas, he added.
	   At least 347 people had drowned in the flooding by Sunday, when
the floodwaters began to recede after leaving behind a three-week
trail of devastation.
	   Several residents had to wade through foul-smelling floodwater
for long distances to reach the country's only hospital for
diarrheal diseases, where the sick were fed liquid cereal made from
rice.
	   Doctor Mohammad Abdus Salam, chief physician at the
International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, said over 500
patients were coming each day to the hospital, which was equipped
to handle only 180 patients daily.
	   Diarrhea is a major killer in Bangladesh, a country of 130
million where floods cause widespread damage each year. Bangladesh,
one of the world's largest deltas, is crisscrossed by hundreds of
rivers. Most flood during the monsoon months.
	   Islam said that water was receding fast from the 32 districts
where the calamity had left more than 10 million people marooned.

Jesper Parnevik popular winner before 29,000 home fans

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jesper Parnevik became the first
two-time winner of the Scandinavian Masters on Sunday, scoring a
three-shot victory in his native Stockholm on the European Tour
Club course that suits his game so well.
	   The 33-year-old Swede, who is a U.S. Tour regular and won his
first American event in the Phoenix Open early this year, led
Darren Clarke by two strokes overnight and was never challenged by
the Ulsterman in the final round.
	   Parnevik closed with a 70 for an 11-under-par total of 273. The
victory was worth dlrs 219,195. Clarke, who also played on Europe's
winning Ryder Cup team last year, was second after a 71.
	   A big gallery of 29,000 fans -- total attendance was almost
94,000 for Europe's second-best attended tournament -- were on hand
on the course, which sits only a short drive from where the popular
Parnevik started playing golf.
	   ``It's a great feeling to win in front of your own people,''
said Parnevik, who also won this event on a southern Swedish course
in 1995. ''The first time was great, but perhaps the second time is
greater.
	   ''It's very hard to win before your home crowd. They not only
want you to win but they expect you to win, so the pressure is
really on you. Now I just feel very tired.
	   ``I thought I had won it coming down the 13th, but Darren holed
two good birdie putts on the 14th and 15th to put the pressure back
on. But then he dropped a shot on the 16th and I knew it was
over.''
	   Parnevik, who tied for fourth in the British Open two weeks ago,
will now return to the United States and the PGA Championship in
Seattle. The final major of the year starts Aug. 13.
	   For Clarke, it was the second straight runnerup finish on the
European Tour, having lost by one shot to Stephen Leaney of
Australia in the Dutch Open at Hilversum last week.
	   Clarke chartered a private jet so he could fly straight home to
Belfast after the Swedish tournament. His wife, Heather, was
expecting their first child Sunday night.
	   Stephen Field of England finished third at 277 while Jean van de
Velde of France and Michael Jonzon of Sweden shared fourth at 278.
	   Craig Hainline, an obscure American from Houston, dropped from
fifth to share 16h with Colin Montgomerie and seven others after
his worst round of the tournament (74). Tom Gillis, the only other
American who made the cut, finished at 293.

UN envoy prepares for talks with leaders of Angola's conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. envoy on an emergency mission to
avert the return of civil war to Angola kept a low profile over the
weekend as he prepared for talks with the two main figures in the
simmering conflict.
	   Lakhdar Brahimi was due to meet President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos on Monday afternoon in the capital Luanda.
	   On Tuesday he was to travel 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast
to the highland base of the former guerrilla movement UNITA to meet
veteran rebel chief Jonas Savimbi.
	   Dos Santos and Savimbi sealed a tenuous end to two decades of
civil war, fueled by Cold War geopolitics, with a U.N.-brokered
peace accord in 1994.
	   Since then, successive deadlines for full implementation of the
agreement have passed unheaded, and UNITA has ignored U.N.
sanctions imposed because of the former rebels' reluctance to
relinquish control of rural strongholds.
	   A sudden surge in tension in recent weeks, including the
massacre of over 100 civilians in a remote northern village,
prompted U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send in Brahimi.
	   Both the government and UNITA have been accused of preparing for
another war with forced recruitment drives in this vast southwest
African country.
	   When Brahimi landed in Luanda on Friday, each side blamed the
other for the rising tension.
	   Following a meeting Saturday with the U.N. mission in Angola and
diplomats from the United States, Portugal and Russia _ the
``troika'' monitoring the fragile peace _ Brahimi said he believed
Angola's problems could be overcome.
	   Careful to avoid jumping the gun, he told reporters, ``Together
with the observers and both sides we will look for a solution.''
	   Brahimi was due to leave the former Portuguese colony Wednesday
for a tour of neighboring states and talks with leaders close to
either Dos Santos or Savimbi. Details of his itinerary were not
available.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Religious Jews on Sunday observed Tisha B'Av _
a little known day of mourning which marks the destruction of the
biblical Jewish Temples by fasting and praying.
	   The First Temple was believed to be destroyed by the Babylonians
in 586 B.C., and the second, by the Romans in A.D. 70. According to
Jewish tradition, both Temples were destroyed on the same day known
as Tisha B'Av, or the ninth day of the Jewish calender month of Av.
	   Tisha B'Av is preceded by a three week mourning period during
which observant Jews refrain from buying new clothes, shaving or
cutting their hair, eating meat, drinking alcohol and getting
married.
	   Thousands of Jews gathered at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall _ the
last remaining remnant of the Temple _ to read from the book of
Lamentations and mourn in public. The observance began Saturday at
sundown and ends on sundown Sunday.
	   During the prayers, a small group of extreme right-wing Jewish
demonstrators attempted to enter the Temple Mount, next to the
Wall. The site is home to one of Islam's holiest sites and where
the ancient Jewish Temples are believed to have been located. The
group, which advocates removing the Muslim site and rebuilding the
ancient Temple in its place, is regularly prohibited by police from
entering the area and nine demonstrators were detained Sunday,
police said.
	   The day is not observed by a majority of Israelis however and
unlike during other Jewish holidays in Israel, businesses remained
open and public transportation operated throughout the country.

India claims 5 new deaths from Pakistani shelling at border

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Five Indian civilians were killed in
Pakistani shelling Sunday as the rival armies resumed the
four-day-old artillery exchange along their disputed border in
Kashmir after a brief lull, officials said.
	   Three people including two women were killed in the Uri region
of the Jammu-Kashmir frontier and two men were killed near
Baramulla town, United News of India said quoting an official
spokesman.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations became independent in 1947. It is divided between them by
the 400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control monitored by the
United Nations. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir.
	   The shelling had stopped Sunday morning in several border
positions but resumed in the evening, the spokesman said, adding
that the Indian toll in four days of fierce firing had risen to 34
with Sunday's deaths.
	   Pakistan had on Saturday accused Indian troops of unleashing
mortars in the disputed territory of Kashmir in a three-day
face-off that killed a reported 51 Pakistanis.

Yugoslavia continues unbeaten run; Australia beats Lithuania

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Australia record second graf &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, emerging as the favorite to
win the World Basketball Championship, continued its unbeaten run
in a rout of Canada 95-55 in second-round play Sunday.
	   Not such good news for Lithuania, which fell from the unbeaten
ranks with a 71-61 loss to Australia behind Andrew Gaze's game-high
24. The Boomers, Goodwill Games silver medalists last month,
improved to 2-2 and kept their chances alive for a coveted
quarterfinal berth.
	   Yugoslavia (4-0) had three players in double figures and saw all
12 score, topped by Miroslav Beric with 13 points and Dejan
Tomasevic with 14 rebounds.
	   ``It was a good old-fashioned butt-kicking by a very good
basketball team,'' Canadian coach Steve Konchalski said.
	   Yugoslavia barged to a 44-23 halftime advantage with trademark
dominating defense. It added the dagger with a 19-2 run against
Canada (1-3) early in the second half and led by as many as 43.
	   Greg Newton led the losers with 14 and the loss means Canada has
virtually no chance of making the quarters.
	   ``My team managed to get into the game from the first minute and
we didn't allow Canada to be dangerous,'' said Yugoslavia coach
Zeljko Obradovic.
	   Lithuania was up 37-35 at halftime after Australia led by as
many as six early in the game. But Australia used a 14-2 run early
in the second half _ capitalizing on tenacious defense and power
inside play _ to take control.
	   Gaze, a 6-foot-7 (2.01) forward, took charge in the last five
minutes, scoring all 10 of Australia's points in one stretch _ two
on 3-pointers. Saulius Stombergas led Lithuania with 17.
	   The Aussies, who have lost two games here by a combined five
points, also put the wraps on Lithuanian forward Arturas Karnisovas
who had only 10 points after averaging a tournament-high 22.7 in
the first three games.
	   ``Lithuania started a small group and we felt we could go and
exploit that,'' said assistant coach Alan Black. ``After the two
close losses, hopefully this will give us the confidence we need.''
	   In late second-round games, the United States (2-1) faced
Argentina (2-1), Russia (2-1) played Italy (1-2), Puerto Rico (1-2)
was against Greece (3-0) and Spain (3-0) played Brazil (1-2).
	   In consolation games, Nigeria (1-3) defeated South Korea (0-4)
89-65 and Japan (1-3) edged Senegal (0-4) 66-55 after trailing by
seven early.

BMW chairman rejects merger speculation as old hat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Europe's largest car maker Volkswagen
won't take over Bayerische Motoren Werke, said BMW Chairman Bernd
Pischetsrieder in an interview published Sunday.
	   The interview appeared in Sunday's editions of Welt am Sonntag,
a day after Volkswagen Chairman Ferdinand Piech was quoted in a
separate newspaper interview as saying there was a possibility the
two companies could become ``unbeatable,'' if they invested in each
other.
	   Welt am Sonntag quoted Pischetsrieder as saying that ``in the
past 35 years, there has been always talk about such merger plans,
and our group has only grown stronger due to his talk.''
	   ``As long as our shareholders won't see a better investment than
BMW, the question won't arise anyway,'' the report quoted him as
saying.
	   The two German companies battled each other earlier this year in
a takeover of Rolls-Royce in England.
	   VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) for Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars, but it will end up with only the Rolls-Royce factory in
Crewe, England, as well as the lesser-known but better-selling
Bentley line of luxury cars.
	   BMW, meanwhile, lost the bidding for the Rolls-Royce company but
paid just 40 million pounds (dlrs 66 million) for one of the auto
industry's biggest prizes _ the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo.
	   BMW has announced plans to start up a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
company on Jan. 1, 2003, but will let VW use the brand name for
free until then.

Albert Costa wins at Kitzbuehel for second time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Spain's Albert Costa needed almost
three hours Sunday to beat Andrea Gaudenzi and win the Generali
Open for the second time after 1995.
	   Costa, ranked 14th, picked up his eighth career title by
struggling past the Italian, 6-2, 1-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 at the dlrs
535,000 event.
	   The win is likely to move Costa near a Top 10 ranking, which the
Spaniard held last year before slumping out of the Top 20.
	   Costa, whose titles have all come on clay courts, won in Hamburg
in May, then reached the final of the Italian Open the following
week before a wrist injury sidelined him.
	   Gaudenzi, ranked 36th, reached his second final this year after
winning at Casablanca.
	   Costa took home dlrs 62,400 for the title and Gaudenzi won dlrs
36,700.

Gonzalez to defend Basque ``dirty war'' convicts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS; ADDS comment from ruling party in grafs 12,13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has
joined the defense team of two of his former government officials
convicted of ``dirty war'' activities against Basque separatists, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Gonzalez, a lawyer, registered with the Madrid Bar Association
on Friday so he can assist the defense team when it appeals the
convictions before the Constitutional Court later this month, El
Pais said, quoting people close to Gonzalez.
	   The Supreme Court last week handed down 10-year jail terms
against former Interior Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo and his
former aide Rafael Vera for the 1983 kidnapping of a businessman
who was mistaken for a Basque separatist hitman and held for 10
days.
	   Ten other former officials who had pleaded guilty got lesser
sentences.
	   The kidnapping was the first action attributed to the so-called
Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, death squads that killed 27
people between 1983 and 1987 in a drive against members and
sympathizers of the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
	   Many of the victims turned out to be mistaken targets.
	   Gonzalez, a Socialist who ruled from 1982 to 1996, has long
denied allegations that his government created the death squads. An
investigating magistrate for the Supreme Court concluded in 1996
that there was insufficient evidence to try Gonzalez himself in the
kidnapping case.
	   El Pais said Gonzalez decided to join the Barrionuevo and Vera
defense team as soon as the guilty verdicts were handed down last
Wednesday but it took three days for him to gather the necessary
papers.
	   He was already a member of the Madrid bar but not an active one
with the right to argue cases in court, it said.
	   In his first public reaction to the sentences, Gonzalez said
Friday that the Supreme Court had come under political pressure
from the current conservative government of Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar and that the convictions were ``radically unjust.''
	   He also said: ``I will defend Barrionuevo and Vera until the
end.''
	   A senior deputy of the ruling Popular Party, Manuel Nunez, said
Sunday that it was unethical for the former prime minister to
defend the men because Gonzalez's government had appointed the
Constitutional Court's judges.
	   ``This is yet another example of his peculiar, strange way of
viewing the independence of the judicial branch and judges,'' said
Nunez.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Romania's prime minister gave two
children a lift on his government plane to Israel Sunday:
Six-year-old David Bogdan and 12-year-old Alexandra Andre, who will
both receive medical treatment for Leukemia.
	   Wearing a white lace dress and accompanied by her mother,
Alexandra burst into tears when asked by reporters how she felt
moments after landing in Israel for medical treatment.
	   ``This is the Holy Land and we hope God can help her,'' said
Alexandra's mother, Adriana, as she wiped away her daughter's
tears.
	   Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile brought the two children for
treatment in Israel as part of an agreement signed between the two
sides. Vasile began a four-day visit to Israel Sunday.
	   ``This is a gesture to the Romanian government who agreed to
have 28 Romanian children adopted by Israelis,'' said Israeli
Health Minister Yehoshua Matza, who greeted the delegation at the
airport.
	   Two more children will arrive next year for the expensive
transplants, Matza said. The Israeli government is covering the
costs for the treatment and taking care of relatives that came with
the children, Matza said.
	   ``We hope the transplant will be successful,'' said Constantine
Bogdan, who accompanied his grandson David on the flight.
	   Both children left the prime minister at the airport and were
taken to a Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem.
	   Shimon Slavin, director of bone marrow transplants at the
hospital, said bone marrow testing on the two children would begin
Monday and the hospital would search for donors from among
relatives and Israeli citizens.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia claimed it captured the stronghold of warlord Rashid Dostum
on Sunday, putting it on the doorstep of the main headquarters of
the opposition coalition.
	   Spokesman Abdul Hay Muttmayan, speaking from Taliban
headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, had few details on
the battle for Shebergan.
	   A day earlier, the Taliban claimed to be just 100 kilometers (60
miles) across flat desert from the town where Dostum had assembled
an arsenal of tanks, fighter jets and other equipment.
	   Azizullah Shasaq, a spokesman for the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia,
one of Dostum's partners, confirmed Shebergan had fallen. Shasaq
said Dostum had retreated south to the nearby town of Saritul and
reported by satellite phone late Sunday that he had suffered few
casualties and that fighting continued.
	   Mullah Omar, another Taliban spokesman, said his fighters had
captured numerous opposition soldiers, but he had no figures.
Taliban radio said Dostum's fighters set fire to Shebergan's
airport as they retreated.
	   The Taliban religious militia, which rules in most of
Afghanistan, has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory it controls. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school, confined most women to
their homes, forbidden all music except religious songs and banned
anything published outside Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.
	   Taliban fighters control about 85 percent of Afghanistan and
seem on the verge of taking the rest. Victories in recent days
could give them the momentum to capturing the only major prizes
left _ Mazar-e-Sharif, and the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul,
where President Burhanuddin Rabbani retreated after the Taliban
drove him from the capital in 1996.
	   The next Taliban target is likely to be Mazar-e-Sharif, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Shebergan. Omar said Taliban
fighters were already making gains around Mazar-e-Sharif, but
Shasaq said Mazar-e-Sharif was calm.
	   Taliban radio reported Sunday that fighters had broken through
enemy defense lines at Ahrytan, about 60 kilometers (about 40
miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif, indicating a two-pronged Taliban
offensive on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif in May, but
retreated after street battles that left several hundred of them
dead. It's believed that as many as 2,000 Taliban soldiers who
	   Fighting has been fierce in Faryab since early July, with both
sides claiming the upper hand as the anti-Taliban coalition
struggles to hold onto its last shreds of territory.
	   The Taliban religious militia, which rules in most of
Afghanistan, has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory it controls.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ No cars or cats this time. The fates finally
allowed Marco Pantani to finish victorious in the Tour de France he
had been preparing for throughout his career.
	   Even the rain, like the rain that dampened his Tour of Italy win
last month, retreated in time to give the 28-year-old Italian his
place in the sun.
	   His entire Mercatone Uno team -- with the exception of the
bald-domed Pantani -- dyed their hair yellow for victory day.
	   On the last day of last month's Tour of Italy, rain forced
organizers to annul the final stage.
	   This time, Pantani sipped Champagne on the final leg. The only
tension was when he got a flat tire on the Champs-Elysee.
	   With his Tour de France win, Pantani becomes the first rider to
take both the Italian and French races since Miguel Indurain
captured both in 1993.
	   But cats, cars and the fates haven't made it easy for Pantani,
regarded as a leading young rider when he turned pro in 1992.
	   He took third place in the 1994 Tour de France and won two
stages of the Tour of Italy that year. He was honored as top young
rider in the 1995 Tour de France, even though he finished 13th. He
came in third in the world championships one-day race.
	   Then disaster struck.
	   On Oct. 18, 1995, during the Milan to Turin race, Pantani hit a
car on a downhill portion and broke his leg in two places. He was
hospitalized for three months and needed more than a year to return
to cycling competitively.
	   He was doing well in the 1997 Tour of Italy when another mishap
occurred: he fell in a chain accident in the eighth stage when a
cat crossed his path. He injured the muscle in his left leg -- the
one he broke the year before.
	   Pantani withdrew from the race. But he recovered in time for the
Tour de France the following month and came in third, winning two
mountain stages.
	   Now, Pantani says he is confident that bad times are over.
	   Still, he said, ``my first victory in the Tour de France was the
most difficult because of all the doping stories and the police.''
	   Less than 100 of the original 189 riders finished this year's
Tour, dogged by police investigations into the use of
performance-enhancing drugs by some riders.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Religious Jews on Sunday observed Tisha B'Av _
a little known day of mourning that marks the destruction of the
biblical Jewish Temples.
	   The First Temple was believed to be destroyed by the Babylonians
in 586 B.C., and the second, by the Romans in A.D. 70. According to
Jewish tradition, both Temples were destroyed on the same day known
as Tisha B'Av, or the ninth day of the Jewish calender month of Av.
	   Tisha B'Av is preceded by a three week mourning period during
which observant Jews refrain from buying new clothes, shaving or
cutting their hair, eating meat, drinking alcohol and getting
married.
	   The day itself is observed with prayers and fasting.
	   Thousands of Jews gathered at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall _ the
last remaining remnant of the Temple _ to read from the book of
Lamentations and to mourn in public. The observance began Saturday
at sundown and ends on sundown Sunday.
	   During the prayers, a small group of extreme right-wing Jewish
demonstrators attempted to enter the Temple Mount, next to the
Wall. The site is home to one of Islam's holiest sites and is where
the ancient Jewish Temples are believed to have been located. The
group, which advocates removing the Muslim site and rebuilding the
ancient Temple in its place, is regularly prohibited by police from
entering the area.
	   Nine demonstrators were detained Sunday, police said.
	   The day is not observed by a majority of Israelis, most of whom
went about their everyday business.

Ex-prime minister spared court appearance in corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia, charged with abuse of power by anticorruption
officials, has been spared a possibly embarrassing court appearance
by a judge, court officials said Sunday.
	   City Judge Kazi Gulam Rasul rejected a plea by government
lawyers in the case relating to Zia's alleged misuse of power in
the appointment of hundreds of police officials during her
five-year tenure.
	   The judge accepted the plea of Zia's counsel Khondokar
Mahbubuddin Ahmed that she was ``seriously preoccupied'' with party
activities and therefore could not come to the court for hearings.
	   The petition also said Zia's presence would attract huge crowds
and possibly result in law and order problems and force traffic
disruptions.
	   Police have charged Zia with unlawfully canceling the
appointment of 287 police officials ordered by then-acting
President Shahabuddin Ahmed, and instead hiring 747 of her party
workers as police subinspectors. She has denied the charges.
	   If proved guilty, Zia may be punished with a prison term of up
to 10 years.
	   Zia lost her post in June 1996 to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Winston Cup question: Can anyone stop Gordon?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Jeff Gordon is making it tough to believe
there will be a chase for the Winston Cup championship.
	   The winner of Saturday's Brickyard 400 leads Indy runner-up Mark
Martin by 72 points and Dale Jarrett by 193. And he shows no signs
of weakness.
	   What' more, once Gordon gets the lead in the second half of the
season, he's hard to shake.
	   Gordon, who turns 27 on Tuesday, won his first title in 1995,
finished second to Hendrick Motorsports teammate Terry Labonte in
1996 and won the title again last year, beating Jarrett by 14
points.
	   Now he is on a tear again, with eight top-three finishes,
including four wins, in his last nine starts.
	   On Saturday, he became the first two-time stock car winner at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a track just 10 miles (16
kilometers)from Pittsboro, the town where Gordon spent most of his
teen years.
	   His Hoosier background gives him a special perspective on his
victories at Indy, home of the Indianapolis 500 since 1911 and the
Brickyard since 1994.
	   ``I'm really overwhelmed,'' he said. ``I love coming here. It
holds so much prestige. ... With winning this race, and with what's
going on my team, my life just keeps getting better.''
	   The victory brought Gordon a $1 million bonus from series
sponsor Winston, raising his total payday to a motorsports record
dlrs 1,637,625.
	   The victory also was a popular one with most of the 320,000
spectators who jammed the speedway. Gordon appeared more excited
about the crowd reaction than the big money.
	   Amid waves of applause and cheers, Gordon drove his Chevrolet
across the finish line under the last of nine caution flags.
	   ``It's an awesome thing to hear, especially when we go other
places it can go the way (boos),'' Gordon said. ``I love coming
here. The other day, when I got out of the car after qualifying
(third), you would have thought I won the pole. It's nice to
hear.''
	   This week, he and the rest of the Winston Cup drivers head to
the road course at Watkins Glen, New York, where he is defending
champion.
	   ``Those guys are doing everything right, right now,'' said
Martin, whose chance to catch Gordon on Saturday was cut short by a
multi-car crash near the rear of the field three laps from the end.
That forced the event to end under a yellow flag.
	   ``We're losing 10 points a race,'' Martin added. ``That's the
best we can do. He's won the race and led the most laps the last
two races. They're just on a roll. They've got us beat in a couple
of areas and we're doing all we can do to figure it out and catch
them.''
	   Jarrett lost four laps in the middle of the race because his
team miscalculated and he ran out of gas. That he made up all four
lost laps showed how strong his car was. But time ran out on
Jarrett, who finished 16th and lost ground in the points.
	   ``You can't afford to make mistakes like that because those guys
take advantage of it every time,'' Jarrett said of Gordon's team.
``As close as our racing is these days, any mistake is damaging.
	   ``But we've still got 14 races left, and a lot can happen to any
team out there.''

Greens party candidate fights accusations about student rebel days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Saying Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats are fighting dirty, Greens party candidate
Joschka Fischer rejects accusations about his 1970s days as a
violent student rebel, Der Spiegel magazine said Sunday.
	   In a separate report, Munich-based Focus magazine said that
Franz-Josef Jung, the Christian Democratic faction whip in Hesse
state parliament, demands Fischer tell the truth about his ties to
the unsolved killing of Hesse state Economics Minister Heinz
Herbert Kerry in 1981.
	   Fischer told Spiegel such insinuations were ``infamous,'' and
charged Kohl's coalition government was falling apart and turning
to a ``dirty campaign.''
	   Once a leader of the the so-called ``Spontis,'' a group of
Frankfurt University students who often clashed with police during
1970s building sit-ins or radical leftist demonstrations, Fischer
admitted that he was a part of that scene for nearly 10 years and
didn't always abide by the law.
	   Spiegel quoted Fischer as saying he could not remember ever
calling for the use of Molotov cocktails against police, as had
recently been reported by the media. ``In those times there was
sometimes some wild talk.''
	   Fischer also said he and others eventually broke off from any
violence ``because we realized that in the end it would lead to
terrorism,'' Spiegel said.
	   Asked about the accusation that his car was used to transport
weapons, one of which was used to murder Kerry, Spiegel quoted
Fischer as saying he had given the car to a ``then good
acquaintance, Hans-Joachim Klein.''
	   At the time Klein repaired cars for the leftist scene and was
supposed to replace the motor, but missed an appointment to return
the vehicle, the report said.
	   Fischer also said he had long ago voluntarily given all
information he had to investigators regarding the car, because ``I
didn't have anything to hide.''
	   Spiegel said Klein is wanted as a suspect in the 1975 attack
against OPEC oil ministers in Vienna, where three people were
killed.
	   Now 50 and seen as an established politician since becoming
Hesse state environment minister in 1985, Fischer has been
mentioned as Germany's possible foreign minister if the leftist
Social Democrats and Greens win enough votes in Sept. 27 elections
to form a coalition government.

Palestinian journalists union bars members from contacting
</HEADLINE>
Israelis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Journalists Association has
forbidden its members from engaging in non-professional contact
with Israelis and has threatened to blacklist journalists who break
the rules, an official from the organization said Sunday.
	   The decision was taken after the association participated in a
larger meeting of Arab press groups last week in Egypt.
	   ``We will form a blacklist of the names of all Palestinian and
Arab journalists,'' who normalize relations with Israel, said
Tawfiq Abu Khousa, vice-president of the Palestinian Journalists
Association in Gaza.
	   Abu Khousa said last week's conference of the Arab Journalist
Associations voted unanimously to ``confront and stop all forms of
normalization of relations with Israel.''
	   Abu Khousa said Palestinian journalists who ignore the ban and
meet with Israelis outside the professional sphere, would have
their names circulated throughout the Arab world and access to high
officials would be cut off.
	   He also said the journalists would be forbidden to participate
in academic forums with their Israeli counterparts.
	   But officials in Yasser Arafat's palestinian Authority said they
would not lend a hand to enforcing the rules of the
quasi-governmental journalists association.
	   ``No Palestinian journalist should worry about the threats of
the officials of the Palestinians Journalists's Association,'' said
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.

Bishop holds first mass in Bissau cathedral since military uprising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A Roman Catholic bishop held mass Sunday
in the cathedral in Guinea-Bissau's capital for the first time
since a military uprising plunged the country into bitter conflict
two months ago, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Bishop Septimio Ferrazzetta called on the government and the
rebels to build on a recent cease-fire to ensure lasting peace,
Lusa said.
	   ``Because you are the people's father, you must learn to
forgive,'' Ferrazzetta addressed President Joao Bernardo Vieira,
through his homily from the pulpit, the agency reported.
	   A group of military veterans, who fought in the colonial war
against Portugal from 1961 to 1975, mutinied when Vieira dismissed
Brig. Ansumane Mane as armed forces chief of staff, for allegedly
running arms to neighboring Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   ``We will tell Brig. Ansumane Mane that our community appeals to
his sense of humanity,'' Ferrazzetta said, according to Lusa.
	   The rebels seized the main military garrison and the airport of
the capital Bissau on June 7. They accused Vieira, himself the
leader of a previous coup who was confirmed in office by elections
in 1994, of corruption and demanded that he step down.
	   No numbers were available on how many were killed in the
fighting, that spread to inland areas of the small West African
country wedged between Senegal and Guinea.
	   Ferrazzetta said he was delighted with the turn-out at the
cathedral, Lusa reported. Hundreds of thousands of refugees
abandoned the shell-ravaged capital in June.
	   Last week, a delegation from Portuguese-speaking countries
mediated a cease-fire agreement on a Portuguese frigate moored off
the coast of Bissau. They were due to meet for a new round of talks
Aug. 7.

Albert Costa wins at Kitzbuehel for second time

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Spain's Albert Costa needed almost
three hours Sunday to beat Andrea Gaudenzi in a lackluster match
and win the Generali Open for the second time after 1995.
	   Costa, ranked 14th, picked up his eighth career title by
struggling past the Italian, 6-2, 1-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 at the dlrs
535,000 event.
	   There was little drama in the two hour, 50 minute match between
two clay court specialists as each set turned into a rout after an
early service break.
	   Both players appeared to lose their concentration at times, with
Costa regaining his in time to sweep the decisive set.
	   ``Maybe my mind was a little tired,'' said Costa, 23. ``You play
every week, fight in every match and now and then you lose your
concentration.''
	   The win is likely to move Costa near a Top 10 ranking, which the
Spaniard held last year before slumping out of the Top 20.
	   Costa, whose titles have all come on clay courts, captured the
biggest tournament of his career at Hamburg in May. He followed by
reaching the Italian Open final against Marcelo Rios the next week,
but was forced to drop out with a wrist injury.
	   Gaudenzi, who has climbed to world No. 36 after a shoulder
injury dropped him to 157 last year, reached his second final this
year after winning at Casablanca.
	   Costa, who beat Thomas Muster in five sets to win his first
title at Kitzbuehel, has now beaten Gaudenzi five straight times.
He is undefeated at Kitzbuehel, having won in both his appearances
here.
	   Costa took home dlrs 62,400 for the title and Gaudenzi won dlrs
36,700.

Gaze outduels fellow Seton Hall product Karnisovas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Andrew Gaze sank Arturas Karnisovas in the
battle of former Pirates.
	   Gaze led Australia past favored Lithuania and its own Seton Hall
product, Karnisovas, Sunday at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Gaze, 33, poured in a game-high 24 points, including 10 straight
down the stretch while playing with four fouls, as Australia
rallied for the 71-61 victory in second-round play.
	   ``When it was money time, he came through,'' Australian coach
Barry Barnes said of the gray-haired Gaze.
	   The 6-foot-7 (2.01-meter) forward helped Seton Hall reach the
1989 U.S. NCAA college championship game. Karnisovas arrived on
campus a year later.
	   ``We just could not stop Gaze in the second half,'' Karnisovas
said.
	   He entered the game as the tournament's leading scorer, with a
22.7 average, but shot just 2-for-6 from the field Sunday and
finished with 10 points.
	   ``I give a lot of credit to the Australian defense,'' said
Karnisovas, who plays home games with Greek League team Olympiakos
on the Peace and Friendship arena court that hosted Sunday's
contest. ``I just could not find opportunities to shoot or
participate on offense.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SKY HOOKS: &LR;  The game has changed, and so have the players.
	   That's the assessment on the state of the NBA delivered by
career scoring leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, in town during the
tournament to make sponsorship appearances.
	   The master of the sky hook, who won six NBA titles during his
20-year career with the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers, is
convinced his mark of 38,387 points will stand for some time.
	   ``The man who will break my career scoring record is probably
now 10 years old,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Since Michael Jordan is
going to retire and the young players make so much money that I
don't expect them to play for 20 years, I don't see any of today's
players breaking the record.''
	   The importance of the inside game has diminished, he said.
	   ``Since I left basketball, there have been big changes in the
game. The emphasis now is more in the perimeter than in the paint,
especially with the 3-pointers,'' Abdul-Jabbar said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   POSTING ODDS: &LR;  Lenny Wilkens knows a thing or two about scouting
teams.
	   After watching some action at the tournament, the NBA's all-time
leader in coaching wins touted Yugoslavia, Lithuania _ which upset
the United States in preliminary-round play last week _ and Greece
as the medal favorites.
	   But Wilkens, who coached Dream Team III to the Olympic title two
years ago in Atlanta, added that he thinks the U.S. team's early
loss could wind up working in its favor, providing motivation.
	   While in Athens, the Atlanta Hawks coach participated in a
coaching clinic for Greeks. Lakers coach Del Harris (here as an
assistant to U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich) and Chicago Bulls
strength coach Al Vermeil joined Wilkens at the camp.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   REBOUNDS: &LR;  Lithuania is without the country's top two centers _
the Portland Trail Blazers' Arvydas Sabonis and Zydrunas Ilgauskas
of the Cleveland Cavaliers _ but Eurelijus Zukauskas has proved an
intimidating force in the paint. He leads the worlds in blocked
shots, averaging better than 3 per game, and had a game-high nine
rebounds against Australia. ... International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch will attend the gold medal game
Sunday.

 &UR; Italian hero inspires new dishes and premier's culinary advice &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Vintages are being dedicated to Italy's newest hero,
and the Italian premier Sunday had some culinary advice for Marco
Pantani.
	   ``I ask him to construct his future victories continuing to,
above all, nourish himself with the `piadina' that his mother in
Cesenatico (an Adriatic resort town) prepared for him almost since
his birth,'' Premier Romano Prodi said as Pantani was pedaling his
way to Italy's first Tour de France victory in 33 years.
	   A ``piadina'' is a sandwich specialty from Prodi's and Pantani's
native region, Emilia Romagna, in north-central Italy. The sandwich
consists of round, unleavened bread, usually stuffed with ham or
cheese.
	   Prodi has something else in common with Pantani besides roots --
the premier is an avid cyclist.
	   Prodi praised Pantani as an ``athlete who made us relive the
legendary feats of great cycling of the past.''
	   ``I dare to think that Emilia-Romagna cooking has had a great
role in this victory,'' Prodi wrote in Sunday's Corriere della
Sera.
	   A wine shop in Alessandria, northern Italy, dedicated a Piedmont
wine after Pantani.

Castro arrives in Grenada amid cheers

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro
arrived Sunday to cheers in Grenada, the Caribbean island that was
the scene of a bloody Cold War confrontation between U.S. and Cuban
forces.
	   The visit to Grenada, a former French and British colony of
three islands tucked between Trinidad and St. Vincent, signals
Castro's renewed acceptance by his former Caribbean foes and their
frustration with U.S. economic policies.
	   At the airport Sunday, hundreds of Grenadians carried tiny Cuban
and Grenadian flags as they waited for Castro to step off his
airplane. One homemade banner said in Spanish, ``Long live the
friendship between Cuba and Grenada _ 19 years'' in reference to
Grenada's 1979 left-wing coup.
	   But opposition politicians, who were persecuted and jailed after
the pro-Cuban government of Maurice Bishop was installed in 1979,
are protesting human rights abuses in Cuba.
	   ``We experienced what happened to us here during 1979 to 1983,
when brave Americans came here and gave their lives to set us free.
So we are saying Castro must change,'' opposition leader Herbert
Preudhomme said recently.
	   Earlier Sunday Castro left Barbados after meeting with local
business leaders. After the meeting, he praised Caribbean countries
and businesses for fighting U.S. sanctions against Cuba.
	   Castro began his visit to Grenada by unveiling a plaque
commemorating Cuba's help in building Point Salines International
Airport, where he arrived.
	   Armed Cuban construction workers at the airport fought invading
U.S. soldiers and a token force of East Caribbean troops for three
days in 1983. Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 Americans
were killed.
	   When U.S. President Ronald Reagan visited Grenada in 1986, he
received a hero's welcome and prayed before a sculpture just
outside the airport dedicated to the U.S. dead. A plaque with all
their names is at the American School of Medicine at St. George's
University.
	   The United States invaded after hard-line Marxists executed
Bishop in a coup. The United States said it was worried about the
safety of American students there. Critics said the students were
never in danger.
	   Several coup leaders remain jailed in a fort overlooking the
university.
	   U.S. troops completed construction of the airport, which U.S.
strategists had feared would give Cuban missiles the range to
target South America.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, who welcomed the Cuban leader
Sunday, once was outspokenly anti-Castro. Like most other Caribbean
leaders, he now says times have changed and it is time to stop
isolating Cuba.
	   The Caribbean embrace of Cuba also marks frustration with the
United States. A much-touted new era in Washington-Caribbean
relations promised at a 1997 summit in Barbados has failed to
materialize along with promised trade benefits and U.S. aid, which
was slashed to dlrs 20 million last year from dlrs 225 million in
1986.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES traffic accidents in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Monster traffic jams clogged Spain's
highways this weekend as vacationers clogged the roads, forming
bumper-to-bumper caravans up to 50 kilometers (30 miles) long.
	   The worst nightmare came Saturday morning for Madrid residents
fleeing southeast to beaches in the Valencia region at the start of
their August vacation.
	   The drive to the city of Valencia normally takes about three
hours, but this time it was six, due in part to a 50-kilometer
stretch of stop-and-go traffic just outside Madrid.
	   Officials reported another bottleneck of 16 kilometers (10
miles) in Cuenca province, also on the way to Valencia, on
Saturday.
	   They said traffic was flowing smoothly Sunday but that the mass
exodus had seen 19 accidents that left at least 25 people dead.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite President Slobodan
Milosevic's pledge that his offensive against secessionist rebels
was over, government forces shelled and burned homes Sunday in an
apparent bid to drive ethnic Albanians from areas of Kosovo which
had been under rebel control.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting in the Drenica
area west of the provincial capital Pristina and in western Kosovo
near the Albanian border.
	   Each side blamed the other for starting the fighting, which
raged three days after Milosevic promised a European Union
delegation that the government's latest offensive against the
Kosovo Liberation Army was over.
	   In neighboring Albania, the state-run ATA news agency said eight
Albanians were killed Sunday by Serb shelling of villages in the
Drenica area. Serb sources said two policemen were killed and two
others injured in fighting near Prilep in southwestern Kosovo.
	   Witnesses said police used 20-milimeter anti-aircraft weapons to
fire on houses and KLA fighters in Prilep. Police eventually drove
guerrillas from the village, located along the main highway in the
area.
	   Albanian sources also reported fierce shelling near Junik and
other rebel-controlled villages near the Albanian border. The
report could not be confirmed.
	   The government offensive seemed aimed at delivering a strong
blow against independence-seeking Albanian rebels and drove tens of
thousands of civilians from their homes.
	   The rebels are expected to announce this week whether they will
endorse a U.S.-plan for peace talks between Milosevic and Albanian
politicians led by Ibrahim Rugova, whom the KLA had rejected
because of his non-violent stand.
	   In a lengthy commentary Sunday, the government's Tanjug news
agency said the ``efficient action'' by Serb forces had ``almost
entirely broken down terrorist gangs of the so-called Liberation
Army of Kosovo.''
	   On Sunday, explosions from mortar fire could be heard Sunday
near this village where the KLA maintains its headquarters. The
blasts grew ever louder, indicating the Serbs were on the march.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, convoys of panicked refugees fled
by foot, tractor or car along rocky dirt roads. There were headed
toward Likovac, where they hoped to find KLA protection.
	   Many said they had no where else to go. All told the same story
of Serb destruction, credible in its simplicity and consistency:
Serbs fired indiscriminately at the villages; terrified civiliand
gathered family members together and fled for their lives, leaving
behind all their possessions.
	   Serb troops them moved into the villages, looted anything of
value they could find, doused the homes with gasoline and set them
afire.
	   ``My house was burned today,'' Sanje Berisha, 33, sobbed as she
and about 100 others sheltered in a courtyard of a house near
Likovac.
	   The tactics were reminiscent of the campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' or the forced removal of rival ethnic groups, which
marked brutal conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia _ which had been part
of Yugoslavia.
	   At Likovac, a dusty, hilltop cluster of a dozen buildings around
a rockey open square, a KLA commander boasted that ``we have not
been defeated'' and that ``Serb attacks only make us stronger.''
	   But other KLA members, who refused to give their names for fear
of punishment by their commanders, admitted that they have been
unable to blunt the Serb advance and protect Albanian villages.
	   ``We are underarmed and we cannot defend them,'' one rebel said
of the dozen villages in the area which have come under Serb attack
since Milosevic declared the offensive over.
	   Despite reports last month that the rebels were receiving heavy
weapons, none were in sight. KLA fighters were carrying mostly
rifles and machine guns _ ineffective against government tanks,
armored personnel carriers, mortars and artillery.
	   Although Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million Kosovo
population, the province is part of Serbia, which along with
Montenegro forms Yugoslavia. Milosevic has promised to restore
autonomy which he withdrew in 1989.
	   But he and the major powers oppose independence, as demanded by
the KLA and most Kosovo Albanian leaders, fearing it would spread
the ethnic conflict to other Balkan countries with large Albanian
communities.

Police capture Italian wanted for 40 murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Police have captured a suspected mobster
wanted for some 40 killings blamed on a feud between Naples-area
crime clans, authorities said Sunday.
	   Maurizio Procida, 34, who had been a fugitive for seven years,
was arrested Saturday night in the countryside outside Avellino, a
town near Naples, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   Police were quoted as saying investigators believe that Procida
had a hand in some 40 slayings carried out from 1983 to 1991 during
a turf war among members of the Camorra, the Naples-area version of
the Sicilian Mafia.

Ex-Beatle joins campaign to stop U.S. monkey experiment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul McCartney has joined a campaign to ban
experiments at the University of California in which monkeys are
deliberately deafened.
	   ``It's a gross intrusion into the rights of harmless creatures.
Isn't it about time that we as a society started to show some
respect to innocent animals?'' McCartney was quoted as telling The
Sunday People tabloid.
	   His spokesman Geoff Baker said on Sunday that the ex-Beatle was
carrying on the animal rights campaign of his late wife, Linda, who
died in April.
	   ``Paul always stood shoulder to shoulder with Linda on these
animal rights issues and now he has taken up Linda's torch,'' Baker
said.
	   Six anesthetized monkeys at the University of California in San
Francisco are to be exposed to high frequency, high decible noise
to discover why millions of rock music fans suffer hearing damage.

 &UR; Italian hero inspires new dishes and premier's culinary advice &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: ADDS local reax &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Vintages are being dedicated to Italy's newest hero,
and the Italian premier Sunday had some culinary advice for Marco
Pantani.
	   ``I ask him to construct his future victories continuing to,
above all, nourish himself with the `piadina' that his mother in
Cesenatico (an Adriatic resort town) prepared for him almost since
his birth,'' Premier Romano Prodi said as Pantani was pedaling his
way to Italy's first Tour de France victory in 33 years.
	   A ``piadina'' is a sandwich specialty from Prodi's and Pantani's
native region, Emilia Romagna, in north-central Italy. The sandwich
consists of round, unleavened bread, usually stuffed with ham or
cheese.
	   Prodi has something else in common with Pantani besides roots --
the premier is an avid cyclist.
	   Prodi praised Pantani as an ``athlete who made us relive the
legendary feats of great cycling of the past.''
	   ``I dare to think that Emilia-Romagna cooking has had a great
role in this victory,'' Prodi wrote in Sunday's Corriere della
Sera.
	   A wine shop in Alessandria, northern Italy, dedicated a Piedmont
wine after Pantani.
	   In Cesnatico, a banner on a building read ``Pantani flies
high.'' Some 2,000 people took to bicycles in the town's streets to
celebrate the hometown man's victory.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces shelled and burned
ethnic Albanian homes Sunday in an apparent campaign to drive
ethnic Albanian civilians from areas of Kosovo that had been under
rebel control.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting in the Drenica
area west of the provincial capital Pristina and in western Kosovo
near the Albanian border.
	   Each side blamed the other for starting the fighting, which
raged three days after Yugoslav President Milosevic promised a
European Union delegation that the government's latest offensive
against the ethnic Albanian militants was over.
	   In neighboring Albania, the state-run ATA news agency said eight
ethnic Albanians were killed Sunday by Serb shelling of villages in
Kosovo's Drenica area. Serb sources said two police officers were
killed and two others injured in fighting near Prilep in
southwestern Kosovo.
	   Witnesses said police used 20-millimeter anti-aircraft weapons
to fire on houses and Kosovo Liberation Army fighters in Prilep.
Police eventually drove guerrillas from the village, located along
the main highway in the area.
	   Albanian sources also reported fierce shelling near Junik and
other rebel-controlled villages near the Albanian border. The
report could not be confirmed.
	   The government offensive seemed aimed at delivering a strong
blow against independence-seeking Albanian rebels and drove tens of
thousands of civilians from their homes.
	   The rebels are expected to announce this week whether they will
endorse a U.S.-plan for peace talks between Milosevic and Albanian
politicians led by Ibrahim Rugova, whom the KLA had rejected
because of his nonviolent stand.
	   Many ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, the stronger of two republics that form Yugoslavia. But
Serbs consider the province the cradle of their culture, and
Western powers prefer to see it remain part of Serbia, as border
changes in the Balkans often lead to further bloodshed.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants
of Kosovo.
	   In a lengthy commentary Sunday, the government's Tanjug news
agency said the ``efficient action'' by Serb forces had ``almost
entirely broken down terrorist gangs of the so-called Liberation
Army of Kosovo.''
	   Mortar fire could be heard Sunday near the village of Likovac,
where the KLA maintains its headquarters. The explosions grew
louder, indicating the Serbs were on the march.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, convoys of panicked refugees on
foot in tractors or cars headed toward Likovac, where they hoped to
find KLA protection.
	   Many said they had nowhere else to go. All told the same story
of Serb destruction: Serbs fired indiscriminately at the villages;
terrified civilians gathered family members and fled for their
lives, leaving behind all their possessions.
	   Serb troops then moved into the villages, looting everything of
value, dousing the homes with gasoline and setting them on fire.
	   ``My house was burned today,'' Sanje Berisha, 33, sobbed as she
and about 100 others took refuge in a courtyard of a house near
Likovac.
	   The tactics were reminiscent of the campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' or the forced removal of rival ethnic groups, that
marked brutal conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia, which had been part
of Yugoslavia.
	   At Likovac, a dusty, hilltop cluster of a dozen buildings around
a rocky, open square, a KLA commander boasted that ``we have not
been defeated'' and that ``Serb attacks only make us stronger.''
	   But other KLA members, who refused to give their names for fear
of punishment by their commanders, admitted that they have been
unable to blunt the Serb advance and protect Albanian villages.
	   ``We are underarmed and we cannot defend them,'' one rebel said
of the dozen villages in the area that have come under Serb attack
since Milosevic declared the offensive over.
	   Despite reports last month that the rebels were receiving heavy
weapons, none were in sight. KLA fighters were carrying mostly
rifles and machine guns _ ineffective against government tanks,
armored personnel carriers, mortars and artillery.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A state opposition party official who was
arrested for allegedly plundering public property has been freed
and given an apology by judicial authorities in Guerrero state, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   David Molina Francisco, president of the state council of the
Democratic Revolution Party, was released Friday in the Pacific
resort city of Acapulco, the daily Reforma reported.
	   Molina had been arrested Thursday in Coyuca de Benitez, 20 miles
(32 kilometers) northwest of Acapulco, where he was accused of
illegally building housing on a public basketball court.
	   Molina said Public Ministry officials told him his arrest had
been a mistake, the newspaper said. Molina called it part of a
campaign in the state to harass leaders of the leftist party, known
as the PRD.
	   The PRD is one of Mexico's three major parties and is the main
rival of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
in Guerrero.
	   Leaders of the state government, controlled by the PRI,
previously accused Molina of involvement in the Popular
Revolutionary Army, a leftist rebel group.
	   Last month, PRD leaders reported that gunmen had kidnapped one
activist, Alfredo Barragan, at a rally in Guerrero. State police
denied knowing anything about him for two days _ then turned him
over to a prison. Officials charged him with embezzlement and
claimed he was a rebel.
	   Barragan said he was tortured.
	   The PRD also claims that scores of its activists in Guerrero
have died in political violence over the past decade. Officials say
the incidents were common crimes, not political ones.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The world's biggest cycling race staged its grand
finale Sunday in Paris, whizzing up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc
de Triomphe. But the mood was neither grand nor triumphant.
	   With the Tour plagued from the start by a doping scandal, many
just seemed glad to see it end.
	   ``It's kind of been spoiled this time,'' said 14-year-old Maxime
Ouanhon, who came to watch the end of an event that is both a
cherished tradition and a deep source of pride.
	   He and his little brother, Alexi, saw Marco Pantani become the
first Italian to win since 1965. Defending champion Jan Ullrich of
Germany came in second, and American Bobby Julich was third.
	   But the talk in France was less about cycling and more about the
doping revelations that seemed to snowball each day for three long
weeks.
	   ``A Legend Shattered,'' read Sunday's headline in Le Monde, the
respected daily that shocked the cycling world in mid-race by
calling for the Tour to be stopped.
	   To emphasize the point, a front-page cartoon displayed an
undertaker at the podium, handing out a medal shaped as a syringe.
	   Yet it showed not only a cyclist on the podium but also a
swimmer and a weight-lifter, underscoring a widely held conviction
among French fans: that doping affects many sports, and the
cyclists were singled out unfairly.
	   ``This happens in every sport, in every country,'' said
Christiane LeBarbu, from Clermont-Ferrand in central France. ``We
shouldn't just draw conclusions about the cyclists.''
	   Her husband, Alain, said the doping was ``an international
problem'' _ and that it hadn't at all spoiled French euphoria over
winning the World Cup last month.
	   Indeed, the World Cup victory seemed foremost on fan's minds
during the early part of the Tour, with signs along the road saying
``Allez les Bleus,'' for the French soccer team, or thanking the
French soccer coach for the stunning victory.
	   But as the race wound its way through the French countryside,
and the doping investigation widened, the slogans changed. Most
fans expressed support for the cyclists and anger at police, whose
methods they saw as too aggressive.
	   ``We are with you!'' one banner said in eastern France. ``It's
hypocrisy!'' said another in Switzerland.
	   The Tour de France has been around since 1903, stopping only for
the two world wars. It unites the French people more than any other
regular sporting event, because it travels to them _ and doesn't
cost a centime.
	   ``I've been here for the ending 23 times,'' Jacky Muzard said
proudly on the Champs-Elysees. ``I'm very relieved _ I thought it
might not make it this time.'' He wore a Tour de France T-shirt
from 1976 that he's donned each year since.
	   The scandal began a few days before the race started, when a
masseur for the Festina team was found with a carload of dopants.
When the team director admitted to an organized system of doping,
Festina was expelled.
	   Subsequent police raids turned up alleged doping among other
teams. To date, seven people have been placed under formal
investigation _ a step short of being charged _ including one
cyclist, Rodolfo Massi of Italy.
	   The riders, angered at police treatment, went on strike for a
day, forcing the 17th stage to be annulled. Six teams pulled out.
	   On Sunday, fans seemed to realize how precarious the state of
their beloved race was.
	   ``Normally I'd be watching on TV, but this time I came out to
show I care,'' said 54-year-old Jean-Pierre Soudrie. ``I love
cycling. I'm not saying doping is a good thing, but no one in the
world is perfect.''

uprising &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A Roman Catholic bishop held mass Sunday
in the cathedral in Guinea-Bissau's capital for the first time
since a military uprising plunged the former Portuguese colony into
bitter conflict two months ago, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
	   Bishop Septimio Ferrazzetta called on the government and the
rebels to build on a recent cease-fire to ensure lasting peace,
Lusa said.
	   He asked President Joao Bernardo Vieira to forgive the rebels,
the agency reported.
	   A group of military veterans, who fought in the colonial war
against Portugal from 1961 to 1975, mutinied when Vieira dismissed
Brig. Ansumane Mane as armed forces chief of staff, for allegedly
running arms to neighboring Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   ``We will tell Brig. Ansumane Mane that our community appeals to
his sense of humanity,'' Ferrazzetta said, according to Lusa.
	   The rebels seized the main military garrison and the airport of
the capital Bissau on June 7. They accused Vieira, himself the
leader of a previous coup who was confirmed in office by elections
in 1994, of corruption and demanded that he step down.
	   Last week, a delegation from Portuguese-speaking countries
mediated a cease-fire agreement on a Portuguese frigate moored off
the coast of Bissau. They were due to meet for a new round of talks
Aug. 7.

New hope for 10 men buried for 16 days in Austrian mine

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A camera lowered down an emergency shaft
showed no signs of life in a 130-meter (430-foot) cavern where
rescuers believe 10 men buried more than two weeks ago in an
Austrian mine may have taken refuge, an official said Sunday.
	   ``We are very disappointed because we could see nothing,'' Fritz
Stangl, deputy mayor of the village of Lassing, told the Austrian
Press Agency. ``But we are not giving up hope.''
	   The failure to detect signs of life in the subterranean
compartment was the latest setback in rescue efforts in the wake of
the worst mining accident in Austria since World War II.
	   The 10 men were part of a rescue team sent into the talc mine
190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna on July 17, when a
landslide buried miner Georg Hainzl. A second, stronger mudslide
buried them too, and officials declared there was no chance anyone
survived.
	   But rescue efforts intensified July 26 when Hainzl was found
alive and in relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Hainzl,
however, was in a different part of the talc mine closer to the
surface.
	   Hopes for the 10 others increased Sunday when rescuers drilled a
20-centimeter (8 inch) shaft into the cavern, where experts
believed the men were trapped.
	   Rescuers then lowered a camera and a microphone down the shaft.
But Stangl told APA that no signs of life were detected. He said
the chamber was too dark to tell whether anyone was there at all.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said the shaft might have to
be reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process which could
take days.
	   Four members of a German rescue team had tried to enter the mine
through another emergency shaft but had to return to the surface
because mud and water blocked their descent.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one could be completed.

forces.
	   Leaving his airplane, Castro clasped his hands over his heart as
hundreds of Grenadians roared a welcome and began singing lines
from a revolutionary hymn, ``Forward march, forward march against
imperialism!'' They unfurled a gigantic banner reading in Spanish,
``Long live the ideas of the Cuban revolution.''
	   The visit to Grenada, a former French and British colony of
three islands tucked between Trinidad and St. Vincent, signals
Castro's renewed acceptance by his former Caribbean foes and their
frustration with U.S. economic policies.
	   At the airport Sunday, hundreds of Grenadians carried tiny Cuban
and Grenadian flags as they waited for Castro to step off his
airplane. One homemade banner said in Spanish, ``Long live the
friendship between Cuba and Grenada _ 19 years'' in reference to
Grenada's 1979 left-wing coup.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell said it was time to ``set the
record straight'' with Cuba and called the early 1980s, when Cuba
and the United States vied for influence on the island, a time of
``hatred and divisiveness.''
	   But opposition politicians, who were persecuted and jailed after
the pro-Cuban government of Maurice Bishop was installed in 1979,
are protesting human rights abuses in Cuba.
	   ``We experienced what happened to us here during 1979 to 1983,
when brave Americans came here and gave their lives to set us free.
So we are saying Castro must change,'' opposition leader Herbert
Preudhomme said recently.
	   Earlier Sunday Castro left Barbados after meeting with local
business leaders. After the meeting, he praised Caribbean countries
and businesses for fighting U.S. sanctions against Cuba.
	   Castro began his visit to Grenada by unveiling a plaque
commemorating Cuba's help in building Point Salines International
Airport, where he arrived.
	   Armed Cuban construction workers at the airport fought invading
U.S. soldiers and a token force of East Caribbean troops for three
days in 1983. Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 Americans
were killed.
	   When U.S. President Ronald Reagan visited Grenada in 1986, he
received a hero's welcome and prayed before a sculpture just
outside the airport dedicated to the U.S. dead. A plaque with all
their names is at the American School of Medicine at St. George's
University.
	   The United States invaded after hard-line Marxists executed
Bishop in a coup. The United States said it was worried about the
safety of American students there. Critics said the students were
never in danger.
	   Several coup leaders remain jailed in a fort overlooking the
university.
	   U.S. troops completed construction of the airport, which U.S.
strategists had feared would give Cuban missiles the range to
target South America.
	   Mitchell once was outspokenly anti-Castro. Like most other
Caribbean leaders, he now says times have changed and it is time to
stop isolating Cuba.
	   The Caribbean embrace of Cuba also marks frustration with the
United States. A much-touted new era in Washington-Caribbean
relations promised at a 1997 summit in Barbados has failed to
materialize along with promised trade benefits and U.S. aid, which
was slashed to dlrs 20 million last year from dlrs 225 million in
1986.

	   PARIS, France (AP) _ It was almost a sign. After a heavy shower,
the sun came out for Marco Pantani.
	   The Italian wore the bright yellow jersey as winner of the Tour
de France Sunday _ a race with a cloud over it ever since before
the beginning in Dublin, due to a growing doping scandal.
	   Pantani did his best to divert attention from it, riding
magnificently in the mountains. He was the first to win both the
Tour of Italy and the Tour de France in one year since cycling
great Miguel Indurain did it five years ago.
	   ``To win the Giro and the Tour de France is something my country
has been waiting for a long time,'' Pantani said. ``This day will
remain one of the most important days in my life.''
	   Pantani, who rides for the Mercatone Uno team, is the first
Italian to win the Tour since Felice Gimondi in 1965.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, the defending champion, came in second
by 3 minutes and 21 seconds, and American Bobby Julich came in
third, at 4:08.
	   Tom Steels of Belgium took the 21st and final stage on the
Champs-Elysees in Paris. It was Steels' fourth stage win of this
Tour. He won the first stage in Dublin three weeks ago.
	   The final day crowd, including vacationing Italians, cheered
Pantani every time he passed, easily spotting the leader's yellow
jersey.
	   Pantani finished the 147-kilometer (91-mile) stage from Melun to
Paris in the pack, coming in 45th.
	   Even after a flat tire held him up for less than a minute,
Pantani was able to get back to the pack easily and finish with it.
	   Julich, riding with the French Cofidis team, became the second
American to finish in the top three, after three-time winner Greg
LeMond.
	   LeMond was third in his first year on the Tour in 1984 before
winning in 1986, 1989 and 1990. This is Julich's second Tour.
	   He knows it will be hard to beat Pantani.
	   ``This year I had little chance to win. Pantani was on another
planet. When he attacks the mountains, no one can match him,''
Julich said.
	   Pantani took the lead last Monday, after Ullrich lost nine
minutes in one day on the 15th stage to Les Deux Alpes.
	   The Italian came in third in both 1994 and 1997, and lost by
more than 14 minutes to Ullrich last year. He had a severe accident
at the end of 1995 and did not race in 1996, recovering from a leg
broken in two places.
	   After a heavy rainshower, the sun came out for the final minutes
and the traditional nine laps up and down the Champs-Elysees, from
the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde.
	   Usually the finale of the grueling three-week competition is
cause for revelry. But this year, there was a sense that the end
could not come soon enough for a pack whose numbers dwindled as the
race went on.
	   Nearly each day since the start of the Tour July 11, there have
been new doping revelations, police searches and rider protests.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams ended the race; six dropped out
and one, Festina, was expelled. The pack was reduced to less than
100 riders from the original 189.
	   While riders criss-crossed France, seven people were placed
under investigation _ one step short of being charged _ on
doping-related charges: three officials of the Festina team, two
from TVM, a doctor from ONCE and one rider, Italian Rodolfo Massi
of the Casino team, the Tour's leading mountain climber.
	   Festina was expelled on July 17, after team director Bruno
Roussel admitted to an organized system of providing
performance-enhancing drugs to his riders.
	   On Monday, TVM team riders are to be questioned by judicial
police in Reims.
	   The 1999 Tour de France is scheduled to begin in Puy-du-Fou.

Yugoslavia continues unbeaten run; Lithuania falls from unbeaten

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, emerging as the favorite to
win the World Basketball Championship, continued its unbeaten run
in a rout of Canada 95-55 in second-round play Sunday.
	   Not such good news for Lithuania, which fell to 3-1 with a 71-61
loss to Australia behind Andrew Gaze's game-high 24. The Boomers,
Goodwill Games silver medalists last month, improved to 2-2 and
kept their chances alive for a coveted quarterfinal berth.
	   The starless Americans (3-1) were on top almost from the start
but waited until late to pull away cleanly from Argentina in an
87-74 victory as Wendell Alexis had 20, Jimmy Oliver 18 and Michael
Hawkins 15.
	   Marcelo Nicola had 26 to lead Argentina with 18 form Fabricio
Oberto. The Argentines played without one of their top players Hugo
Sconochini, who picked up an injured left leg in the last game.
	   Russia also reached 3-1, beating Italy (2-2) 71-55 as Serguei
Babkov scored 26 and Mikhail Mikhailov added 15 rebounds. Italy was
led by Gregor Fucka with 15 points.
	   At 4-0, European champion Yugoslavia boasts the tournament's
best record although Spain and Greece could each match it in late
games Sunday as Spain faced Brazil and Greece played Puerto Rico.
	   Yugoslavia had three players in double figures and saw all 12
players score, topped by Miroslav Beric with 13 points and Dejan
Tomasevic with 14 rebounds.
	   ``It was a good old-fashioned butt-kicking by a very good
basketball team,'' Canadian coach Steve Konchalski said.
	   Yugoslavia barged to a 44-23 halftime advantage with trademark
dominating defense. It added the dagger with a 19-2 run against
Canada (1-3) early in the second half and led by as many as 43.
	   Greg Newton led the losers with 14 and the loss means Canada has
virtually no chance of making the quarters.
	   ``My team managed to get into the game from the first minute and
we didn't allow Canada to be dangerous,'' said Yugoslavia coach
Zeljko Obradovic.
	   Lithuania was up 37-35 at halftime after Australia led by as
many as six early in the game. But Australia used a 14-2 run early
in the second half _ capitalizing on tenacious defense and power
inside play _ to take control.
	   Gaze, a 6-foot-7 (2.01) forward, took charge in the last five
minutes, scoring all 10 of Australia's points in one stretch _ two
on 3-pointers. Saulius Stombergas led Lithuania with 17.
	   The Aussies, who have lost two games here by a combined five
points, also put the wraps on Lithuanian forward Arturas Karnisovas
who had only 10 points after averaging a tournament-high 22.7 in
the first three games.
	   ``Lithuania started a small group and we felt we could go and
exploit that,'' said assistant coach Alan Black. ``After the two
close losses, hopefully this will give us the confidence we need.''
	   In consolation games, Nigeria (1-3) defeated South Korea (0-4)
89-65 and Japan (1-3) edged Senegal (0-4) 66-55 after trailing by
seven early.

Palestinian journalists union bars members from contacting Israelis

journalist, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Journalists Association has
forbidden its members from engaging in non-professional contact
with Israelis and has threatened to blacklist journalists who break
the rules, an official from the organization said Sunday.
	   The decision was taken after the association participated in a
larger meeting of Arab press groups last week in Egypt.
	   ``We will form a blacklist of the names of all Palestinian and
Arab journalists,'' who normalize relations with Israel, said
Tawfiq Abu Khousa, vice-president of the Palestinian Journalists
Association in Gaza.
	   Abu Khousa said last week's conference of the Arab Journalist
Associations voted unanimously to ``confront and stop all forms of
normalization of relations with Israel.''
	   Abu Khousa said Palestinian journalists who ignore the ban and
meet with Israelis outside the professional sphere, would have
their names circulated throughout the Arab world and access to high
officials would be cut off.
	   He also said the journalists would be forbidden to participate
in academic forums with their Israeli counterparts.
	   But officials in Yasser Arafat's palestinian Authority said they
would not lend a hand to enforcing the rules of the
quasi-governmental journalists association.
	   ``No Palestinian journalist should worry about the threats of
the officials of the Palestinians Journalists's Association,'' said
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.
	   Israeli and Palestinian journalists have worked together for
years, often forming friendships despite tensions between the two
peoples and a current 17-month stalemate in Mideast peace talks.
	   Khaled Abu Aker, a Palestinian reporter who works for several
U.S. newspapers including The New York Times scoffed at Abu
Khousa's threats and said the comments would alienate members.
	   ``Our meetings with Israelis are not normalization.
Normalization means accepting the other's world view, and we would
never accept Israel's world view,'' he said.

Italian generals scoff at accusations over Italian tragedy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS with defense minister calling failure to find cause
``a defeat.'' CORRECTS date from 1981 to 1980 in 6th graf, The
prosecutors etc; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's defense minister on Sunday described as a
``defeat for everyone'' Rome prosecutors' failure, after 18 years
of inquiry, to find out what caused a domestic airliner to crash
into the Mediterranean in one of the nation's most enduring
mysteries.
	   The prosecutors on Saturday, in a 900-page request for the
indictment of 10 air force officials for allegedly blocking the
probe, concluded that whatever caused an Italian jetliner to crash
into the Mediterranean -- bomb, missile or something else -- is
still unknown.
	   ``A long probe which doesn't end with the ascertainment of the
causes and those responsible for the awful affair is a defeat for
everyone,'' Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta was quoted as
saying by the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   All 81 people aboard the DC-9 perished in the 1980 crash.
	   The prosecutors are formally seeking trial for four retired
Italian air force generals and six other officers for an alleged
cover-up.
	   ``What a joke, they say that I lie and they still don't know the
truth,'' La Repubblica newspaper headlined its interview with one
of the retired generals.
	   ``If the investigating magistrates say that no one can be
prosecuted for the crime of massacre, than for what, why and how
would I have thrown them off the trail?'' the Rome daily quoted
retired Gen. Franco Ferri as saying.
	   The prosecutors called a news conference for Monday which could
shed light on whether investigators intend to keep on searching for
a possible culprit for the June 27, 1980, crash near Ustica, a tiny
island north of Sicily.
	   The prosecutors added that there was no conclusive proof that
the plane, on a Bologna-Palermo flight of now-defunct Itavia
airlines, was deliberately brought down nor was there proof of the
much-debated Libyan connection.
	   Since the tragedy occurred when Italy was gripped by domestic
terrorism, theories have included a bomb going off. Others
theorized that a missile -- possibly fired by a Western war plane
trying to hit an aircraft flying Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi --
brought down the Itavia jet.
	   The prosecutors suggested American planes might have been in the
area, according to newpaper accounts of the indictment request.
	   French, U.S. and NATO officials have long denied any military
activity in the skies that night.
	   In 1989, a panel concluded the jet was struck by a missile. A
year later, a new inquiry by experts blamed a bomb.
	   Mechanical failure was previously ruled out.
	   Italian experts even differed about the discovery of the
wreckage of a Libyan Mig in the mountains of Calabria a few weeks
after the Ustica crash.
	   At first, a coroner dated the death of the Libyan pilot to about
the time of the Itavia crash. Later, a report put the date of death
to approximately when the Libyan jet's wreckage was found.

Torian beats Johnson, Jackson, Crear again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Reggie Torian pulled away from world
and Olympic champion Allen Johnson and world record holder Colin
Jackson in the final 20 meters Sunday to show why he's the fastest
110-meter hurdler around.
	   Winner of the U.S. title at New Orleans, Torian was level with
the two bigger name hurdlers at halfway in a British Grand Prix
race which had the five fastest of the year in the field.
	   But he hit the front as they cleared the final hurdle and, as he
crossed the finish line, looked to his left to see he had edged his
rivals again.
	   He clocked 13.15 seconds compared with his time of 13.03 at New
Orleans June 21 and Johnson took second in 13.22 with Jackson third
in 13.24.
	   ``It was really really Allen and and me hurdle for hurdle and I
just stole it at the end,'' said Torian, who has beaten Johnson
three times this year. ``It's my goal to keep winning races and go
into next year's World Championship season as No. 1.
	   ``It's important to drop in a fast time early in the season and
then keep winning. Especially in a race like this. It wasn't the
best race, it wasn't the best times but everyone was there.''
	   Goodwill Games winner Mark Crear wound up fourth in 13.33 while
Courtney Hawkins appeared in contention until he had an ugly fall
three hurdles from home and wound up lying on his back on the
track.
	   Melissa Morrison powered past Jamaica's Michelle Freeman in the
final 15 meters to win the women's 100 meters hurdles in 12.74 with
fellow American Angie Vaugn third.
	   ``I felt a bit sluggish at the beginning after a couple of false
starts,'' said Morrison. ``I just didn't feel very relaxed in the
blocks but I want out and gave it all I had and come out
victorious.
	   ``A victory over Angie, who beat me at the Goodwill Games. I
can't really ask for more.''
	   World champion Stephane Diagana of France won the men's 400
hurdles in 48.70, world record holder Jonathan Edwards leaped 17.14
to win the triple jump.
	   Mahjoub Haida led countryman Benjounes Lahlou home ahead of
Kenya's David Cheruiyot for a Moroccan 1-2 i the 800 meters,
clocking 1 minute 45.03 seconds. But Kenya's Paul Tergat, a former
10,000-meter world record holder and four-time world cross country
titlist, left three Moroccans trailing with a victory in the 3,000
meters in 7 minutes 39.50 seconds.

team's efforts to enter mine failing. CHANGES overline. ADDS

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A camera lowered down an emergency shaft
revealed no signs of life in a 130-meter (430-foot) cavern where
rescuers believe 10 men buried more than two weeks ago in an
Austrian mine may have taken refuge, an official said Sunday.
	   ``We are very disappointed because we could see nothing,'' Fritz
Stangl, deputy mayor of the village of Lassing, told the Austrian
Press Agency. ``But we are not giving up hope.''
	   The failure to detect signs of life in the subterranean
compartment was the latest setback in rescue efforts in the wake of
the worst mining accident in Austria since World War II.
	   The 10 men were part of a rescue team sent into the talc mine
190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna on July 17, when a
landslide buried miner Georg Hainzl. A second, stronger mudslide
buried them too, and officials said there was no chance anyone
survived.
	   But rescue efforts intensified July 26 when Hainzl was found
alive and in relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Hainzl,
however, was in a different part of the talc mine and was closer to
the surface.
	   Hopes for the 10 others increased Sunday when rescuers drilled a
20-centimeter (8 inch) shaft into the cavern, where experts
believed the men were trapped.
	   Rescuers then lowered a camera and a microphone down the shaft.
But Stangl told APA that no signs of life were detected. He said
the chamber was too dark to tell whether anyone was there at all.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said the shaft might have to
be reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process that could take
days.
	   Four members of a German rescue team had tried to enter the mine
through another emergency shaft but had to return to the surface
because mud and water blocked their descent.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one could be completed.

Palestinians: Monday may be last chance for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ This week may be the last for
direct Mideast peace talks unless Israel accepts an American peace
plan to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank, a
Palestinian official said Sunday.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said a crucial Monday meeting scheduled between negotiators
would be the deciding factor for the continuation of talks.
	   ``If the Israelis are not going to present something new on
accepting the American proposals, then tomorrow's meeting may be
the last direct meeting between the two sides,'' Abourdeneh told
The Associated Press.
	   American efforts to mediate an end to 17 months of stalemate in
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations failed to yield a
breakthrough. The United States could not get Israel to agree to a
set of ideas it presented to revive talks and ultimately told the
sides it was up to them to negotiate an end to the impasse.
	   Two weeks ago senior negotiators from both sides began meeting
directly for the first time in months but the Palestinians have
complained that no progress has been made and that Israel has
continued to resist the American proposal.
	   However, Israeli officials said that only small gaps remained
between the sides and warned the Palestinians to refrain from
issuing ultimatums.
	   ``Threats or bombastic statements are not going to move the
peace process forward,'' said Israeli government spokesman Moshe
Fogel.
	   ``We are coming to the negotiating table in good faith ... but
it is going to take both sides to succeed and if the Palestinians
believe that by threatening to end the talks ... that they are
going to succeed in achieving everything that they demand, then
they are miscalculating,'' Fogel said.

Red ink won't slow Goodwill Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Next stop, Brisbane.
	   The Goodwill Games press on, undisturbed by the sea of red ink
that got even deeper in the 15 days that Ted Turner's mini-Olympics
played in New York and its Long Island suburbs.
	   The nation's largest city took a mostly ho-hum approach to the
games, which ended Sunday, ensuring that for the fourth straight
time they would lose money.
	   But Turner never viewed his pet project in terms of dollars and
cents, willingly absorbing millions in losses for more ambitious
gains. And Time Warner Inc., which now owns Turner's company and
with it the Goodwill Games, embraces the same point of view.
	   So Michael Plant, president of the games, shrugged off the
question of financial issues on the eve of Sunday's closing
celebration.
	   ``We always use the word `investment,''' Plant said. ``We still
believe at the end of the day, this will be the most financially
successful games.''
	   That is to say Plant expects the 1998 games won't add
substantially to the dlrs 109 million Turner lost on the first
three editions of this made-for-television event.
	   ``We will not discuss any final tally of revenue or expenses, as
is the policy with any other project of the company,'' Plant said.
``The people at the top are pleased with the results of the '98
games.''
	   So much so that plans are moving ahead for the next edition, set
for 2001 in Brisbane, Australia. That program will have 12 sports
plus surf-lifesaving, with wrestling, water polo, synchronized
swimming and soccer dropped.
	   Plant said Goodwill officials will have an operational plan in
place within six months and a marketing plan set by March 1. There
is even talk of adding a winter edition of the games.
	   With television ratings up 25 percent from four years ago,
organizers remain upbeat despite huge sections of empty seats for
many events in New York. Even the figure skating, which featured
such big names as Michelle Kwan and Todd Eldredge, struggled for
fans. Only when organizers offered cut-rate dlrs 5 seats in the
upper level of Nassau Coliseum did the building fill up.
	   Kwan and Eldredge did their parts, winning gold medals in figure
skating. So did the other major players including Michael Johnson,
Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Dan O'Brien in track and field, Cuban
heavyweight boxer Felix Savon, swimmers Jenny Thompson and
Aleksandr Popov, and the U.S. basketball, wrestling and women's
soccer teams.
	   Their successes, however, must be balanced with the accident
that left Chinese gymnast Sang Lan paralyzed. There also was a
brief political protest that interrupted the U.S.-Iran wrestling
match.
	   ``The best is always when you go to an event and see what you
have worked for unfold on the field of play,'' Plant said. ``The
worst is when something tragic happens _ like the case of Sang Lan
_ that affects everyone deeply.''
	   Sang remains in Mount Sinai Hospital, where she is beginning
rehabilitation for her spinal cord injury. Doctors have said it is
unlikely she will walk again.
	   Sang's tragedy created more attention than many of the events at
the games and ticket sales never picked up any momentum.
	   ``Our expectations when we started were to sell and distribute
around 350-400,000 (tickets) based on 600,000 seats available,''
Plant said. ``By the end of the games, we think we will be at that
350,000 number.
	   ``Looking at New York, we were not naive enough to believe that
we would sell out basketball every night. This is a very busy time
of year _ and a challenging market in which to generate
spectators.''
	   Television has provided the best numbers for the organizers.
Through Wednesday, Goodwill Games telecasts on the WTBS averaged
1.5, slightly higher than for Atlanta Braves games on the
superstation and up 25 percent from the 1994 games in St.
Petersburg, Russia.
	   Plant said the Goodwill Games is satisfied at having met three
goals:
	   _produce compelling television.
	   _provide an opportunity for New York and Long Island to have a
world-class event.
	   _help youngsters through various programs.
	   Originally, the games were aimed at promoting world peace. With
the Cold War over, the agenda now is to help children by raising
money for the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs and UNICEF. Plant said dlrs 5
million was raised for those charities.
	   ``There is no corporate mandate that the games must turn a
profit,'' Plant said. ``The games do more than just contribute to
the bottom line.''

	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Debbie Keller scored two first-half
goals and No. 2 goalkeeper Tracy Ducar got her third shutout of the
season Sunday as the U.S. women's soccer team defeated Canada 4-0.
	   Keller scored off a save of Kristine Lilly's shot in the 25th
minute and added an unassisted goal in the 37th minute for a 2-0
halftime lead. Tiffeny Milbrett and Julie Foudy added second-half
goals.
	   The Americans have won 18 of 19 games against Canada, including
17 straight, since the teams met for the first time in 1986. The
U.S. outshot the Canadians 35-3.
	   The U.S. hit the post twice, had one shot strike the crossbar
off a save and two more blocked in the first 20 minutes of the
second half. Meanwhile, Ducar had her only two saves in the first
half.
	   Milbrett scored on a pass from Foudy in the 61st minute for a
3-0 U.S. lead. The players swapped roles, with Foudy scoring on an
assist from Milbrett in the 88th minute.
	   The shutout was the 13th this season for the U.S. women.
	   The match, played at the Florida Citrus Bowl, was part of a
doubleheader with the Major League Soccer All-Star game.

	   PARIS, France (AP) _ It was almost a sign. After a heavy shower,
the sun came out for Marco Pantani.
	   The Italian wore the bright yellow jersey as winner of the Tour
de France Sunday _ a race with a cloud over it ever since it began
three weeks earlier in Dublin, Ireland, due to a growing doping
scandal.
	   Pantani did his best to divert attention from it, riding
magnificently in the mountains. He was the first to win both the
Tour of Italy and the Tour de France in one year since cycling
great Miguel Indurain did it five years ago.
	   ``To win the Giro and the Tour de France is something my country
has been waiting for a long time,'' Pantani said. ``This day will
remain one of the most important days in my life.''
	   Pantani, who rides for the Mercatone Uno team, is the first
Italian to win the Tour since Felice Gimondi in 1965.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, the defending champion, came in second,
3 minutes and 21 seconds behind the winner, and American Bobby
Julich came in third, at 4:08.
	   Tom Steels of Belgium took the 21st and final stage on the
Champs-Elysees in Paris. It was Steels' fourth stage win of this
Tour. He won the first stage in Dublin three weeks ago.
	   The final day crowd, including vacationing Italians, cheered
Pantani every time he passed, easily spotting the leader's yellow
jersey.
	   Pantani finished the 147-kilometer (91-mile) stage from Melun to
Paris in the pack, in 45th place. A flat tire held him up for less
than a minute.
	   Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro sent Pantani a message
offering ``the thanks of the Italian people for having given Italy
this exceptional success.''

Da Matta takes third Indy Lights win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TROIS-RIVIERES, Quebec (AP) _ Points leader Cristiano da Matta
of Brazil dominated Round 11 of the Indy Lights series from the
pole position Sunday and was never challenged as he won the 50-lap,
76-mile (122-kilometer) race.
	   Da Matta's average speed was slowed to 78.298 mph (126 kph) by
four full-course caution periods _ for a total of 11 laps. Oriol
Servia, from the Catalonia region of Spain, started on the outside
of the front row and finished second, 1.31 seconds behind da Matta.
Naoki Hattori of Japan finished third.
	   Da Matta now has a 28 point lead (130-102) over English rookie
Guy Smith with three races remaining on the 14-race schedule. Smith
finished fourth today.

Group seeking residence papers occupies Vatican mission a second

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to show group prepares to spend second night at
mission &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 15 illegal immigrants occupied the Vatican
mission to France for a second day Sunday, waiting for French
authorities to grant residence permits, or for Pope John Paul II to
intervene on their behalf.
	   ``The situation is still blocked,'' said the protesters'
spokesman, Madjyguene Cisse.
	   On Saturday, authorities proposed a meeting with Paris Police
Chief Philippe Massoni, on condition the mainly African protesters
leave the mission in the chic 16th district.
	   ``We refused,'' Cisse said.
	   The group entered the Vatican mission about 10:30 a.m. Saturday
saying they wanted a ``morally viable mediator'' for their cause.
	   Vatican representative to France, Mario Tagliaferri, proposed to
act as mediator, but it was not clear what efforts may have been
made on behalf of the occupiers.
	   Tagliaferri offered the group a room, mattresses and covers,
ahead of what was to be their second night at the mission, which
has also provided the protesters with meals.
	   The occupiers say they are seeking papers for 17 comrades who
were part of a group of some 300 African illegal immigrants who
occupied the Saint Bernard church for two months in 1996.
	   Police stormed the church and expelled the group, but many since
then have become legal residents of France.
	   The Saint Bernard group now serves as a model for other illegal
immigrants seeking papers to remain in France.
	   Last week, several hundred Asians held a street protest to press
their demands for residence permits.

three weeks earlier in Dublin, Ireland, due to a growing doping
scandal.
	   Pantani did his best to divert attention from it, riding
magnificently in the mountains. He was the first to win both the
Tour of Italy and the Tour de France in one year since cycling
great Miguel Indurain did it five years ago.
	   ``To win the Giro and the Tour de France is something my country
has been waiting for a long time,'' Pantani said. ``This day will
remain one of the most important days in my life.''
	   Pantani, who rides for the Mercatone Uno team, is the first
Italian to win the Tour since Felice Gimondi in 1965.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, the defending champion, came in second,
3 minutes and 21 seconds behind the winner, and American Bobby
Julich came in third, at 4:08.
	   Tom Steels of Belgium took the 21st and final stage on the
Champs-Elysees in Paris. It was Steels' fourth stage win of this
Tour. He won the first stage in Dublin three weeks ago.
	   The final day crowd, including vacationing Italians, cheered
Pantani every time he passed, easily spotting the leader's yellow
jersey.
	   Pantani finished the 147-kilometer (91-mile) stage from Melun to
Paris in the pack, in 45th place. A flat tire held him up for less
than a minute.
	   Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro sent Pantani a message
offering ``the thanks of the Italian people for having given Italy
this exceptional success.''

Palestinian journalists union bars members from contacting Israelis

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Journalists Association has
forbidden its members from engaging in non-professional contact
with Israelis and has threatened to blacklist journalists who break
the rules, an official from the organization said Sunday.
	   The decision was taken after the association participated in a
larger meeting of Arab press groups last week in Egypt.
	   ``We will form a blacklist of the names of all Palestinian and
Arab journalists,'' who normalize relations with Israel, said
Tawfiq Abu Khousa, vice-president of the Palestinian Journalists
Association in Gaza.
	   Abu Khousa said last week's conference of the Arab Journalist
Associations voted unanimously to ``confront and stop all forms of
normalization of relations with Israel.''
	   Abu Khousa said Palestinian journalists who ignore the ban and
meet with Israelis outside the professional sphere, would have
their names circulated throughout the Arab world and access to high
officials would be cut off.
	   He also said the journalists would be forbidden to participate
in academic forums with their Israeli counterparts.
	   But officials in Yasser Arafat's palestinian Authority said they
would not lend a hand to enforcing the rules of the
quasi-governmental journalists association.
	   ``No Palestinian journalist should worry about the threats of
the officials of the Palestinians Journalists's Association,'' said
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.
	   Israeli and Palestinian journalists have worked together for
years, often forming friendships despite tensions between the two
peoples and a current 17-month stalemate in Mideast peace talks.
	   Khaled Abu Aker, a Palestinian reporter who works for several
U.S. newspapers including The New York Times scoffed at Abu
Khousa's threats and said the comments would alienate members.
	   ``Our meetings with Israelis are not normalization.
Normalization means accepting the other's world view, and we would
never accept Israel's world view,'' he said.

Palestinians: Monday may be last chance for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ This week may be the last for
direct Mideast peace talks unless Israel accepts an American peace
plan to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank, a
Palestinian official said Sunday.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said a crucial Monday meeting scheduled between negotiators
would be the deciding factor for the continuation of talks.
	   ``If the Israelis are not going to present something new on
accepting the American proposals, then tomorrow's meeting may be
the last direct meeting between the two sides,'' Abourdeneh told
The Associated Press.
	   American efforts to mediate an end to a 17-month stalemate in
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations failed to yield a
breakthrough. The United States could not get Israel to agree to a
set of ideas it presented to revive talks and ultimately told the
sides it was up to them to negotiate an end to the impasse.
	   Two weeks ago senior negotiators from both sides began meeting
directly for the first time in months but the Palestinians have
complained that no progress has been made and that Israel has
continued to resist the American proposal.
	   However, Israeli officials said that only small gaps remained
between the sides and warned the Palestinians to refrain from
issuing ultimatums.
	   ``Threats or bombastic statements are not going to move the
peace process forward,'' said Israeli government spokesman Moshe
Fogel.
	   ``We are coming to the negotiating table in good faith ... but
it is going to take both sides to succeed and if the Palestinians
believe that by threatening to end the talks ... that they are
going to succeed in achieving everything that they demand, then
they are miscalculating,'' Fogel said.

Scenes from pope's life in new video for Italian pop star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Scenes from Pope John Paul II's life form the
backdrop of a new video for an Italian pop star who dedicated a
song to the pontiff to mark the 20th anniversary of this papacy.
	   RAI, Italian state television, showed snippets of the video,
which feature the pope as a young man as well as several highlights
of his papacy, including his meeting with Rome's chief rabbi in
1986 and his encounter with Cuban leader Fidel Castro earlier this
year.
	   The video music is by singer Amedeo Minghi, who, Italian news
reports said, will give a concert in St. Peter's Square in October
to celebrate the 20th anniversary of John Paul's election as
pontiff.
	   Minghi is dedicating a song to the pontiff entitled ``Un uomo
venuto da lontano'' (The Man Who Came From Afar). The album
featuring the song is due out in September.

<TEXT>
	   Edinburgh, Scotland (AP) _ Hearts surprised Glasgow Rangers with
a 2-1 first round win in the Scottish Premiership division
competition Sunday, scoring two goals in the first 20 minutes to
set up victory at Tynecastle.
	   The Scottish Cup winners, third behind Celtic and Rangers last
season, capitilized on two defensive mistakes by Rangers to score
goals through Stephane Adam and Jim Hamilton.
	   Rangers _ Scottish champions for nine consecutive years before
losing the title to Celtic last season _ hit back before halftime
to go into the break trailing 2-1.
	   Both sides missed opportunities and failed to add to the score
in the second half, further frustrating new Rangers coach Dick
Advocaat _ who was warned by the referee after a verbal outburst.

<TEXT>
	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In an important test of its clout
less than two years before presidential balloting, Mexico's ruling
party battled Sunday to retain three governorships and prove it can
win truly competitive elections.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party was favored to win easily
in the gulf coast state of Veracruz and hold off a challenge from
the center-left Democratic Revolution Party in Oaxaca in the
southwest.
	   But it faced a strong challenge in Aguascalientes, a small and
relatively prosperous central state, where polls showed its
candidate, Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, in a virtual tie with
Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of the center-right National Action Party.
	   The three main parties are looking to this year's 10
gubernatorial elections to gain momentum ahead of the 2000
presidential race. The opposition hopes to wrest the presidency
from the governing party, known as the PRI, which has dominated
Mexican politics throughout its 69-year history.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of the three gubernatorial
elections last month, recapturing the governor's seat in Chihuahua
it had lost in 1992 to National Action.
	   With its loss in Chihuahua _ and following a weak showing in the
Mexico City race _ National Action needed a win in Aguascalientes,
its best chance of capturing a governor's seat this year.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes, which has recently become more urban and middle
class. The party controls the mayoral seat in the capital and has a
majority in the local congress.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, says business has
been good for him lately, but he voted Sunday for National Action
for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Turnout among Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters appeared
strong and no major problems were reported, said Adriana Damian
Olvera, spokeswoman for the president of the state electoral
council.
	   Turnout also was good in Oaxaca, even though state election
officials reported that more than 40 percent of the polling booths
were late in opening. Opposition parties also complained that some
stations did not have the indelible ink used to mark the thumbs of
people who have voted.
	   There were few voters seen at polls in Veracruz, possibly due to
heavy morning rains.
	   For the PRI, 9th graf pvs

Floods in Yemen kill 14 over the weekend

	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Floods caused by weeklong rains swept
through parts of Yemen over the weekend, killing at least 14
people, officials and newspapers said Sunday.
	   Near the capital, San`a, floods destroyed homes in five villages
Saturday, killing 11 people, the Yemen Times reported.
	   In the town of Ibb, south of San`a, a 14-year-old boy was swept
away by floods, and two other people were killed when their homes
collapsed, officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Storms have lashed central, northern and western Yemen for about
a week. Rain is not unusual this time of the year in Yemen, a poor
country on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, but the
storms are some of the most severe in years.
	   The flooding has caused an estimated at 2.5 billion Yemeni
riyals (dlrs 19 million), the Yemen Times reported.
	   Last week, floods killed eight people in the Red Sea province of
Hodeida, 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of San'a.
	   The newspaper quoted officials as saying the floods had washed
out roads in rural areas, destroyed coffee crops and stranded cars.
	   In 1996, about 200 people died in floods that swept through
several provinces, causing an estimated dlrs 1.2 billion in damage.

Albanian party denounces continued Serb offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A Kosovo Albanian party Sunday denounced
the on-going Serb offensive in the Yugoslav province and told
Albanian television that the push will only serve to harden
resistance by secessionist rebels.
	   ``Serbia wants to make impossible for thousands of Albanians to
return to their homes and to destroy the bases of the Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' the Albanian Democratic Movement said in a
statement.
	   ``But the fighting has just started,'' the party said. ``The
idea of the liberty is more strong than the Serbian offensives.''

Eritrean minister proposes troop pullout to border foe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Eritrean minister's willingness to
withdraw from border area. Edits thruout to conform, trims. Changes

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso _ Eritrea's foreign minister said
Sunday his country was ready to withdraw troops from hotly disputed
border territory with neighboring Ethiopia as long as Ethiopia also
pulls back its forces to create a de-militarized zone patrolled by
U.N. and neutral African forces.
	   It marked the first time since fighting began in early May on
the frontier between the two Horn of Africa countries that Eritrea
has expressed readiness to leave territory it claims as rightfully
within its own boundaries.
	   Eritrea's Foreign Affairs Minister Seyoum Mesfin told reporters
his new offer to withdraw from unspecified border areas to create a
neutral zone held by U.N. and Organization of African Unity was
``an act of good will to help defuse the tension.''
	   It was unclear exactly what areas were envisioned in the
proposed pullout, which came on the second day of separate talks
between the feuding sides and African mediators.
	   ``We don't need a war to solve a border problem,'' Seyoum said.
	   Ethiopia's Foreign Affairs Minister Haile Woldetensae said later
he was ``not optimistic'' despite the new proposal which appeared
to meet at least some of Ethiopia's demands.
	   The developments came after both Seyoum and his Ethiopian
counterpart met separately Saturday afternoon with Burkina Faso's
President Blaise Campaore who is hosting the mediation efforts led
by OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   The Eritrean and Ethiopian ministers later went into separate
talks with the OAU secretary general and the foreign ministers of
Zimbabwe and Djibouti, who had hatched a list of peace proposals
given to the feuding sides.
	   Until now, Eritrean officials had steadfastly refused to
withdraw troops, instead proposing face-to-face talks and a cease
fire to formalize the end of hostilities. Ethiopia had insisted on
a troop pullout before talks could proceed.
	   Early in the conflict, the United States and Rwanda had
initially presented a four-point proposal for peace talks that
included Eritrean withdrawal from contested areas it had occupied
after May 6.
	   Eritrea balked at the precondition, claiming it was only on
territory rightfully within its boundaries.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of two districts on the
western end of the 960-kilometer (600-mile) border between the East
African countries in early May that precipitated the crisis.
	   Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed areas under
colonial-era agreements, gained independence for Ethiopia in 1993.
	   Although the foreign ministers of both East African countries
shared a plane Saturday to Burkina Faso, they have refused to meet
directly.
	   Burkina Faso officials said Sunday on the condition of anonymity
that talks were expected to break off later that night. Another
round of meetings were being planned for an as-yet unspecified time
and place.

Yugoslavia continues unbeaten run; U.S., Russia reach 3-1
</HEADLINE>

slightly &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia showed why it's looking like
the class of this World Basketball Championship with a 95-55
hammering of Canada in Sunday's second round, and the U.S. and
Russia reminded they shouldn't be written off yet.
	   The starless Americans (3-1) beat Argentina 87-74 with 20 from
former Syracuse star Wendell Alexis. Russia (3-1) won over Italy
71-55.
	   The news wasn't as good for Lithuania, which fell to 3-1 and out
of the unbeaten ranks with a 71-61 loss the Australia. The win
moved Australia _ the Goodwill Games silver medalists _ to 2-2 and
kept hopes alive for the Boomers of a coveted quarterfinal berth.
	   At 4-0, European champion Yugoslavia boasts the tournament's
best record although Spain and Greece could have each matched it in
late games Sunday as Spain faced Brazil and Greece played Puerto
Rico.
	   Yugoslavia had three in double figures and saw all 12 players
score, topped by Miroslav Beric with 13 points and Dejan Tomasevic
with 14 rebounds.
	   ``It was a good old-fashioned butt-kicking by a very good
basketball team,'' Canadian coach Steve Konchalski said.
	   Yugoslavia barged to a 44-23 halftime advantage with trademark
dominating defense. It added the dagger with a 19-2 run against
Canada (1-3) early in the second half and led by as many as 43.
	   Greg Newton led the losers with 14 and the loss means Canada has
virtually no chance of making the quarters that will be played
Friday
	   ``My team managed to get into the game from the first minute and
we didn't allow Canada to be dangerous,'' said Yugoslavia coach
Zeljko Obradovic.
	   The Americans, who also got scoring from all 12 players, were on
top almost from the start but waited until late to pull away
cleanly from Argentina in an 87-74 victory as Wendell Alexis had
20, Jimmy Oliver 18 and Michael Hawkins 15.
	   Marcelo Nicola had 26 to lead Argentina with 18 form Fabricio
Oberto. The Argentines (2-2) played without one of their top
players Hugo Sconochini, who picked up an injured left leg in the
last game.
	   ``Our game plan it to take whatever open shot are presented.
Today the team did a tremendous job of finding the open man,'' said
coach Rudy Tomajnovich.
	   The U.S. was up 47-38 at halftime, but let Argentina tie at
54-54 with 14:27 to play. With five minutes left, the South
Americans got to within two before the U.S. hit a 14-3 run near the
end to seal the victory.
	   Russia also reached 3-1 with the win over Italy (2-2) 71-55 as
Sergei Babkov scored 26 and Mikhail Mikhailov added 15 rebounds.
Italy was led by Gregor Fucka with 15 points.
	   ``The win against Italy gives us hope of advancing to the final
four,'' said Russian coach Sergei Belov. ``It's important given the
fact we lost to Italy in the European championship (semifinals last
year).'' Italy eventually took silver and Russia bronze.
	   Lithuania, silver medalists in the last two Olympics, also finds
itself at 3-1, but it got there with a loss after leading 37-35 at
halftime. Australia used a 14-2 run early in the second half _
capitalizing on tenacious defense and power inside play _ to take
control.
	   Andrew Gaze, a 6-foot-7 (2.01) forward who finished with a
game-high 24, took charge in the last five minutes, scoring all 10
of Australia's points in one stretch _ two on 3-pointers. Saulius
Stombergas led Lithuania with 17.
	   The Aussies, who have lost two games here by a combined five
points, also put the wraps on Lithuanian forward Arturas Karnisovas
who had only 10 points after averaging a tournament-high 22.7 in
the first three games.
	   ``Lithuania started a small group and we felt we could go and
exploit that,'' said assistant coach Alan Black. ``After the two
close losses, hopefully this will give us the confidence we need.''
	   In consolation games, Nigeria (1-3) defeated South Korea (0-4)
89-65 and Japan (1-3) edged Senegal (0-4) 66-55 after trailing by
seven early.

Torian beats Johnson, Jackson, Crear again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later events &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Reggie Torian pulled away from world
and Olympic champion Allen Johnson and world record holder Colin
Jackson in the final 20 meters Sunday to show why he's the fastest
110-meter hurdler around.
	   Winner of the U.S. title at New Orleans, Torian was level with
the two bigger name hurdlers at halfway in a British Grand Prix
race which had the five fastest of the year in the field.
	   But he hit the front as they cleared the final hurdle and, as he
crossed the finish line, looked to his left to see he had edged his
rivals again.
	   He clocked 13.15 seconds compared with his time of 13.03 at New
Orleans June 21 and Johnson took second in 13.22 with Jackson third
in 13.24.
	   ``It was really really Allen and and me hurdle for hurdle and I
just stole it at the end,'' said Torian, who has beaten Johnson
three times this year. ``It's my goal to keep winning races and go
into next year's World Championship season as No. 1.
	   ``It's important to drop in a fast time early in the season and
then keep winning. Especially in a race like this. It wasn't the
best race, it wasn't the best times but everyone was there.''
	   Goodwill Games winner Mark Crear wound up fourth in 13.33 while
Courtney Hawkins appeared in contention until he had an ugly fall
three hurdles from home and wound up lying on his back on the
track.
	   Melissa Morrison powered past Jamaica's Michelle Freeman in the
final 15 meters to win the women's 100 meters hurdles in 12.74 with
fellow American Angie Vaughn third.
	   ``I felt a bit sluggish at the beginning after a couple of false
starts,'' said Morrison. ``I just didn't feel very relaxed in the
blocks but I want out and gave it all I had and come out
victorious.
	   ``A victory over Angie, who beat me at the Goodwill Games. I
can't really ask for more.''
	   World champion Stephane Diagana of France won the men's 400
hurdles in 48.70, world record holder Jonathan Edwards leaped 17.14
to win the triple jump.
	   Mahjoub Haida led countryman Benjounes Lahlou home ahead of
Kenya's David Cheruiyot for a Moroccan 1-2 i the 800 meters,
clocking 1 minute 45.03 seconds. But Kenya's Paul Tergat, a former
10,000-meter world record holder and four-time world cross country
titlist, left three Moroccans trailing with a victory in the 3,000
meters in 7 minutes 39.50 seconds.
	   Former world record holder Steve Backley heaved 88.80 meters to
win the javelin in a field which included out-of-form world
champion Marius Corbett, who managed only 76.21.
	   Russia's Olympic 800 and 1,500-meter gold medalist Svetlana
Masterkova failed in a bid to break her world mile record of
4:12.56 when she labored to 4:28.28.
	   Britain's Paula Radcliffe outclassed Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan
to win a women's 3,000 race in 8 minutes 38.84 seconds. O'Sullivan,
the former 5,000 meters world champion, struggled in second in
8:45.35.
	   Olympic 400-meter silver medalist Roger Black made an emotional
farewell when he finished third behind countrymen Mark Richardson
and Iwan Thomas.
	   The 32-year-old veteran, who has also helped Britain win a relay
world title and two silvers, announced his retirement in bitter
circumstances after the selectors chose Solomon Wariso instead for
next month's European Championship.
	   Ironically, Wariso had to pulled out of Sunday's event because a
knee injury he collected in beating Black in a dive to the line at
the British trials and there is speculation that, if Wariso isn't
fit for the Europeans in Budapest, Black may be recalled.

Red ink won't slow Goodwill Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 10th graf to UPDATE with report on winter games in Lake
Placid in 2000. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Next stop, Brisbane.
	   The Goodwill Games press on, undisturbed by the sea of red ink
that got even deeper in the 15 days that Ted Turner's mini-Olympics
played in New York and its Long Island suburbs.
	   New York took a mostly ho-hum approach to the games, which ended
Sunday, ensuring that for the fourth straight time they would lose
money.
	   But Turner never viewed his pet project in terms of dollars and
cents, willingly absorbing millions in losses for more ambitious
gains. And Time Warner Inc., which now owns Turner's company and
with it the Goodwill Games, embraces the same point of view.
	   So Michael Plant, president of the games, shrugged off the
question of financial issues on the eve of Sunday's closing
celebration.
	   ``We always use the word `investment,''' Plant said. ``We still
believe at the end of the day, this will be the most financially
successful games.''
	   That is to say Plant expects the 1998 games won't add
substantially to the dlrs 109 million Turner lost on the first
three editions of this made-for-television event.
	   ``We will not discuss any final tally of revenue or expenses, as
is the policy with any other project of the company,'' Plant said.
``The people at the top are pleased with the results of the '98
games.''
	   So much so that plans are moving ahead for the next edition, set
for 2001 in Brisbane, Australia. That program will have 12 sports
plus surf-lifesaving, with wrestling, water polo, synchronized
swimming and soccer dropped.
	   Plant said Goodwill officials will have an operational plan in
place within six months and a marketing plan set by March 1. There
is even talk of adding a winter edition of the games, and Plant was
quoted in Sunday's Newsday as saying plans were nearly complete for
that addition in Lake Placid, New York, in 2000.
	   With television ratings up 25 percent from four years ago,
organizers remain upbeat despite huge sections of empty seats for
many events in New York. Even the figure skating, which featured
such big names as Michelle Kwan and Todd Eldredge, struggled for
fans. Only when organizers offered cut-rate dlrs 5 seats in the
upper level of Nassau Coliseum did the building fill up.
	   Kwan and Eldredge did their parts, winning gold medals in figure
skating. So did the other major players including Michael Johnson,
Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Dan O'Brien in track and field, Cuban
heavyweight boxer Felix Savon, swimmers Jenny Thompson and
Aleksandr Popov, and the U.S. basketball, wrestling and women's
soccer teams.
	   Their successes, however, must be balanced with the accident
that left Chinese gymnast Sang Lan paralyzed. There also was a
brief political protest that interrupted the U.S.-Iran wrestling
match.
	   ``The best is always when you go to an event and see what you
have worked for unfold on the field of play,'' Plant said. ``The
worst is when something tragic happens _ like the case of Sang Lan
_ that affects everyone deeply.''
	   Sang remains in Mount Sinai Hospital, where she is beginning
rehabilitation for her spinal cord injury. Doctors have said it is
unlikely she will walk again.
	   Sang's tragedy created more attention than many of the events at
the games and ticket sales never picked up any momentum.
	   ``Our expectations when we started were to sell and distribute
around 350-400,000 (tickets) based on 600,000 seats available,''
Plant said. ``By the end of the games, we think we will be at that
350,000 number.

Georgians order medical tests for radiation exposure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Villagers in western Georgia will be tested for
radiation exposure following the discovery of a radioactive area in
a former Soviet army base near their settlement, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Sunday.
	   The source of the radiation was not identified, but Georgian
Environmental Minister Nino Chikhobadze said that it covered a
300-square-meter (3,230-square-foot) area and that it measured 230
roentgens at its center.
	   The site near the village of Matkhodzhi was discovered during a
routine check of former Soviet military facilities, ITAR-Tass said.
Chikhobadze said it would be repressurized and buried soon, the
news agency reported.

Arab League chief arrives for talks in Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The head of the Arab League arrived in Libya
by land Sunday after the U.N. sanctions committee refused to give
him an exemption to fly, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the league's secretary-general, plans to
meet Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for talks on recent U.S.-British
discussions for holding a trial in the Netherlands for two Libyans
suspected of bombing a Pan Am jet in 1988 over Scotland.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on Libya in 1992
in a bid to force Libya to hand over the two men. They are
suspected of planting a bomb on the airliner, killing 270 people.
	   The sanctions include a ban on air travel to or from Libya.
	   On Saturday, the 22-nation Arab League called the sanctions
committee's rejection of its request for Abdel-Meguid to fly to
Libya ``authoritarian and stubborn.''
	   The United Nations allows flights to Libya only for humanitarian
and religious reasons.

Scenes from pope's life in new video for Italian pop star
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with pope's quotes about value of music &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Scenes from Pope John Paul II's life form the
backdrop of a new video for an Italian pop star who dedicated a
song to the pontiff to mark the 20th anniversary of this papacy.
	   RAI, Italian state television, showed snippets of the video,
which feature the pope as a young man as well as several highlights
of his papacy, including his meeting with Rome's chief rabbi in
1986 and his encounter with Cuban leader Fidel Castro earlier this
year.
	   The video music is by singer Amedeo Minghi, who, Italian news
reports said, will give a concert in St. Peter's Square in October
to celebrate the 20th anniversary of John Paul's election as
pontiff.
	   Minghi is dedicating a song to the pontiff entitled ``Un uomo
venuto da lontano'' (The Man Who Came From Afar). The album
featuring the song is due out in September.
	   John Paul, attending a classical music concert in his honor
Sunday night in the courtyard of his summer residence in Castel
Gandolfo, said music has the ``capacity to favor the encounter
among different cultures'' and can ``lead, through the harmony of
the notes and the dialogue of the instruments, to the contemplation
of the supreme and eternal beauty of God,'' the Italian news agency
ANSA reported.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A camera lowered Sunday down an emergency
shaft found no signs of life in a 130-meter (430-foot) cavern where
rescuers believe 10 men buried more than two weeks ago in an
Austrian mine may have taken refuge.
	   But a spokesman for the rescue operation, Alfred Zechling, said
the finding was inconclusive. A second camera with better lighting
would be lowered into the shaft early Monday, he told reporters at
the mine in the village of Lassing, 120 miles (190 kilometers)
southwest of Vienna.
	   Zechlinger said that after the second camera is sent down, ``we
will probably know with relative assurances whether anyone is
there.'' He said prelimary tests indicated there was sufficient
oxygen in the chamber for the men to have survived since they were
buried in a massive landslide July 17.
	   ``We are very disappointed because we could see nothing,'' Fritz
Stangl, deputy mayor of the village of Lassing, told the Austrian
Press Agency. ``But we are not giving up hope.''
	   The failure to detect signs of life in the subterranean
compartment was the latest setback in rescue efforts in the wake of
the worst mining accident in Austria since World War II.
	   The 10 men were part of a rescue team sent into the talc mine
after a mudslide buried miner Georg Hainzl. But a second, stronger
mudslide buried them too. Officials declared there was no chance
anyone survived.
	   But rescue efforts intensified July 26 when Hainzl was found
alive and in relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Hainzl,
however, was in a different part of the talc mine closer to the
surface.
	   Hopes for the 10 others increased Sunday when rescuers drilled a
20-centimeter (8 inch) shaft into the cavern, where experts
believed the men were trapped.
	   Rescuers then lowered a camera and a microphone down the shaft.
But hopes were dashed when the probes failed to detect any signs of
life.
	   Officials said they were not giving up hope because the chamber
was too dark to tell whether anyone was there at all.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said the shaft might have to
be reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process which could
take days.
	   Four members of a German rescue team had tried to enter the mine
through a different shaft in hopes of finding a short cut to the
chamber. But they had to turn back at a depth of 100 meters (330
feet) because of water and slush from the landslides.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one could be completed.

Eritrean minister proposes troop pullout to border foe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Eritrea's willingness to withdraw from

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso _ Eritrea's foreign minister said
Sunday his country was ready to withdraw troops from a disputed
territory as long as Ethiopia also pulls back its forces creating a
demilitarized zone patrolled by U.N. and neutral African forces.
	   It marked the first time since fighting began in early May on
the frontier between the two countries that Eritrea has expressed
readiness to leave territory it claims.
	   Eritrea's Foreign Affairs Minister Seyoum Mesfin told reporters
his new offer to withdraw from unspecified border areas to create a
neutral zone was ``an act of good will to help defuse the
tension.''
	   It was unclear exactly what areas were envisioned in the
proposed pullout, which came on the second day of separate talks
between the feuding sides and African mediators.
	   ``We don't need a war to solve a border problem,'' Seyoum said.
	   Ethiopia's Foreign Affairs Minister Haile Woldetensae said later
he was ``not optimistic'' despite the new proposal which appeared
to meet at least some of Ethiopia's demands.
	   The developments came after both Seyoum and his Ethiopian
counterpart met separately Saturday afternoon with Burkina Faso's
President Blaise Campaore who is hosting the mediation efforts led
by OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   The Eritrean and Ethiopian ministers later went into separate
talks with Salim and the foreign ministers of Zimbabwe and
Djibouti.
	   Until now, Eritrean officials had steadfastly refused to
withdraw troops, instead proposing face-to-face talks and a cease
fire. Ethiopia had insisted on a troop pullout before talks could
proceed.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of two districts on the
western end of the 960-kilometer (600-mile) border between the East
African countries in early May that precipitated the crisis.
	   Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed areas under
colonial-era agreements, gained independence for Ethiopia in 1993.

Rights group decries `new stage of war' in Chiapas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A human rights group denounced what it called
a ``new stage of the war'' in Chiapas in which 63 people have been
killed in the rebellion-troubled state since a December massacre,
newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center said that
since the Dec. 22 massacre of 45 people in Acteal, a village
sympathetic to leftist Zapatista rebels, the state has suffered
increasing violence and a deterioration of human rights.
	   The center's report said military actions in the first half of
1998 demonstrated that the massacre in Acteal ``was not the
culmination of three years of counterinsurgency war, but could be
the start of a new period of more open violence.''
	   As of the end of June, there were 63 slayings, many apparently
politically motivated, according to the center's investigation,
reported in the daily Reforma.
	   The group also decried attacks on civic leaders and human rights
observers, including the deportation of more than 185 foreigners
from Chiapas.
	   The center, which works with the Roman Catholic diocese led by
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, said the situation in Chiapas has grown more
complex and dangerous given the ``new government offensive against
the bases of support for the (Zapatistas), indigenous
organizations, civil groups and international observers.''
	   The federal government this year has stepped up a campaign
against foreign involvement in the 4 1/2-year-old conflict,
asserting that Mexico is capable of solving the internal conflict
on its own.
	   Peace talks with the rebels, who demand greater democracy and
Indian rights, have been stalled since 1996.
	   Bishop Ruiz had been a key mediator but the government accused
him of favoring the rebels. He resigned as a mediator in June,
blaming the government for the break down in negotiations.
	   Since the Acteal massacre, blamed on pro-government supporters,
the Mexican army has set up at least 28 new military camps, most in
the county surrounding Acteal and in Ocosingo, a community where
tension has been high, the daily La Jornada said, citing the
center's report titled ``The Legality of the Injustice.''
	   There have been 190 military actions in indigenous communities,
a campaign the center said was meant to put psychological pressure
on rebel sympathizers.
	   ``The war has taken on a new method of its manifestation, among
other things, in the massive presence of the federal army ... in a
new offensive against mediation, in a xenophobic campaign against
international human rights observers, and in a new dynamic of
paramilitary groups in the state,'' the report said.

Prostitutes reach agreement to work in Mexico City neighborhood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Prostitutes may work freely in a Mexico City
neighborhood as long as they keep their distance from churches,
schools and hospitals, newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The accord allows prostitutes to work on a major avenue near the
city's historic center between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., the daily
Reforma reported. In exchange, they must keep at least 65 feet (20
meters) away from churches, schools and hospitals, avoid wearing
clothing that reveals their underwear or intimate body parts, and
refuse to solicit minors.
	   They also must be certified by a health organization as being
free of sexually transmitted disease.
	   Prostitution is neither strictly prohibited nor wholly legal
under Mexican law. Some Local governments have set up tolerance
zones for male and female prostitutes.
	   Organizations representing the ``sex workers'' signed the new
agreement with officials of Venustiano Carranza, a capital city
borough. Another city borough signed a similar agreement last year,
Reforma said.

Justice Minister says government will not support change in
</HEADLINE>
Brazil's abortion law &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - The Brazilian government will not
support changes to the nation's 58-year-old abortion law, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Justice Minister Renan Calheiros and the president of a special
government commission to modernize the 1940 penal code reportedly
agreed to withdraw the committee's recommendations regarding
abortion.
	   ``We (the government) are not going to put an explosive issue
like this on our agenda,'' Calheiros told the newspaper. The
minister said any change must come from Congress.
	   The penal code allows abortion only in cases of rape or to save
a woman's life. Doctors who perform abortions for any other reasons
can receive up to three months in jail.
	   The special committee had recommended extending the law to cover
a woman whose health is at risk or whose pregnancy resulted from an
``act of violence,'' and not necessarily from rape.
	   The committees recommendations were withdrawn to keep the
government away from a polemical controversy so close to national
elections in October, the newspaper reported.
	   Calheiros and others are well aware of the ensuing religious
fallout that would occur in the nation with the world's largest
Roman Catholic population. About 70 percent of Brazil's 160 million
citizens are Catholic.
	   Women's' rights groups complain that a legal abortion is hard to
obtain because of government red tape and the fact many doctors
fear prosecution. Many are disappointed that President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, whose wife Ruth is an outspoken proponent of
women's rights, has not actively campaigned to change the law.
	   There are currently six bills to change abortion laws before
Congress.

Brazilians win beach volleyball gold as expected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even a knee injury couldn't slow top-ranked
Brazil on the way to the Goodwill Games' gold medal in women's
beach volleyball.
	   Shelda Bede, her left leg in a huge wrap, and Adriana Behar beat
Kerri Pottharst and Pauline Manser of Australia 12-9, 12-5 Sunday,
matching Brazil's gold medal in the men's competition.
	   The win was the third of the year and seventh of their careers
for Bede and Behar, who did not lose a match in winning the $30,000
first prize.
	   ``It took a lot of concentration for her to play and to play
well like she played,'' Behar said of her partner, who was
diagnosed Saturday with an inflamed tendon behind her left knee.
``She was the best and she served so well. For me, in this final, I
want to thank Shelda because she gave us the victory.''
	   The U.S. team of Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce won the bronze medal
with a 12-11, 12-3 victory over Laura Bruschini and Annamaria
Solazzi of Italy.
	   ``I was fired up to get on that podium today,'' said Arce, whose
team was beaten by the Australians in the semifinals.
	   Sunday's matches drew a crowd of 2,800 to the venue built by
dumping almost 1 million pounds (453,000 kilos) of sand on Wollman
Rink in Central Park. Among those in attendance were former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, and Goodwill Games
founder and organizer Ted Turner and his wife, actress Jane Fonda.
	   Bede is considered one of the best servers in the sport, and she
backed that up Sunday with nine aces, six more than the other three
players combined.
	   ``We handled their serves well in the first game but I felt they
stepped it up a bit in the second,'' Pottharst said. ``When you
play a team that serves well, you have to pass the ball well, but
their serves were coming like bombs.''
	   In five tournaments this year, the Brazilians have three titles
and two seconds. It was their seventh win in as many matches
against the Australians, including the final of a tournament in
Brazil earlier this year and in pool play at the Goodwill Games.
	   ``They are definitely dominating the tour,'' Manser said. ``We
had high expectations and it didn't happen this time, but we are
getting closer.''
	   McPeak and Arce, the second-seeded team in this tournament and
the runners-up in last year's world championship, dominated the
second set after struggling in the first.
	   ``We needed that medal,'' McPeak said. ``We wanted that gold
really bad but came up short and that is frustrating. We're trying
to get our groove back and are pushing to be No. 1 in the sport.
We're close.''
	   The eight teams that competed in the Goodwill Games all head for
tournaments in Japan and China the next two weeks, then it's back
to the United States for the debut of the American Volleyball
League in Del Mar, California, Aug. 28-30.
	   ``This year's been difficult. We thought we might have a tour.
We tried,'' McPeak said of the demise of the Women's Professional
Volleyball Association that led to the creation of the AVL.
``There's been a lot of ups and downs. It's been difficult and the
situation is still so volatile.''

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A camera lowered down an emergency shaft
Sunday found no signs of life in a 130-meter (430-foot) deep cavern
where rescuers believe 10 men may have taken refuge following an
Austrian mine accident more than two weeks ago.
	   But a spokesman for the rescue operation, Alfred Zechling, said
the finding was inconclusive. A second camera with better lighting
would be lowered into the shaft early Monday, he told reporters at
the mine near Lassing, 120 miles (190 kilometers) southwest of
Vienna.
	   Zechlinger said that after the second camera is sent down, ``we
will probably know with relative assurances whether anyone is
there.'' He said prelimary tests indicated there was sufficient
oxygen in the chamber for the men to have survived since they were
buried in a massive landslide July 17.
	   ``We are very disappointed because we could see nothing,'' Fritz
Stangl, Lassing's deputy mayor, told the Austrian Press Agency.
``But we are not giving up hope.''
	   The failure to detect signs of life in the subterranean
compartment was the latest setback in rescue efforts in the wake of
the worst mining accident in Austria since World War II.
	   The 10 men were part of a rescue team sent into the talc mine
after a mudslide buried miner Georg Hainzl. But a second, stronger
mudslide buried them too. Officials declared there was no chance
anyone survived.
	   But rescue efforts intensified July 26 when Hainzl was found
alive and in relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Hainzl,
however, was in a different part of the talc mine closer to the
surface.
	   Hopes for the 10 others increased Sunday when rescuers drilled a
20-centimeter (8 inch) shaft into the cavern, where experts
believed the men were trapped.
	   Rescuers then lowered a camera and a microphone down the shaft.
But hopes were dashed when the probes failed to detect any signs of
life.
	   Officials said they were not giving up hope because the chamber
was too dark to tell whether anyone was there at all.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said the shaft might have to
be reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process which could
take days.
	   Four members of a German rescue team had tried to enter the mine
through a different shaft in hopes of finding a short cut to the
chamber. But they had to turn back at a depth of 100 meters (330
feet) because of water and slush from the landslides.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one could be completed.

Yugoslavia keeps rolling, US keeps improving
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with Greece, Spain wins. CHANGES
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia continues to be the most
dominant team at the World Basketball Championship. The United
States continues to be the most inconsistent.
	   The European titlists stretched their unbeaten march through
round-robin play to four games Sunday with a 95-55 dismantling of
Canada that was decided inside the first 10 minutes.
	   Spain and Greece also picked up wins, in less impressive
fashion, to improve to 4-0.
	   The unsung Americans (3-1) didn't pull away from Argentina until
late but put together their best overall game of the tournament to
win 87-74. Former Syracuse standout Wendell Alexis scored 20 points
and Jimmy Oliver had 18.
	   It was a two-point game with 4:00 minutes to go.
	   ``You can say we've had our ups and downs,'' U.S. coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said.
	   His team was never fully in control, allowing Argentina (2-2) to
get within shouting distance repeatedly. Marcelo Nicola led the
South Americans with 26 points, and Fabricio Oberto added 18.
	   But unlike in last week's loss to Lithuania, the U.S. team
responded to each Argentina spurt with a run of its own.
	   ``This team has come a long way. I was very pleased with their
fire today,'' said Tomjanovich, who has had the team for only a
month, after the NBA labor dispute resulted in the dumping of the
league's stars from the roster.
	   ``I liked the way that we ended the game. We had the lead,
played smart, spread it out and made them come to us,'' he added.
``We didn't have guys looking to score more points.''
	   Alexis had 15, including three 3-pointers from the corners, in a
5-minute stretch of the first half when the United States built the
first of its short-lived leads.
	   The victory moved the Americans into second place in their
group, tied with Lithuania at 3-1. Spain, the next opponent for the
United States, beat Brazil 73-63. Guards Alberto Angulo and Ignacio
Rodriguez had 17 points apiece for Spain, which trailed by as many
as seven points in the early stages.
	   Joao Jose Vianna led Brazil (1-3) with 15 points.
	   Forward Nicos Economou's 19 points helped Greece keep pace with
Yugoslavia atop the other six-team group by holding off Puerto Rico
71-64. The hosts led by 13 at halftime, but Puerto Rico (1-3), led
by Eddie Casiano's 19 points, closed the gap down the stretch.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Russia (3-1) secured a 71-55 win over Italy
(2-2) on the strength of Sergei Babkov's 26 points and Mikhail
Mikhailov's 15 rebounds, and Australia (2-2) handed Lithuania its
first loss, 71-61, as Seton Hall product Andrew Gaze scored 24,
including 10 straight down the stretch.
	   The Aussies, who have lost two games by a combined five points,
shut down Arturas Karnisovas, holding him to 10 points on 2-of-6
shooting. He came into the game averaging a tournament-high 22.7
points.
	   In consolation games, Nigeria defeated South Korea 89-65 and
Japan topped Senegal 66-55.
	   Even without its two best players _ Vlade Divac of the Charlotte
Hornets and former NBAer Predrag Danilovic _ and playmaker
Aleksandar Djordjevic battling injury, Yugoslavia has looked like
it could add this title to its 1990 world gold.
	   ``They got on a roll and we couldn't stop their roll,'' said
Canada's coach, Steve Konchalski. ``When we got the ball inside in
the first half, they seemed to block every shot.''
	   The top four teams in each group reach the quarterfinals, and
Sunday's losses mean Canada, Brazil and Puerto Rico have virtually
no chance of advancing.
	   If Yugoslavia is known as the ``Americans from Europe'' because
of their style of play and success on the international stage, this
non-Dream Team from the United States is quickly becoming the
domain of the ``Americans in Europe.''
	   Alexis plays in Germany, Oliver in Spain and point guard Michael
Hawkins (15 points Sunday) for Greek League team Olympiakos, which
plays its home games at the Peace and Friendship arena, the site of
Sunday's win.
	   ``It's a tremendous asset to have those guys,'' Tomjanovich
said, ``because they feel comfortable with the (international)
style of basketball.''

Eastern Mexican state sets back clocks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The sun rose an hour earlier in Mexico's
easternmost state Sunday, due not to a celestial miracle but to a
failed experiment in time-zone adjustment.
	   Last October, officials in Quintana Roo _ home to the popular
tourist resorts of Cancun and Cozumel _ ordered clocks in the state
to be aligned with the eastern time zone of the United States in
hopes of better accommodating tourists.
	   But locals, bothered to see the sun rise at 8 a.m. and set as
late at 9 p.m., complained the government was bowing too far to
foreign interests, the daily Reforma reported.
	   State officials gave in and agreed to set clocks back an hour,
in line with Mexico City and central Mexico, as of Sunday.

Alex dissipates before reaching islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS and UPDATES throughout with storm breaking up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Alex dropped below storm strength
Sunday, degenerating into a weak trough before reaching the Leeward
Islands, forecasters at the United States' National Weather Service
said Sunday.
	   Reports from an Air Force hurricane-chasing plane indicated Alex
no longer has a closed low-level circulation, producing little more
than a few showers and locally gusty winds.
	   Alex still was about 300 miles (480 kilometers) east-northeast
of the northern Leeward Islands when the storm began dissipating,
forecasters said.
	   Forecasters also were watching a large tropical wave about
midway between the Lesser Antilles and the Cape Verde islands
Sunday. The wave was moving west at about 15 mph (25 kph). Slow
development of the wave is possible in the next day or two,
forecasters said, although it has changed little since Saturday.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Kevin Millwood and the Atlanta Braves again shut
down Mark McGwire, and Ryan Klesko drove in two runs Sunday in a
4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   McGwire went 0-for-4 and struck out three times. The major
league home run leader was hitless in 11 at-bats in the three-game
series, striking out seven times and never getting a ball out of
the infield.
	   Since hitting his 45th home run against Milwaukee last Tuesday,
McGwire has gone 18 at-bats without homering.
	   Millwood (12-6) pitched seven innings, gave up six hits and
struck out eight, including McGwire twice. Rudy Seanez struck out
two in a scoreless eighth and Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect
ninth for his 16th save.
 &UR; Padres 4, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Andy Ashby tied for the major league lead with
his 15th victory and Tony Gwynn hit a two-run homer as the San
Diego Padres beat the Montreal Expos.
	   Ashby (15-6) won for his 10th in his last 12 decisions, holding
the Expos to one run on six hits in eight innings. He struck out
five and walked one while tying Boston's Pedro Martinez and the
Yankees' David Cone for the most wins in the majors.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched a perfect ninth for his 36th save.
	   Ken Caminiti and Greg Myers hit solo homers in the sixth for NL
West-leading San Diego. Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero went 3-for-4
with a triple and an RBI single. He is hitting .412 (40-for-97)
with 11 homers and 30 RBIs in 25 games since the All-Star break.
 &UR; Astros 6, Pirates 2 &QC; 
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Randy Johnson was everything the Houston
Astros wanted when they sacrificed their future to get him:
Overpowering, dominating, intimidating.
	   Johnson, pitching fewer than 48 hours after Houston swung the
big trade to get him, struck out 12 in seven innings and the Astros
scored four times in the eighth to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   Despite jet leg and an unfamiliarity with Pittsburgh hitters,
Johnson was just as menacing for the NL Central-leading Astros as
he was for the Seattle Mariners.
	   His 12 strikeouts gave him 225 for the season _ he led the AL
before he was traded Friday for three prospects _ and are an
Astros' season high.
 &UR; Mets 9, Dodgers 3 &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Armando Reynoso pitched seven strong innings and
Butch Huskey homered before leaving with a hamstring injury as the
New York Mets beat former teammate Brian Bohanon and the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
	   The Mets won for the 10th time in 14 games. They won twice in a
three-game series between NL wild-card contenders.
	   Reynoso (2-0) allowed only an unearned run on two hits in his
second start of the season. Turk Wendell pitched two innings in
relief to finish the combined five-hitter.
	   Bohanon (4-7), traded from the Mets to Los Angeles on July 10,
gave up six runs on five hits in six innings.
 &UR; Brewers 7, Diamondbacks 2 &QC; 
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Brad Woodall pitched seven strong innings to
win for the first time since June 27 as the Milwaukee Brewers
avoided a three-game sweep by the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Woodall (5-5) gave up one run and five hits, walked three and
struck out a career-high eight, including Andy Stankiewicz to
strand the bases full in the seventh.
	   The Brewers scored seven runs off Brian Anderson (7-10), who
gave up 10 hits in four-plus innings and issued his first walk in
32 innings.
 &UR; Giants 15, Phillies 3 &QC; 
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ On a huge day for hitting, Barry Bonds
almost landed his biggest blow at the mound.
	   Bonds went 4-for-4 and drove in three runs, then tackled
Philadelphia reliever Ricky Bottalico after being hit by a pitch as
the San Francisco Giants beat the Phillies.
	   Newly acquired Ellis Burks, Bonds and Jeff Kent hit consecutive
home runs in the second inning _ the first time the Giants had hit
three in a row since 1982 _ as San Francisco defeated Philadelphia
for the third straight day.
	   Bonds homered, tripled and singled twice. He had also stolen a
base in the fifth when the Giants were up 9-2, which may have

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Kevin Millwood and the Atlanta Braves again shut
down Mark McGwire, and Ryan Klesko drove in two runs Sunday in a
4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   McGwire went 0-for-4 and struck out three times. The major
league home run leader was hitless in 11 at-bats in the three-game
series, striking out seven times and never getting a ball out of
the infield.
	   Since hitting his 45th home run against Milwaukee last Tuesday,
McGwire has gone 18 at-bats without homering.
	   Millwood (12-6) pitched seven innings, gave up six hits and
struck out eight, including McGwire twice. Rudy Seanez struck out
two in a scoreless eighth and Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect
ninth for his 16th save.
 &UR; Padres 4, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Andy Ashby tied for the major league lead with
his 15th victory and Tony Gwynn hit a two-run homer as the San
Diego Padres beat the Montreal Expos.
	   Ashby (15-6) won for his 10th in his last 12 decisions, holding
the Expos to one run on six hits in eight innings. He struck out
five and walked one while tying Boston's Pedro Martinez and the
Yankees' David Cone for the most wins in the majors.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched a perfect ninth for his 36th save.
	   Ken Caminiti and Greg Myers hit solo homers in the sixth for NL
West-leading San Diego. Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero went 3-for-4
with a triple and an RBI single. He is hitting .412 (40-for-97)
with 11 homers and 30 RBIs in 25 games since the All-Star break.
 &UR; Astros 6, Pirates 2 &QC; 
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Randy Johnson was everything the Houston
Astros wanted when they sacrificed their future to get him:
Overpowering, dominating, intimidating.
	   Johnson, pitching fewer than 48 hours after Houston swung the
big trade to get him, struck out 12 in seven innings and the Astros
scored four times in the eighth to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   Despite jet leg and an unfamiliarity with Pittsburgh hitters,
Johnson was just as menacing for the NL Central-leading Astros as
he was for the Seattle Mariners.
	   His 12 strikeouts gave him 225 for the season _ he led the AL
before he was traded Friday for three prospects _ and are an
Astros' season high.
 &UR; Mets 9, Dodgers 3 &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Armando Reynoso pitched seven strong innings and
Butch Huskey homered before leaving with a hamstring injury as the
New York Mets beat former teammate Brian Bohanon and the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
	   The Mets won for the 10th time in 14 games. They won twice in a
three-game series between NL wild-card contenders.
	   Reynoso (2-0) allowed only an unearned run on two hits in his
second start of the season. Turk Wendell pitched two innings in
relief to finish the combined five-hitter.
	   Bohanon (4-7), traded from the Mets to Los Angeles on July 10,
gave up six runs on five hits in six innings.
 &UR; Brewers 7, Diamondbacks 2 &QC; 
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Brad Woodall pitched seven strong innings to
win for the first time since June 27 as the Milwaukee Brewers
avoided a three-game sweep by the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Woodall (5-5) gave up one run and five hits, walked three and
struck out a career-high eight, including Andy Stankiewicz to
strand the bases full in the seventh.
	   The Brewers scored seven runs off Brian Anderson (7-10), who
gave up 10 hits in four-plus innings and issued his first walk in
32 innings.
 &UR; Giants 15, Phillies 3 &QC; 
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ On a huge day for hitting, Barry Bonds
almost landed his biggest blow at the mound.
	   Bonds went 4-for-4 and drove in three runs, then tackled
Philadelphia reliever Ricky Bottalico after being hit by a pitch as
the San Francisco Giants beat the Phillies.
	   Newly acquired Ellis Burks, Bonds and Jeff Kent hit consecutive
home runs in the second inning _ the first time the Giants had hit
three in a row since 1982 _ as San Francisco defeated Philadelphia
for the third straight day.
	   Bonds homered, tripled and singled twice. He had also stolen a
base in the fifth when the Giants were up 9-2, which may have
prompted what happened the next time he batted.
 &UR; Rockies 6, Cubs 3 &QC; 
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Neifi Perez hit a go-ahead single in a three-run
seventh inning as the Colorado Rockies snapped a three-game losing
streak.
	   Pedro Astacio (10-10) improved his record since the All-Star
break to 4-1, and also helped himself with an RBI double and
sacrifice bunt. He allowed five hits and three runs in seven
innings.
	   Chuck McElroy pitched the final two innings for his second save.
	   Chicago's Sammy Sosa, second in the majors with 42 homers, went
0-for-2 with two walks.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Roger Clemens, still pitching for Toronto
after a flurry of trade rumors, struck out a season-high 14 and won
his ninth straight decision Sunday as the Blue Jays beat the
Minnesota Twins 6-4.
	   Clemens (14-6), who has not lost in 12 starts since May 29,
pitched eight innings and allowed six hits and one earned run. He
tied David Cone of the New York Yankees for the AL's longest
winning streak this year _ San Diego's Kevin Brown currently has
won 10 in a row.
	   Clemens fanned at least one batter in every inning and reached
double digits in strikeouts for the 87th time in his career.
	   There was speculation Friday that Clemens might get sent to the
Yankees, Cleveland or Houston in a deal before the midnight trading
deadline. Instead, the Blue Jays held onto their ace.
	   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, who turns 36 on Tuesday,
started fast, striking out four of the first five batters. Randy
Myers got one out for his 28th save.
	   Shawn Green, who went 4-for-5 and scored three times, tied it in
the fourth when he hit his 20th home run, connecting off Brad Radke
(10-9).
 &UR; Orioles 9, Royals 2
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Eric Davis' two-run double
stretched his hitting streak to 20 games and helped the Baltimore
Orioles beat the Kansas City Royals and avoid a three-game sweep.
	   Jeffrey Hammonds homered, had two doubles and drove in two runs.
Rafael Palmeiro also had two doubles and two RBIs as every
Baltimore starter hit safely.
	   Rookie Sidney Ponson (5-6) won his fourth straight decision.
Glendon Rusch (6-14) lost his fifth in a row.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Devil Rays 2
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Bobby Higginson hit a three-run
homer and Brian Powell pitched seven strong innings as the Detroit
Tigers defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Higginson's opposite-field drive to left-center in the fifth
inning was his 20th homer of the season. He has hit at least 20
homers in three consecutive seasons.
	   Powell (2-2) gave up two runs and four hits and Todd Jones
pitched the ninth for his 19th save. Bryan Rekar (1-3) took the
loss.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ The United States won the Curtis Cup for the
first time in eight years, beating Britain-Ireland Sunday in the
two-day competition at The Minikahda Club.
	   Singles victories by Kellee Booth and Brenda Corrie-Kuehn with
four matches to go gave the U.S. an insurmountable 9 1/2-4 1/2 lead
in the biennial women's amateur golf event.
	   Members of the U.S. team embraced each other after Corrie-Kuehn
beat Becky Morgan with a par putt at the 17th hole.
	   The Americans, who came into the final day needing four points
to win, took a commanding 7 1/2-4 1/2 lead in the morning after
winning two of the three foursome matches.
	   The United States won despite a minimal contribution from Jenny
Chuasiriporn. The U.S. Open runner-up and future Duke teammate Beth
Bauer were beaten in both of their foursome matches, while
Chuasiriporn earned a half-point in her singles match against
Rebecca Hudson Saturday.
	   The win was only the second for the Americans since 1986. They
lead the series 21-6-3.

Hope dwindles for 10 men buried for 16 days in Austrian mine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to CORRECT name Zechling in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A camera lowered down an emergency shaft
Sunday found no signs of life in an underground cavern where
rescuers believe 10 men buried in an Austrian mine may have taken
refuge.
	   But a spokesman for the rescue operation, Alfred Zechling, said
the finding was inconclusive. A second camera with better lighting
will be lowered into the shaft early Monday, he told reporters at
the mine in the village of Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles)
southwest of Vienna.
	   Zechling said that after the second camera is sent down, ``we
will probably know with relative assurances whether anyone is
there.'' He said preliminary tests indicated there was sufficient
oxygen in the chamber for the men to survive. They were buried in a
massive landslide July 17.
	   The failure to detect signs of life Sunday was the latest
setback in Austria's worst mining accident since World War II.
	   ``We are very disappointed because we could see nothing,'' Fritz
Stangl, deputy mayor of the village of Lassing, told the Austrian
Press Agency. ``But we are not giving up hope.''
	   The 10 men were part of a rescue team sent into the mine after a
mudslide buried miner Georg Hainzl. But a second, stronger mudslide
buried them too. Officials declared there was no chance anyone
survived.
	   But rescue efforts intensified July 26 when Hainzl was found
alive and in relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Hainzl
was in a part of the talc mine closer to the surface.
	   Talc is a soft mineral that is refined into talcum powder and
lubricants.
	   On Sunday, rescuers drilled a shaft into the cavern where
experts believed the remaining men were trapped. They then lowered
a camera and a microphone down the shaft but failed to detect any
signs of life.
	   Officials said they were not giving up hope because the chamber
was too dark to tell whether anyone was there.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said it might have to be
reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process that could take
days.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one is completed.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso _ Feuding neighbors Eritrea and
Ethiopia broke off two days of separate talks with African
mediators on Sunday without agreeing on a formula to end their
tense border standoff.
	   But the frontier foes in the Horn of Africa pledged not to
resume hostilities until they have held another round of peace
discussions yet to be scheduled.
	   Fighting which flared in early May has subsided since mid-June,
following a U.S.-brokered deal to stop deadly air raids. Several
hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before the stalemate.
	   Departing from Eritrea's earlier refusals to withdraw soldiers
from the disputed territory, the country's foreign minister Seyoum
Mesfin proposed a pullout by Eritrean and Ethiopian forces from
border areas to create a demilitarized zone patrolled by U.N. and
neutral African forces.
	   ``We don't need a war to solve a border problem,'' Seyoum said.
	   Until now, Eritrea had steadfastly refused to remove its troops
from land it considers its own. Ethiopia had insisted on a pullout
before talks could proceed.
	   Seyoum described his offer to create a neutral zone held by U.N.
and Organization of African Unity soldiers as ``an act of good will
to help defuse the tension.''
	   It was unclear exactly what areas were envisioned in the
proposed pullout, which came near the end of the second day of
separate talks involving the opposing parties and African mediators
in Burkina Faso's capital.
	   Ethiopia's Foreign Affairs Minister Haile Woldetensae said later
he was ``not optimistic'' despite the offer which appeared to meet
at least some of Ethiopia's demands.
	   The developments came after the opposing ministers met
separately with Burkina Faso's President Blaise Campaore who was
hosting the mediation efforts led by OAU secretary-general Salim
Ahmed Salim.
	   The Eritrean and Ethiopian ministers later held separate talks
with the OAU secretary-general and the foreign ministers of
Zimbabwe and Djibouti, who had hatched a list of peace proposals
given to the quarreling sides.
	   Both parties in the conflict have refused meet face-to-face.
	   Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo said Campaore
would meet soon with the heads of state of Djibouti and Zimbabwean
to discuss the latest developments.
	   The antagonists would subsequently attend another round of
meetings, although no date or venue had been decided on, Ouedraogo
added.
	   ``We are working together to come up with acceptable solutions
for both parties ... a solution that humiliates nobody, and in
which nobody is blamed,'' Ouedraogo said.
	   Ethiopia blames Eritrea's invasion of two districts on the
western end of the 960-kilometer (600-mile) border between the East
African countries in early May for precipitating the crisis.
	   Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed areas under
colonial-era agreements, gained independence for Ethiopia in 1993.

	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Hundreds of people gave Fidel
Castro a roaring welcome Sunday in Grenada, the Caribbean island
that is the only place where U.S. and Cuban forces fought
face-to-face in the Cold War.
	   At the international airport where the bloody 1983 fighting took
place, Castro clasped his hands over his heart when Grenadians
began singing a revolutionary song: ``Forward march, forward march
against imperialism!''
	   Castro said history would judge the battle. ``On a day like this
I would rather pay my respects to all who perished in that
conflict,'' he said.
	   But his visit _ the final stop on an unprecedented three-nation
Caribbean tour _ marked a dramatic turnaround in Caribbean
relations with Cuba, once shunned as an exporter of communist
revolution.
	   U.S. troops landed in Grenada in October 1983 after Marxist
hard-liners staged a bloody coup against a leftist government that
had been supported by Castro. The hard-liners executed Prime
Minister Maurice Bishop and his Cabinet.
	   For three days, armed Cuban construction workers fought invading
U.S. soldiers, who were accompanied by a token force of Eastern
Caribbean troops. Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 Americans
were killed.
	   But Grenada _ like other Caribbean nations _ has since moved to
embrace Cuba, frustrated with what it calls U.S. neglect of the
Caribbean once the Cold War ended.
	   Castro said it was time for Cuba and Grenada to put the invasion
behind them.
	   ``It is a source of special satisfaction for the Cubans to
observe the Grenadian people's willingness to leave behind that
chapter of their history and to look with their eyes to the
future,'' he declared. ``We are, and will forever, be brothers.''
	   Castro unveiled a plaque commemorating Cuba's help in building
Point Salines International Airport, which U.S. strategists once
feared would allow Cuban fighter planes to penetrate deep into
South America.
	   After the invasion, U.S. troops completed the airport. When
then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan visited Grenada in 1986, he, too,
received a hero's welcome, and he prayed at a sculpture outside the
airport honoring the U.S. dead.
	   Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, a former foe of
Castro's, said Sunday the show of gratitude to Cuba was ``better
late than never.''
	   Opposition politicians who were jailed after the 1979 revolution
that installed Bishop's pro-Cuban government protested Castro's
visit. ``We experienced what happened to us here during 1979 to
1983, when brave Americans came here and gave their lives to set us
free. So we are saying Castro must change,'' opposition leader
Herbert Preudhomme said recently.
	   Cuba's rapprochement with the Caribbean marks increasing
frustration with the United States. A much-touted new era in
U.S.-Caribbean relations promised at a 1997 summit in Barbados with
President Bill Clinton failed to deliver promised aid and trade
benefits.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has sent doctors and engineers to work in
Caribbean hospitals and schools, and offered free education in
Cuban universities to dozens of island youth.
	   As Castro noted in Jamaica, where he began his tour Wednesday,
Caribbean nations have lost 100,000 jobs, mainly in garment
factories that have moved to Mexico because it belongs to the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
	   Caribbean leaders also were angered by a successful U.S.
challenge in the World Trade Organization of preferential European
tariffs for their bananas, an export lifeline for many small-island
economies like Grenada's.
	   The region's governments, meanwhile, are campaigning against
Washington's 38-year-old embargo of Cuba, which they say doesn't
work and is inhumane.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A camera lowered down an emergency shaft
Sunday found no signs of life in a 130-meter (430-foot) deep cavern
where rescuers believe 10 men may have taken refuge following an
Austrian mine accident more than two weeks ago.
	   But a spokesman for the rescue operation, Alfred Zechling, said
the finding was inconclusive. A second camera with better lighting
would be lowered into the shaft early Monday, he told reporters at
the mine near Lassing, 120 miles (190 kilometers) southwest of
Vienna.
	   Zechling said that after the second camera is sent down, ``we
will probably know with relative assurances whether anyone is
there.'' He said prelimary tests indicated there was sufficient
oxygen in the chamber for the men to have survived since they were
buried in a massive landslide July 17.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Kevin Millwood and the Atlanta Braves again shut
down Mark McGwire, and Ryan Klesko drove in two runs Sunday in a
4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   McGwire went 0-for-4 and struck out three times. The major
league home run leader was hitless in 11 at-bats in the three-game
series, striking out seven times and never getting a ball out of
the infield.
	   Since hitting his 45th home run against Milwaukee last Tuesday,
McGwire has gone 18 at-bats without homering.
	   Millwood (12-6) pitched seven innings, gave up six hits and
struck out eight, including McGwire twice. Rudy Seanez struck out
two in a scoreless eighth and Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect
ninth for his 16th save.
 &UR; Padres 4, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Andy Ashby tied for the major league lead with his
15th victory and Tony Gwynn hit a two-run homer as the San Diego
Padres beat the Expos.
	   Ashby (15-6) won for his 10th in his last 12 decisions, holding
the Expos to one run on six hits in eight innings. He struck out
five and walked one while tying Boston's Pedro Martinez and the
Yankees' David Cone for the most wins in the majors.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched a perfect ninth for his 36th save.
	   Ken Caminiti and Greg Myers hit solo homers in the sixth for NL
West-leading San Diego. Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero went 3-for-4
with a triple and an RBI single. He is hitting .412 (40-for-97)
with 11 homers and 30 RBIs in 25 games since the All-Star break.
 &UR; Astros 6, Pirates 2 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Randy Johnson was everything the Houston Astros
wanted when they sacrificed their future to get him: Overpowering,
dominating, intimidating.
	   Johnson, pitching fewer than 48 hours after Houston swung the
big trade to get him, struck out 12 in seven innings and the Astros
scored four times in the eighth to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   Despite jet leg and an unfamiliarity with Pittsburgh hitters,
Johnson was just as menacing for the NL Central-leading Astros as
he was for the Seattle Mariners.
	   His 12 strikeouts gave him 225 for the season _ he led the AL
before he was traded Friday for three prospects _ and are an
Astros' season high.
 &UR; Mets 9, Dodgers 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, Armando Reynoso pitched seven strong innings and
Butch Huskey homered before leaving with a hamstring injury as the
New York Mets beat former teammate Brian Bohanon and the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
	   The Mets won for the 10th time in 14 games. They won twice in a
three-game series between NL wild-card contenders.
	   Reynoso (2-0) allowed only an unearned run on two hits in his
second start of the season. Turk Wendell pitched two innings in
relief to finish the combined five-hitter.
	   Bohanon (4-7), traded from the Mets to Los Angeles on July 10,
gave up six runs on five hits in six innings.
 &UR; Brewers 7, Diamondbacks 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Brad Woodall pitched seven strong innings to win
for the first time since June 27 as the Brewers avoided a
three-game sweep by the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Woodall (5-5) gave up one run and five hits, walked three and
struck out a career-high eight, including Andy Stankiewicz to
strand the bases full in the seventh.
	   The Brewers scored seven runs off Brian Anderson (7-10), who
gave up 10 hits in four-plus innings and issued his first walk in
32 innings.
 &UR; Giants 15, Phillies 3 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, on a huge day for hitting, Barry Bonds almost
landed his biggest blow at the mound.
	   Bonds went 4-for-4 and drove in three runs, then tackled
Philadelphia reliever Ricky Bottalico after being hit by a pitch as
the San Francisco Giants beat the Phillies.
	   Newly acquired Ellis Burks, Bonds and Jeff Kent hit consecutive
home runs in the second inning _ the first time the Giants had hit
three in a row since 1982 _ as San Francisco defeated Philadelphia
for the third straight day.
	   Bonds homered, tripled and singled twice. He had also stolen a
base in the fifth when the Giants were up 9-2, which may have
prompted what happened the next time he batted.
 &UR; Rockies 6, Cubs 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Neifi Perez hit a go-ahead single in a three-run
seventh inning as the Colorado Rockies snapped a three-game losing
streak.
	   Pedro Astacio (10-10) improved his record since the All-Star
break to 4-1, and also helped himself with an RBI double and
sacrifice bunt. He allowed five hits and three runs in seven
innings.
	   Chuck McElroy pitched the final two innings for his second save.
	   Chicago's Sammy Sosa, second in the majors with 42 homers, went
0-for-2 with two walks.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Roger Clemens, still pitching for Toronto
after a flurry of trade rumors, struck out a season-high 14 and won
his ninth straight decision Sunday as the Blue Jays beat the
Minnesota Twins 6-4.
	   Clemens (14-6), who has not lost in 12 starts since May 29,
pitched eight innings and allowed six hits and one earned run. He
tied David Cone of the New York Yankees for the AL's longest
winning streak this year _ San Diego's Kevin Brown currently has
won 10 in a row.
	   Clemens fanned at least one batter in every inning and reached
double digits in strikeouts for the 87th time in his career.
	   There was speculation Friday that Clemens might get sent to the
Yankees, Cleveland or Houston in a deal before the midnight trading
deadline. Instead, the Blue Jays held onto their ace.
	   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, who turns 36 on Tuesday,
started fast, striking out four of the first five batters. Randy
Myers got one out for his 28th save.
	   Shawn Green, who went 4-for-5 and scored three times, tied it in
the fourth when he hit his 20th home run, connecting off Brad Radke
(10-9).
 &UR; Orioles 9, Royals 2
	   In Kansas City, Eric Davis' two-run double stretched his hitting
streak to 20 games and helped the Baltimore Orioles beat the Kansas
City Royals and avoid a three-game sweep.
	   Jeffrey Hammonds homered, had two doubles and drove in two runs.
Rafael Palmeiro also had two doubles and two RBIs as every
Baltimore starter hit safely.
	   Rookie Sidney Ponson (5-6) won his fourth straight decision.
Glendon Rusch (6-14) lost his fifth in a row.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Devil Rays 2
	   In St Petersburg, Florida, Bobby Higginson hit a three-run homer
and Brian Powell pitched seven strong innings as the Detroit Tigers
defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Higginson's opposite-field drive to left-center in the fifth
inning was his 20th homer of the season. He has hit at least 20
homers in three consecutive seasons.
	   Powell (2-2) gave up two runs and four hits and Todd Jones
pitched the ninth for his 19th save. Bryan Rekar (1-3) took the
loss.

	   The region's governments, meanwhile, are campaigning against
Washington's 38-year-old embargo of Cuba, which they say doesn't
work and is inhumane.

Burton wins day of survival at du Maurier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ The shootout turned into survival Sunday
at the du Maurier Classic, something Brandie Burton understands as
well as anyone.
	   Beset by injuries and self-doubt over five winless years on the
LPGA Tour, Burton won the final major championship of the season by
making an 8-foot par putt on the last hole to beat Annika Sorenstam
by one stroke.
	   Burton closed with an even-par 72, still enough to set a
tournament record at 18-under 270, the lowest score in relation to
par ever at a women's major. Betsy King had a 17-under 267 in
winning the 1992 LPGA Championship.
	   ``My heart is about out of my chest right now,'' Burton said,
wiping away tears. ``I definitely did it the hard way.''
	   Nothing came easy on another warm, sunny day that finally dried
out the greens and, along with the Sunday pressure of a major, put
some teeth into the Essex Golf &AMP; Country Club.
	   None of the players within six shots of the lead managed to
break 70.
	   And Burton, who also won the du Maurier in 1993 in a playoff
over King, made it especially difficult on the final two holes.
	   ``I was just trying to cross the finish line,'' Burton said.
	   Leading Sorenstam by one stroke on the par-5 17th, Burton sailed
her 3-wood into a swale of rough to the right of the green. With
Sorenstam facing a 25-foot (7-meter) eagle putt, Burton raised the
heel of her wedge slightly to keep it from getting caught in the
rough, and chipped to 4 feet (1.2 meters)
	   Both walked off with birdies, but Burton kept the outcome in
doubt when her 7-iron into the 18th hit a tall oak tree hanging
over the right side and kicked into the fairway, 60 yards (54
meters) short.
	   She chipped over the ridge to 6 feet (1.83 meters) . After
Sorenstam hit a nice chip out of the rough to assure par, Burton
hit her 8-footer (2.4 meters) into the center of the cup, bent over
and buried her face in her hands.
	   ``Two years ago, I honestly couldn't tell you if I would be on
top again,'' Burton said. ``I wasn't enjoying the game. It was
work.''
	   King, needing a victory to complete the LPGA career grand slam,
was two strokes behind until she bogeyed the last two holes. She
had a 72 and finished third, five strokes behind.
	   Meg Mallon, who grew up just across the Detroit River in
Farmington, Mich., got to within one stroke of Burton at the turn,
but shot 40 on the back nine and finished with a 75.
	   She tied for fourth at 272, along with Canadians Dawn Coe-Jones
and Gail Graham, and Michelle Estill.
	   Se Ri Pak, trying to become the first woman since Pat Bradley in
1986 and the first rookie ever to win three majors in a year, had a
1-over 73. She finished at 283.
	   She finally takes a break _ although a week of filming
television ads awaits _ and will resurface in two weeks at the
Women's British Open.
	   ``Maybe I'll practice a little bit,'' she said. ``Then I just
rest. I want to sleep.''
	   Burton was the LPGA rookie of the year in 1991 as a 19-year-old.
She won four tournaments _ including three in 1993 _ before she
turned 22.
	   But the 26-year-old Californian hadn't won since. Injuries to
her wrist, rib and back, plus three jaw surgeries, kept her in and
out of the game. Burton walked away from golf for five months
before deciding she couldn't live without it.
	   ``I'm a lot happier now than when I won my first tournament,''
she said. ``I was so locked into golf. I wasn't having fun. I'll
make sure I enjoy this one.''
	   Sorenstam regained the lead on the money list over Pak, but
found greater consolation in being in serious contention at a major
for the first time since she won her second straight U.S. Women's
Open in 1996.
	   That was at Pine Needles, North Carolina, where she was paired
with Burton in the final round.
	   ``It was her turn this time,'' Sorenstam said. ``I gave it all I
had. Winning is obviously very important, and I had a chance. But I
was beaten by someone who played well.''
	   The victory means the LPGA's four majors this year were won by
players in their 20s. Pat Hurst was 28 when she won the Dinah Shore
in March, and the 20-year-old Pak won the LPGA Championship and the
U.S. Open.

Long grind finally catches up with Pak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Six straight golf tournaments, three of
which she won, have taken their toll on Korean rookie Se Ri Pak.
Now, all she wants to do is sleep.
	   The 20-year-old sensation fell far short in her bid to become
the first rookie to win three majors in one year Sunday, shooting
1-over-par 73 to finish at 283 in the du Maurier Classic. That left
Pak 13 strokes behind winner Brandi Burton in the season's final
major.
	   Enough, already. She'll skip the Star Bank LPGA this week at
Beavercreek, Ohio.
	   ``Maybe I'll practice a little bit, then I just rest,'' said
Pak, who hasn't returned to South Korea since moving to Orlando,
Florida, last summer. ``I want to sleep.''
	   Pak, complaining of a sore shoulder, looked utterly worn out
from the grind of playing and trying to deal with the media
attention her run has generated. Large galleries, including
hundreds of reporters and photographers, shadowed her every move at
Essex Golf &AMP; Country Club during the week.
	   The pack following Pak included almost 70 media types from back
home where she's become a national hero. It got to be almost more
than she could bear.
	   ``I think that's why sometimes my shot is not perfect, because
my body's a little heavy or something,'' said Pak, winner of four
tournaments this season, three in the five weeks leading up to du
Maurier. ``I need rest and will get more better.''
	   Pak is the first player since Juli Inkster in 1984 to win two
majors in her rookie season. She won the LPGA Championship in May,
and four weeks ago became the youngest player to win the U.S.
Women's Open. A triumph in the du Maurier would have made Pak the
first woman since Pat Bradley in 1986 to win three majors in a
season and the first golfer since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three in
a row.
	   ``Every time, I try to do my best,'' Pak said in her broken
English. ``But golf is sometimes bad, sometimes good. This week not
that bad. I'm not miss by much but sometimes something makes
trouble.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TEAM CANADA: Dawn Coe-Jones did her best Justin Rose imitation
on the 18th hole Sunday.
	   Rose, then an amateur and the darling of his countrymen at the
British Open, holed a wedge shot from 45 yards (41 meters) on the
home hole at Royal Birkdale, resulting in a thunderous roar from
the English fans.
	   Coe-Jones, the low Canadian in the du Maurier, chipped in for
birdie on the final hole to the delight of her adoring crowd.
	   ``I caught the ball cleanly,'' said Coe-Jones, who shot 70 for
276. ``It hit it a bit off the toe and _ bingo! _ it turned out
great.''
	   The shot also helped Coe-Jones tie countrywoman Gail Graham
(68), another of the four Canadians in the tournament.
	   ``There is a lot of pressure on all the Canadians,'' Coe-Jones
said. ``I want to win this tournament more than any tournament we
play.''
	   Liz Earley finished at 285 and Marie-Jose Rouleau 288, rounding
out the home team scores.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; U.P. POWER: Becky Iverson, from Michigan's Upper Peninsula,
struggled with a sore left knee the final two days of the
tournament. Iverson, who lives in Gladstone, opened fast with
rounds of 69-66 but was clearly in pain the final two days,
finishing 75-73 to tie Pak and five others at 283.
	   ``Playing golf plus maybe being a catcher when I was a kid was
not such a good idea,'' said Iverson, who had to lift her left foot
and step away from the ball on tee shots _ not unlike a baseball
player bailing out on an inside pitch. ``But, I had problems with
my knee even when I was a kid.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DIVOTS: Smriti Mehra, the only professional female golfer from
India, has been trying to teach yoga to her idol, Nancy Lopez. ``At
least I tried to, but she chickened out,'' Mehra said with a laugh.
Mehra (72) and Lopez (68) both finished at 281. ... Graham's
father, who had double-bypass surgery three days before the
tournament started, said she got a little emotional toward the end
of the tournament. ``I was just really pleased that I could kind of
put things aside and concentrate on my game and play well,'' Graham
said. ... Meg Mallon (75-276), who finished in a four-way for
fourth, was a little unhappy with the way the greens were allowed
to dry out during the week. ``It would be like in the middle of the
U.S. Open if they decided to completely change the conditions and
cut the rough and slow the greens down. And that's what happened
today. You couldn't hit it at the pins like we did the first three
days,'' Mallon said. ``You come here to practice on Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday to play a golf course that we think we're going to
play consistently all week.''

	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ It won't change the results of a
disappointing World Cup showing, however the United States did
reclaim some bragging rights in Major League Soccer's third
All-Star game.
	   Brian McBride of the Columbus Crew scored one goal and assisted
on two others Sunday as the U.S. All-Stars beat the World All-Stars
6-1 before a crowd of 34,416 at the Florida Citrus Bowl.
	   Nine of 11 U.S. starters were members of the national team that
went 0-3 in France this summer, and they viewed this game as an
opportunity to regain a measure of international respect.
	   McBride and MetroStars teammates Alexi Lalas and Tab Ramos
scored in the first 16 minutes, and the U.S. built a 4-0 lead
before D.C. United's Roy Lassiter and Cobi Jones of the Los Angeles
Galaxy finished the rout with goals in the final 12 minutes.
	   The World team avoided a shutout when Tampa Bay's Mauricio Ramos
scored on an assist from Chicago's Jorge Campos, who started the
game in goal before returning as a forward in the 89th minute.
	   The first two MLS All-Star games were played under an Eastern
vs. Western conference format that was abandoned for the U.S.-World
concept this year.
	   While winning didn't bury memories of a poor World Cup showing,
the U.S. team's domination was complete. McBride was the MVP,
breaking World star Carlos Valderrama's two-year stranglehold on
the award, but he had plenty of help.
	   The U.S. team beat Campos on four its first five shots on goal,
while goalkeeper Tony Meola stopped shots by five different World
players before being replaced by Zach Thornton at the start of the
second half.
	   Valderrama, rumored to be headed for the New England Revolution
in a trade spurred by his dispute with Miami Fusion coach Ivo
Wortmann, started and played all but about 15 minutes of the game.
	   Without providing specifics, MLS commissioner Doug Logan told
ABC Sports during the telecast that a multi-player deal involving
Valderrama is under consideration.
	   Logan said the situation with one of the league's most popular
players, who was fined a MLS-record $10,000 for refusing to
practice for the Fusion last week, likely will be resolved in the
next day or two.
	   Valderrama had one goal and four assists in two previous
All-Stars games, but wasn't much of a factor Sunday.
	   Tad Ramos, assisted by McBride and Marcelo Balboa, gave the
United States a 1-0 lead in the fifth minute. Lalas and McBride
scored within a minute of one another to make it 3-0, and a goal by
Kansas City's Preki late in the first half all but assured U.S.
would walk away with bragging rights.

Cuba wins its 22nd World title by defeating SKorea 7-1

	   ROME (AP) _ Cuba claimed its 22nd gold medal at the World
Baseball Championships Sunday, defeating South Korea 7-1 and
extending its winning streak to 41 games since 1986.
	   The final was a virtual repeat of the 1994 Worlds in Nicaragua,
which Cuba won.
	   The game's first run came in the fourth inning when Cuban
outfielder Oscar Machado, 31, reached home on a double by Antonio
Pacheco.
	   Infielders Orestes Kindelan, Pacheco, and Omar Linares _ Cuba's
leading player, nicknamed ``El Nino'' _ each scored in the sixth
inning to help Cuba pull ahead.
	   Also in the sixth, South Korea's 19-year-old infielder,
Myung-Chul Shin, cracked the game's only home run, scoring his
team's lone point.
	   Starting pitcher Jose Contreras went the distance for Cuba,
tossing a five-hitter and striking out 13.
	   It was the Cuban national team's sixth straight World title.
	   ``The players' extraordinary efforts and their drive to win paid
off again,'' said Jorge Lusson, an official from Cuba's minister of
sports.
	   Cuba dominated the tournament from the start, rolling over
opponents including Nicaragua (14-2), in the semifinals, and the
Netherlands (12-1), in the quarters.
	   The United States and Canada were eliminated in the preliminary
round.
	   Cuba has taken home the gold at every world championship it has
contested since 1952, a total of 22 titles from 25 tournaments.
	   This edition was open to professionals for the first time, but
no Major League players participated.
	   The South Koreans advanced to the final after an 8-2 victory
over Italy, which had never previously reached the semifinals at
the Worlds.
	   South Korea has contested nine Worlds and won only once, in
1982.
	   In consolation games, Nicaragua beat Italy 5-1 to finish third,
Japan beat the Netherlands 9-3 to finish fifth, and Australia
defeated the Dominican Republic 9-2 to finish seventh.

Mexican inmates begin hunger strike claiming they are political

<TEXT>
	   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Eighty-three inmates began a
hunger strike Sunday to demand their freedom, saying they are
political prisoners in the tense Mexican state of Chiapas.
	   The Indian inmates, who are jailed in Yajalon and Tuxtla
Gutierrez on criminal charges such as homicide, robbery, and
plundering, pledged to go without food until the end of August.
	   Aurelio Lopez Ruiz, a spokesman for the prisoners, said the men
believe they are imprisoned because they sympathize with the
leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   The rebels rose up in Chiapas in 1994 to demand greater
democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks with the government broke
down in 1996.

Nine for nine again for U.S. Postal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - It's getting to be a habit for Mark Gorski and the
U.S. Postal riders on the Tour de France.
	   For the second year in a row, the U.S. Postal team delivered all
nine of its competitors to the finish line of the three-week event
that started in Ireland 21 stages and nearly 3,850 kilometers
(2,400 miles) ago.
	   Only one other team can match that -- the German Telekom team
with two Tour de France champions, Jan Ullrich and Bjarne Riis,
among its riders. There were 21 teams at the start.
	   Gorski, the U.S. Postal team director and 1984 Olympic sprint
cycling gold medalist, knows what it took for the riders of the
only American team in the race to finish like it did.
	   ``We have a great spirit on our team. A spirit of `Let's get it
done. We're all in this together' ``, Gorski said. ``And six out of
our nine have had a top five finish in this race.''
	   George Hincapie, the American champion from Charlotte, North
Carolina, had another top four finish on the 21st stage Sunday. He
was once within two seconds of the overall lead and ended up 53rd.
	   ``I feel bad for him not taking the yellow jersey,'' Gorski
said. ``He brought the Tour de France back to America that first
week in a way that it meant a lot to the United States, the U.S.
Postal Service and him personally.''
	   Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Massachusetts ended up 51st but had
a surprising second in the first time trial.
	   ``Tyler was to me the revelation. To finish second in the time
trial of 58K to Jan Ullrich by a minute was phenomenal,'' Gorski
said.
	   Frankie Andreu of Dearborn, Michigan, finished just 58th but it
was the seventh consecutive time that Andreu had started and
finished the Tour.
	   ``Frankie is the guy that keeps the staff and the team directors
and all the other riders on their toes,'' Gorski said. ``He has
been around so long that he knows exactly what we have to do.''
	   Marty Jemison of Park City, Utah was 59th. ``He is part of the
glue that keeps the team together,'' Gorski said.
	   Two of the foreign riders placed in the top 15 of the overall
standings, both less than 20 minutes behind champion Marco Pantani.
	   Jean-Cyril Robin of France was sixth and Dariusz Baranowski of
Poland was 12th
	   ``I know that J.C. is so proud of his performance in the race.
Never had a individual finish above ninth but sixth overall,'' said
Gorski. ``That speaks volumes of his consistency day in and day
out.''
	   Also Viatcheslav Ekimov of Russia was 25th; Pascal Derame of
France ended up 84th but came close to winning the 19th stage,
ending up fourth.
	   Peter Meinert-Nielsen of Denmark came in 45th to complete the
nine-for-nine finish

	   Reyes (1-4), recalled from the minors on Saturday, held the
Marlins to one run and three hits in six innings for just his third
major league victory.
	   Reyes, who started the season with the Dodgers' Triple-A
affiliate in Albuquerque, was acquired by the Reds in a trade for
reliever Jeff Shaw on July 4. His two previous major league wins
came last year with the Dodgers.
	   Danny Graves pitched three scoreless innings for his third save.
In the eighth, he struck out Craig Counsell with two outs and the

two runs and four hits.

Estelle, Alex growing weaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Estelle, Alex both weakening. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Hurricane Estelle was growing weaker Sunday as it
moved further out into the Pacific far off Mexico's western coast.
	   Sunday afternoon, the center of the storm was about 750 miles
(1,200 kms) west-southwest of the tip of the Baja California
Peninsula, the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said.
	   Estelle's maximum sustained winds were 115 mph (185 kph), down
from 130 mph (209 kph) earlier in the day. The storm was moving at
14 mph (22 kph) to the west-northwest, a path expected to continue
through Monday.
	   The hurricane center said the storm was becoming disorganized
and its eye had lost its definition. Estelle was entering cooler
waters, indicating the system likely would continue to weaken.
	   Meanwhile, tropical storm Alex dropped below storm strength
Sunday, weakening before reaching the Leeward Islands.
	   In Miami, the National Weather Service said reports from an Air
Force hurricane-chasing plane indicated Alex was producing little
more than a few showers and locally gusty winds.
	   Alex still was about 300 miles (485 kms) east-northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands when the storm began dissipating,
forecasters said. The islands are about 1,000 miles (1,600 kms)
southeast of Miami.

Police close temple fearing violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ Police closed a Sikh temple and surrounding
streets Sunday, fearing a violent clash between moderate and
fundamentalist factions.
	   Only Ross Street temple executives were allowed behind police
lines because of a growing conflict between the two groups.
	   Police were unable to mediate a solution in the long-running
religious dispute, and were certain violence would erupt, Police
Chief Bruce Chambers said.
	   One person was taken into custody, then released.
	   ``It was very tense for a while,'' said spokesman Sgt. Gord
Elias. ``We had the two opposing sides on different sides of the
street, yelling back and forth.''
	   The streets around the temple were reopened Sunday afternoon
after the crowd of about 1,000 dispersed.
	   ``(The temple) will remain closed for an indefinite period of
time,'' said Elias.
 &UR; Pundits predict Clinton will step down on schedule
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The scandal that has dogged U.S. President Bill
Clinton since rumors of an affair with a White House intern
surfaced in January will weaken the presidency but not seriously
harm the president.
	   That was the overwhelming conclusion of a panel of lawyers and
media pundits Sunday at a forum on the coverage of Washington
scandals as part of the American Bar Association's annual meeting.
	   When asked at the end of the two-hour debate what the fallout
will be for Clinton, most predicted no impeachment, as some have
suggested, but that the president will step down on Jan. 1, 2001 as
scheduled.
	   ``My one prediction would be that however this turns out, the
institution of the president will be weakened by all this,'' said
Walter Delinger, a former top official in Clinton's Justice
Department. ``I think there's been a general disregard for the
office of the presidency.''
	   Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor appointed four years ago
to investigate the Clintons' involvement in the Whitewater land
deal and who now heads the probe into the president's alleged
affair with Monica Lewinsky, is in Toronto for the conference but
did not participate in the round-table discussion.
 &UR; World experts gather for Titanic salvage attempt
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ Historians and scientists will try to recover
critical pieces of the Titanic this week in an underwater
expedition that might lead to a better understanding of the
ill-fated oceanliner's demise.
	   A team of about 100 people are gathered off the coast of
Newfoundland where the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in 1912.
	   They plan to bring to the surface a part of the ship's hull and
analyse the underwater micro-organisms that are steadily eating
away at the once-mighty vessel.
	   The expedition, which runs from Aug. 5 to Aug. 8, will attempt
to clarify what happened underwater when the ship sank and how
certain marine processes continue to destroy it.

	   EDMONTON (AP) _ An Alberta teen who won a national modelling
contest is headed to Europe, filled with dreams of becoming the
world's next supermodel. Amanda Hoover of St. Albert, will vie for
a $1-million modelling contract in the International Elite Model
Look finals in Nice, France in mid-September. The 16-year-old beat
out 10,000 entrants from across Canada in the Elite Model
Management's Model Look '98 national finals.

Report: Nissan Motor Co. to stop making 200SX coupe in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's struggling No. 2
automaker, will stop producing and marketing 200SX subcompact
coupes at its Tennessee plant in 1999, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The decision is part of Nissan's efforts to restructure its
debt-ridden North American operations, the Nihon Keizai newspaper
reported, quoting company sources.
	   The two-door cars are the first models affected by Nissan's
group-wide restructuring program, announced in May, the report
said.
	   Local production of the 200SX _ known as the Lucino in Japan _
started in April 1995 at the company's plant in Smyrna, Tennessee.
The model was among Nissan's top products in the U.S. market,
selling 42,000 units in 1995, reported the paper, Japan's top
business daily.
	   But sales fell to 7,700 cars in the first six months of 1998,
partly due to the overall popularity of sports-utility vehicles, it
said.
	   The daily said Nissan plans to start producing sport utility
vehicles in the United States beginning next year.
	   Nissan has also been hit by domestic sales declines along with
Japan's slumping economy.

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In what would be a crucial victory
ahead of the 2000 presidential elections, the opposition National
Action Party captured the governor's seat in the central state of
Aguascalientes, according to television exit polls.
	   The polls by Televisa and Television Azteca also showed the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, as expected, holding
onto governor's seats in the gulf coast state of Veracruz and the
southeastern state of Oaxaca.
	   Official preliminary results were to be released later.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the governing party, known as
the PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to compensate for the loss.
	   According to Televisa's poll, PAN candidate Felipe Gonzalez
Gonzalez captured 50 percent of the vote. The PRI's candidate,
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, had 41 percent and Alfonso Bernal
Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party had 6
percent. It did not give the margin of error in its poll.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes as the small, relatively prosperous state has become
more urban and middle class in recent years.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, said he voted for
the PAN for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Turnout figures among Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters
were not immediately available, but the state electoral council
reported earlier in the day that turnout was strong and there were
no major problems.
	   In Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and the son of
a former president, won with 52 percent of the vote, according to
the Televisa poll. Luis Pazos of the PAN finished a distant second
with 28 percent of the vote.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential win for the
PRI. With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's
third-largest electorate and could be crucial in the presidential
election.
	   If the final results reflect the showing of the exit poll, the
win could make Aleman a top contender for the PRI's presidential
nomination.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But its won two of three elections last
month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, PRI candidate Jose Nelson Murat Casab won with 51
percent of the vote, according to the exit poll. It said the
Democratic Revolution candidate, Hector Sanchez, finished second
with 34 percent.

15,000 people living in housing threatened by storms in Acapulco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Nearly two months into the Pacific
hurricane season, more than 15,000 people in Acapulco still live in
housing that is at high risk of danger during strong storms, the
city's mayor said Sunday.
	   The government plans to relocate 500 families to safer housing
but it is not possible to move all of the people who live in
dangerous zones, Mayor Manuel Anorve Banos said.
	   In October 1997, 150 people were killed when Hurricane Pauline
hit Acapulco. Most of the deaths occurred in the city's poor,
hillside neighborhoods where there is little regulation over
construction of cardboard-and-stick shacks.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces are pressing their
attacks against ethnic Albanian secessionists, burning homes and
shelling villages in rebellious Kosovo province despite President
Slobodan Milosevic's pledge that the offensive was over. The
campaign to drive Albanian civilian from their homes is reminiscent
of the tactic of ``ethnic cleansing'' _ or forced removal of rival
ethnic groups _ which marked conflicts in former Yugoslav republics
of Bosnia and Croatia earlier in this decade. Both Serb and
Albanian sources reported fighting Sunday in the Drenica region of
central Kosovo and along the Albanian border southwest of this
provincial capital. Each blamed the other for shooting first.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ This week may be the last for
direct Mideast peace talks unless Israel accepts an American peace
plan to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank, a
Palestinian official said Sunday. Nabil Abourdeneh, a senior aide
to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said a crucial Monday meeting
scheduled between negotiators would be the deciding factor for the
continuation of talks. ``If the Israelis are not going to present
something new on accepting the American proposals, then tomorrow's
meeting may be the last direct meeting between the two sides,''
Abourdeneh told The Associated Press. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Hundreds of people gave Fidel
Castro a roaring welcome Sunday in Grenada, the Caribbean island
that is the only place where U.S. and Cuban forces fought
face-to-face in the Cold War. At the international airport where
the bloody 1983 fighting took place, Castro clasped his hands over
his heart when Grenadians began singing a revolutionary song:
``Forward march, forward march against imperialism!'' Castro said
history would judge the battle. ``On a day like this I would rather
pay my respects to all who perished in that conflict,'' he said.
But his visit _ the final stop on an unprecedented three-nation
Caribbean tour _ marked a dramatic turnaround in Caribbean
relations with Cuba, once shunned as an exporter of communist
revolution. (CARIBBEAN-CASTRO)
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels armed with machetes and clubs
hacked to death as many as 110 people in attacks northwest of the
Rwandan capital, an army commander said Sunday. Col. Fred Ibingira
said soldiers had counted 110 bodies of those killed in attacks
late Friday at the Buheta and Raba communes, about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) northwest of the capital, Kigali. Word of the attacks
did not come until Sunday. Ibingira said the attackers, who
included residents of the area, burned down a local official's
house. It wasn't immediately clear whether the official had been
killed. (RWANDA-REBEL ATTACK)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Five Indian civilians were killed in
Pakistani shelling Sunday as the rival armies resumed the
four-day-old artillery exchange along their disputed border in
Kashmir after a brief lull, officials said. Three people including
two women were killed in the Uri region of the Jammu-Kashmir
frontier and two men were killed near Baramulla town, United News
of India said quoting an official spokesman. India and Pakistan
have fought two wars over Kashmir since both nations became
independent in 1947. It is divided between them by the
400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control monitored by the United
Nations. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After avoiding the cliched British costume drama
with fresh, modern roles in ``Good Will Hunting,'' ``Big Night''
and ``Grosse Pointe Blank,'' Minnie Driver took the lead in the
period piece ``The Governess.''
	   ``I wanted to do a period drama, but I didn't want it to be
chocolate-boxy,'' Driver says in Sunday editions of The New York
Times. ``And sure enough, along came this twisted take on spiritual
subterfuge and blind eroticism.''
	   It's the story of a young Jewish woman in 1840s London who
learns she must hide her religious faith to find work as a
governess.
	   ``I'm fascinated by how much we, as women, have to subjugate and
hide ourselves in order to get on in the world,'' Driver said.
	   The 27-year-old actress started her career on British television
before landing her first big movie part in ``Circle of Friends''
opposite Chris O'Donnell. Steady work in U.S. films led Driver to
relocate to Hollywood, where some mistake her for an American
because she mimics the accent perfectly.
	   ``I think I'm viewed as being a bit of a traitor in Britain,''
admits Driver, who earned a best supporting actress Academy Award
nomination for ``Good Will Hunting.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Winning an Academy Award in an arty, esoteric
independent film didn't give Nicolas Cage a swelled head.
	   ``Actors can get high on their own importance and snob
themselves out of the business,'' Cage says in Sunday's Daily News.
``That's why I decided to go into movies that were perhaps more
escapist entertainment. Which is what I've always done: go as far
as I can in the opposite direction of what I've just
accomplished.''
	   After winning the best actor Oscar for ``Leaving Las Vegas,''
the story of a suicidal drunk, Cage made mainstream action films
with big-time costars in ``The Rock'' (Sean Connery), ``Con Air''
(John Malkovich), ``Face/Off'' (John Travolta), and the love story
``City of Angels'' with Meg Ryan.
	   Now Cage appears in the mainstream action-thriller ``Snake
Eyes.''
	   ``When I started acting, I was much more of an anarchist,'' Cage
said. ``I was only interested in doing kind of punk rock,
alternative expressions, and I neglected another side of the
industry. Then I became aware that I was about to intense or weird
myself right out of the business, and that I had to find some
balance.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Burt Reynolds is getting
reorganized _ financially speaking _ to end his bankruptcy.
	   Reynolds' creditors ``still have some terms that we're arguing
over but we're substantially in agreement'' on his plan of
reorganization, according to their lawyer, Bob Gilbert.
	   The plan now goes before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Hyman for
approval at a hearing tentatively set for October.
	   ``Mr. Reynolds would be out of bankruptcy protection and could
get on with his life,'' said a Reynolds' lawyer, Jim Leshaw.
	   Reynolds declared more than dlrs 10 million in debts when he
filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1996.
	   In the proposed plan, creditors would get up to dlrs 500,000 of
Reynolds' future earnings over two years, Leshaw said.
	   Reynolds, the star of the ``Smokey and the Bandit'' movies and
many other films, earned a best supporting actor Academy Award
nomination last year for ``Boogie Nights.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Evel Knievel is shopping for spare parts.
	   The retired motorcycle daredevil needs a liver transplant but is
even more concerned about others like him who have less time, so he
uses public appearances around the country to urge people to sign
organ donor cards.
	   ``I'm with a group called Life List, all waiting for livers,''
Knievel, 59, said Friday at the Three Rivers Regatta, where he was
master of ceremonies. ``There are people with us who'll die in
another five, six, seven days. I'd rather they got a liver than I
did. I'm feeling better actually.''
	   He blamed his failing liver on cirrhosis, along with hepatitis C
possibly contracted from one of the many blood transfusions he got
after spectacular crashes on the daredevil circuit in the 1960s and
'70s.
	   Knievel estimated he suffered at least 35 broken bones and
underwent surgery 14 times during his career, in which he made 300
death-defying jumps.
	   Knievel has no regrets for what he admits was a wild lifestyle
of fast-living and heavy drinking, saying, ``I had a great time.''
He was diagnosed with hepatitis C five years ago and estimates he
may be able to live until age 75 if he gets a liver transplant.
	   ___
	   PLATTSBURGH, New York (AP) _ The lure of the final episode of
``Seinfeld'' was too powerful for two American jail deputies who
were disciplined for rigging the surveillance video monitor to show
the television show.
	   Jeffrey Lozier was fired and Bryan Van Tilburg was suspended.
Van Tilburg quit the Clinton County force Thursday, saying he had
already planned to move out of the area.
	   ``Yes, I see what I did was wrong, and I should be punished,''
said Lozier, an eight-year veteran. ``But they went way to the
extreme. I've put my heart and soul into this department. It has to
count for something.''
	   A security monitor was disconnected and hooked up to a cable
wire to bring in the May 14 show. They were caught by another
surveillance camera that was monitoring them.
	   Sgt. Pamela Atwood, their shift supervisor, also was accused in
the incident, and she resigned in May. All three had been suspended
without pay.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduran authorities deported a
U.S. citizen Sunday who was wanted by the FBI and Texas authorities
in connection with homicide and fraud allegations.
	   Theodore Donald Young, 40, had been living illegally in suburban
San Pedro Sula for the past three years, Honduran police spokesman
Luis Antonio Mazzoni said.
	   With help from FBI agents, Honduran police arrested Young on
Thursday in San Pedro Sula, 160 kms (100 miles) north of
Tegucigalpa, where he owned a truck dealership.
	   Mazzoni said the FBI had been searching for Young since 1995 for
investigation of his alleged role in a killing and alleged fraud
committed against several U.S. companies.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ It took a full year, but students at a
co-ed school in southern Chile can now legally ``hold hands and
exchange kisses and simple caresses,'' the Santiago daily El
Mercurio reported Sunday.
	   According to the paper, the Court of Appeals in Valdivia, 850
kilometers (530 miles) south of Santiago, also ruled that male
students at the private Windsor School have the right to wear
earings and have long hair, and girls can dye their hair.
	   The school had issued strict regulations last year, but students
Mariano and Eduardo Vodanovic, aged 13 and 15, sued the school with
the support of their father, Natalio, who is an attorney.
	   ``Simple kisses and caresses contribute to the emotional
education of children and help develop the natural contact among
men and women,'' the Court ruled, according to the paper.
	   Earings, long or dyed hair ``pose no threat whatsoever to public
order or morals,'' it added.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Nearly one out of 10 Brazilians
dies without medical assistance, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   In 1996, 88,000 out of 908,000 Brazilians died without a doctor
by their side, according to a report released recently by the
federal health ministry. The study does not include people who died
from violent deaths.
	   ``This report indicates a lack of access to public health in
Brazil,'' Cassia Maria Buchala, a professor of public health at the
University of Sao Paulo told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.
	   Most deaths without medical aid occur in poor rural areas, where
people typically die at home or where hospitals and clinics are not
available. The impoverished northeast is the national leader with
49 percent of all deaths in the region occurring without a
physician.
	   In some cases, there isn't even a doctor to sign a death
certificate and families are forced to bury their relatives
illegally.
	   Critics here are pressing the federal government to open more
clinics in rural areas.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - More than sixty-six percent of
Brazil's 106 million eligible voters have little or no schooling, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Citing figures released by the federal Superior Electoral
Tribunal (TSE), the O Estado De Sao Paulo newspaper reported that
more than 70 million voters have less than a primary school
education. Moreover, 8.5 million are illiterate and only 3.4
million, or 3.2 percent have a high school degree.
	   ``Without schooling, people have little chance of making a
conscious voting decision,'' Senator Jose Eduardo Dutra told the
newspaper.
	   Piaui and Alagoas states have the worst voter profiles. In those
northeastern regions, 82 percent and 78 percent of voters
respectively have minimal schooling.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Thousands of Panamanians who back a drive to
allow the president to seek re-election drove through the capital
city's streets Sunday to rally support for the measure, which goes
before voters this month.
	   Some in the caravan, led by the governing Democratic
Revolutionary Party, waved placards reading ``Yes to work,'' and
``Yes to democracy.''
	   With the national vote four weeks away, support appears low for
the proposed constitutional amendment.
	   Panamanians will go to the polls on Aug. 30 to decide whether
President Ernesto Perez Balladares may run for a second term _ a
step his supporters say is needed to continue economic reforms and
free-market policies.
	   In the latest poll, published last week by the daily La Prensa,
the measure was favored by 33.8 percent of voters. That was steady
with the results of a June survey and down from 39 percent recorded
in March.
	   Opposition remained nearly unchanged from June at 49 percent.
	   Last week's poll of 1,203 Panamanians had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
	   The stake's of the referendum will be high. If voters say yes,
Perez Balladares is probably unbeatable in the 1999 election,
opposition leaders admit. If voters say no, the ruling party
doesn't have anyone groomed to succeed him.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces are pressing their
attacks against ethnic Albanian secessionists, burning homes and
shelling villages in rebellious Kosovo province despite President
Slobodan Milosevic's pledge that the offensive was over.
	   The campaign to drive Albanian civilians from their homes is
reminiscent of the tactic of ``ethnic cleansing'' _ or forced
removal of rival ethnic groups _ which marked conflicts in former
Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Croatia earlier in this decade.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting Sunday in the
Drenica region of central Kosovo and along the Albanian border
southwest of this provincial capital. Each blamed the other for
shooting first.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said Serb police shelled about
13 Albanian villages in the Drenica region, forcing civilians to
flee for their lives and then torching their houses.
	   Eight Albanians were reported killed, the Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said Sunday. Serb sources said two policemen
were killed and two others wounded in fighting at Prilep near the
Albanian border.
	   Witnesses said police used 20 milimeter anti-aircraft guns to
fire on Albanian houses in the Prilep fighting.
	   The clashes occurred just three days after Milosevic assured a
European Union delegation that the offensive, which began July 24,
was over. He later assured U.S. envoy Christopher Hill that tens of
thousands of Albanians displaced by the fighting could return to
their homes and international relief organizations could assist
them.
	   But in the Albanian capital Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party
courted by the United States accused the Serb-led Yugoslav
government of trying ``to make it impossible for thousands of
Albanians to return to their homes.''
	   The statement was issued by the Albanian Democratic Movement,
whose leader Mehmet Hajrizi has been mentioned as a key figure in a
planned Albanian team which U.S. diplomats hope can negotiate the
future of the majority Albanian province with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has promised to restore the autonomy he cancelled in
1989. But he and major powers oppose independence for Kosovo,
although Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province by 9-to-1.
	   The United States and European nations fear independence could
lead to demands by Albanian-speaking communities in Macedonia and
Montenegro to establish a ``Greater Albania'' in the southern
Balkans.
	   KLA leaders are expected to announce this week whether they will
accept a U.S. plan for Albanian politicians to enter peace talks
with Milosevic. The current Serb offensive appears designed to
deliver a strong blow against the rebels and force them to
negotiate from a position of weakness.
	   In a lengthy commentary Sunday, the government's Tanjug news
agency said the ``efficient action'' by Serb forces had ``almost
entirely broken down terrorist gangs of the so-called Liberation
Army of Kosovo.''
	   At the KLA headquarters in Likovac, a dusty, hilltop cluster of
buildings in the Drenica area, a KLA commander boasted that ``we
have not been defeated'' and that ``Serb attacks only make us
stronger.''
	   But other KLA members, who refused to give their names for fear
of punishment by their commanders, admitted that they have been
unable to blunt the Serb advance and protect Albanian villages.
	   ``We are underarmed and we cannot defend them,'' one rebel said.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs outpower them. U.S. diplomats
want them to make a deal. Still, ethnic Albanian rebel leaders
insist they can win independence for Kosovo.
	   Here in the dusty hilltop village where high rebel commanders do
business, the mood this weekend was defiantly optimistic.
	   ``The KLA is not being damaged by Serb attacks but on the
contrary is being strengthened,'' Commander Shaban Shala said
confidently while sitting in a cafe. ``We are holding territory and
getting more.''
	   But just kilometers (miles) away, villages are in flames from a
new attack. Shells boom in the valley below. The Serbs are closing
in, and some rebels admit they cannot stop them.
	   Many refugees have arrived in Likovac, where high-ranking KLA
commanders do business. The scene is like a Wild West outpost, full
of guns, intrigue and tension. Rebels whisper in the cafe or stride
past the refugees across the dirt square, most of them wearing the
usual KLA attire: camouflage, beret and automatic rifle.
	   Over and over, refugees give the same description of how Serb
police methodically destroyed their villages _ shooting to drive
out the people, looting the houses, emptying gallon jugs of
gasoline and setting the houses on fire.
	   ``The burned everything,'' said Hamdi Doci, fleeing with his
wife and four children.
	   Back in the cafe, one KLA fighter was despondent that rebels
were unable to protect the villages. ``We have good hearts,'' he
said. ``But we are underarmed and we cannot defend'' the people.
	   While the Serbs have tanks, heavy artillery and rocket
launchers, the KLA only has automatic rifles, said the fighter. He
refused to give his name for fear of angering a KLA leadership
secretive about the structure, number and power of its ranks.
	   For five months, Milosevic has been repelling the KLA's push for
independence in Kosovo, a province in the Serb republic that makes
up most of Yugoslavia. Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who outnumber
Serbs in the province 9-to-1, have been living under the oppressive
Milosevic regime since he yanked their autonomy in 1989.
	   Already, the recent fighting has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their homes, despite appeals from
humanitarian organizations and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill that
Serbs stop targeting civilians.
	   The Serb latest operation started after rebels tried to take the
town of Orahovic, a bold departure from their previous guerrilla
tactics of attacking Serb-controlled villages. Since then, their
defeat has been sweeping: Last week, Serbs drove the KLA from two
strategic roads and two strongholds.
	   For weeks, Hill has been trying to convince the KLA to unite
with ethnic Albanian politicians in talks with the Serbs on the
future of Kosovo. Politicians say they will accept autonomy as a
first step, but the KLA has insisted it will accept nothing less
than immediate independence.
	   One KLA faction says it is fighting for a ``Greater Albania''
which would entail redrawing borders to absorb Albanian-majority
parts of Macedonia and Montenegro.
	   ``Milosevic is a devil,'' said a KLA fighter who identified
himself only as ``FGB.'' He said he was prepared to see many ethnic
Albanians killed for the sake of liberating Kosovo. ``For
Albanians, this is our last chance. So we must pay every price.''
	   Hill met with KLA leadership last week here in Likovac, brought
to the rebel's fenced, brick offices by ethnic Albanian politicians
with close KLA ties. Since the meeting, the rebels have been
weighing whether to join politicians in a coalition that would form
the basis for a negotiating team with the Serbs.
	   Kosovo politicians say the KLA should give its approval this
week. Some KLA fighters said an announcement would come ``soon''
but none indicated they were anywhere near sacrificing their
independence goal.
	   After this weekend, the KLA may not have a choice. A leading
ethnic Albanian politician said the KLA missed its chance to really
negotiate and is now too weakened to do anything but enter talks.
``They are facing defeat but they don't know how to make anything
good out of it,'' said the politician, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Early Sunday, several KLA supporters ran to Likovac from a
nearby village to evaluate the fighting.
	   ``We have to keep fighting, because our cause is just,'' said a
man who gave his name as Den. ``But it's all over now. Everything
is gone, houses burned, women and children killed.''

Khatami transforming Iran into a nation ready for democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ In the year he has been president, Mohammad
Khatami has led a nation trying to make the difficult transition
from autocracy to democracy against the wishes of the powerful
hard-line clergy.
	   Although a cleric himself, Khatami has opposed the religious
hard-liners who have ruled Iran with an iron hand since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
	   His main achievement has been to open the political atmosphere
by raising issues and strictures troubling the average citizen. By
breaking the taboo on discourse, he has allowed Iranians to speak
their minds.
	   In a country headed by a religious leader seen by the clerics as
God's representative, Khatami has challenged the hard-line view
that freedom and human rights are somehow Western inventions out of
line with Muslim tradition.
	   Khatami, 55, says that without freedom there can be no Islam.
	   ``If religion stands in the way of freedom, it will lose,'' has
been one of his oft-repeated statements.
	   The president's efforts face a struggle. He has has been
powerless to change the laws because the Majlis, or parliament, is
dominated by hard-liners.
	   Although Khatami is the elected leader, the constitution gives
the hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, control of
such key instruments of power as the police and judiciary. And as
God's representative, he has the last word on all matters.
	   Still, in speeches and appointment of moderate ministers,
Khatami has sought to ease strictures such as public segregation of
the sexes _ a concern of one of Khatami's main constituencies, the
younger generation.
	   Even in foreign policy, Khatami watered down the war cry of
``Death to America'' by promoting cultural and sports exchanges
with a country known since the revolution as ``the Great Satan.''
	   Khatami's popularity has been his chief weapon since he took
office last Aug. 3. He received more than 20 million votes in May
elections, thrashing the hard-line candidate Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri,
in a country of 60 million population.
	   Thus, the hard-liners in parliament _ although they impeached
Khatami's interior minister to thwart his easing of the Islamic
social code _ approved another moderate to the post to avoid too
harsh a confrontation.
	   As the forces that got Khatami elected try to whittle away at
the power of the clerical hierarchy, the hard-liner's tactics have
made them even more unpopular. Some moderates feel the demand for
change is already too strong to be curbed.
	   ``There is no doubt about which side will win this power
struggle, but it could take time,'' said Abbas Amir Entezam, who
was in the provisional government after the revolution but was
later jailed for opposing the ruling clergy.
	   ``No matter what the hard-liners do, things can never go back to
the way they were,'' he said. ``Even if they do away with Mr.
Khatami, public opinion will force his successor to tread the same
path toward democracy.''

	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Nick Price won the FedEx St. Jude
Classic with a birdie on the second hole of a playoff Sunday with
Jeff Sluman for his first victory this season and second since
1994.
	   Price had made up two shots with three holes left by eagling the
par-5 16th for the third time in four days.
	   ``This turns my year around,'' he said. ``I feel like I've
gotten over a big hurdle this weekend.''
	   He had a chance to win in regulation, but missed a 7-foot
(2.3-meter) birdie try at No. 18. It rolled around the right edge
of the cup, but failed to drop.
	   ``I couldn't believe it stayed out,'' Price said. ``I didn't
want to go to extra time. My nerves weren't too good at that
point.''
	   Both players parred No. 18 _ the first playoff hole _ Price from
a fairway bunker.
	   Sluman put his tee shot into the water right of the fairway on
the second extra hole, the 375-yard (343 meters), par-4 No. 12.
	   Sluman hit his third shot to about 12 feet (4 meters), but never
got to try his par putt because Price rolled in a 20-foot (6-meter)
birdie try for his second St. Jude title. He also won in 1993.
	   ``I had a feeling he was going to make that putt,'' Price said.
``I read that one perfectly.''
	   It was the 11th second-place finish in Sluman's career. He has
two victories.
	   ``Anytime you're one off the lead and shoot 65, that's usually
enough to win,'' Sluman said. ``But Nick shot a great round. I did
all I could. I didn't make a bogey and had six birdies. What can
you do?''
	   In fact, Sluman did not make a bogey all weekend, shooting 66 on
Saturday and the day's low round of 65 on Sunday.
	   Price finished with a final-round 66.
	   ``I've played pretty solid all year but done as well as I felt I
should have,'' Price said. ``It's been frustrating.''
	   Sluman, playing in the group ahead of Price in regulation, took
the lead on No. 16, the 528-yard, par-5, with a birdie from about 2
feet (70 cms) to go 16-under.
	   Price trailed by two shots at that point. He made it up all at
once with the eagle at 16, a hole he played in 7-under-par for the
four rounds.
	   ``That's the best I've ever done any week on any hole in my
career,'' Price said.
	   Sluman parred the last three holes in regulation, coolly saving
par on No. 18 from a front greenside bunker with Price's perfect
tee shot sitting in the fairway behind him.
	   Price's approach on No. 18 in regulation was about 7 feet (2.3
meters) to the right of the hole. His putt to win rolled around the
right edge and out as Price reacted with disbelief.
	   ``At that point I was very happy to get back to No. 18,'' Sluman
said. ``I didn't think there was any chance Nick would miss that
putt.''
	   Glen Day matched Sluman for the best round of the day with a 65,
and held the lead when he came to the 18th tee. But he pulled his
tee shot left into the lake and made bogey to finish alone in third
place at 14-under 270 _ two shots back.
	   Bob Estes began the day tied with Price for the lead at
11-under, and jumped into the lead with birdies on four of his
first five holes. He was still in the hunt before bogeying the
par-3 14th when he couldn't get up and down from the left rough.
	   Another bogey, on No. 17, ended his chances.
	   Estes finished with a 69 for a 271, alone in fourth place.
	   Tim Conley (69) was at 272, followed by Paul Goydos (67) at
10-under and Jay Haas (68) and Paul Azinger (72) at 9-under.

Morgan is last man standing at Utah Showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Gil Morgan is hard enough to catch when
he's playing his regular game. Don't even think about it when he's
almost perfect.
	   Morgan played a third day of nearly flawless golf to win the
Utah Showdown on Sunday by four shots over Isao Aoki and John
Mahaffey.
	   Morgan played a bogey-free tournament, only the ninth in senior
tour history and the first since Hale Irwin did it at last year's
Vantage Championships. Morgan recorded his fifth win this season,
tying him with Irwin for the tour lead, and his second in four
weeks.
	   Though Morgan started the final round with a three-stroke lead
and dominated play for the third day, Aoki made Sunday interesting
with a big move on the front nine.
	   He birdied six of the first eight holes on the final clear,
windy day at the Park Meadows course. Aoki was just two shots
behind Morgan at the turn after starting the day five strokes back,
but he faded down the stretch, picking up just one birdie on the
back nine to finish with a final-round 66.
	   Mahaffey, a former PGA Championship winner who joined the senior
tour in May, birdied three of the last four holes to sneak into a
second place tie for his best senior tour finish.
	   Morgan, who finished with a final-round 67, won for the 12th
time in less than two years on the senior tour. He only decided to
enter the Utah Showdown earlier in the week and had never played
the Park Meadows course.
	   His scores weren't spectacular, but Morgan's drives and short
game were so solid that he faced no more than ``about six tough par
putts,'' he said.
	   Aoki's famed putting stroke was responsible for most of his six
birdies early in the round. He hit a 60-footer (18-meters) on the
4th hole, which he celebrated with a swing of his Panama hat and a
low bow to the cheering gallery.
	   But Aoki's putter deserted him on the back nine, and he could
only watch as Morgan pulled away with birdies on 11 and 14. Aoki
and Mahaffey were followed by Hugh Baiocchi in fourth place, six
strokes behind Morgan and a shot ahead of five players in fifth.
	   Defending champion Dave Stockton, who came from three strokes
back on the final day to win last year's tournament, never made a
much-anticipated charge and finished in a tie for 10th place.
Stockton has never successfully defended any of his 25 PGA and
senior tour wins.
	   Baseball Hall of Famer Johnny Bench played his best round of the
tournament Sunday, carding a 3-over 75. The senior tour rookie
finished the event in a tie for 72nd place with a 231.

Hakkinen wins German Grand Prix, extends Formula One lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ There was no rain and no miracle for
Michael Schumacher.
	   Despite threatening clouds, the weather held and Mika Hakkinen
led from the pole to capture the German Grand Prix on Sunday and
extend his Formula One championship lead over Schumacher to 16
points.
	   With five races left in the season and each victory worth 10
points, Hakkinen is moving closer to his first title.
	   ``There are still plenty of races left and anything can
happen,'' the Finn said. ``You have to keep pushing and go flat out
and that's what I intend to do.''
	   After his worst qualifying performance of the season that put
him only in ninth place on the starting grid, Schumacher could do
no better than fifth place in his Ferrari.
	   ``I am sorry that I was unable to do better in front of my home
crowd,'' Schumacher said. ``But after qualifying ninth and being
off the pace all weekend, there was no reason to expect a miracle
during the race.''
	   ``Finishing fifth was the best I could do,'' said the German,
who has won four races this season.
	   On the high-speed 6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) circuit, Hakkinen
overcame late engine problems to edge McLaren teammate David
Coulthard of Britain by 0.427 seconds over the 45 laps.
	   Defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve of Canada posted his
best finish of the season by coming in third in a Williams.
	   ``In the end, I was quite worried about the situation,''
Hakkinen said.
	   ``Jacques was pushing quite hard in third place and catching us.
There was some oil on the track and at the same time I started to
lose speed in the car. I was obviously concerned about all this,''
he said.
	   Hakkinen covered the 307.022-kilometer (190.774-mile) race
distance in one hour, 20 minutes, 47.984 seconds.
	   His victory dampened Schumacher's hopes of becoming the first
Ferrari driver to win the Formula One championship since Jody
Scheckter in 1979. Schumacher won two titles with different cars.
	   Hakkinen now has 76 points, while Schumacher has 60. Coulthard
is third with 42.
	   Coulthard said he had no real chance of overtaking Hakkinen,
despite the close finish.
	   ``It may look like a walk in the park to anyone who is watching,
but believe me, when you are doing 350 kph (210 mph) into the
braking area while following another car and losing downforce, it's
very difficult,'' the Briton said.
	   ``There is far too much at stake to go for glory and get it all
wrong. I don't need it for my championship and Mika doesn't need it
for his,'' he said.
	   Villeneuve said he tried to close in when he noticed Hakkinen
struggling over the last couple of laps.
	   ``I was trying to put pressure on the McLarens and I noticed
that Mika was having some problems. But then something broke in my
car as well and I had to slow down,'' Villeneuve said.
	   ``But we kept pace with them and it's good to be on the
podium,'' said the Canadian, who was 2.5 seconds behind Hakkinen.

Davenport defeats Williams to win Bank of the West title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport outlasted an injured
and erratic Venus Williams in three sets to win Sunday's sweltering
final of the Bank of the West tournament.
	   Playing in temperatures of more than 90 degrees (32 degrees
Celsius) that forced a 10-minute break before the third set, the
top-seeded Davenport won 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 to capture the dlrs 79,000
first prize.
	   The third-seeded Williams, who served 12 aces in her semifinal
victory Saturday night over Monica Seles, had 14 aces against
Davenport _ but also had eight double faults.
	   Williams took two injury timeouts during the second set, and
spent the last half of the match with her left leg and knee wrapped
in bandages.
	   Davenport got a break in the ninth game of the final set to go
up 5-4 and then needed four match points to close out the victory.
On the second match point, Williams hit a deep return that
Davenport thought was out.
	   Davenport let out a little scream and didn't try to return the
ball, then looked in shock as the linesman called the shot good.
	   ``I thought it went out, but it probably went in because it did
skid,'' she said. ``It's tough on a big point. Sometimes you just
want the ball to go out.''
	   Williams had gotten an early break in the third set and taken a
3-0 lead, but Davenport broke back in the fifth game and then got
the decisive break four games later.
	   Davenport kept Williams on the run in the first set, hitting
sharply angled shots to move the teenager around the court.
Davenport got the only break of the set in the seventh game.
	   Davenport got another break to go up 2-1 in the second set, and
Williams immediately took a five-minute medical timeout and had her
left leg bandaged. The injury appeared to leave Williams
off-balance on some returns.
	   The trainer also attended to Williams two games later, and came
out again two games after that to tape Williams' left knee and
extend the wrap around her leg.
	   Williams then rallied, breaking Davenport's serve to even the
set at 4-all and breaking serve again in the final game of the set.
The chair umpire then called a 10-minute timeout for the players
``due to the extreme weather conditions.''

Poll finds low support for new Japanese Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The newly formed Cabinet of Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi is supported by less than one-third of voters polled, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The poll, conducted by the Asahi newspaper, found that 32
percent surveyed over the weekend said they supported Obuchi's
Cabinet.
	   It also found that 47 percent said they do not support the new
administration. That figure was the worst disapproval rating for a
new Cabinet since the paper began taking polls on the subject in
1955, excluding the brief, scandal-tainted government of Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno in 1989.
	   The paper surveyed 1,130 registered voters Saturday and Sunday.
It provided no margin of error.
	   The Asahi survey follows one published Sunday by the Yomiuri
newspaper, Japan's largest, which put the Cabinet's approval rating
at a slightly higher 33.1 percent.
	   Obuchi, president of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
unveiled his Cabinet on Thursday after winning an election in
Parliament to become Japan's next leader.
	   He faces immediate pressure to quickly pull Japan's struggling
economy out of recession.

Five British tourists killed in Spanish traffic accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OLIVA, Spain (AP) _ Five British tourists were killed Sunday in
a head-on collision on a highway that runs along Spain's
Mediterranean coastline, news reports said.
	   Traffic was detoured around the accident for two hours while
firemen pried open the wreckage to remove the bodies, police told
the state news agency EFE.
	   The tourists, two women and three men ranging in age from 18 to
25, were returning to Benidorm from Valencia on national highway
332 about 5 p.m. (1900GMT) when their rental vehicle collided with
a truck, police told the news agency. The police said the tourists
had been vacationing in Benidorm,
	   The crash was within the Oliva municipal limits, a seaside town
about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Valencia, the regional
capital. Benidorm is south of Oliva.
	   Police said the bodies were taken to the morgue in Gandia, a few
miles north of Oliva. Officials did not identify the victims by
name or hometown and referred queries from The Associated Press to
British consular offices, which were closed.

U.S. wins for first time in eight years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ The United States won the Curtis Cup for the
first time in eight years Sunday, beating Great Britain-Ireland
10-8 in the two-day competition at The Minikahda Club.
	   Singles victories by Kellee Booth and Brenda Corrie-Kuehn with
four matches to go gave the U.S. team an insurmountable lead in the
biennial women's amateur golf event.
	   ``That's no resounding victory, but it was a victory, and that's
what we were trying for,'' said U.S. captain Barbara McIntire, who
also led the Americans to a win in the 1976 Curtis Cup. ``I'll take
any victory at all.''
	   Members of the U.S. team embraced each other after Corrie-Kuehn
beat Becky Morgan 2 and 1 with a par putt at the 17th hole.
	   ``When it left my club face, I knew it was in,'' Corrie-Kuehn
said. ``I was so excited. I felt so privileged to have the
opportunity to make the winning shot.''
	   Britain-Ireland won three of the last four matches Sunday, but
the rally came after the United States had clinched the Cup.
	   Karen Stupples beat Carole Semple Thompson 1-up, Rebecca Hudson
defeated Robin Burke 2 and 1, and Fiona Brown beat Jo Jo Robertson
1-up, before Virginia Derby-Grimes of the United States and Elaine
Ratcliffe of Britain-Ireland halved.
	   ``Had we won a match or two early on, who knows what would have
happened,'' Britain-Ireland captain Ita Butler said. ``As usual, it
came down to the short game. The U.S. holed some very long putts
and we didn't.''
	   Booth and Corrie-Kuehn teamed up for a pair of foursome
victories and each won two individual matches, making them the
fifth and sixth players to win four times in a single Curtis Cup.
	   Booth's 2 and 1 win over Kim Rostron helped complete a reversal
for Booth, who was on the U.S. team that lost the Cup in 1996.
	   ``We were pretty down two years ago,'' Booth said. ``This year
we came out with a real good attitude and won it.''
	   The Americans, who came into the final day needing four points
to win, took a 7 1/2-4 1/2 lead in the morning after winning two of
the three foursome matches.
	   The United States won despite a minimal contribution from Jenny
Chuasiriporn. The U.S. Open runner-up and future Duke teammate Beth
Bauer were beaten in both of their foursome matches, including a
2-up loss to Brown and Hudson on Sunday, while Chuasiriporn earned
a half-point in her singles match against Hudson Saturday.
	   The win was only the second for the Americans since 1986. They
lead the series 21-6-3.

Yugoslavia better without its stars than others without theirs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia without its big-name players is
better so far than the Americans without theirs.
	   Sure, the United States is missing all of its NBA stars in this
World Championship, but Yugoslavia is almost as hamstrung without
Vlade Divac, former NBAer Predrag Danilovic and injured playmaker
Aleksandar Djordjeciv.
	   Still, the Atlanta Olympic silver medalists, are 4-0 after
Sunday's 95-55 second-round bashing of Canada (1-3) where all 12
players scored led by Miroslav Beric with 13.
	   Host Greece is 4-0, but the biggest suprise is Spain, which is
also unbeaten as the tournament heads toward its final Aug. 9. All
three are assured of reaching Friday's quarterfinals.
	   The Americans (3-1) seem to have recovered from a loss last week
to Lithuania and also had all 12 in the scorebook. They beat
Argentina (2-2) 87-74 as Wendell Alexis _ a former star at Syracuse
_ led with 20.
	   After a four-year absence caused by sanctions during the war,
Yugoslavia returned in '95 to win the European title and repeated
it two years later.
	   This team _ stars or no _ is just as good, said coach Zeljko
Obradovic.
	   ``Certainly the absence of players such as (Zoran) Savic _ who
retired from international play _ and Danilovic and Divac is
consideable,'' Obradovic said. ``But I believe this team has a
quality equivalent to that of '95 when all those players were
present.''
	   The Americans at 3-1 were joined Russia and Italy with the same
records. Russia was a 71-55 winner over Italy, and Lithuania was
dumped from the unbeaten ranks by Australia 71-61.
	   ``I think it (the victory) was for re-establishing ourselves,''
said Alexis, whose 20 was followed by Jimmy Oliver with 18 and
Michael Hawkins with 15. ``I think after the loss to Lithuania
teams started to look at us with a lesser light.''
	   U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich has watched his team dip and climb
as it tries to tie together its CBA, college and European roots.
	   ``You can say we've had some ups and downs,'' Tomjanovich said.
	   ``Our intensity level coming into the game wasn't where it
should be,'' he added. ``We talked a little about us representing
the United States and also what this can do for players
personally.''
	   Russia's win over Italy (2-2) was keyed by Sergei Babkov with 26
and Mikhail Mikhailov added 15 rebounds. Italy was led by Gregor
Fucka with 15 points.
	   ``The win against Italy gives us hope of advancing to the final
four,'' said Russian coach Sergei Belov. ``It's important given the
fact we lost to Italy in the European championship (semifinals last
year).'' Italy eventually took silver and Russia bronze.
	   Lithuania, silver medalists in the last two Olympics, also finds
itself at 3-1 after losing to Australia as Andrew Gaze scored 24
for the Aussies and Saulius Stombergas led Lithuania with 17.
	   The Aussies, losers of two games here by a combined five points,
put the lid on Lithuanian forward Arturas Karnisovas who had only
10 points after averaging a tournament-high 22.7 in the first three
games.
	   Spain, which last won a medal in a major tournament with bronze
in the '91 Europeans, beat Brazil 73-61 with 17 each from Alberto
Angulo and Ignacio Rodriguez. Joao Jose Vianna had 15 for Brazil
(1-3).
	   Greece, a 71-64 winner over Puerto Rico, got 19 from Nikos
Economous to lead the way.
	   ``Some people think that because we're playing Greece, this is
going to be easy,'' said coach Panayiotis Giannakis, who played on
Greece's last great team _ the 1987 European champions. ``But I can
tell you nothing is simple.''
	   Greece has drawn near-sellouts while everyone else has played to
small crowds averaging 500 to 1,500.

Japanese see declining birth rate as threat to future

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A challenging job, more than enough money and
plenty of freedom. Hideko Arai figures she has it all _ except what
the Japanese government wants her to have: children.
	   With no plans for marriage and certainly no wish to raise a kid
on her own, Arai says her childless status is not going to change
soon.
	   ``If I decide I want to go somewhere, I can just go. If I want
to go out on the town, I can go out,'' explained the 36-year-old
marketing coordinator. ``I have my own money and my own freedom.''
	   Women like Arai are at the center of a national debate over what
the government says is a top threat to the country's future: the
declining birth rate.
	   The government fears that fewer babies _ births are down to an
all-time low of 1.39 per woman _ will mean a less prosperous, more
troubled and lonelier Japan. The trend will increasingly squeeze
funds needed to provide for the rapidly increasing numbers of
elderly among the 130 million Japanese.
	   The prospect of a childless future is forcing the country to
confront an array of forces, from cramped housing to rigid
traditional marriage roles, that discourage Japanese from having
more kids.
	   Japan is slowly changing to make it easier to raise children.
Men are helping out more at home as women increasingly go to work.
Babysitting agencies are sprouting up to fill the gaps in day care.
More bosses are allowing employees to take time off to care for
their children.
	   But the changes are not coming fast enough.
	   The Health and Welfare Ministry announced in June that the
current birth rate is far below what's needed to keep the
population steady. The number of children 14 or under _ 19.2
million _ is at its lowest since 1920. Within a decade, the total
population will begin to fall.
	   The trend will mean a shortage of workers to power the economy
and a dearth of taxpayers to finance the staggering pension and
health care bills of the future. The cost of those and other social
services could quadruple by 2025.
	   ``The balance between those who support and those who are
supported has collapsed,'' said Hiroshi Choda, a policy analyst
with the Health and Welfare Ministry.
	   In an apocalyptic projection illustrating the sense of crisis
the government feels, a recent Health Ministry report estimated
that if the current birth trend held up, the Japanese population
could disappear sometime around 3500.
	   Fewer kids could also mean an uninhabited Japan. Schools are
already closing in rural areas.
	   Despite the alarm bells, the government is unsure what to do.
Officials are pushing day-care centers to expand hours and cut
costs and have urged businesses to give employees more time to be
at home, but there's little agreement on what else should be done.
	   Some of the causes of the declining birth rate are familiar in
other countries, such as high rent and rising costs of raising
children. birth rates in Italy and Germany are even lower than in
Japan.
	   But there are other factors that have particular resonance here.
	   One is the persistence of traditional marriage roles. Women by
and large are expected to quit their jobs at marriage or when they
have children and devote themselves to cooking, cleaning and
raising a family.
	   For Japan's growing ranks of well-educated career women, the
life of a housewife seems unbearably humdrum. In a country where
only 1 percent of children are born to single mothers, having a
child outside marriage is not considered a serious option.
	   Arai, who works for the Max Wald computer consulting company in
Tokyo, said she has the same attitude about marriage as many of her
single contemporaries: She can take it or leave it.
	   ``If I'm just going out with a man, our relationship can be
equal,'' she said. ``But once we get married, that balance would
fall apart and he'll tell me to stay home.''
	   More Japanese women are thinking like Arai.
	   The percentage of unmarried women in their 20s in Japan is
nearing 50 percent. In 1972, nearly 80 percent of women thought it
was better to get married _ in 1990, that had plummeted to 40
percent.
	   Men are taking a dimmer view of marriage as well. Surveys find
many bachelors in their 30s say they either haven't met the right
person or prefer the freedom of being single. Both men and women
are getting married at older ages.
	   The Japanese way of work has also come under scrutiny. The
expectation that men will make their jobs their No. 1 priority is
keeping fathers at the office late into the night and on weekends _
meaning harried wives are left to run the household alone.

	   For working women, the demands of Japanese corporate culture
often mean mixing career and family is impossible. A glance around
any Japanese office shows that women with career-track jobs are
almost always single.
	   ``I haven't had time to think seriously about my private life,''
said Sumiyo Shiosaka, 33, of NEC Home Electronics Ltd., who said
she'd like to get married _ but hasn't met the right man at the
right time.
	   As more women enter the work force, families are looking for
someone to watch the kids. With the extended family breaking down,
that more often means day care _ another area getting serious
attention in the birth rate debate.
	   Public child care in Japan for the most part is excellent. At
younger ages, three caretakers and sometimes a full-time nurse tend
to a class of 10 children. The school keeps a detailed diary of
what the children eat, how they play and even their moods.
	   But the system, which cares for nearly 2 million children,
suffers from familiar problems of many government-run programs:
bureaucratic snags and rigidity.
	   For example, thousands of kids are on waiting lists to get into
the system _ even though there are plenty of open spaces. The
government suspects centers might be turning away infants because
they are more difficult to care for than toddlers.
	   The government is trying to expand hours beyond the traditional
6 p.m. closing, cut tuition and offer more flexible services.
Progress so far has been spotty.
	   Despite the cries that something should be done to boost Japan's
fertility, the government is not sure policy can change things
much. Officials often say personal choices like marriage and
childbirth are mostly beyond state control.
	   For some, this is a welcome sign.
	   Masako Yokoyama, president of Arai's company, Max Wald, said she
hopes the changes will lead to greater acceptance of families that
don't follow the ``man at work, women at home with two kids''
model.
	   ``Families with no children, families with only one child,
unmarried couples having children, that's OK, too,'' said Yokoyama,
who raised her 18-year-old daughter with the help of her parents
after she divorced.
	   ``There are increasingly different types of lifestyles,'' she
said. ``And I think it's a good thing.''

Torian shows why he's No. 1 hurdler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Reggie Torian doesn't have the
international titles and achievements that belong to hurdling
rivals Allen Johnson, Colin Jackson and Mark Crear.
	   But he showed Sunday why he could be joining them in 1999.
	   Torian beat all three to become the fastest in the world this
year over 110 meters.
	   He produced the finishing speed in the last 20 meters at the
British Grand Prix meet at Don Valley stadium to leave world and
Olympic champion Johnson, world record holder Jackson and Goodwill
Games titlist Crear struggling.
	   In the case of Johnson, it's the third time Torian's beaten him
this season and the U.S. champion, who ran the year's best 13.03 in
winning the national title at New Orleans June 21, saw his latest
win as a good sign for next year's World Championship.
	   ``It's important to drop in a fast time early in the season and
then keep winning. Especially in a race like this. It had the five
fastest in the world. It wasn't the best race, it wasn't the best
time because it's a tiring part of the season but everyone was
there,'' said Torian, who clocked 13.15 in sunny conditions.
	   ``I want to go into next year's big events as a solid No. 1 so
important to keep winning,' said Torian, who is aiming for more
success at more lucrative Golden League races at Monte Carlo and
Zurich within the next 10 days.
	   Torian said he wasn't hampered by Courtney Hawkins' fall three
hurdles from home, the American winding up on his back as his
rivals headed for the line.
	   ``I didn't really feel him,'' he said. ``It was really Allen and
me hurdle for hurdle and I just stole it at the end.''
	   Johnson came home second in 13.22 with Jackson third in 13.24
and Crear fourth in 13.33.
	   Melissa Morrison was another U.S. winner in a high-quality
women's short hurdles.
	   She powered past Jamaica's Michelle Freeman in the final 15
meters to win in 12.74 with fellow American Angie Vaughn third.
	   ``I felt a bit sluggish at the beginning after a couple of false
starts,'' said Morrison. ``I just didn't feel very relaxed in the
blocks but I want out and gave it all I had and come out
victorious.
	   ``A victory over Angie, who beat me at the Goodwill Games. I
can't really ask for more.''
	   Russia's Olympic 800 and 1,500-meter gold medalist Svetlana
Masterkova failed in a bid to break her world mile record of
4:12.56 when she labored to 4:28.28.
	   Britain's Paula Radcliffe outclassed Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan
to win a women's 3,000 race in 8 minutes 38.84 seconds. O'Sullivan,
the former 5,000 meters world champion, struggled in second in
8:45.35.
	   Olympic 400-meter silver medalist Roger Black made an emotional
farewell when he finished third behind countrymen Mark Richardson
and Iwan Thomas.
	   The 32-year-old veteran, who has also helped Britain win a relay
world title and two silvers, announced his retirement in bitter
circumstances after the selectors chose Solomon Wariso instead for
next month's European Championship.
	   Ironically, Wariso had to pulled out of Sunday's event because a
knee injury he collected in beating Black in a dive to the line at
the British trials. There is speculation that, if Wariso isn't fit
for the Europeans in Budapest, Black may be recalled.

Japanese fathers carve out more time for family
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-FEA-Childless Japan &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAWASAKI, Japan (AP) _ Mikio Tanaka considers himself a
dedicated father _ and proved it by taking off three months to care
for his baby boy.
	   That makes Tanaka something of a revolutionary in Japan, where
men are better known for working long hours and bar-hopping with
clients than mixing baby formula and changing diapers.
	   ``It was tough, but it was also a lot of fun,'' Tanaka said,
sitting on the living room floor as his 22-month-old son, Daiki,
hung on his back. ``I saw the first time he stood up. It was a
great experience.''
	   Tanaka, 31, is one of a growing number of fathers in Japan who
are taking a bigger role inside the home.
	   Men are a common sight with kids at parks and zoos on the
weekends, though often seen stifling yawns. Books and magazines
counsel fathers on how to play with and care for their kids.
	   For Japan's overworked housewives, the change is overdue. A
recent government survey found most dads play with and bathe the
kids, but less than 40 percent change diapers or put children to
bed.
	   In Tanaka's case, his wife, Ayako, 28, was reluctant to take the
full year of maternity leave to which she was entitled as a public
high school teacher.
	   Fortunately for Tanaka, a department chief at his company had
taken paternity leave a few years before, so his proposal to take
three months unpaid leave was not a total shock to his bosses.
	   ``If I asked for a year, maybe they would have said `no','' he
said, adding that even his parents were skeptical, worrying the
move would hurt his career.
	   Ayako took Daiki's first three months off, then it was Tanaka's
turn when she went back to work. Daiki started day care full-time
at 6 months.
	   Tanaka said the feeding and diaper-changing was easy to get used
to, but the isolation from adults was tough.
	   ``I had no one else to talk to. It was a big change from work,''
he said. ``And then my wife would come home from work that she was
really enjoying _ I was jealous.''

Japan's big families face tight quarters, tight budgets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-FEA-Childless Japan &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ There's a slumber party every night in Michiko
Sasaya's living room, always with the same five guests: her husband
and their four children.
	   Such is life for Japan's dwindling number of big families _
which, in a country with a plummeting birth rate, means those with
more than two kids.
	   ``We sleep sort of scattered around the room,'' Sasaya said with
a laugh as her 2-month-old gurgled on her lap and the others _ ages
3, 4 and 6 _ horsed around.
	   While Sasaya, 39, says she wouldn't have it any other way, her
life is a portrait of the obstacles discouraging Japanese couples
from having more children.
	   A major problem is space. Sasaya's apartment is no smaller than
most family dwellings in Tokyo _ it just has a few more occupants.
	   All five sleep in the tatami-mat living room/bedroom. The
adjoining family room is cluttered with a crib, an upright piano,
an electric keyboard and toys galore. The dining room consists of a
small coffee table, with a refrigerator and cabinet separating it
from the kitchen.
	   As in most Japanese homes, child-raising here is women's work.
Sasaya's surgeon husband, Kazuto, often takes only two days off a
month and getting home early means 8 at night.
	   ``I never have time to myself,'' said Sasaya, an ex-nurse.
	   The Sasayas do enjoy some advantages that have made their
expanding family possible. Kazuto, 34, makes a good living as a
surgeon. And his father owns the apartment, so they pay no rent.
	   Able to build up savings, the family is shelling out to buy a
new, and bigger, home. In Tokyo's tight real estate market, that
won't be cheap. Sasaya said the house will run about dlrs 650,000.
	   At a time when young Japanese are growing less interested in
family, Sasaya sees only good in her brood. She was raised with
three siblings and says anything smaller would seem a bit lonely.
	   But a fifth child isn't in the cards.
	   ``I think four is just right,'' she said.

Exit poll: Opposition wins Mexican gubernatorial vote

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECAPS with ruling party saying its own exit polls
show it holding on to Aguascalientes seat &QL;

 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In what would be a crucial victory
ahead of the 2000 presidential elections, the opposition National
Action Party captured the governor's seat in the central state of
Aguascalientes, according to television exit polls.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, however, said its
own polls showed it was hanging on to Aguascalientes by 4
percentage points.
	   The polls by Televisa and Television Azteca also showed the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, as expected, holding
onto governors in the gulf coast state of Veracruz and the
southeastern state of Oaxaca.
	   Official preliminary results were to be released later.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the governing party, known as
the PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to compensate for the loss.
	   According to Televisa's poll, PAN candidate Felipe Gonzalez
Gonzalez captured 50 percent of the vote. The PRI's candidate,
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, had 41 percent and Alfonso Bernal
Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party had 6
percent. It did not give the margin of error in its poll.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes as the small, relatively prosperous state has become
more urban and middle class in recent years.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, said he voted for
the PAN for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Turnout figures among Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters
were not immediately available, but the state electoral council
reported earlier in the day that turnout was strong and there were
no major problems.
	   In Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and the son of
a former president, won with 52 percent of the vote, according to
the Televisa poll. Luis Pazos of the PAN finished a distant second
with 28 percent of the vote.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   If the final results reflect the showing of the exit poll, the
win could make Aleman a top contender for the PRI's presidential
nomination.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But its won two of three elections last
month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, PRI candidate Jose Nelson Murat Casab won with 51
percent of the vote, according to the exit poll. It said the
Democratic Revolution candidate, Hector Sanchez, finished second
with 34 percent.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A car exploded Monday, killing a man
and shattering the windows of nearby shops, officials said.
	   The cause of the explosion is unclear, but a police spokesman
said it was being treated as ``suspicious.'' Arson Squad detectives
were at the scene.
	   Lorensen Avenue near the Merlynston railway station was ``a
picture of devastation'' with shop windows blown out and wreckage
strewn across a wide area, Fire Brigade inspector Frank Besanko
said.
	   The car at the center of the explosion was at the side of the
roadway, its hood and trunk blown open, the victim's body still
inside.
	   An ambulance service spokesman said no other injuries had been
reported.

One-fourth of Sydney suburbs approved to drink tap water
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous, UPDATES with danger zone down to
three-fourths of city &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ One-fourth of Sydney households got the
all-clear to drink tap water by Monday but other residents must
continue boiling it until parasites are flushed from the city's
water system.
	   Some suburbs in Sydney's south and a few in the west had tested
clear of the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium, said New South
Wales Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles.
	   ``Sydney's water supply continues to improve, fresh clean water
is flushing through the Sydney water system,'' he told reporters.
Others may have to wait for days until all the water is safe again.
	   Fear and anger among the city's 3.7 million residents has
continued since the dangerous parasites were found in the water
supply last week.
	   ``Opening the tap and drinking water is something we take for
granted, and what has happened with the water makes me understand
what people in Third World countries go through,'' said Sydney
resident Rick Turansky.
	   Authorities found a number of dead dogs and foxes in canals near
the water plant, but Knowles said it was not clear if they caused
the problem.
	   ``It may be the case that we never find the source of
contamination,'' he said.
	   No illnesses have been reported yet, but the parasites have an
incubation period of a week or more.
	   Giardia can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems. Both are normally spread through fecal matter.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee in 1993,
contributing to the deaths of about 100 people. More than 400,000
others became ill.
	   Despite the government's claims that the water supply is
improving, many said they wouldn't be drinking tap water any time
soon.
	   The Intercontinental Hotel said it closed its pool because of
the water scare.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks fall on worries over slow recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Concern that Japan's economic recovery may be a
long, slow process drove the U.S. dollar higher against the yen
early Monday. Tokyo stocks slipped at the open.
	   The dollar bought 144.80 in early morning trading, up 1.02 yen
from late Friday and also above its late New York rate of 144.65.
It traded as high as 145.09 yen _ its first time above 145 yen
since June 16.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 75.37 points, or 0.46
percent, to 16,303.60. On Friday, it closed up 177.37 points, or
1.09 percent.
	   The dollar gained as Japanese investors continued to sell yen to
shift their savings into dollar-denominated assets.
	   While incoming Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has promised 6
trillion yen (dlrs 42 billion) in income tax cuts and 10 trillion
yen (dlrs 69 billion) in stimulus spending, analysts say a
turnaround in Japan's economy could take time.
	   Those concerns were reinforced Friday when Japan announced
unemployment in June rose to 4.3 percent, its highest since the
jobless rate was first measured in 1953.
	   And signs are appearing that Obuchi face have political
difficulties. Two opinion polls conducted over the weekend show his
public approval to be among the lowest in recent decades for an
incoming Japanese premier.
	   Obuchi is due to finalize his economic plans in a speech before
Parliament later this week.
	   On the stock market, prices fell as declines by the yen were
seen as a vote of no confidence in Obuchi's new government.
	   ``The foreign exchange market is moving quite sharply, and if
this continues it may drag stocks lower,'' said Isao Takahashi,
senior manager of Japanese equity trading at HSBC James Capel
Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section dropped 5.14 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,256.90.
The TOPIX closed up 13.85 points, or 1.11 percent, the day before.
	   Trading was light as investors awaited clearer word on Obuchi's
economic policies.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.230 percent from Friday's finish of 1.250
percent, driving its price up to 111.59 yen from 111.45 yen.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Running water trickles into Nancy
Segura's home only once or twice a month. If it happens to come in
the middle of the night, she must stumble out of bed to fill a
barrel.
	   The social worker often waits two hours in a long line for a bus
in the morning and two hours more in the afternoon. She has been
trying to get a telephone line installed in her apartment for 17
years.
	   Her plight is not unusual in Latin America, where public
services are often a nightmare. Inefficient state-owned telephone,
electricity, water and transportation companies have been
overwhelmed by population growth and years of corruption,
mismanagement and underfunding.
	   As part of free-market reforms sweeping the region, governments
are now trying to modernize the companies by converting them to
private ownership. But that often means drastic rate hikes to pay
for improvements, sometimes even worse service and angry customers.
	   Electricity users recently massed in Caracas' Plaza Bolivar,
Peruvians boycotted the telephone company for a day and residents
of the Dominican Republic clashed with police over almost daily
power outages that last up to 18 hours.
	   Dozens of Dominicans have died in such protests the last two
decades, but the past year has been one of the worst for electric
service. President Leonel Fernandez declared the power shortage his
top priority; even the country's Roman Catholic bishops lashed out
at the poor service.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, Brazilians have created an ``I hate Light''
Internet page to vent their frustrations over the privatized local
electricity company, Light Servicos de Electricidades.
	   Brazilian vigilante groups sometimes intercept repair crews in
the street and threaten them with physical harm if they don't fix
damaged transformers.
	   In Venezuela, protests prompted President Rafael Caldera to
freeze electric rates for all of 1998.
	   Prolonged blackouts often cause families in the Caracas slum
where Nancy Segura lives to lose the food in their refrigerators.
When power surges back, appliances that are still plugged in often
are damaged.
	   Catching the bus is an ordeal. Commuters sprint toward the bus
as it putt-putts down the street, and elbow and shove others aside
to squeeze aboard. By the time the bus departs, people are dangling
out the door.
	   ``You feel like a piece of meat hanging on a hook,'' Segura
says.
	   Running water is contaminated and produces skin rashes,
diarrhea, parasites, vomiting and other problems. Many residents
store water in barrels that become breeding grounds for mosquitos
that carry potentially fatal dengue fever. Others drink water from
streams polluted with sewage, which helps explain cholera's
vehement comeback in Latin America.
	   Phone service in the region isn't much better. In Rio de
Janeiro, it can take 30 to 60 seconds to get a dial tone, and you
often reach a different number from the one you dial.
	   Officials contend privatization has improved service from even
worse levels.
	   Many Venezuelan companies used to employ full-time secretaries
merely to dial the phone all day because it took up to 10 minutes
to get a dial tone and many calls never went through.
	   Today, making calls is easier, and the privatized phone company,
CANTV, has boosted the number of lines installed each year from
50,000 in 1991 to a predicted 290,000 this year.
	   The catch: Venezuela's phone rates are soaring. Basic local
service has gone up nearly 5,300 percent since the government sold
the company to a GTE-led consortium almost seven years ago, says
Congressman Luis Rosendo Hernandez, a member of Congress's public
services commission. That's about 3 1-2 times the inflation rate
over that period.
	   CANTV executives say local rates were laughably low _ 45
bolivars (75 cents) a month.
	   Some privatizations have backfired. Despite the dlrs 2.2 billion
sale of Rio de Janeiro's electricity monopoly two years ago, power
outages are worse than ever. The sale was supposed to bring greater
efficiency, but mismanagement and chaos continue to plague the
company.
	   Still, officials hope private companies in Latin America will do
a better job at collecting payments. Under the state companies,
millions of customers in slums don't pay for services such as
electricity and water, which aren't metered. Many steal electricity
by running wires to utility poles.
	   The Dominican Republic plans to sell half the state electric
company. ``Death to blackouts!'' the president declared as he
inaugurated two small power plants recently.
	   Venezuela's semi-privatized Hidrocapital water company, which
serves Caracas's 5 million residents, says improved service has
reduced street protests against the company from 360 in 1993 to
just seven last year.
	   ``Before we were hated by a lot of people,'' says Norberto
Bausson, the company's vice president. ``Now we are hated by fewer
people.''

Privatized services squeeze Peruvians' pocketbooks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-FEA-Peru-Services Nightmare &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KOOP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Jorge Chico, a retired university
administrator, waited fruitlessly for 15 years for Peru's
inefficient state telephone company to install a telephone line in
his home.
	   After the company was privatized in 1994, he got his telephone
installed within a month of requesting a line.
	   But the privatization has been a mixed blessing. Telephone rates
have soared under the new private monopoly, Telefonica del Peru.
	   ``They are constantly cutting off the line for lack of
payment,'' said his son, William Chico, a magazine editor. ``The
same is happening to most of my relatives. Ordinary Peruvians can't
pay.''
	   Peru's public services have improved dramatically since the
privatization of its telephone, electricity and bus systems under
President Alberto Fujimori's free-market reforms.
	   Millions of families that never had access to electricity or
telephones now do. Since its purchase by Spain's Telefonica de
Espana, the telephone company has expanded the number of telephone
lines in Peru from 500,000 to 2.5 million. Peru has 25 million
inhabitants.
	   But the new owners have also tripled the cost of a local call
and added other charges, economist Jorge Manco said.
	   ``These privatized companies have been able to do what they want
since they have monopolies, and the consumer, especially the poor
consumer, is suffering because of it,'' he said.
	   Angry users organized a one-day telephone strike to protest the
high rates this spring, calling on Peruvians to not use their
phones that day.
	   Electric rates also have soared since the privatization of the
state power distributors. And the installation of cheaper,
aboveground power lines has been linked to at least six cases of
electrocution in slums.
	   Protests have erupted in several shantytowns demanding
underground cables.
	   There have been unexpected problems, too.
	   Commuters used to spend hours waiting for jam-packed, ancient
buses to wheeze by to take them to their jobs in Lima. But once on
board they traveled quickly on empty streets.
	   In the early 1990s, Fujimori opened up transportation to
competition and allowed the unrestricted importation of buses and
transport vans. A flood of vehicles filled the streets, bringing
cutthroat _ and sometimes dangerous _ competition among bus drivers
jockeying to pick up riders first.
	   Today, commuters wait only minutes for a bus to come along. But
it often takes them hours to reach their destinations because of
the traffic jams created by the glut of buses.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's struggling No. 2
automaker, may stop producing and marketing 200SX subcompact coupes
at its Tennessee plant in 1999, a company spokeswoman said Monday.
	   Tokyo-based Nissan is considering the move as part of efforts to
restructure its debt-ridden North American operations, said Nissan
spokeswoman Ritsuko Harimoto.
	   The two-door cars are the first models affected by Nissan's
group-wide restructuring program, announced in May, that calls for
a 30 percent reduction in the car maker's 50-model lineup, Harimoto
said.
	   Local production of the 200SX _ known as the Lucino in Japan _
started in April 1995 at the company's plant in Smyrna, Tennessee.
The model was among Nissan's top products in the U.S. market,
selling 42,000 units in 1995, Harimoto said.
	   But sales fell to 7,700 cars in the first six months of 1998 in
the United States, partly due to the overall popularity of
sports-utility vehicles there, the company said.
	   Harimoto said Nissan has decided to produce a new recreational
vehicle model in the United States next year, but she added details
on the new product could not yet be disclosed.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper said the new RV model will be based
on Nissan's subcompact pickup truck Datsun, which is already being
produced in the United States.
	   Also, production of Sentra sedans, now being manufactured at the
Tennessee plant, will be moved to Nissan's factory in Mexico by the
year 2000, Harimoto said.
	   The Tennessee plant also makes Nissan's Altima and Frontier
pickups.
	   Nissan reported a deficit of about 80 million yen (dlrs 551
million) in its North American operations last year because of
sluggish U.S. sales.

	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Jack Cassell remembers when the
Cubans he ran with along the beach suddenly started toting
submachine guns _ the year before President Reagan sent U.S. troops
to invade Grenada.
	   ``It was very scary to be an American in Grenada then,'' said
Cassell, 44, now a neurologist living near Orlando in Eustis,
Florida.
	   He was back in Grenada, on vacation with his wife and son, when
Fidel Castro arrived Sunday on his first visit to the island where
Cuban and U.S. troops had their only confrontation during the Cold
War.
	   Forty-five Grenadians, 29 armed Cuban construction workers and
18 Americans were killed in three days of fighting around Point
Salines Airport, where Castro landed 15 years later.
	   Ending a triumphant tour that began in Jamaica and Barbados _
other islands that once shunned him _ Castro said he wanted to
avoid recriminations.
	   ``On a day like this I would rather pay my respects to all who
perished in that conflict,'' he said after unveiling a plaque
commemorating Cuba's help in building the airport which U.S.
strategists feared would give Cuban fighter planes the range to
penetrate deep into South America.
	   After the invasion, U.S. troops completed the airport. When
Reagan visited Grenada in 1986, he, too, received a hero's welcome,
and he prayed at a sculpture outside the airport honoring the U.S.
dead.
	   Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, a former foe of
Castro's, hugged the Cuban leader Sunday and said his country's
show of gratitude was ``better late than never.''
	   On his tour, the Cuban leader has attacked what he termed a
``new economic oppression'' affecting Caribbean nations.
	   He says 100,000 jobs were lost, mainly from garment factories
that moved to Mexico because it is part of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, and that small-island economies are endangered by
a successful U.S. challenge at the World Trade Organization to the
preferential tariffs Caribbean bananas receive in Europe.
	   Cassell was a student at the St. George's University School of
Medicine when Bishop assumed power and until his graduation in
1982. He said tension was building even a year before the 1983
invasion.
	   ``People who were selling us black coral one day were waving
AK-47s in our faces the next day. My nice (Cuban) friends who used
to be running on the beach by the airport construction were
suddenly toting AKs.''
	   Cassell said he thought Grenada's failed revolution was
necessary to get rid of the corrupt government of Gairy, who died
several years ago. But he said Bishop installed an overtly hostile
government.
	   Today Grenada is democratic. Castro's Cold War sponsor, the
Soviet Union, is gone. His Cuba, clinging to Marxism, still suffers
a 38-year-old U.S. embargo.
	   Still, Mitchell noted, it is Cuba and not wealthier countries
like the United States that freely educates poor Grenadians and
other Caribbean students to be doctors and engineers.
	   He said Caribbean leaders still hope Washington will make good
on promises for more aid that President Clinton made at the first
U.S.-Caribbean summit in Barbados last year.
	   Meanwhile, Caribbean nations that want Washington to stop
isolating Cuba no longer fear U.S. ire. They say that with the Cold
War over, Cuba no longer is a threat.

Suspended Nigerian heads rooting section

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nigerian center Julius Nwosu, who was
given a two-month suspension by FIBA after testing positive for
ephedrine in the opening game last week against Spain, was jumping
and shouting in Nigeria's noisy rooting section in Sunday's 89-65
victory over South Korea.
	   Nwosu stood on his feet for the entire game orchestrating cheers
and directing Nigeria's non-stop brass band and the 100 fans who
surrouned it
	   Nwosu, who said he took a vitamin supplement without knowing it
contained ephedrine, will have to sit out all international and
club games until his ban ends.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GETTING TECHNICAL: Getting slapped with a techinal foul in the
last minutes of a close game can be disasterous in the NBA. The
shooting team not only gets two free throws but the ball in its own
offensive zone.
	   Not so in international play. Under FIBA rules, a technical is
played just like a regular shooting foul. The team that fouls gets
the ball after the foul shots.
	   That means if your team is losing and time in running out, there
are 12 players who can pick up technicals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CANADIAN WOES: Canada fell to 1-3 with it 95-55 loss Sunday in
the second round to unbeated Yugoslavia _ the tournament favorites.
Now they have almost no chance of reaching the quarerfinals.
	   ``They (Yugoslavia) shot 62 percent form the field and 55
percent from 3-point range,'' said coach Steve Konchalski. ``We
couldn't top Yugoslavia. When we got the ball inside, they seemed
to block every shot.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SKY HOOKS: The game has changed, and so have the players.
	   That's the assessment on the state of the NBA delivered by
career scoring leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, in town during the
tournament to make sponsorship appearances.
	   The master of the sky hook, who won six NBA titles during his
20-year career with the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers, is
convinced his mark of 38,387 points will stand for some time.
	   ``The man who will break my career scoring record is probably
now 10 years old,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Since Michael Jordan is
going to retire and the young players make so much money that I
don't expect them to play for 20 years, I don't see any of today's
players breaking the record.''
	   The importance of the inside game has diminished, he said.
	   ``Since I left basketball, there have been big changes in the
game. The emphasis now is more in the perimeter than in the paint,
especially with the 3-pointers,'' Abdul-Jabbar said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   POSTING ODDS: Lenny Wilkens knows a thing or two about scouting
teams.
	   After watching some action at the tournament, the NBA's all-time
leader in coaching wins touted Yugoslavia, Lithuania _ which upset
the United States in preliminary-round play last week _ and Greece
as the medal favorites.
	   But Wilkens, who coached Dream Team III to the Olympic title two
years ago in Atlanta, added that he thinks the U.S. team's early
loss could wind up working in its favor, providing motivation.
	   While in Athens, the Atlanta Hawks coach participated in a
coaching clinic for Greeks. Lakers coach Del Harris (here as an
assistant to U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich) and Chicago Bulls
strength coach Al Vermeil joined Wilkens at the camp.

Singapore's foreign maids struggle, save and long for home

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In this rich, sleek city-state, tens of
thousands of imported housemaids toil up to 90 hours a week and
lead severely restricted lives, all to grab a tiny piece of the
island's prosperity.
	   Every day at 7:30 a.m., Cristina has porridge and coffee in the
kitchen, waiting for her employers, a family of three, to get up.
The rest of the day she takes care of the toddler, cleans and
cooks. She goes to bed at midnight.
	   The 29-year-old gets a half-day off on Sundays, when she goes to
church and meets with other maids. But she doesn't complain about
her work because it brings her 350 Singapore dollars (nearly dlrs
220) a month, far more than she could earn in her native
Philippines.
	   ``They don't kick me around, and I can eat whenever I'm
hungry,'' she says with a shrug.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Asian women try to escape financial
hardship by working as maids abroad. Governments encourage the
practice, which brings in foreign currency because maids send most
of their earnings to families back home in the Philippines,
Myanmar, Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
	   Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime Sin of the Philippines, whose
country is perhaps best known for exporting maids, once called the
millions of Filipina women working far from home ``heroes'' for
providing for their families.
	   Yet, those heroines must put up with daily indignities, ranging
from walking a few steps behind their employers to virtual bans on
the use of swimming pools at fancy apartment complexes.
	   Once in Singapore, a maid cannot leave easily.
	   Dozens of agencies serve as intermediaries between prospective
maids and interested employers, often advertising their latest
scouting in Indonesia or the Philippines as ``the best of the
crop.''
	   A maid is responsible for an agent's fee of about 1,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 588), which she pays in monthly
installments from her salary. Agents hold maids' return plane
tickets, and in some cases their passports.
	   Agencies often advertise maids as ``shorthaired,'' ``fair'' (as
opposed to dark-skinned) and ``obedient.''
	   ``Look at her, she's so tiny,'' an agent recently praised a maid
to a prospective employer during a meeting witnessed by a reporter.
``You don't have to worry that she'll eat a lot.''
	   Many maids feel they have little choice but accept their fate,
considering poverty and unemployment at home.
	   ``Work is hard, but if you are careful, you can save some
money,'' says Rita, 34, who came to Singapore in 1993, leaving
behind a husband and two children in the Philippines.
	   When her current two-year contract with a Singaporean family
expires, Rita hopes she can afford to return home for good.
	   Like the other maids interviewed for this story, Rita asked that
her last name not be revealed for fear of offending her employer.
	   The maids' lot is in stark contrast to that of the chic
Singaporean women who make up more than 40 percent of the island's
work force, in large part because they can leave their homes and
children in the care of foreigners.
	   A maid must promise not to get pregnant or marry a citizen while
working in Singapore; if they do, the government will deport them.
They are regularly screened for pregnancy as well as for venereal
and other diseases.
	   But a maid's working hours and living conditions are not
regulated. As a result, maids often work double shifts and some
have to accept a mat on the kitchen floor as their bed.
	   Authorities are trying to wean Singapore, a nation of 3.1
million people, from relying so much on maid labor.
	   Yet, the convenience of having an inexpensive, live-in servant
is so strong that the number of maids in Singapore has doubled over
the last several years to about 100,000.
	   Physical and sexual abuse of maids by their employers also has
sharply increased, legislators say. In April, Parliament passed
legislation to increase penalties for employers who abuse their
maids.
	   In a rare display of public criticism, several members of
Parliament urged Singaporeans to try to see maids as lonely,
overworked human beings.
	   That's hardly the case now, since some Singaporeans view their
maids almost as slaves, said the home affairs minister, Wong Kan
Seng. He painted a nearly Dickensian picture, saying most maids in
Singapore are illiterate and come from rural areas.
	   They are ``isolated from society nearly all the time, dependent
on their employer for food and housing,'' Wong said. ``This makes
them more vulnerable than other workers.''
	   Some Singaporeans readily admit they want it that way.
	   Phyllis Tan, a beauty salon manager, employs two maids from
neighboring Indonesia, one for taking care of the house, the other
for gardening and car washing.
	   Her credo: ``Never give your maid a day off. Pay them extra,
take them out for a meal, but a day off, never.''
	   The reason, Tan says, is that on their days off ``maids
congregate with other maids. Then they will get ideas, get arrogant
and talk back.''

British tourists &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ August vacationers fleeing summer's
scorching heat jammed the country's highways over the weekend,
forming bumper-to-bumper caravans of up to 50 kilometers (30 miles)
long.
	   The national highway department reported 36 people had been
killed in traffic accidents between 3 p.m. Friday and 8 p.m.
Sunday. Another 49 were injured, 29 critically.
	   The worst collision happened about 5 p.m. (1900GMT) Sunday near
the southeast seaside town of Oliva in the Valencia region, some
350 kilometers (220 miles) southeast of the capital, Madrid. Police
said five British tourists _ two men and three women ranging in age
from 18 to 25 _ died when their rental car collided with a truck.
	   Anticipating massive traffic jams on the first weekend of the
traditional vacation period, more than 8,000 Civil Guards and
highway department personnel, supported by 16 helicopters, mounted
a ``First of August Operation'' to watch over the country's
highways from Friday afternoon through Sunday midnight.
	   Spanish workers get 30 days' vacation a year. Many factories and
stores shut down in August, the hottest month, when temperatures in
Madrid often reach 40 degrees (104 Fahrenheit). On the first
weekend of the month, millions head for the mountains or the
beaches.
	   The worst traffic jam came Saturday morning for Madrid residents
headed southeast to the Valencia beaches. The drive normally takes
about three hours, but on Saturday it was six, due in part to a
50-kilometer (30-mile) stretch of stop-and-go traffic just outside
the capital.
	   Officials reported another bottleneck of 16 kilometers (10
miles) in Cuenca province, also on the way to Valencia, on
Saturday.
	   They said traffic flowed more smoothly on Sunday, the major
exception being the accident near Oliva, which closed national
highway 332 for two hours while firemen pried open the wreckage to
remove the bodies of the British tourists.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Roger Clemens, still pitching for Toronto
after a flurry of trade rumors, struck out a season-high 14 and won
his ninth straight decision Sunday as the Blue Jays beat the
Minnesota Twins 6-4.
	   Clemens (14-6), who has not lost in 12 starts since May 29,
pitched eight innings and allowed six hits and one earned run. He
tied David Cone of the New York Yankees for the AL's longest
winning streak this year _ San Diego's Kevin Brown currently has
won 10 in a row.
	   Clemens fanned at least one batter in every inning and reached
double digits in strikeouts for the 87th time in his career.
	   There was speculation Friday that Clemens might get sent to the
Yankees, Cleveland or Houston in a deal before the midnight trading
deadline. Instead, the Blue Jays held onto their ace.
	   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, who turns 36 on Tuesday,
started fast, striking out four of the first five batters. Randy
Myers got one out for his 28th save.
	   Shawn Green, who went 4-for-5 and scored three times, tied it in
the fourth when he hit his 20th home run, connecting off Brad Radke
(10-9).
 &UR; Orioles 9, Royals 2
	   In Kansas City, Eric Davis' two-run double stretched his hitting
streak to 20 games and helped the Baltimore Orioles beat the Kansas
City Royals and avoid a three-game sweep.
	   Jeffrey Hammonds homered, had two doubles and drove in two runs.
Rafael Palmeiro also had two doubles and two RBIs as every
Baltimore starter hit safely.
	   Rookie Sidney Ponson (5-6) won his fourth straight decision.
Glendon Rusch (6-14) lost his fifth in a row.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Devil Rays 2
	   In St Petersburg, Florida, Bobby Higginson hit a three-run homer
and Brian Powell pitched seven strong innings as the Detroit Tigers
defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Higginson's opposite-field drive to left-center in the fifth
inning was his 20th homer of the season. He has hit at least 20
homers in three consecutive seasons.
	   Powell (2-2) gave up two runs and four hits and Todd Jones
pitched the ninth for his 19th save. Bryan Rekar (1-3) took the
loss.
 &UR; Athletics 7, Indians 5 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Matt Stairs hit his fourth home run in
as many games as the Oakland Athletics rallied to win their fourth
straight.
	   Stairs' 19th homer of the season came in Oakland's five-run
seventh inning, which they entered trailing 5-2. The A's swept the
three-game series, their first sweep of three or more games at the
Coliseum since 1996.
	   Mike Mohler (3-2) got the victory with an inning of relief, and
Bill Taylor pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.

Compass trouble causes Northwest jet to make unscheduled landing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Northwest Airlines jet bound for Honolulu from
the central Japan city of Nagoya was forced to make an unscheduled
landing because of compass problems, an airport spokesman said
Monday.
	   The DC-10, carrying 159 passengers and crew, landed without
difficulty Sunday night at Tokyo's international airport in Narita,
an airport spokesman said, on condition of anonymity.
	   Officials at Narita cleared the plane to land after the pilot
reported that the compass was ``odd,'' the spokesman said.
	   The plane arrived at 11:35 p.m. (1435 GMT), about one hour after
taking off from Nagoya, 300 kilometers (190 miles) to the
southwest.
	   Because of the late hour, passengers spent the night at nearby
hotels before catching other flights to Honolulu on Monday morning,
he said.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Here he goes again: American
adventurer Steve Fossett is getting set for his fourth attempt to
circle the world in a balloon, one of the last unachieved feats of
aviation.
	   The 54-year-old Chicago stockbroker will probably leave Thursday
from Mendoza, launching his Solo Spirit balloon from a soccer field
in the foothills of the Andes.
	   Solo Spirit meteorologist Bob Rice had originally reported
promising conditions for a Monday departure. But during a news
conference Sunday in St. Louis, where the team operations center is
located, he said increasingly poor weather conditions would likely
push back Fossett's launch.
	   ``We don't expect a good wind pattern for at least three or four
days,'' Rice said. ``We'll have nothing to work with until probably
Thursday. That's the way it works with weather.''
	   A wealthy adventurer, Fossett has swum the English Channel,
climbed some of the world's highest mountains and competed in the
Ironman Triathlon. Though success in his balloon quest has been
elusive, failure is not on his radar.
	   ``You have to believe that you are going to succeed with this
flight because a water landing would be very dangerous,'' Fossett
told The Associated Press. ``I'm using the same capsule I've used
for seven balloon flights, and it's seaworthy.''
	   Most of Fossett's charted course will take him over southern
oceans.
	   Two balloonists from Kansas had planned to travel a southern
route in 1988, also starting in Mendoza, 600 miles (950 kms) west
of Buenos Aires. But bad weather kept them on the ground. John
Petrehn and Rowland Smith eventually aborted their round-the-world
plans after dlrs 100,000 worth of helium leaked from a balloon
while it was being inflated.
	   Competition is intense to achieve RTW _ ballooning parlance for
a flight ``Round the World.''
	   ``If I do not succeed on this flight, there will be seven
competitors in the Northern Hemisphere in December and January,''
Fossett said.
	   ``The Southern Hemisphere is the right place to do an
around-the-world flight. It's far too complicated in the Northern
Hemisphere with all those countries to cross, each with a military
and political concern.''
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms. A year later, he set
the distance record: a 10,361-mile (16,673 kms), six-day journey
from St. Louis to Sultanpar, India. He landed after running short
of fuel while awaiting Libyan clearance.
	   On Jan. 5, 1998, Fossett landed 5,802 miles (9.337 kms) away
from St. Louis, in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern Russia.
	   In his latest attempt, Fossett plans to head east from Argentina
over the South Atlantic and brush just below the tip of South
Africa _ a west-to-east route that harnesses favorable winds in the
Southern Hemisphere winter.
	   Fossett would attempt to fly over Australia and New Zealand
before a long leg eastward across the Pacific into South America.
Circling the globe on that route could take 18 days and cover
20,000 miles (32,185 kms).
	   Solo Spirit, shaped like a giant silver light bulb half a
football field high, has both helium and hot air chambers. The
4-foot-by-6 1/2-foot (1.3 by 2-meter) capsule has a bench to sleep
on, advanced communications gear, a life raft and enough food to
await sea rescue, if need be.
	   Temperatures outside will plunge below freezing as the balloon
and its unpressurized capsule are carried along anywhere from a
crawl to more than 100 mph (160 kph), often at altitudes above
20,000 feet (6,100 meters).
	   Equipped with an oxygen mask, Fossett will be lucky to sleep
four hours each night, awakened by alarms whenever Solo Spirit
loses altitude.
	   Fossett began his life of adventure as a mountain-climbing
11-year-old. He since has competed in auto, bicycle and sled dog
races. In 1996, Fossett set a speed record for solo sailing across
the Pacific: 20 days and 9 hours from Yokohama, Japan, to San
Francisco.
	   ``If I am successful at this balloon flight it will be my
opportunity to communicate the spirit of adventure to many people
... to take on challenges,'' he said. ``They don't have to be grand
adventures on the scale of my balloon fights, but there are many
interesting things to do.''

Agassi wins 11th straight match, fourth title of year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andre Agassi, blunting Tim Henman's 130
mph-plus serves with whipsaw returns, rolled through the Brit 6-4,
6-4 Sunday to win the Mercedes Cup, his 11th consecutive match
victory without dropping a set.
	   Agassi needed just one hour, 20 minutes to win his fourth
tournament of the year and second in as many weeks. He'll rise two
spots to No. 11 in Monday's ATP Tour rankings.
	   ``It's been a long road,'' said Agassi, who lost in the first
round here last year when he failed to win any titles and plunged
to a career-low 141st ranking. ``I've climbed 130 spots this year
and 11 more to go. I feel like I'm better than my ranking.''
	   Agassi's victory streak includes one Davis Cup match. He hasn't
lost since the second round at Wimbledon, where he and Henman were
practice partners. They had never faced each other in a match until
Sunday.
	   ``It wasn't quite high quality tennis,'' said Agassi, who
collected dlrs 45,000. ``He didn't play his best and I know I
didn't. We were both feeling each other out early. Once I got the
lead, I hit out a few more of my shots. I responded to some of his
big shots well.''
	   Agassi dropped serve just once against Henman, netting a
backhand in the sixth game of the second set for a 3-3 tie.
	   But Henman double-faulted in the next game _ the second straight
service game he lost on a double fault _ to fall behind 3-4. Agassi
won the match serving a love game with a backhand passing shot down
the line.
	   ``I don't think I played my best tennis,'' said Henman, whose
semifinal finish at Wimbledon made him a hero in Britain. ``To beat
someone like Andre, you've got to play to the high level of your
game.''
	   Henman had eight aces, but negated them with seven double
faults. Although he connected on 77 percent of his first serves,
Agassi often blasted returns to the corners or passed Henman at the
net.
	   ``I had him in trouble a couple of times and he came up with
some big serves,'' Agassi said. ``He was having to serve a high
percentage of first serves with the way I was returning.''
	   Agassi earned the only service break of the first set in the
third game. Facing break point, Henman missed his first serve. Just
before his second, a cell phone shattered the silence and Henman
backed off in distraction.
	   He forced deuce with a backhand winner, but then sent a forehand
wide and netted an overhead smash to lose the game.
	   ``It's not the first time it happened,'' Henman said of the
chirping phones. ``It's not ideal, but it's going to happen
wherever you play.''
	   Agassi hasn't faced a single set point during his 11-match
streak. He was even hotter earlier this year, winning 13
consecutive matches until losing to promising American Jan-Michael
Gambill at Indian Wells in March.
	   ``It's like letting something ride on the blackjack table,'' the
Las Vegas native said. ``If you let it ride, it gets bigger
quicker.''

Australia's BHP to get new chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's BHP steel, mining, and
energy company said Monday that Jerry Ellis will retire as chairman
and as a director in the first half of 1999, making way for Don
Argus.
	   Argus is currently chief executive officer and managing director
of Australia's largest bank, National Australia Bank Ltd. NAB last
week said Argus would leave his position towards the end of the
first half of 1999.
	   Institutional and small shareholders have actively sought Ellis'
removal over the past few months. The chairman has presided over a
period of prolonged share price under performance and declining
profits, culminating in a U.S. dlrs 911 million (1.47 billion
Australian dollars) loss for the fiscal year ended May 31.
	   BHP, or Broken Hill Proprietary Co., is currently without a
chief executive officer after John Prescott resigned in March after
receiving much the same criticism from large investors that has now
forced out Ellis.

Japan's Prince Akishino departs for 10-day China visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prince Akishino, the younger son of Japan's Emperor
Akihito, departed Monday for a private visit to China as part of a
research group to study birds in southwestern Yunnan Province.
	   The prince and his wife, Princess Kiko, left Tokyo's
international airport in Narita on board an All Nippon Airways
Boeing 747, an airport official said.
	   The 10-day trip will be the second to China by Japanese royals
since the end of World War II, following an official visit by
Akihito and Empress Michiko in 1992, the Imperial Household Agency
said.
	   Akishino will join a 12-member research team led by Yoichi
Shoda, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, the agency
said.
	   The royal couple will study the relationship between man and
fowl in villages in Yunnan and their research will focus on
everyday life in towns as well as local legends, Kyodo News
reported.
	   During their stay, the couple will also tour a museum and a
company that researches birds and go to Beijing to visit the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, the agency said.

<TEXT>
	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In what would be a crucial victory
ahead of the 2000 presidential elections, the opposition National
Action Party captured the governor's seat in the central state of
Aguascalientes, according to television exit polls.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, however, said its
own polls showed it was hanging on to Aguascalientes by 4
percentage points.
	   The polls by Televisa and Television Azteca also showed the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, as expected, holding
onto governors in the gulf coast state of Veracruz and the
southeastern state of Oaxaca.
	   Official preliminary results were to be released later.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the governing party, known as
the PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to compensate for the loss.
	   According to Televisa's poll, PAN candidate Felipe Gonzalez
Gonzalez captured 50 percent of the vote. The PRI's candidate,
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, had 41 percent and Alfonso Bernal
Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party had 6
percent. It did not give the margin of error in its poll.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes as the small, relatively prosperous state has become
more urban and middle class in recent years.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, said he voted for
the PAN for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Turnout figures among Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters
were not immediately available, but the state electoral council
reported earlier in the day that turnout was strong and there were
no major problems.
	   In Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and the son of
a former president, won with 52 percent of the vote, according to
the Televisa poll. Luis Pazos of the PAN finished a distant second
with 28 percent of the vote.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   If the final results reflect the showing of the exit poll, the
win could make Aleman a top contender for the PRI's presidential
nomination.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But its won two of three elections last
month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, PRI candidate Jose Nelson Murat Casab won with 51
percent of the vote, according to the exit poll. It said the
Democratic Revolution candidate, Hector Sanchez, finished second
with 34 percent.
	   However, an electoral dispute appeared to be shaping up in
Oaxaca, where both the PRI and Democratic Revolution insisted that
their own polls showed each of them ahead.
	   Another exit poll, conducted by the Arturo Rosenbluth
Foundation, had results very different from Televisa's.
	   It said its survey showed Democratic Revolution winning the
Oaxaca governorship with 38.1 percent of the vote, following by the
PRI with 36.9 percent and National Action with 17.8 percent.
	   The foundation said in a written statement that the exit poll
was conducted at 137 of 3,685 polling places in Oaxaca and that it
had a margin of error of 0.064 percent.
	   Representatives of several political parties complained to
electoral authorities that foundation workers conducting the survey
had entered polling booths and in some cases appeared to be trying
to influence the way people voted.
	   Foundation spokesman Daniel Ponce denied the accusations and
said that functionaries at some polling places had refused to let
his organization conduct the survey.

South African gets consolation prize for record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Penny Heyns of South Africa got a
consolation payoff for her world record.
	   Heyns set a world record in the 50-meter breaststroke Saturday
night. Because it is not an official event, organizers said she
would not earn the dlrs 50,000 offered to anyone setting a world
record at the Goodwill Games.
	   Heyns complained, and on Sunday, officials said Heyns should get
dlrs 10,000 instead.
	   FINA, the world governing body for swimming, decided this year
to credit swimmers with world records for the first 50 meters of
100-meter events in breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly.
Fifty-meter races are only contested in freestyle.
	   Because the 50 breaststroke is not an event in itself, Heyns
will not earn the dlrs 50,000, a ruling that Heyns disputed after
the race, saying, ``there was no fine print.''
	   Heyns was timed in 30.95 seconds on the first lap of the 100
breaststroke event. She earned the Goodwill gold medal with a time
of 1 minute, 8.14 seconds.

Chinese gymnast says DiCaprio `wants me to be strong'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a Goodwill
Games accident says a hospital visit from actor Leonardo DiCaprio
has given her a boost.
	   Sang Lan, the 17-year-old who broke her neck in a practice vault
July 21, said in an interview with WTBS Sunday that DiCaprio had
given her his autograph and a movie poster from ``Titanic,'' and
had his picture taken with her.
	   ``He said some encouraging words to me and expressed his concern
and wants me to be strong,'' Sang Lan said in her first interview
since the accident.
	   Sang had mentioned after the fall that she would like to meet
DiCaprio, and the star of ``Titanic'' spent about an hour with her
last Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.
	   WTBS, an Atlanta-based superstation, is part of Turner
Broadcasting, which runs the Goodwill Games. The interview was
conducted by Goodwill Games studio host Jim Lampley at Mount Sinai,
where Sang was moved last week to begin rehabilitation.
	   Television pictures showed her from the shoulders up, her head
in a heavy brace. She spoke through an interpreter and appeared to
be smiling.
	   Doctors have said she probably will never walk again.
	   Sang said her rehabilitation was ``difficult, but I think it
will get better.''
	   ``I'm doing upper extremities and then later they are going to
teach me how to eat and then I can help myself,'' she said, adding
that the strength she gained as an athlete ``helps me a lot.''
	   She also thanked the thousands of people who had sent cards,
letters and presents.
	   ``I'm really happy that so many people supported me and I want
to thank all the people who care about me and support me,'' she
said.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks decline on worries over slow recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Concern that Japan's economic recovery may be a
long, slow process drove the U.S. dollar higher against the yen
Monday morning. Tokyo stocks fell in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 144.69 yen at midday, up 0.91 yen from late
Friday and also above its late New York rate of 144.65. It moved as
high as 145.09 yen Monday morning _ its first time above 145 yen
since June 16.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 157.24 points, or 0.96
percent, to 16,221.73 at the end of the morning session. On Friday,
it closed up 177.37 points, or 1.09 percent.
	   Currency traders said the dollar later weakened from its morning
highs on profit-taking, as Japanese exporters and other investors
sold dollars.
	   ``Players are feeling that the dollar reached its goal for the
day,'' said Minoru Kobayashi, manager of foreign exchange at Asahi
Life Insurance.
	   Some traders showed caution toward aggressively pushing the yen
lower after China on Friday again voiced warnings over the Japanese
currency's weakness.
	   While Japan's new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has promised 6
trillion yen (dlrs 42 billion) in income tax cuts and 10 trillion
yen (dlrs 69 billion) in stimulus spending, analysts say a
turnaround in Japan's economy could take time.
	   Those concerns were reinforced Friday when Japan announced
unemployment in June rose to 4.3 percent, its highest since the
government began taking such statistics in 1953.
	   And signs are also appearing that Obuchi faces political
difficulties. Two opinion polls conducted over the weekend show his
public approval ratings to be among the lowest in recent decades
for an incoming Japanese premier.
	   Obuchi is due to finalize his economic plans in a speech before
Parliament later this week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices were dampened by the
weakening of the yen against the dollar. Bank issues were among
early losers.
	   Trading remained light as many investors avoided making
significant moves as they wait and see how the new Obuchi
administration will take action in propping up the faltering
economy.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section dropped 11.41 points, or 0.90 percent, to 1,250.63.
The TOPIX closed up 13.85 points, or 1.11 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.230 percent from Friday's finish of 1.250
percent, driving its price up to 111.59 yen from 111.45 yen.

Thieves stealing Bangkok manhole covers for scrap metal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thieves have made off with more than
100 manhole covers from the streets of Bangkok during the past six
months, selling them for scrap metal, local papers reported Monday.
	   The Metropolitan Electric Authority has organized a team of 50
volunteers to try and catch the thieves, The Nation newspaper
reported.
	   The solid steel manhole covers weigh about 180 kilograms (400
pounds) and cost 150,000 baht (dlrs 3,650) each, but thieves sell
them for about 500 baht (dlrs 12) to scrap metal dealers, an MEA
spokesman said.
	   He added that the thieves were endangering motorists because the
open manholes were big enough for a car wheel to fall into.

	   In Seattle, the Mariners, emerging from the hangover after the
trade of Randy Johnson, got strong pitching from Paul Spoljaric and
four relievers to beat the New York Yankees.
	   The Yankees, who have baseball's best record, lost for the 28th
time in 105 games. The Mariners ended a six-game losing streak
against New York.
	   Jay Buhner gave Seattle's bullpen some breathing room in the
seventh when he hit a two-run homer off David Cone (15-4). Buhner
had three RBIs.
	   Spoljaric, replacing Johnson in the starting rotation after
Johnson's trade on Friday night to the Houston Astros for three

eight strong innings for his 13th victory as the Rangers beat the
Chicago White Sox.
	   Zeile, acquired from the Florida Marlins on Friday, connected
during a four-run fourth and went 2-for-2 with three walks. He
homered and went 3-for-4 in Saturday's 8-1 win over the White Sox.
	   Sele (13-8) allowed six of the first nine batters he faced to
reach base, but retired nine of 10 during one stretch from the

<TEXT>
	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In what would be a crucial victory
ahead of the 2000 presidential elections, the opposition National
Action Party captured the governor's seat in the central state of
Aguascalientes, according to television exit polls.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, however, said its
own polls showed it was hanging on to Aguascalientes by 4
percentage points.
	   The polls by Televisa and Television Azteca also showed the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, as expected, holding
onto governorships in the gulf coast state of Veracruz and the
southeastern state of Oaxaca.
	   Official preliminary results were to be released later.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the governing party, known as
the PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to compensate for the loss.
	   According to Televisa's poll, PAN candidate Felipe Gonzalez
Gonzalez captured 50 percent of the vote. The PRI's candidate,
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, had 41 percent and Alfonso Bernal
Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party had 6
percent. It did not give the margin of error in its poll.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes as the small, relatively prosperous state has become
more urban and middle class in recent years.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, said he voted for
the PAN for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Turnout figures among Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters
were not immediately available, but the state electoral council
reported earlier in the day that turnout was strong and there were
no major problems.
	   In Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and the son of
a former president, said his victory was assured Sunday night after
the Televisa poll showed him winning with 52 percent of the vote.
	   Aleman promised to create ``a social alliance'' as Vercruz's new
governor during a local television interview broadcast live into
State Electoral Council headquarters as perplexed electoral
officials looked on.
	   By the time Aleman had declared his victory, the first official
numbers had not even be released.
	   Shortly after, electoral officials released the first official
numbers: with 200 of 7,046 of the polling places counted, the PRI
candidate was ahead with 53 percent, followed by Luis Pazos of
National Action with 28 percent. The Democratic Revolution
candidate trailed with 14 percent.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   If the final results reflect the showing of the exit poll, the
win could make Aleman a top contender for the PRI's presidential
nomination.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But its won two of three elections last
month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, a tighter-than-expected race _ and a possible
electoral dispute _ was shaping up.
	   The first official results, issued by Oaxaca's State Electoral
Council, showed PRI candidate Jose Nelson Murat Casab was ahead,
but with Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez trailing by
6 percentage points.
	   With the votes from 8.37 percent of polling places counted,
Murat Casab was leading with 42.77 percent of the vote, followed by
Sanchez with 36.81 percent. The National Action candidate had 17.98
percent.
	   Both the PRI and Democratic Revolution insisted that their own
polls showed each of them ahead.
	   An exit poll conducted by the Arturo Rosenbluth Foundation said
its survey showed Democratic Revolution winning the Oaxaca
governorship with 38.1 percent of the vote, followed by the PRI
with 36.9 percent and National Action with 17.8 percent.
	   The foundation said in a written statement that the exit poll
was conducted at 137 of 3,685 polling places in Oaxaca and that it
had a margin of error of 0.064 percent.
	   Representatives of several political parties complained to
electoral authorities that foundation workers conducting the survey
had entered polling booths and in some cases appeared to be trying
to influence the way people voted.
	   Foundation spokesman Daniel Ponce denied the accusations.

Market dives before earnings and growth reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The battered Hong Kong stock market took a
nosedive early Monday because of bad news from abroad and
expectations of even more gloom at home.
	   The key Hang Seng index was down 319 points, or about 4 percent,
in early trading to 7,616. The loss followed drops of 3.89 percent
last week and more than 4 percent the previous week.
	   Traders blamed a sharp fall Friday on Wall Street, the weakness
of the Japanese yen resulting from uncertainties about the new
government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, and concerns about the
domestic economy.
	   Giant HSBC Holdings and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank were to
announce their midyear earnings after the market closed Monday, and
their shares fell sharply in anticipation of poor performance.
	   Also later Monday, the government was to announce revised
economic growth figures.
	   The government already has revealed preliminary data that the
economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter of 1998, and has
indicated that it expects a further contraction in the second
quarter.
	   Hong Kong withstood much of Asia's financial turmoil in the
first months after it began last summer, but now has been dragged
down into recession as well. Besides the negative growth,
unemployment is at a 15-year high. The economy is being slowed
further by cargo problems at the new Chek Lap Kok airport.
	   Analysts said final figures may show the gross domestic product
shrank by 3 percent in the first quarter. If it is much worse than
that, they predicted that markets may tumble again on Tuesday.
	   ``Investors are selling on the yen's weakness, and the Dow'
fall,'' said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon Securities.
	   The dollar hit a seven-week high of 145 yen early Monday in
Asia. The Dow fell 143.66 points on Friday.
	   The Hang Seng index is nearing its low for the year, 7,462.5,
which it reached in mid-June.

Death toll from floods rises to 42; at least 65 still missing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fresh rains turned mountain streams
into raging torrents Monday, hampering the search for 65 people
known missing in floods in South Korea. Forty-two bodies already
have been recovered.
	   Buffeted by a sudden rain shower, a rescue helicopter crashed in
a rice paddy Monday, injuring five people. The national news
agency, Yonhap, reported all five were in serious condition.
	   The helicopter went down near scenic Mt. Chiri National Park,
where all but eight of the dead and missing were lost or stranded
by floods triggered by heavy rains Saturday.
	   Some 7,000 policemen and soldiers, aided by helicopters, cranes
and other heavy machinery, cleared landslides to reach deeper into
the park, where dozens of college students and other campers were
still believed to be stranded.
	   Officials expected the number of deaths to rise as more of the
missing were accounted for.
	   A rain front moving east from China dumped up to 30 centimeters
(12 inches) of rain in less than three hours early Saturday,
engulfing hundreds of sleeping campers in flash floods in the park
220 kilometers (135 miles) south of Seoul.
	   Police said whole families camping along normally placid streams
were swept away. Some bodies were found washed up on coastal
beaches 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, raising fears that many of
the missing will never be found.
	   ``We are expanding our search further downstream, but our
operations are slow because of occasional heavy rains. Upstream,
it's almost impossible to venture into those wild streams,'' said
Kwon Ki-hwan, an official at the Home Ministry's Disaster Relief
Headquarters.
	   On Monday, police searching downstream pulled up a car, in which
two children were found dead.
	   TV footage showed family members searching hospitals to look for
missing relatives.
	   Also Monday, President Kim Dae-jung ordered the Cabinet to
revamp the nation's disaster warning system. Saturday's rains had
not been forecast by the National Weather Service.
	   The downpours submerged homes and farmland, washed away roads
and triggered landslides. As communications with remote areas were
restored, property damage estimates climbed to dlrs 53 million
Monday.

Dispute between Malaysia, Singapore turns bitter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A row between Malaysia and
Singapore over the shift of a joint customs and immigration post
got uglier Monday with more Malaysian officials joining in a tirade
against its neighbor to the south.
	   Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat accused Singapore's media of
launching a ``hate campaign'' while Education Minister Najib Abdul
Razak described Singapore as ``arrogant,'' newspapers reported
Monday.
	   Singapore relocated its railroad immigration facility on
Saturday, despite Malaysia's refusal to go along. Train services
are running smoothly between the two countries, but Malaysian
officials complain it takes longer because passengers now have to
get off twice for immigration checks.
	   ``Why did they find a time such as now, when the country is
facing an economic slowdown and other problems?'' Malaysian
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik was quoted as asking in the Star.
	   Information Minister Mohamed held out the threat of Malaysia
turning off its water supply to Singapore. About half of the water
consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from its Southeast Asian
neighbor.
	   ``Malaysians are still able to control their emotions, but I
won't be surprised if they come to a point where they cannot take
it anymore and want the government to stop supplying water to
Singapore,'' he said.
	   ``Singapore must act as a gentleman would in resolving this
problem or the republic would be held responsible for any
deterioration in relations between the two countries,'' said
Education Minister Najib.
	   Malaysia's main opposition leader Monday urged restraint.
	   ``Singapore and Malaysian ministers and leaders should observe a
moratorium and stop mutual bashing,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the
opposition leader in Parliament.
	   Relations between the two countries have swung from diplomatic
tolerance to hostility in recent weeks.
	   In 1963, Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia, an experiment
that failed two years later after wrangling between Singapore
senior minister Lee Kwan Yew and the late Malaysian Prime Minister
Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Singapore still remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner
and an important gateway into Malaysia.
	   More than 200,000 Malaysians cross over to Singapore each day to
work. Twenty-seven trains run daily between the two countries for
passenger, freight and a golf shuttle service.

Major Japanese semiconductor maker to cut capital spending by 16
</HEADLINE>
percent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sluggish sales have forced Japanese semiconductor
maker NEC Corp. to cut capital spending on chip production by 16.6
percent to 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.03 billion) this year, the
company said Monday.
	   The Tokyo-based NEC will also postpone its scheduled start-of a
new domestic chip-manufacturing plant by one year to early 2000, a
company spokesman said.
	   The NEC spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
company will also shelve plans to rationalize its chip-production
lines at domestic plants for the fiscal year, which will end March
31, 1999.
	   NEC, Japan's top semiconductor maker, originally planned a total
of 180 billion yen (dlrs 1.24 billion) in capital spending on chip
production.
	   NEC, which has been the only major semiconductor maker enjoying
strong earnings to date, expects revenues to fall in the current
fiscal year partly due to a larger-than-expected fall in memory
chip prices, the spokesman said.
	   The spokesman said NEC plans to raise output of 64-megabit chips
from the current monthly figure of nearly 8 million to about 10
million by December. NEC had originally planned to boost monthly
production to 15 million chips by mid-1999.
	   But the company said it will sharply slash production of
16-megabit memory chips from 6 million per month to 2 million in
December.
