<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Military Vessels Collide in Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A Greek coastguard vessel and a
Turkish patrol boat collided in eastern Aegean today, but no
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the two vessels
had collided while in Greek territorial waters without any serious
damage to either boats being caused.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 09:30 local time this morning in the
sea area one nautical mile south of Imia Islet.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the incident, according to Reppas, who
added that after the collision the Turkish vessel headed for the
Turkish coast and the Greek boat continued its patrol in the area.
</P>
<P>
Repaas said the incident took place when the Greek vessel
spotted the Turkish craft entering Greek territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman underlined that Athens would make all the
necessary diplomatic representations to Ankara, since there had
been a violation of national territory.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO member states, have been at odds
over disputes in the Aegean and the division of Cyprus. The two
countries nearly came to war in January following the mutual
claims on the small Aegean islet of Imia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Stability Vital for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- While shouting in an impassioned tone
in their campaign for the coming June 12 general elections,
Bangladeshi politicians might have not overlooked the fact that
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is limping due to
prolonged political conflicts between rival parties.
</P>
<P>
In its recent statement on global economic prospects, the World
Bank noted that Bangladesh is the lone South Asian country where
GDP growth had slowed down to 4 to 5 percent during the current
fiscal year beginning last July 1.
</P>
<P>
All economic sectors like agriculture, industry, business and
trade and investment failed to achieve the expected growth,
sources recognized, adding that in such a situation the rate of
GDP growth may slide to 4 percent from the 6 percent target set by
the 1995-1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
The following figures also reflect the grim picture: the
country's revenue collection was tk 19 billion (475 million US
dollars) lower than the target of tk 68.9 billion (1.22 billion
dollars) in the first 8 months of the current fiscal year while
foreign exchange reserve has now come down to 2.2 billion dollars
from 3.5 billion dollars at the beginning of the fiscal year. The
rate of inflation has increased to 9 percent from 4 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Political unrest has been blamed as the main reason for the
economic failure.
</P>
<P>
During the past 2 years, the former Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) government and the opposition led by the Awami
(people's) League (AL) have been locked in disputes over the
formation of a neutral caretaker government to supervise general
elections, causing one strike or strike-like agitation program
after another.
</P>
<P>
Because of the unrest, all economic activities have been
severely affected with colossal losses of at least tk 70 billion
(1.75 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Industry and foreign trade were the most hit sectors. Although
growth in industrial sector was estimated to be 11.5 percent, its
condition is more deplorable as production dropped, investment was
frustrating and credit disbursement reduced to tk 5 billion (about
125 million dollars) in the first 5 months against the whole-year
target of tk 35 billion (875 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The export target of 1995-1996, estimated at slightly above 4
billion dollars, will not be achieved as the pillar economic
sector of garment failed to ship the goods during its peak period
of January-March when the government-opposition confrontation was
also in a decisive stage. Most of the letters of credit have been
canceled by the buyers.
</P>
<P>
Of course, natural calamities have also caused the stagnation
of the growth process. As floods, drought, cyclones and tornado
have frequently occurred, a deficit of about 3.5 to 5 million tons
is estimated to be in food production this year while the rate of
growth in agriculture sector was fixed at 4 percent with food
production targeted at 20.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most reform programs were either slowly pursued or
abandoned because the measures hit the vested interests in civil
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
There are some other reasons for the negative growth in the
economy, but the macro-economic stability is vital to make the
national economy gain inherent strength to withstand any
situation.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts here noted that the economic strategy of the
country needs to be recast for the stabilization of growth process
through implementation of adjustment programs as the structural
weakness of the economy now is so acute that even a slight
abnormal situation creates major imbalance.
</P>
<P>
For that, the future recovery of the economy lies in
establishing a stable government, the experts said, hoping
politicians contesting for parliamentary seats not to allow
themselves to be swayed by personal feelings and to pay more
attention to the country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts in U.S. Jump Quickly in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in U.S. Surged by
5.9 percent in April to the highest level in two years despite the
rising mortgage rates, the U.S. Commerce Department reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.52 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, the highest since a 1.53 million rate in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the largest since a 7.9 percent surge in last
November.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised the March's housing starts to a 5.2
percent drop and the rate was down to 1.44 million from the
originally estimated 1.45 million.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters in U.S. had expected a 1.4 percent decline in
April, believing the housing industry had reached a plateau
because of the recent increase in mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages now are above 8 percent, up
sharply from 6.94 percent in the middle of February.
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts say that for every 1 percentage point increase in
rates, 250,000 to 300,000 families are priced out of the market.
</P>
<P>
An early May membership survey by the National Association of
Home Builders of the country resulted in a boost in its Housing
Market Index to the highest level since February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, applications for building permits, often a barometer
for future activity, jumped 3.3 percent in April to a 1.46 million
annual rate, highest since 1.48 million last December.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, housing starts in April rose by 4.8 percent in the
South and 1.5 percent in the West as well as 1.2 percent in the
Midwest. But those in the Northeast were down by 1.4 percent.

<P>
ATHENS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece today rejected Ankara's
protests over a planned sea cruise by a number of reporters to the
islands of the eastern Aegean including the Imia islets.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Costas Bikas said there was
nothing out of the ordinary about the cruise which, he added, was
being organized in consultation with the press and media ministry.
</P>
<P>
Greece plans to take journalists from European Union countries
on a warship to the area of the Imia islets on Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey on Wednesday lodged a protest with Athens' ambassador in
Ankara over the cruise plan and Turkish Assistant Foreign Minister
Inal Batu called the cruise "a serious provocation", maintaining
that "a visit by foreign journalists under the protection of
warships will change the status quo in the region".
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas responded to Turkish
protest by saying that he did not think that "Greece is without
the right to host foreign guests and citizens of the European
Union within its national territory."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey narrowly escaped a military conflict over the
disputed islet of Imia in January with the last-minute
intervention by the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Rajko
Kasagic today rejected his removal from office by Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic whom he called an "illegal president".
</P>
<P>
Kasagic told a press conference in Banja Luka, the largest Serb
city in northwestern Bosnia, that he would remain in office until
a new government was elected, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"My government can function from Banja Luka," he said, and
added: "I will defend Banja Luka from Pale," the Serb stronghold
where Karadzic is based.
</P>
<P>
"He is driving us towards a deadly fate and an isolationist
state," Kasagic said.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic sacked the premier on grounds that Kasagic's
cooperation with international mediators overseeing the
implementation of the Dayton peace accords had "endangered the
interests of the Serb people and nation."
</P>
<P>
International mediators have refused to deal with Karadzic who
has been indicted as a war criminal by the international war
crimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic is regarded as a moderate Serb politician who has said
he is willing to cooperate with the Muslim-Croat federation, the
other entity in Bosnia. Karadzic, who heads a hardline faction
working against the Dayton agreement, has refused to do so.

LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Minister of Foreign
Affairs Tom Ikimi said yesterday that his country welcomes a
proposal by Portugal for a Europe-Africa summit, tentatively
scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Portuguese ambassador to Nigeria, Filipe
Orlando de Albuquerqu Lorena, Ikimi said Nigeria "will do
everything to ensure the success" of the summit, because dialogue
is the best way to resolve conflicts and misunderstanding among
nations.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was referring to the misunderstanding between Nigeria
and the European Union, of which Portugal is a member, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the envoy that as a founding member of the
Organization of African Unity, Nigeria plays a very important
role in the organization, as well as the Economic Community of
West African States.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese envoy was in the Nigerian capital of Abuja to
brief the minister of his country's proposal for the summit. He
did not disclose the exact aim of the summit but said reaction to
the proposal had been very favorable.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Portuguese foreign minister planned to attend
the July OAU summit in Cameroon to brief members of the
organization on the proposed summit.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Serie A club Lazio defeated
China's national team 2-1 in the opener of a three-match China
tour of soccer friendlies here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Lazio opened scoring through
Marpo Piovanelli, who headed the ball pass Chinese goalkeeper Ou
Chuliang after a goalmouth melee at the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, Guerino Gottardi made it 2-0 for Lazio when
he slammed in a low angle ball from outside the right side of the
box before about 70,000 Chinese spectators in a full-capacity
Workers' Stadium.
</P>

The Chinese eleven stepped up offence but had to wait to almost
half a minute before the final whistle for a face-saving goal,
which was scored by Hao Haidong on a Xie Feng pass from the right
wing.

<P>
Three Lazio players received yellow cards from referee Lu Jun
following clashes with Chinese defenders, with Massimiliano
Esposito and Giuseppe Favalli in the first half and Roberto

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Expands Demining Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia has removed mines from
27,000 hectares of land in the past two and a half years, saving
55,700 people from being disabled, the Cambodian Mine Action
Center (CMAC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Mine clearance operations starting November 1993 have destroyed
55,700 anti-personnel mines, 375 anti-tank mines and 362,245 other
explosive devices, said CMAC Director Sam Sotha.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at an inauguration ceremony for a demining unit
in Kompong Thom, one of Cambodia's most heavily-mined provinces
where demining work has been delayed by poor roads and the
security situation.
</P>
<P>
There are estimated to be 8 to 10 million mines in Cambodia, and
every month around 300 people are killed or maimed by
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
The CMAC is now seeking to expand its demining operation which
was established by the United Nations' Transitional Authority in
Cambodia in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sam Sotha listed four priorities of demining: to clear land
for the resettlement of refugees and displaced people; to clear
land for farming; to clear land in or near towns or public
buildings such as schools, hospitals and water wells, and
clearance of land for the development of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The demining operation in Kompong Thom is supported by funds
from the European Community which has donated 2.5 million
U.S. dollars for demining since late 1995, said CMAC Chairman Ieng
Mouly.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Pupils Urged to Combat Vandalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 16 (xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
today appealed to pupils in schools to combat vandalism because
the government can't afford continuous replacement of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an opening ceremony of a youth training center in
Kafue, 50 kilometers south of here, Chiluba said, "I want to
encourage each and every pupil of whatever grade to combat the
vice of vandalism. Those desks and chairs we are buying or
repairing must be guarded jealously."
</P>
<P>
A lot of schools which were found damaged almost beyond repair
have now been rehabilitated and work on many more has continued,
he said.
</P>
<P>
This exercise is expensive, but the government believed that
it is worth the cost because education is the cornerstone to the
national development, Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged those schools with production units to
contribute to repairing desks and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
The president said the process of providing desks to all
schools is a long-term program. In the past four years, many
children have been equipped with desks, moving from the cold
floors, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Vandalism is rampant in Zambian schools, resulting in the
acute shortage of desks in primary and secondary ones.

CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
here today with Jacques Andreatti, personal envoy of French
President Jacques Chirac, who briefed him on France's views and
intentions vis-a-vis the forthcoming Group of Seven summit.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, the French envoy told reporters that he
was commissioned by Chirac to brief Mubarak on the agenda of the
G-7 summit to be held in Lyon next month under the presidency of
France, and to acquaint himself with the Egyptian president's
views on a number of international economic problems, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is the first time France, as a country
chairing the G-7 summit, takes an initiative such as dispatching
envoys to countries outside the G-7 to get acquainted with their
viewpoints before the convening of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
France believes that the big industrialized nations should take
into consideration the views of other countries toward economic
problems, the French envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt and Saudi Arabia are among the countries
whose viewpoints will be considered.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether France would submit to the summit a report
voicing views of countries outside the group on international
economic issues, he said that the current initiative made by
France is purely a French one and that it does not concern the
other G-7 member states.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether he discussed with Mubarak a
wider French role in the Middle East peace process, the envoy said
that the issue was not tackled at today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Principles in Sino-US Joint Communiques Should Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
stressed that the principles enshrined in the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques should be strictly abided by in order to make
relations between the two countries grow normally and stably.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning the development of
Sino-U.S. relations in an interview with Egyptian and Chinese
journalists here, the visiting Chinese head of state said the
issues concerning Sino-U.S. relations, particularly the
U.S. attitude toward the Taiwan issue, should be properly handled
on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that to maintain the healthy and stable relations
between China and the U.S. not only is in the interests of both
countries but also will be conducive to peace and stability in the
world.
</P>
<P>
While progresses have been made in bilateral relations between
China and the U.S. in the recent years, he went on, difficulties
and problems still exist. He described the Sino-U.S. relations as
still being marked with rises and falls and troubles, adding that
this runs counter to the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to make joint efforts with the U.S. side to
increase trust, reduce troubles, expand cooperation, and avoid
confrontation so as to ensure that the bilateral relations will
grow stably and healthily," the Chinese head of state said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent visit to China by Russia President Boris Yeltsin
and the agreements signed by China and Russia, Jiang said that
China and Russia have anchored the basic principles and direction
of development in Sino-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's visit and the China-Russia Joint Declaration proved
that the relations between the two neighboring countries have
reached a new level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the strategic partnership between China
and Russia is a new type of state-to-state relations and is in
keeping with the post-Cold War international situation and the
development of international relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is now on a five-day state visit
to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Says World Community Rejects Sacking of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The international community does
not recognize "illegal acts" of the Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
and will "continue cooperation with Serb Premier Rajko Kasagic,"
the international High Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt said
today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Kasagic in Serb city Banja Luka, Bildt said
in a statement that the international community will continue to
work with Kasagic's government to help fully implement the Dayton
peace agreement for the benefit of the Serb people and the entire
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Serb President Karadzic sacked Kasagic on Wednesday in order to
"protect constitutional order... and prevent any further worsening
of the crisis in the government's work."
</P>
<P>
But Kasagic today rejected the dismissal and renounced Karadzic
as an illegal president who is driving the Serb people to the
ruins.
</P>
<P>
The statement said both Bildt and Kasagic were resolved to
fight against isolationist forces that were a threat not only to
the implementation of the peace accords, but also to peace and
prosperity in the republika srpska.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the future lay in cooperation rather
than confrontation," the statement quoted them as saying.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Partial Lifting of UK Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President Jacques
Chiriac said today that the French government backs the European
Union (EU) Commission recommendation for lifting a ban on some
British beef by-products exports in an effort to calm the BSE or
mad cow disease crisis across the EU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after his talks with
British Prime Minister John Major at the Downing Street, Chirac
said that France would support the EU Commission proposal of
allowing Britain to export gelatine, tallow and semen.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the EU standing veterinary committee is
convening a special session today in Brussels to discuss the EU
proposal, which is expected to face intense opposition from
Germany and other EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The French President stressed that "It is now up to Europe to
express solidarity when solidarity is needed and I hope that
strong solidarity" will be expressed at today's EU conference.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived here for a four-day state visit to Britain,
made it clear that lifting the total global ban on British beef
products exports would have to be achieved step by step, but
easing the ban on some British beef by-products would be an
important move "in the right direction".
</P>
<P>
France was the first the European country to impose a
unilateral ban on British beef products in early March when the
British government announced a possible link between the BSE and
its human equivalent, Creuzfeldt-Jacob disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Major expressed his gratitude
for President Chirac's support of a partial ban, saying that
France would play a "leading role" in ensuring the other EU member
states that the ban should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On the possible outcome of the EU veterinary conference, Major
said that he "see no scientific reasons for the ban not to be
lifted and no "proper justifications" that Britain's EU partners
would not agree to ease the seven-week-old ban.
</P>
<P>
The British Prime Minister also made it clear that if the EU
veterinary committee rejected the EU ban-lifting proposal, the
British government would take immediate appropriate action upon
the decision.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission imposed the global ban on British beef
products exports on March 27 in a bid to calm the public fears
over the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders also exchanges views on a
series of bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
On the EU Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), Major said that
there are a large number of areas where the two countries share
communal interests and both sides have agreed to make great
efforts so as to reach "a joint position" at the IGC.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Re-register Non-state Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Non-state enterprises in Vietnam will
be re-registered and certain relevant legal documents be revised,
in the government's efforts to rein in the country's fraud-ridden
private business sector.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's 26,654 non-state enterprises, valued at 1 billion
U.S. dollars in total capital, are mostly centered on services,
often traditional professions, which can quickly recover the
capital invested, the English "Vietnam News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As a big-time tax-payer, they paid 376.2 million dollars to the
state coffer in taxes in 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that the business activities of many
non-state enterprises have shown evidence of fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
According to local economic police, in Hanoi alone there are
150 illegal enterprises as well as more than 300 fraudulent
private companies which had registered false addresses for the
purpose of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
To add to the confusion, a large majority of private companies
used receipts different from the form stipulated by the Ministry
of Finance.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the non-state sector in several provinces
and municipalities found that 20-30 percent of private enterprises
had changed their addresses without informing the authorities and
10 percent were registered but remained inoperative.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Does Not Object to Diplomats' Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz stressed here today that his country does not object to
diplomats' involvement in the proposed cease-fire monitoring
committee in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office, Boueiz said Lebanon
does not object that members of delegations to the monitoring
committee, which is to be set up under a cease-fire understanding
reached between Lebanon and Israel on April 26, include diplomats
on the ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz emphasized that the Lebanese delegation would not
include any ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the five member states of the monitoring
committee, namely the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and
Syria, are to hold their fourth meeting in Washington later today
to discuss the formation of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting was held in Washington last Friday. In the
previous meetings, they reportedly reached agreement on two
points in principle: the headquarters of the monitoring committee
would be at the Lebanese coastal town of Naqura on the border
with Israel, and each delegation should be headed by a military
officer.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz noted that the United States and France insisted that
ambassadors should be included in every delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Probably they want the ambassadors to be political assistants
or advisors for this committee," the Lebanese foreign minister
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have a problem (on this issue)," said the minister,
adding that the military officers possibly have political
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz described the April understanding, which ended the
16-day Israeli military strikes on south Lebanon, as a
"transitional stage."
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the security committee, or the cease-fire
monitoring committee "should not encroach upon the essence of
resolution 425 and the mechanism of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council resolution 425 calls for unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have insisted that the monitoring committee
should be distanced from political affairs and its function should
be limited to the security aspect.

MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine official today pointed
out that an unofficial report about a plant site choice of US car
giant General Motors Corp. (GM) was merely a "psychological war."
</P>
<P>
A recent Asian Wall Street Journal report quoted an auto
industry source as saying that "the GM is expected to choose
Thailand over the Philippines as the site for its major
vehicle-assembly plant in Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
Board of Investments (BOI) Governor Ofelia Bulaong dismissed
the report as a "psychological war," and said, "I don't believe
it."
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Melito Salazar, also a BOI
managing head, said today that he has "no comment" on the paper's
unofficial report
</P>
<P>
The GM spokesman himself had said there is no decision yet, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Asian Wall Street Journal also quoted a GM
spokesman as saying that the GM hasn't made a decision yet on
where it will build its one billion US dollar car manufacturing
facility -- Thailand or the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The GM is expected to make a final decision within the next two
weeks, the Asian Wall Street Journal reported, quoting
unidentified sources.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Introduce Sliding Rouble Rate from July 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has decided
to replace the fixed exchange rate corridor with a sliding rate
for the rouble that will be linked to inflation, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, the rouble would fluctuate between 5,000 and
5,600 to the U.S. dollar, compared with the current limits of
4,550 and 5,510, the news agency quoted a presidential decree
issued today as saying.
</P>
<P>
It added that the fluctuation limits will be fixed at a range
of 5,500 to 6,100 rubles to the dollar from the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The rouble's fixed corridor was established last July to
stabilize the currency and curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to lower the value of the rouble against the
dollar was made after a meeting between President Boris Yeltsin,
First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Kadannikov, Central Bank
chief Sergei Dubinin and presidential economic aide Alexander
Livshits this morning.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin told a news conference after the meeting that as of
Friday the bank will quote the rouble exchange rate every day on
the basis of transactions on both the interbank and the hard
currency markets.
</P>
<P>
The rouble closed at 4,970 per dollar today at the Moscow
Interbank Currency Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The sliding rate, which will be slightly behind inflation and
will thus continue to curb price growth, would make the Russian
market more predictable, a local financial newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Film Video of Violence Banned in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The release of the video of the film
"Natural Born Killers", which is filled with violence, has been
suspended indefinitely in Britain, according to a BBC TV report
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Distributors Warner Home Video was quoted as saying that the
video would not be released until British film censors had
re-evaluated it.
</P>
<P>
The company said the recent mass killings in Dunblane Primary
School, Scotland, and in Tasmania, India, made the video
"inappropriate".
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, more than 200 British members of parliament in a
petition urged the government to ban the film.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major told the house of Commons that he
shared with concern of millions of British people who were worried
about the level of screen violence in feature films and even more
damagingly in videos, which will be more readily available to
young people.
</P>
<P>
Major said although he had not seen the above-mentioned film,
everything he had heard about it suggested that it was
distasteful.
</P>
<P>
He asked the film censors to consider it with great care and
act on it.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Services Being Improved In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Telephone services demand in
Tanzania is expected to be met by 70 percent from the present 37
percent, when the donor-funded telecommunications restructuring
program (TRP) is completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Communications and Transport Minister William Kusila said
today that there are 118,000 waiting applications, against the
capacity of about 130,000 lines of which 90,270 are in operation
now.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, in his message issued for the
World Telecommunications Day to be marked worldwide tomorrow,
that the TRP project which was started in 1994, is also expected
to improve the poor quality of telephone infrastructure in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said statistics had it that the overall teledensity in the
country was 0.35 DELS per 100 people which ranks among the lowest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
As part of the restructuring program, the government had also
allowed the private sector to invest in the provision of value
added services and so far three firms had installed telephone
services in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the capacity of switches during the past 16 years grew
by 166 percent while the demand for the services rose by 876
percent in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Syria Rules Out Assad-Peres Meeting for Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Information Minister
Mohammad Salman today ruled out the prospect of a meeting between
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres for the present.
</P>
<P>
At a reception held on the occasion of the commencement of
overseas transmission by the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA)
through satellite, Salman made the remarks when asked to comment on
reports that Peres would be meeting with President Assad.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, this is no new talk," Salman said. "Such talk is
neither accurate, nor correct, because meetings of heads of state
do not materialize until solutions have been reached."
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Israel is still avoiding the adoption of
any essential measure in the peace process, Salman noted.
</P>
<P>
With regard to a resumption of negotiations on the
Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks following the Israeli
elections, the Syrian official said that "we in Syria uphold the
conviction that peace is a strategic target, and we shall never
abandon it."
</P>
<P>
"We want a just and comprehensive peace which fulfills a complete
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the Turkish-Israeli security
agreement would further aggravate the situation in the region
rather than ease it.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the recent statements made by U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher on Syria's stance towards the peace
process, adding that such talk would encourage Israel to maintain
its rejectionist attitude.

<HEADLINE> Last Month's Jerusalem Bomber Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli police, after five
weeks of investigations, revealed today that the person who was
critically injured in an explosion in east Jerusalem last month
had been identified as Hussein Muhamad Mikdad from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mikdad, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem from the village of Farun in
south Lebanon, seriously wounded himself when a bomb he was
preparing prematurely exploded in the Lawrence Hotel in eastern
Jerusalem on April 12.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the explosion, Mikdad, also a member of
Hezbollah (Party of God), was carrying forged British
identification, in the name of Andrew Jonathan Charles Newman,
according to a Jerusalem police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Mikdad was associated with Sheikh
Fadlallah, a Hezbollah activist, and before leaving for Israel he
spent time in the Iranian Embassy in Beirut, capital of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Israel on April 4, on a Swissair flight from
Zurich, and after spending several days in Tel Aviv he moved to
Jerusalem and booked in at the Lawrence Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations have determined that the type of
explosive which blew up in his room at the hotel was RDX,
weighing less than one kilogram.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, RDX is more powerful than TNT explosives
and more difficult to detect, and less than one kilogram of RDX
is enough to blow up a plane.
</P>
<P>
A Sony multi-band clock radio, modified for concealment and
serving as a bomb timer, was found in Mikdad's belongings in the
hotel, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Police sources indicated that Mikdad planned to board a flight
of Israel's EL Al airline and then blow up the plane.
</P>
<P>
Mikdad, losing both his legs, an arm and both eyes in the
blast, remains in serious condition and has been heavily guarded
in a Jerusalem hospital, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to security sources, in the wake of the
investigations security procedures at ports and airports have
been intensified throughout Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah, in a statement issued today in Beirut,
has denied any connection with the injured Mikdad.

<HEADLINE> Experts Assure No Direct Link Between BSE and V-CJD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Veterinary and medical experts
assured Thursday here the lack of direct link between the "mad cow
disease" and a fatal human brain disorder V-CJD, while stressing
the need for further research efforts to identify any possible
relationship.
</P>
<P>
"There is no direct evidence suggesting a direct link between
the animal and human diseases", Dr. Joe Gibbes of the United
States told a press conference after a 3-day scientific meeting on
the issue concluded in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
This was the identical conclusion reached at the meeting
sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and attended by
experts from around the world, which agreed with an earlier
judgement at a similar meeting in last April.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Dr. Gibbes also said that he considered
the European Union (EU) ban introduced in last March on British
beef exports was not justified by the scientific data so far
available.
</P>
<P>
The EU ban followed British government's announcement of a
suspected link between Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE),
namely "mad cow disease", and 10 cases of new
Variant-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (V-CJD) in Britain, which has
since caused widespread panic across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Experts Thursday confirmed that they considered the 11 V-CJD
cases in Britain and one in France so far reported as sporadic,
the causes of which remain unknown, and that they found no common
cause so far to link them with each other.
</P>
<P>
In fact, one expert said, these cases differed clinically with
typical CJD cases.
</P>
<P>
The V-CJD cases, only found since 1994, has been suspected as
the human equivalent of BSE that is contracted from eating
infected beef. In Britain, over 160,000 BSE cases have been
reported since the cow epidemic was first identified in 1986.
</P>
<P>
According to one expert, British beef were as safe as could be,
given the implementation of safety measures earlier recommended by
WHO and the British government to ensure the removal of animal
parts capable of causing infection from food chains.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting agreed to the need to develop rapid and
efficient ways to diagnose BSE case in early stage. According to
one expert, evidence showed that BSE-infected protein could be
identified a month before clinical case is developed.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed that research efforts should be enhanced to
better understand the animal Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy (TSE), the disease occurring in cattle -- BSE, and
the new V-CJD.
</P>
<P>
They proposed to establish global surveillance in a unified
fashion under the WHO leadership and coordination for more
knowledge about the BSE and CJD situation worldwide and for study
of BSE cases, all variants of CJD and any potential link between
BSE and V-CJD.

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia will continue to strongly
support the application of a policy of principles to the Cyprus
problem, which stands for an independent, territorially integral
and sovereign republic without foreign troops on its soil.
</P>
<P>
This was stated today in Moscow by Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgenii Primakov during a 40-minute meeting with leader of the
Cypriot left-wing opposition Akel party Demetris Christofias,
according to an Akel party announcement here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Russian minister underlined the need
that the Cyprus problem remains within the framework of the U.N.,
especially that of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.N. chief to try harder to make possible a
meeting between the two community leaders for promoting a just and
viable solution to the Cyprus problem based on relevant
U.N. resolutions and the high level agreements reached between the
two sides in 1977 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed the view that a special committee
monitoring the Cyprus problem should be set up by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated Russia's proposal for convening an
international conference on the international aspects of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Primakov sent a letter recently to U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali stressing the need for U.N. action on the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides has described
the Russian move as "a positive contribution" to efforts
towards a solution to the Cyprus problem, which has remained
unsolved for the past 22 years.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 16 (Xinhua)-- Eighteen opposition parties in
Zambia today appealed to the ruling party to attend the on-off
inter-party meeting to iron out differences between them over
important national issues.
</P>
<P>
At the liaison meeting of the opposition parties here,
President of Liberal Democratic Front (LDF) Rodger Chongwe urged
the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and President
Frederick Chiluba to attend the round table talks to avoid social
disorder in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chongwe, on behalf of the opposition parties, apologized to
President Chiluba for their refusal to let him chair the
inter-party meeting and for not standing up when he entered the
conference hall as etiquette demanded during the abortive meeting
recently.
</P>
<P>
The MMD delegation led by President Chiluba walked out of the
meeting over the procedural issue of chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chongwe stressed the opposition has demanded that
the government should withdraw the constitution amendment bill
from parliament and has instead insisted to hold this year's
presidential and parliamentary elections under the 1991
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The constitution amendment bill (the draft constitution),
which has been passed second reading at parliament contains some
controversial clauses including the requirement of second
generation zambians for qualifying presidential candidates.

MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros
Ghali, who is on an official visit in Moscow, held several
meetings with Russian leaders to discuss "Russia's interaction with

</P>
<P>
During their almost two-hour meeting in the Kremlin, Ghali and

<HEADLINE> Serbia Against Dismissal of Kasagic from Premier Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government stated
today that the sacking of the legally elected Bosnian Serb Premier
was against Serb interest and "totally unacceptable and illegal."
</P>
<P>
"The Serbian government considers this decision as yet another
in a series of those which are directly aimed against the
interests of Republika Srpska and its citizens, and which
compromise the development of democratic processes and results
being realized in the economic recovery of Republika Srpska," a
government statement said.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who was indicted as
war criminal by the international war crimes tribunal, sacked his
premier Rajko Kasagic on Wednesday because Kasagic's policy and
cooperation with international community had "endangered the
interests of the Serb people and the nation." But Kasagic
announced today he rejected the decision by Karadzic and would
continue staying in the office until a new government is elected.
</P>
<P>
International community has rejected to deal with Karadzic
since the Dayton agreement was reached last November and regarded
Kasagic as a moderate Serb politician who can be contacted with.
Kasagic has said he was willing to cooperate with Muslim-Croat
federation, the other entity in Bosnia while the Serb hardliners
refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government pointed out that "the decision on
Kasagic's ousting was not preceded by a parliamentary procedure,
when the people's deputies in the assembly give their vote on
confidence in the prime minister," the statement issued by the
Information Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the Serbian government considers this decision
invalid and insist that the Serb Parliament hold a session so that
the interests of Republika Srpka and its citizens are finally
protected from such arbitrary actions," it said.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who is believed to have
strong influence on the Serbs in Bosnia, disussed the current
situation in Bosnia today in Belgrade with visiting German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.
Both Kinkel and Solana have stated that the sacking of Kasagic was
illegal and null.

<HEADLINE> Recall of Refugee Ship Painful, Says Ghanian </HEADLINE>

LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
said yesterday that the decision to recall the Nigeran-registered
freithter "Bulk Challenge" was a painful one for his government
given the social cost of keeping Liberian refugees in his

<P>
A latest report monitered here today quoted the president as
complaining that assistance promises were never fulfilled as some
countries had offered although Ghana took the refugees in
response to their urges.

Ghana was reported to change its earlier decision to turn
back on the refugees aboard the ship off shore at alleged
assisitance offer.
</P>
<P>
Ghana finally allowed the ship carrying mainly Liberians
fleeing the war in their country to berth at the port of Takordi,
about 230 kilometers west of Accra, on Tuesday, after turning it
away two times.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, capital of Liberia, thousands of people were
seeking to leave the country though the city remained largely
calm on Wednesday, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> State Visit To S. Africa Fruitful, Says Nujoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Namibian President
Sam Nujoma today described his first four-day state visit to
South Africa as fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg at the end of
his visit, Nujoma welcomed the growing economic and commercial
ties between South Africa and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said both governments had pledged to ensure that such
cooperation was of mutual benefit to the people of their
countries.
</P>
<P>
During Nujoma's stay in South Africa, the two countries had
reached agreement on a number of joint projects, including
development of the Kudu gas field off the coast of Namibia, which
the president said ''would certainly provide jobs for all our
people''.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma also urged South African business to play a positive
part in cross-country investment, saying it was sure to benefit
both parties.
</P>
<P>
On the closer cooperation in the field of higher education,
Nujoma said: ''our respective ministers of education are
establishing a joint task force to explore ways in which South
Africa could assist Namibia in meeting the challenges of tertiary
education.''
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, who arrived in South Africa on Monday, came to the
country for his first state visit at the invitation of President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Namibia gained its independence from South Africa in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic, Kinkel Discuss Promotion of Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks here today with visiting German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel on regional issues and promotion of
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views on the most important issues in
international developments, with emphasis on current trends in the
Balkan region and steps aimed at strengthening peace and stability
in the territory of former Yugoslavia, said a statement released
by the Serbian presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel arrived here earlier today on a one-day official visit
to Yugoslavia, the first visit by a German foreign minister since
1991.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Bosnia issue, the two sides agreed that efforts
should be stepped up in order to intensify the implementation of
civilian and political aspects of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
"The key task in this regard is the election of legal
institutions in both entities in Bosnia, which will facilitate the
construction of a normal order, relations, and a safe life," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
A successful general election, scheduled for mid-September,
also provides an essential precondition for the return of a large
number of refugees, the establishment of normal communications,
and the restoration of confidence among the citizens, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Milosevic and Kinkel also focused their
attention to the questions of common interest between Yugoslavia
and Germany. Germany recognized Yugoslavia diplomatically on April
17.
</P>
<P>
"A normalization of relations between the two countries would
provide a strong impetus, primarily to their economic cooperation,
as Germany had in the past presented one of the most important
foreign trade partners of Yugoslavia," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> US Productivity Up in 1st Quarter in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Labor Department
reported today that productivity in the country jumped by 2.6
percent at an annual rate from January through March, the biggest
quarterly advance since last summer.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the increase in nonfarm productivity was
the largest since it surged 3 percent in the second quarter of
1995 and the rates are adjusted for seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, which is the key to the living standard in the
U.S., fell 1 percent in the final three months of last year after
rising 1.7 percent in the July-September quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed little inflation pressures. Unit labor
costs, typically two-thirds of the price of a product, inched up
just 0.6 percent in the first quarter. That was the smallest
increase since a 1.4 percent decline in the July-September quarter
of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Productivity measures output per number of hours worked.
Greater efficiency means businesses can increase employees' wages
without raising prices since workers are producing more with the
same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. economists attribute the recent gains to business
investments in high-tech equipment and to the restructuring and
downsizing that many companies have undergone.
</P>
<P>
U.S. productivity rose 1.1 percent in 1995, up from 0.5 percent
in 1994 and 0.2 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department also said that output shot up 3.7
percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, more than six
times faster than the anemic 0.6 percent gain in the final three
months of 1995. But hours worked increased just 1 percent, slower
than the 1.6 percent increase in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
Total business productivity, including farming, rose 2.8
percent after dropping 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter in 1995.
It was the largest increase since a 3 percent advance in the
second quarter of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Major Optimistic on Partial Lifting of UK Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has expressed great optimism upon a European Union (EU) decision
to partially lift the global ban on British beef product exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament this afternoon, Major said that there
was "every prospect" of an EU vote to end the ban on some British
beef by-products when the EU standing veterinary committee resumed
talks Monday.
</P>
<P>
EU veterinary experts reportedly failed to reach agreement on
lifting the ban on exports of British gelatine, tallow and other
beef by-products at Wednesday's meeting in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"On the subject of gelatine, tallow and semen, broadly half of
the European Union supported our position yesterday," Major said.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister made it clear that all that could be
"credibly done" was being done in a bid to remove the worldwide
ban on British beef products.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef product exports
on March 27 when the British government admitted that there were
possible connections between BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent, the brain-bashing Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was quoted
by the BBC television as saying that the British government was
considering to stage an advertising campaign around Europe so as
to reassure European consumers that British beef was safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is certainly necessary to ensure that the
public throughout Europe are aware of what has already been done
and what the British authorities, including our farming community,
are already implementing," Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rifkind admitted that there were some EU member states
that remained opposed to any relaxing of the seven-week-old EU ban
on British beef by saying that "there are one or two countries who
we believe are behaving in a very unreasonable way."
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to ensure that we win them over. We don't
need to get unanimity, as it happens on Monday. If we get a
sufficient majority, that will be sufficient to get the ban
lifted," he said.

<HEADLINE> Solana: World Continues Cooperation With Bosnian Serb PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said today the international community would continue a
very close cooperation with the ousted Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Kasagic in the Serb city of Banja Luka in
northwestern Bosnia, Solana said he still regarded Kasagic as
prime minister of Republika Srpska and talks on the implementation
of the Dayton peace agreement had been held with him in this
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door talks in Banja Luka were attended, apart from
Kasagic and Solana, by international High Representative for
Bosnia Carl Bildt, NATO commander-in-chief Gen. George Joulwan and
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) Commander for Sector Southwest
Gen. Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Solana and Joulwan flew to Belgrade later
today to discuss the power struggle in the Serb leadership with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic who is believed to have a
strong influence on the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic sacked Kasagic
Wednesday in order to "protect constitutional order... and prevent
any further worsening of the crisis in the government's work." But
the Serb hardliner's move has angered the international community
which said it would continue supporting the moderate Serb premier.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Kasagic said he believed that "the world
wishes to help Republika Srpska and its people in the restoration
of lasting peace" and that "borders towards this world should be
opened in the interest of the movement of people, capital and
goods."
</P>
<P>
He said he saw Karadzic's dismissal as an attempt to isolate
this part of Republika Srpska which has a vision of creating a
democratic society and cooperating with the world."
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said earlier in the day that he would not step down and
would stay in office until the dismissal was confirmed by
parliament.

<HEADLINE> UK Building Societies Prepare for Euro Mortgages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest mortgage lenders
are planning to overhaul the traditional home loan ahead of a
single European currency with the launch of euro mortgages.
</P>
<P>
Lending giants in Britain have put detailed plans in place for
financial life in the country after 1999, when they believe
European currencies will join in a single currency, the euro, with
the UK forced to accompany them within several years.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today said that the building societies have
produced blueprints for euro savings accounts, passbooks and
cash-dispensers despite the government's increasingly
Eurosceptical tone.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Halifax, the biggest mortgage lender in the UK,
said, "Our view is that a single European currency will happen and
that the UK will be brought in within two or three years. This
will mean substantial changes for our products, the housing market
and the economy as a whole. We have to look forward and be
prepared."
</P>
<P>
Bradford and Bingley's plans for a euro mortgage are already at
an advanced stage, and will be launched ahead of the UK's
participation in the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Its chief executive Geoffrey Lister said, "We believe euro
mortgages will be popular because they will offer lower interest
rates than sterling mortgages. We could even reach the stage where
Britain remains outside the currency alignment but employees ask
to be paid in euro."

WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Chief of Naval Operations
Jeremy Boorda died this afternoon of an apparently self-inflicted
gunshot, a television report said.
</P>
<P>
Washington police said the shooting happened shortly after 2
p.m. EDT in Boorda's residence in the Washington Navy Yard.
Washington D.C. General Hospital announced that the admiral
died of a gunshot wound to the chest at 2:30.

Navy Secretary John Dalton said, "There is an investigation
under way." But he said "we really don't know any more at this
point" about the cause of the death.
</P>

Boorda, 57, became chief of naval operations, the top uniform
position in the Navy, in march 1994.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in Western Europe Rise 12 percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Western Europe's new car sales rose
12.1 percent last month year-on-year, but the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association (EAMA) attributed most of the increase
to statistical anomalies, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two extra selling days in April, compared with the same month a
year ago, accounted for most of the increase, an EAMA spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
This meant that the 14.4 percent increase in new car sales in
Germany became around 4 percent in real terms. Similarly, a 13
percent rise in France was reduced to around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even this gives a falsely optimistic picture of the French
market, according to the EAMA. Some 29 percent of April's sales
are considered to have been due to government incentives to buy
new cars. Without them, the French market would have slipped below
1995 levels.
</P>
<P>
A longer selling month also influenced a 17.1 percent rise in
Britain, although the 7 percent real growth was seen as a sign of
returning confidence.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Volkswagen reinforced its clear market
leadership, its 200,900 selling representing a 17.6 percent rise
on a year ago. General Motors retained second place with a 6.1
percent rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer
today called on Japan to continue promoting the cause of trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is in Japan to explain the Asia policy of the new
Australian government, also said his country will strengthen ties
with East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Australia had a change of government in March after the
conservative Liberal Party won general elections and formed a
coalition with the National Party.
</P>
<P>
Fischer told a news conference that Australia is committed to
"keeping up the momentum of trade and investment liberalization"
through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the WTO's
role in liberalizing global trade should be a major theme during
the next meeting of APEC trade ministers in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, he noted that Japan is Australia's largest
trading partner, taking almost a quarter of Australian exports.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment "continues to play a major part in
Australia's economic development," he added.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Makes Inspection in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Economic development and social
progress in ethnic minority regions is crucial to invigorating
China, a country with many national groups, said Premier Li Peng,
who was visiting southwest China's Yunnan Province, which has many
minority groups, between May 10 and 17.
</P>
<P>
Li said that local officials should sincerely follow the
Party's policy on ethnic groups and that economic progress is the
basis of national unity, which is in turn the condition for
economic growth and social stability.
</P>
<P>
In the company of top local officials, Li visited minority
families, and attended folk festivals, and said that more
politically qualified minority cadres who also know how to develop
local economy should be trained and education in minority areas
should be improved.
</P>
<P>
He said Yunnan is rich in natural resources and has great
development potential, and made progress under the 8th Five-Year
Plan (1991-95).
</P>
<P>
Li said the province should attach greater importance to its
infrastructure, make more use of its resources and develop more
pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The premier asked local officials to pay greater attention to
agriculture and find ways of becoming self-sufficient in grain
supply within five years.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to increase border trade to improve the
minority economy and cooperative relations with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the fight against crime, especially drugs, should
be intensified.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has always been concerned about
the war on drugs and that Yunnan faces a heavy task in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The premier also visited the quake-hit Lijiang area during his
tour in the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Li Lanqing today
called for tighter controls on the price of goods across China
to reach this year's goal on price controls.
</P>
<P>
The call for controls came in a State Council telephone and
television meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the State Council, Li said that in the
first four months of this year, commodity retail prices rose by
7.6 percent over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to government efforts to fight inflation, the rate of
increase fell 11.8 percentage points compared with the first four
months of 1995," he pointed out, adding that the retail price
index has been held to below 10 percent for six consecutive
months, and markets across the country are relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the price control task remains quite
hard, and governments at all levels must never relax price control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Li listed six requirements in the price control work:
</P>
<P>
---- to regard the fight against inflation and control of
prices as the primary task of this year's macro-economic controls;
</P>
<P>
---- to set local price control targets in accordance with the
State Council's demands;
</P>
<P>
---- to improve agricultural production and ensure food and
vegetable supply;
</P>
<P>
---- to strictly control items of price rise and keep markets
stable;
</P>
<P>
---- to strengthen commodity price management and stop any
illegal fee collection;
</P>
<P>
---- and to improve leadership in price control work.
</P>

<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The mortality condition of children
and mothers improved substantially in the Philippines between 1990
and 1995, the National Statistics Coordination Board said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the government statistics
body, infant mortality rate declined from 57 infant deaths per
thousand livebirths in 1990 to 49 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, maternal mortality rate dropped drastically
from 209 for every 10,000 livebirths in 1990 to 180 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the study said that the drop in regional population
growth will slow down the growth of the Philippine population from
2.39 percent in 1995 to 2.13 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
This will translate to some 1.6 million increase in the
country's population annually, thus bringing the total population
to some 74 million by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Thomas, Uber Cups, Most Important for Badminton: Frost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Thomas and Uber Cup, All-England
Open and world championships are the most important competitions,
much more than the Olympics, for the sport of badminton, a retired
world-class badminton player said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Morten Frost, Danmark's veteran player during the 1960s and
1970s, with a glamorous career including appearance in the final
of the 1978 world championships, made the comments at a press
conference here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Frost, now manager of the Danish team in the on-going Thomas
and Uber Cup Finals here, were answering the question if his
players were keen on playing in the 10-day tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Because we have so few top players I believe we need the
competition and yes we are keen to play here and we will try our
best," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I think badminton has gone crazy. It's important we
remember where we come from. We have spent 20 years building up a
system which is the backbone of badminton and we should support
that system," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics is only every four years. Of course I understand
how important it is to win medals, of course I understand how
important it is for the players - but we have to support our own
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Olympic qualification, he said: "In the
Olympics the best should play. In many ways the Olympics will be a
weaker tournament than this competition (Thomas and Uber Cups),
the All England or the world championships," he added.

</P>
<P>
Local authorities said that the liner contributed greatly to
economic and trade cooperation between the two cities. ROK has
become the largest trade partner of Weihai.
</P>
<P>
Before the ship's operation Weihai only had three ROK-funded
enterprises. Now the figure has risen sharply to more than 480.

Europe, at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Foreign Operations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dine said that even if Russian Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov wins Russia's presidency, the United States will maintain
assistance to Russia, especially at the regional and local levels.
</P>
<P>
Those programs will continue to promote private enterprise and
free and fair elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
But Dine said that the U.S. Agency's aid to Russia is "on a
close-out course."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the U.S. aid to Russia is set this year at
about 165 million U.S. dollars, one-tenth of the assistance
provided only two years ago. Top priorities are Russian tax,
financial and energy sector reforms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AID is expanding its assistance to Ukraine, with 206
million U.S. dollars scheduled this year, Dine told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
He said that AID is concentrating heavily on Ukraine's
agri-business sector, considered critical to Ukrane's economic
prospects.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali today spoke highly of "the close working relations"
between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a CIS summit here today, Boutros-Ghali described the
relations between the CIS and the U.N. as "a major example of a
successful division of labour between a regional association and
the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
He especially praised the joint peace-keeping efforts by the
CIS and the U.N. in the two former Soviet republics of Georgia
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretary general added that cooperation between
the U.N. and the CIS should not be limited to peacekeeping and
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"It is exceptionally important for us to go farther than that
and address major economic and social problems of our times, many
of which are of global scale," he said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali welcomed the "dynamically developing" economic
and social integration process inside the CIS.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent treaty on the establishment of a
community between Russia and Belarus, as well as the integration
agreement between Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia,
reflected not only the natural evolution of the CIS, but also a
growing tendency toward regional and sub-regional integration in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali, who arrived here on Wednesday for a four-day
official visit, has already held seperate talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia has asked the United
Nations to extend the mandate of the U.N. peace-keeping force
stationed in the country, according to reports from Skopje,
capital of the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frckovski had written to
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, requesting the
extension of the mandate of the UN Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP), Macedonian press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the 1,000-strong U.N. force, comprising U.S. and
Nordic troops sent to Macedonia three years ago, will expire on
May 31.
</P>
<P>
Frckovski gave three reasons for requesting the extension.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, he said, areas along the border between Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, populated mainly by ethnic
Albanians, were still tense even after the Dayton peace agreement
on Bosnia was signed last November.
</P>
<P>
Territorial disputes between Greece and Turkey were another
source of instability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Macedonian army does not have the capability to
defend the country's northern and southern borders, the foreign
minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian president Boris Yeltsin,
addressing a summit meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) today, defined three key principles for deepening
integration within the CIS: sovereignty, openness and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told CIS leaders gathered in the Kremlin that the three
principles should guide relations among the 12 CIS member
countries as well as their relations with other nations.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the three principles, he said that national
sovereignty must be preserved; integration structures should be
open to other nations; and there should be flexibility in forming
the joint body supervising the integration process.
</P>
<P>
He likened the integration process within the CIS to a
multi-storey building in which there is "an organizational
structure on each floor".
</P>
<P>
Turning to specific ways to promote cooperation among CIS
countries, Yeltsin suggested establishing a common scientific and
technological information network, enlarging the Customs Union and
creating Payments and Currency Unions.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit also issued a joint statement declaring
support for Yeltsin's ongoing democratic and economic reforms.

HARARE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has been selected to host
the southern Africa executive branch office of the African
Export-Import Bank, a development that will promote and finance
the export of non-traditional African goods.
</P>
<P>
The African Export-Import Bank, with its headquarter in Cairo
of Egypt, was formed in Abuja of Nigeria in 1993 by African
states to deal with the problem of the institutional and
financial gap in Africa's trading framework.
</P>
<P>
Briefing members of parliament today before they ratified the
agreement for the establishment of the bank here, Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa said, "the establishment of the bank
comes in the wake of ever-increasing difficulties by African
exporters and importers in obtaining favorable trade financing
terms from the international financial markets, hence rendering
them uncompetitive on the global markets."
</P>
<P>
Operating on the lines of similar export-import banks in Japan
and the United States, he said among its other functions, the
bank would extend direct credit to African exporters through the
provision of pre-shipment and post-shipment finance.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia won
a gripping opening match over arch-rivals China in Group A at the
19th Thomas Cup world badminton men's team championships here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the other Group A match today, Sweden beat England 4-1.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians, with veterans like world number one Joko
Suprianto and Alan Budi Kusuma, won over their opponents 3-2 after
leveling the first four matches -- two singles and two doubles.
</P>
<P>
Joko lost the opening singles 2-1 to Dong Jiong, whom he edged
out of the top spot in the world rankings just three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Dong, 22, came from one game down to beat the veteran
Indonesian 10-15, 15-7, 15-8 in one hour and 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians came back strongly in the following doubles,
with their second-ranked pair, Ricky Subagdjia and Rexy Mainaky,
beating a Chinese combination of Jiang Xin and Huang Zhanzhong
2-0.
</P>
<P>
But a buoyant young Chinese star Sun Jun put his team one point
up with a come-from-behind victory over Indonesia's world champion
Heryanto Arbi 8-15, 15-7, 15-8, in the second singles.
</P>
<P>
But Indonesia evened the score again, and again with a doubles
win. Antonius and Deny Kantono defeated Chinese Liu Jianjun and
Liu Yong 15-7, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the final and decisive third singles was decided by
a match between young blood and experience.
</P>
<P>
Lin Liwen, with almost nothing to be boosted of, put up a
spirited fight against a much experienced Kusuma.
</P>
<P>
But experience spoke as Lin failed to get himself fully suited
to a pressure-on game and Kusuma won by a mere of three points, 18
to 15.

in the Shanghai securities market.
</P>
<P>
About 143,000 people from around the country have opened

</P>
<P>
In April alone, it accepted 436,400 accounts, or nearly 52

New accounts, which can be used immediately, have provided
convenient investment access, more new shares have been listed,
interest rates have been cut, and, especially, the securities

<HEADLINE> Hrawi Stresses Lebanon's Desire to Implement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has
stressed his country's desire to implement the cease-fire
understanding reached with Israel on April 26 and the importance
of an Israeli commitment to the understanding.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Arab parliamentarians at the south Lebanese town of
Kana today, the Lebanese president announced, "We are desirous of
implementing the April understanding, but we regard the Israeli
commitment as a soul of this understanding."
</P>
<P>
The Arab parliamentarians are at Kana to conclude the 27th
conference of the Union of Arab Parliaments (UAP).
</P>
<P>
Hrawi pointed out that the implementation of the cease-fire
understanding would be a "test of the Israeli intentions and its
respect for international laws."
</P>
<P>
He said a basic problem, namely the implementation of U.N.
Security Council resolution 425, should not be ignored, for
resolution 425 calls for the return to us of our occupied lands in
south Lebanon and western Beqaa up to the international borders
(with Israel)."
</P>
<P>
Alluding to an interlocking of the Lebanese and Syrian tracks,
the Lebanese president said, "South Lebanon and western Beqaa will
not be liberated before (Syria's) Golan and Golan will not be
liberated before south Lebanon and western Beqaa."
</P>
<P>
"All Lebanon is for peace, the just and comprehensive peace,"
he said. "All Lebanon is against the surrender of land to the
occupation, disruption of the entity and violation of the national
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The Arab parliamentarians arrived at Kana at noon today from
Syria where they opened the 27th UAP conference Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Economy to Grow 7 Pct in 2nd Half of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economy is expected to
make a soft landing in the second half of the year with a
7-percent growth, following a 7.3-percent growth in the first six
months, the Bank of Korea said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank predicted that the growth of gross domestic
product will slow down in the latter half of the year as a result
of a decline in the growth of exports and capital investment.
</P>
<P>
The envisaged yearly economic growth was given at 7.2 percent
this year compared with 9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Private-sector consumption and construction investment, with a
relatively high rate of growth at 7.2 percent and 7 percent
respectively, are to substitute exports as the leading supporters
of the country's economic growth, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of capital investment will be 7 percent in the
second half of year, lower than 11.1 percent in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that a sharp fall in the growth of imports will
bring forth a 1.8-billion-U.S.-dollar trade surplus, lowering
trade deficit from 4.75 billion dollars in 1995 to around 2.3
billion dollars for the whole of this year.
</P>
<P>
The invisible trade will register 2.3 billion dollars in
deficit during the latter half, bringing the yearly deficit to 5.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit is, therefore, likely to decline
slightly from 8.8 billion dollars last year to 7.9 billion dollars
this year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices were predicted by the central bank to grow a
modest 1.3 percent, a remarkable drop from 3.4 percent in the
first half of year, reducing the year's inflation to 4.7 percent,
about the same as last year.

<HEADLINE> No Hiding Place For Criminals, Vows Top Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China is to launch a new round of
anti-crime campaign later this month, said a top Chinese official
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
President of the Supreme People's Court Ren Jianxin vowed that
criminals in the country would find "no hiding place".
</P>
<P>
Ren, also a member of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) Central Committee and Secretary of the Political
Science and Law Committee under the CPC Central Committee, said
this at a forum on social security, sponsored by the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) today.
</P>
<P>
"The initial stage of the campaign has proved effective at
maintaining social stability, and received a positive response
from ordinary citizens across the country," said Ren, also
director of the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of
Public Security.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should not overestimate the achievements that have
been made so far, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The director also pointed out that the focus at the next stage
should be put on major cases, criminal gangs and criminals still
on the run, especially on criminals who defy the trend of the
present anti-crime campaign.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, the Political Science and Law Committee
under the CPC Central Committee will dispatch several working
groups to different regions of the country, to carry out
inspections and give directions, and intensify the anti-crime
campaign, Ren noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the participation of ordinary citizens
is essential to the effectiveness of the campaign, adding, "the
involvement of the masses will leave criminals with 'no hiding
place'".
</P>
<P>
"Totally relying on the campaign is not enough to solve the
problem of social security, and we should further implement all
measures of the comprehensive management of social security at
grass roots level, this is the only way out." Ren concluded.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Silk Industry Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said at a national conference on silk here today that the domestic
silk industry should be integrated, instead of several parts
belonging to different industries.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, centralized production and all-round
structural change is the way to revive the traditional industry,
which had a dominant position on global markets for a long time,
but was slowed by an outmoded management style over the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
Price wars that frequently erupted during cocoon purchasing
time each year resulted in declining quality of cocoons and silk
products and a sharp decrease in silk exports in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the price wars are not only an indication
of shortages of raw material but also the result of contradictions
in the interests of China's agriculture, industry, and trade
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that reforms could have a tremendous influence on
agricultural, industrial, and commercial development, as well as
on the thousands of silkworm raisers across the country, and would
help poverty-relief policies of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the country will set up silk and cocoon companies
to act as a regulator of the local silk industry, and a national
corporation for cocoon purchases, silk production, and exports,
will be started by local firms on "a voluntary basis."
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid price fluctuations in the cocoon trade, the
government should improve macro-economic controls and establish
cocoon reserves at the state- and local-government level.
</P>
<P>
A large number of small-sized technologically-backward silk
mills will be shut down or merged with other companies this year,
to open up bottlenecks in raw material supplies, and technological
renovation and quality improvement will be the focus of the
industry in its development.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Romano Prodi today
formed Italy's 55th postwar government and named a former
communist as his finance minister and the outgoing premier as his
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Prodi announced his cabinet list after a brief meeting with
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who on Thursday granted him the
mandate to form the government.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old prime minister, who has not held elected office
until now, leads the center-left Olive Tree coalition which won
the general elections last month over the center-right Freedom
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Prodi told reporters that the new government will first deal
with unemployment and financial disorder.
</P>
<P>
Key figures in his cabinet include former prime minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, who is to head a combined treasury and budget
ministry, and outgoing prime minister Lamberto Dini who is to be
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left
(PDS) have been given key portfolios: economist Vincenzo Visco,
who will head the finance ministry, and Giorgio Napolitano, who
will be appointed interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Their nomination to the cabinet brings Italian communists and
leftists back into government after a hiatus of almost half a
century. The Communist Party of Italy pulled out of the coalition
government in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Walter Veltroni will be appointed deputy prime minister and
culture minister.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the new government would be sworn in on Saturday.

train personnel engaged in demining and countermining operations,
or defend the United States and its allies," Clinton said in a

</P>
<P>
But he said that the U.S. will reserve the right to use
landmines that can be set to self-destruct until a comprehensive
international ban on all mines takes effect.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that he had instructed U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry to launch a program to develop better mine-detection
and mine-clearing technology for use in the many countries still

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that China's eight
ethnic minority areas maintained sustained and rapid economic
growth in 1995, with the GDP of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia,
Guangxi, and Tibet, and Yunnan, Guizhou and Qinghai provinces at
560 billion yuan, accounting for nearly one-tenth of country's
total.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the State Nationalities Affairs
Commission, the areas produced one-eighth of the country's grain,
one-fifth of cotton, a large amount of edible oil, sugar and meat.
</P>
<P>
Increased state investment in some businesses related to the
tobacco, coal, petroleum, electricity, and cement industries is
playing an important role in ethnic minority areas, which have
become important industrial centers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, total output of industrial enterprises at or above
the township level reached 430 billion yuan, an increase of 13.47
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the GDP of the eight areas achieved an
annual increase of 11.3 percent, on average.
</P>
<P>
Improving the infrastructure and basic industries, between 1991
and 1995, has also laid a good foundation for future development.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan improved or built eight airports, six trunk highway
lines, and more than 800 km of highways.

the present two billion US dollars to four billion a year. At the
same time, it would try to maintain greater transparency, openness
and accountability in all dealings, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
The major area of concern for the government was fiscal deficit
and the BJP government would do better management of monetary and
fiscal policies to check inflation, tackle the problem of high
interest rates, massive public borrowing and profligacy in
government expenditure that had pushed up the deficit to
unacceptable levels, he further said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in China's
coastal areas and those farther inland need to increase
cooperation to shorten the gap in economic growth between the two
areas, Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is in the capital of northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region to attend a conference on co-operative exchanges
between coastal and inland township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between township enterprises across the country
will play a vital role in speeding up economic development in the
vast central and western areas of China," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), he pointed out,
China is expected to generate 150 billion yuan in revenue and
provide 5 million jobs in rural surplus labor by means of coastal
and inland township enterprise co-operation, and to select 200
prototype regions for the co-operation.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation will not only involve funds, but also
technology, personnel, and management," he explained, adding that
it can take many forms.
</P>
<P>
He said that funding, technology, management skills, and
trained personnel from coastal regions can greatly help improve
existing township enterprises in central and west China, and went
on to say that township industries must place more emphasis on
science and technology, improving management, and adjusting
industrial and product structures if they are to develop further.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched a project to increase cooperation between
township enterprises in 1995, 10,000 co-operative agreements,
worth 30 billion yuan, have been signed, bringing some 15 billion
yuan in funds to inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,100 cooperative township enterprises were set up and
over 50,000 personnel from inland areas trained.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nujoma Recalls Sino-Namibian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- "That's great!" exclaimed
Namibian President Sam Nujoma at the news that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin is to visit Namibia on May 18-20.
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to our Chinese brother!" the excited president told
Chinese Ambassador An Yongyu in their recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
When Nujoma recalled the victory of Namibians in his
interviews with Chinese correspondents, he often said: it was
with the firm support from the Chinese people that Namibia had
won her independence in March 1990 from the then apartheid South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Having visited the People's Republic of China on eight
occasions, Nujoma takes pride in his brotherhood with senior
Chinese leaders and sentiment for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He highly evaluated the advice from the late Chinese leader
Chairman Mao Zedong and the late Premier Zhou Enlai on the
necessity of waging a protracted struggle for national
independence.
</P>
<P>
The advice proved correct. Unlike the prediction by some
leaders of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)
that the struggle would take only three to five years, it took as
long as 23 years to win the final victory of the Namibian people,
the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma takes pleasure in every achievement made in China.
"China is a giant whose development in peace and stability is
vital for Asia, Africa and the rest of the whole world," the
Namibian president said at the New Year's Day reception early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has been a firm supporter of China in terms of human
rights and Taiwan issues.
</P>
<P>
China has won world recognition of her success in maintaining
peace, stability and high economic growth, which constitute
the basis of human rights, according to the Namibian president,
who accused those attacking China on the issue of being
unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
The president has time and again pointed out that Taiwan is
an integral part of China and that Namibia won't follow any
policy of "Two Chinas".
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has been paying special attention to projects of
economic and technical cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the visit by the Chinese president to
his country, Nujoma met again with the Chinese ambassador in
early May to discuss preparations for the historic event of
both countries.
</P>
<P>
"Please tell President Jiang, the Namibian government and
people are looking forward to his visit," Nujoma said to the
Chinese ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Life Insurance Sales in Fashion in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- After several visits, Xiao Sun
finally persuaded a manager in a luxurious office in a downtown
skyscraper to purchase 13 life insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
The deal was his largest single success since Xiao Sun became a
sales agent with a local insurance company just three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Selling life insurance has become a vogue profession in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, following
marketing of electronic household appliances, cosmetics, club
membership cards and commodities houses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by local insurance authorities show that
about 500 people, most of them enthusiastic youth, are joining the
army of life insurance agents in Guangzhou each month.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year white-collar clerks in major corporations,
owners of private enterprises, shops and stalls, and workers
repairing shoes and other daily life items along streets have been
visited by the nearly 4,000 life insurance agents in Guangzhou, a
prosperous city with about 6.5 million residents.
</P>
<P>
More and more people in the city have realized that it is worth
buying life insurance, and each insurance agent usually sells one
policy after visiting about 15 new clients.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance agents are paid on commission, which varies
between five percent and 30 percent of premiums on the policies
they sell. Each agent's monthly income is usually about 4,000 yuan
with some even topping 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The life insurance market had been neglected for years until
the China Pacific Insurance Company and the Ping'an Insurance
Company, the No.2 and No.3 insurers in China, came into Guangzhou
in 1992, and Guangzhou Life Insurance, the first regional public
insurance company in Guangzhou, was established in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The three new insurers broke the monopoly of the People's
Insurance Company of China, China's No.1 insurer, and heralded a
competitive era for the local life insurance market.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the International Insurance Association put
potential life insurance premiums at about 15 percent of gross
domestic product or saving deposits in a country or region.
</P>
<P>
Given that residents had 200 billion yuan in deposits in 1995,
Guangzhou's potential life insurance premiums should be as much as
30 billion yuan. The city, however, took in less than one billion
yuan in life insurance premiums last year.
</P>
<P>
The huge spread has led more than 10 major foreign insurers to
set up representative offices in Guangzhou to prepare for
operation in the city.
</P>
<P>
American International Assurance (AIA), the first foreign
underwriter operating in China, opened a branch here in January.
Selling 37 percent of the 50,000 effective life insurance policies
in Shanghai, China's largest city, in 1995, AIA has finished
recruiting staff members, ready to tap the thriving life insurance
market.
</P>
<P>
"Guangzhou is a really large life insurance market," said an
expert. "Whether Chinese- or foreign-funded, insurance companies
should concentrate on fostering personnel as soon as possible
rather than consider how strong their competitors are."
</P>
<P>
"Personnel with expertise will help them win larger market
shares in future competition in Guangzhou," he said.

<HEADLINE> CIS Leaders Express Support for Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the former Soviet
republics today threw their weight behind Russian president Boris
Yeltsin's re-election bid, saying that the well-being of their
countries depends on the continuation of Russian reforms.
</P>
<P>
At their regular summit in the Kremlin this morning, the leaders
of the 12 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) adopted a statement declaring their support for
ongoing democratic and economic reforms in Russia, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that "the situation in the CIS countries
largely depends on the success of the reforms in Russia". It was
therefore important for Russia to have the political will not to
stray from the path of reform which was now yielding results, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also stressed that Russia is at the center of
efforts to integrate the CIS and "conditions have been created for
integration within the CIS thanks to the efforts of Yeltsin" who
is running for a second term in the June 16 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said the CIS countries will "respect any
constitutional choice of the Russian people" but hoped that
Russian voters would choose "a united, flourishing and democratic
Russia".
</P>
<P>
During their summit, CIS leaders also discussed an integration
plan for 1996-1997 and joint measures to fight crime in the CIS
countries.

<HEADLINE> Arab Parliamentarians Condemn Repeated Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- At the final session of its 27th
conference which was deliberately held today in a southern
Lebanese town, the venue of the bloodiest Israel shelling, the
Union of Arab Parliaments (UAP) condemned "repeated Israeli
aggressions on Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The session was held in the Official Secondary School in Kana,
and attended by Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker
Nabih Berri and delegates from more than a dozen Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
In its final declaration, the UAP announced that it "denounces
the repeated Israeli aggressions on lebanon, especially the recent
brutal aggression and what resulted from the massacres of the
Lebanese civilians."
</P>
<P>
It particularly named the five massacres committed by Israel
in south Lebanon last month at the towns and villages of
Nabatiyeh, Tahmar, Mansouri, Jmijma and Kana, in addition to the
destruction of infrastructure and economic installations.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded in
16 days of Israeli military strikes in south lebanon last month.
</P>
<P>
The UAP "calls for pressures on Israel in order to stop the
(Israeli) painful operations, the annexation of lands, the
merciless displacement of people, the limitation of citizens'
freedom and the steal of historic monuments."
</P>
<P>
It also called on the Jewish state to "make compensation for
the damages which (Israel) inflicted on Lebanon, and to release
the Lebanese detainees in prisons in Israel and in the Israeli
prison at Khiam in south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that the UAP "condemns also the massacre
which Israel committed against the innocent civilians who had
sought shelter at the positions of U.N. (peacekeeping) forces at
Kana on April 18."
</P>
<P>
The union "regards the massacre as an operation of the
organized state terrorism and calls for a trial of those
responsible for this operation as war criminals according to
international legislations and laws."
</P>
<P>
It called on the international community to exert pressure on
Israel "with all means" for the implementation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425, which demands a pullout of the Israeli
forces from south Lebanon and western Bekaa "without any
condition."
</P>
<P>
It "stresses the right of the Lebanese people in the
resistance against the Israeli occupation," and "calls for all
kinds of supports for the Lebanese national resistance ... and
Lebanon's reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
Chief delegates of the Arab parliaments arrived at Kana, some
95 kilometers south of Beirut, at noon today to hold their final
session of the 27th UAP conference to show their solidarity with
Lebanon and with the residents at Kana.
</P>
<P>
Before the session was held, the Arab parliamentarians, headed
by UAP Chairman Mohammed Jalal Said and accompanied by Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi and House Speaker Nabih Berri, laid a wreath
at the collective cemetery of the victims of the Israeli shelling
at Kana.
</P>
<P>
They also visited the camp of the Fijian contingent, laid a
wreath to the ruined camp houses where the massacre took place,
and inspected the Fijain troops.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Ambitious Gas Project (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gas and coal dust explosions are responsible for up to 40
percent of deaths caused by all coal mine accidents.
</P>
<P>
Production mines in China emit more than one billion cubic
meters of methane gas a year, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
While important to mine safety, Chen says, this is a waste of
energy which China can no longer bears, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, methane is a chief culprit of the "green house
effect" -- a process of global warming since the Industrial
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Known deposits of coal throughout China contain an estimated
30-35 trillion cubic meters of methane, accounting for one third
of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
"For the good of China and the human race, UCMC will do its
best," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In China, only 400 million cubic meters of coal pit gas is
actually used every year -- mostly for cooking in families in and
around coal fields. Gas is pumped out simply as a mine safety
measure.
</P>
<P>
As a start UCMC will, in five years, develop two or three
coal-gas fields with an annual output of one billion cubic meters
for marketing. This calls for digging up to 600 gas pits.
</P>
<P>
China has basically completed a nation-wide coal geology
survey, which involves coal-bed methane.
</P>
<P>
Six coal fields have been verified to have gas reserves of
commercial value amounting to each having at least 100 billion
cubic meters. These are mostly in northern and eastern China, such
as Yangquan in Shanxi and Huaibei in Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Across the length and breadth of China, there are 19 coal
fields with gas reserves verified at 10 billion cubic meters or
more -- ranging from Hegang in China's far northeast to Songzao in
Sichuan of the southwest.
</P>
<P>
China's coal pit gas has attracted worldwide attention. Under
an agreement signed in 1992, the United Nations Development
Program allocated 10 million US dollars to help China develop its
coal-bed methane.
</P>
<P>
All the four projects under the agreement will be completed
this year: appraisal of China's coal-bed methane resources as one,
and three projects separately in Kailuan, Hebei Province, north
China; Tiefa in Liaoning Province, northeast China, and Songzao in
Sichuan Province, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The results are "very encouraging", Chen said, adding that some
gas pits "are producing 6,000 - 7,000 cubic meters a day."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the US Environmental Protection Agency agreed to
cooperate with the Chinese Ministry of Coal Industry (MCI) in the
recovery and utilization of China's coal-bed methane resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile MCI is cooperating with many foreign companies in
coal-bed methane development, including Amoco and Texaco.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Reaffirms Land-for-Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Peace will continue to be an Arab
strategic option so long as it is just and comprehensive and based
on the land-for-peace principle and the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA),
Meguid said that an Arab summit, even a mini-summit, is a most
welcome effort, which should be regarded as a step toward
realizing Arab reconciliation and the unification of Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief said that main priority at the present
should be directed toward Arab reconciliation in the light of his
proposal which has already won the approval of 14 Arab states thus
far. The Cairo-based league now has a membership of 22.
</P>
<P>
Meguid also said that the Arabs and the international community
were opposed to the Israeli aggressive operations against Lebanon,
on the grounds that such aggression undermined the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Peace cannot be achieved through violence or continued Israeli
occupation of Arab lands, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meguid called upon the Arab states to be cautious while taking
any step to normalize relations with Israel, because the present
conditions require an appreciation of the Arab situation as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized Arab rejection of the recent
Israeli-Turkish agreement, pointing out that it shocked the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkish justifications that similar agreements
were concluded with 16 other countries, Meguid said that none of
them occupied the territories of Arab states.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Arab stance toward this agreement was based
on the fact that it did not conform to the historical relationship
between Arabs and Turks, nor to the fact that Turkey was being
considered a Moslem, friendly and neighboring country to the
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Meguid, who is leading a delegation, left here today for Libya
on an Arab and European tour which will also take him to Malta,
Britain, Ireland and Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Arab Lawmakers Arrive in South to Show Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief delegates of the Arab
parliaments arrived at southern Lebanese town of Kana today from
Syria where they attended a three-day conference of the Union of
Arab Parliaments (UAP).
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Arab parliamentarians to Kana came on the eve
of the monthly commemoration day for an Israeli bombardment at a
military camp of the U.N. peacekeeping force at the town on April
18, during which more than 100 civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the 16 chief delegates to the 27th UAP
conference, headed by UAP Chairman Mohammed Jalal Said, arrived at
Kana around 0:30 p.m. (09:30 GMT). They announced that the visit
was aimed at showing their solidarity with Lebanon and the
residents in Kana.
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, they were joined by Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi, who, before the Arab parliamentarians, laid a wreath
to the collective cemetery of the victims in the April 18 Israeli
bombardment at Kana.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Lebanese president and the parliamentary delegates
drove to the camp of the Fijian contingent at the entrance of
Kana and inspected the Fijian troops.
</P>
<P>
In the Fijian military camp, the venue of the bloody Israeli
shelling, Hrawi met with Maj. Gen. Stanislaw Wozniak, commander of
the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, and laid a wreath at the ruined
camp houses where the civilians were massacred.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nujoma Recalls Sino-Namibian Ties (by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- "That's great!" exclaimed
Namibian President Sam Nujoma at the news that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin is to visit Namibia on May 18-20.
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to our Chinese brother!" the excited president told
Chinese Ambassador An Yongyu in their recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
When Nujoma recalled the victory of Namibians in his
interviews with Chinese correspondents, he often said: it was
with the firm support from the Chinese people that Namibia had
won her independence in March 1990 from the then apartheid South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Having visited the People's Republic of China on eight
occasions, Nujoma takes pride in his brotherhood with senior
Chinese leaders and sentiment for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He highly evaluated the advice from the late Chinese leader
Chairman Mao Zedong and the late Premier Zhou Enlai on the
necessity of waging a protracted struggle for national
independence.
</P>
<P>
The advice proved correct. Unlike the prediction by some
leaders of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)
that the struggle would take only three to five years, it took as
long as 23 years to win the final victory of the Namibian people,
the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma takes pleasure in every achievement made in China.
"China is a giant whose development in peace and stability is
vital for Asia, Africa and the rest of the whole world," the
Namibian president said at the New Year's Day reception early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has been a firm supporter of China in terms of human
rights and Taiwan issues.
</P>
<P>
China has won world recognition of her success in maintaining
peace, stability and high economic growth, which constitute
the basis of human rights, according to the Namibian president,
who accused those attacking China on the issue of being
unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
The president has time and again pointed out that Taiwan is
an integral part of China and that Namibia won't follow any
policy of "Two Chinas".
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has been paying special attention to projects of
economic and technical cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the visit by the Chinese president to
his country, Nujoma met again with the Chinese ambassador in
early May to discuss preparations for the historic event of
both countries.
</P>
<P>
"Please tell President Jiang, the Namibian government and
people are looking forward to his visit," Nujoma said to the
Chinese ambassador.

<HEADLINE> China Sounds Alarm Against Cheats in New Canal Rumor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials today declared
the building of so-called Shuoxian-Tianjin canal as a "rumor".
</P>
<P>
Fund raisers are trying to gather money to launch the project
for the 580-kilometer long waterway. But today Chinese officials
described fund-gathering practices concerned with the non-existent
project as illegal.
</P>
<P>
Individuals have been going about in the mainland, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao promoting the project, a canal to connect Shuoxian
County in North China's Shanxi Province with the coastal city of
Tianjin, and raising money. But some people and companies have
already filed complaints claiming that they have been cheated.
</P>
<P>
A panel of officials from the State Planning Commission, the
Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Communications
called an urgent press conference in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
They emphasised that China has never approved the project, and
have ordered its public security and law departments to
investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
The officials called the project unfeasible, saying that the
canal would have no guarantee of water resources.
</P>
<P>
"The canal is designed to fetch water from the Wanjiazhai
Reservoir along the upper reaches of the Yellow River, however,
because the area is arid and semi-arid, water resources are
unstable, especially before the project to channel the water of
the Yangtze River to the North is launched," they said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the project also poses tremendous technical
difficulties because the canal would start from mountainous and
hilly areas in the west, some 1,000 meters higher than Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Also, because of the huge construction costs, neither the
Central government nor any local governments can afford them
financially, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that supporters of the canal project believe
that the scheme could help transport coal from Shanxi Province to
the eastern parts of China, where industrial developments are
badly in need of fuel and energy.
</P>
<P>
The officials called the water link unnecessary, saying that
China has already built a special railway for the purpose, and is
drafting plans for another.
</P>
<P>
They said that the digging of the canal would aggravate
water-shortages in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow
River and cause more frequent dry spells.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, a division chief with the State Planning Commission,
said that she has been voicing her objection to the 'project' ever
since the so-called project was first announced in 1989. But she
was astonished to find her name in the list of supporters for the
project.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that China would never resort to the project
as a measure to relieve the water shortages in north China.
</P>
<P>
They said that China regards a project to channel water as one
of its key measures to solve water shortage problems, and that
China is actively studying ways of carrying out plans to bring
water from the Yangtze River in southern China to the north. But
that does not include the project for the canal-that-never-was.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Steps up Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has stepped up its
anti-drug campaign as the drug problem is deteriorating on this
eastern Mediterranean island, according to the Cyprus Weekly
today.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the drug cases have been on the increase in
the past few years, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 authorities investigated 156 drug cases involving 221
people, with 100 being Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 there were just 50 cases involving 79 people. In 1991
this number increased to 72 cases and 90 people were
implicated. In 1992 the authorities investigated 77 cases with 123
people involved, while in 1993 there were 86 registered cases with
123 people implicated.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, however, the number of cases involving drugs jumped to
135 with 171 people involved, and this is seen as a significant
increase.
</P>
<P>
Police have expressed their concern about the problem which
involves mainly young people and the trafficking of drugs from or
through the Turkish-controlled northern island by Turkish
Cypriots, who collaborate with Greek Cypriots in the
government-controlled southern areas.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police were reported to successfully break up a gang of
Greek Cypriots who were collaborating with Turkish Cypriots in
smuggling and trafficking drugs in the southern areas, destined
for local consumption.
</P>
<P>
Police say efforts are in hand to deal with the situation. The
Cypriot police and anti-drug units are closely cooperating with
the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and with
the United Nations and European Union authorities.
</P>
<P>
As part of the anti-drug campaign which is mainly targeted on
youth, Cyprus in 1995 organized 72 lectures in schools, military
camps and barracks, which were attended by more than 5,000
people.

<HEADLINE> Indian CBI Seeks Interpol Help to Trace Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) has sought the help of Interpol to trace down
two accomplices of a cheat.
</P>
<P>
The cheat is a British national who cheated various banks in
India to the tune of 22.7 million rupees (710,000 US dollars)
within a span of 20 days in January 1995, Press Trust of India
(PTI) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The alleged cheat, Lal Budhrani was lodged in Tihar jail under
judicial custody since his arrest in January last year, but two of
his accomplices escaped.
</P>
<P>
Budhrani came to India on September 20, 1994 with a pre-planned
motive to execute his cheating operation. None of the 11 bank
branches from where he withdrew huge amount of cash by issuing
forged bank drafts had any inkling that they were making payments
on forged drafts.

<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton of the United
Sates is expected to raise the issue of Nigeria at the Summit
of Eight in Lyon, France next month.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian local press quoted U.S. Under-secretary of State
for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff as saying on Thursday in
Washington that the action was ''in the hope that the heads of
state will condemn Nigeria's military government''.
</P>
<P>
Tarnoff was testifying before a U.S. Senate sub-committee
which held a special hearing on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The United States, together with the European Union, have
already imposed limited sanctions against Nigeria following the
Abacha administration's hanging of nine Ogoni minority activists
in last November. The Commonwealth also suspended Nigeria's
membership.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian government has strongly refuted the
accusation, saying the Ogoni issue is purely Nigeria's internal
affair and no foreign countries should interfere in it.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Group of Eight include the United States,
Britain, Canada, France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Mongolian Able to Make Pottery 8,000 Years ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Ancient inhabitants of the Inner
Mongolia grasslands were able to make decorative pottery as early
as 8,000 years ago, Chinese archeologists have found.
</P>
<P>
Earthenwares discovered at Xinglongwa in the grasslands area,
are cylindrical in shape, thick-walled, and made from grey sandy
soil.
</P>
<P>
On the surface of the pottery are simple and zig-zag decorative
lines which indicate the cultural features of northern China,
laying a foundation for delicate pottery at later times,
archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 years later than Xinglongwa, pottery found at the
Zhaobaogou ancient site bare some strange interconnecting pictures
showing pig heads, snakes, deer heads and birds.
</P>
<P>
The primitive pictures put many kinds of animals together
through the combination of abstraction and realism.
</P>
<P>
Excavations of the ancient sites of kilns show that local
people developed professional pottery-making 5,000 years ago. The
kilns had rectangle and U-shaped stoves with single or double
chambers.
</P>
<P>
The grey cooking pots and jars made from sandy soil transfer
heat quickly and absorb water easily, while other daily utensils
were decorated colorfully.
</P>
<P>
Pottery goddesses for ceremonial occasions and sacrificial
utensils also appeared during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Earthenware belonging to various ancient dynasties are
important materials for the study of ancient ethnic groups in
northern China, archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
In the 10th century, the Qidan people pushed local
pottery-making to its heyday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a dozen ancient kilns show that 1,000 years
ago local residents were able to make distinctive and delicate
dishes and pots in the shape of a cock's comb, phoenix heads, fish
and birds.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said in Japan today that he felt hurt at the
opposition against the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) proposed
by Malaysia a few years ago, Malaysia's news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his dismay at US stand against the setting up of the

Agreement (NAFTA), but it was told that the proposed EAEC was not
approved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference held in Tokyo, Mahathir asked, "Do we
have to ask for a license to form the EAEC ?" adding, "I feel a
little bit hurt. I think East Asian countries have every right to
come together."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that one country should not impose its value on
another.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the EAEC was neither going to be a trade bloc nor
a military alliance.

<HEADLINE> China launches ambitious gas project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China's highest governing body, the
State Council, today launched the China United Coal-bed Methane
Company (UCMC) in an ambitious effort to exploit its abundant
coal-bed methane resources.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the new company will also solve the country's
energy environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
UCMC has been designated by the State Council to commercialize
prospecting, development, transport, marketing and utilization of
coal pit gas, while acting as the Government watchdog.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has granted UCMC, which is jointly owned by
the Ministry of Coal Industry (MCI), the Ministry of Geology and
China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation, the exclusive rights
to undertake the exploration, development and production of
coal-bed methane, or "coal pit gas" in cooperation with foreign
partners.
</P>
<P>
The company will jointly map out target areas for international
cooperation and will conduct invitations for overseas bidding,
negotiation, and signing and execution of contracts for the
proposed projects upon the approval by the State Planning
Commission, according to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Notorious as the cause of coal pit explosions, coal-bed methane
can be used as a clean fuel, as good as natural gas which is also
basically methane. Scientists say that every 1,000 cubic meters of
methane generates as much heat as one ton of oil.
</P>
<P>
"China is expected to invest one to 1.5 billion yuan in
recovery and utilization of coal-bed methane over the next five to
ten years, in hope that a new energy sector will be built for the
21st century," said Chen Minghe, chairman of UCMC.
</P>
<P>
Development of the country's coal-bed methane resources is
listed as a "task of key importance" in the country's 9th
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Accordingly work is in full swing to develop complete sets of
technology and equipment for the nationwide coal-bed methane
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The immediate target is an annual output of one billion cubic
meters of coal-bed methane by 2000. The national output should
reach 10 billion cubic meters by 2010, says UCMC Board Chairman
Chen Minghe.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's largest coal producer, feels more pressed
than any other country to harness coal gas.
</P>
<P>
"China has the largest coal reserves in the world, there are
over 1,000 billion tons of available coal reserves " said Wang
Senhao, minister of Coal Industry, "But China's energy resources
per capita is only 40 percent of world's average."
</P>
<P>
"But China's coal-bed methane reserves are three times that of
the United States and are estimated at about 30,000 to 35,000
billion cubic meters," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"A systematic way of exploiting coal-bed methane will also
greatly reduce gas explosions and loss of human lives in coal
mines," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- With promises from Warsaw to knit
closer business ties, a grand South Korean government delegation
today winds up its four-day mission in Poland, its top trading
partner in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Prime Minister Soo Sung Lee, accompanied by 70
entrepreneurs, started the trip on May 13 in a bid to pry open
the Polish market for Korean products and investment and to
elevate their bilateral relations to a new horizon.
</P>
<P>
After hours of talks with Polish counterpart Wrodzimierz
Cimoszewicz and President Aleksander Kwasniewski, both sides are
committed to expanding cooperation to cover as many areas as
possible -- political, economic, technological, cultural and
social.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has offered Warsaw soft loans of 50 million U.S. dollars
as well as loan guarantees of 450 million dollars since they
forged diplomatic ties in late 1989. It is ready to pour in more
money, said Soo Sung Lee.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed that bilateral cooperation in
the future will be centered on seeking a perfect match between
Poland's technical know-how and South Korea's capital and jointly
tapping market opportunities in third countries.
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of areas where Seoul and Warsaw can work
together, including the industries of electronics, post and
telecommunications, automobile, aircraft, shipbuilding and
chemicals, Lee and Cimoszewicz pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries topped 540 million dollars last
year. Poland imports textiles and auto from South Korea, and
exports steel and pig iron.
</P>
<P>
Big-time Korean investors, such as Hyundai, Samsung and LG,
have also set an eye on Poland, eager to build modern office
buildings and container factories in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, the No.1 player in the South Korean business circle,
will invest a total of 341 million dollars in two auto plants in
Poland by the year 2000 and 1.5 billion dollars more in early next
century.

<HEADLINE> Mountainous Areas Bidding farewell to Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in a poverty
stricken mountain area of north China have become better off.
</P>
<P>
They have scaled new heights to achieve a prosperity that just
a few years ago seemed like a dream.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of a large group of well-developed towns and
villages is heralding the economic boom period for the once
poverty-hit Luliang Mountain region in Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Luliang Prefecture, a mountainous area with over 200 towns and
villages and a population of 3 million, has been beset by harsh
natural conditions and is regarded as one of the country's poorest
regions.
</P>
<P>
But through years of strenuous efforts more than one million
local people, or one third of the prefecture's total population,
have shaken off poverty by embarking on a fast track leading to
wealth.
</P>
<P>
And 49 villages and towns, accounting for one fourth of the
region's total, are keeping pace with their counterparts in the
developed areas of the country by achieving respective record
output values exceeding 100 million yuan,
</P>
<P>
The prefecture attributed its initial success in fighting
poverty to the vigorous development of infrastructural facilities,
township-run enterprises and effective agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Luliang prefecture has aimed for
"high yield, fine quality and best efficiency" in its drive to
enhance agricultural production and produced 290 million kg of
grain in 1995, with an average per capita net income of 1,287 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The township-run enterprises, particularly backbone industries
in the sectors of metallurgy, mining and brewing have become
pillars for boosting local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The total output value of the 49 township-run enterprises
topped 10 billion yuan in 1995, injecting a great vigor into
economic prosperity in the Luliang Mountainous region, which is
finally bidding farewell to poverty.

<HEADLINE> CIS Summit Opens in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) opened its regular summit meeting here this morning,
mainly to discuss joint efforts to develop integration and fight
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the 12-member CIS are also expected to give all
but explicit backing to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's bid for
re-election. Yeltsin, with Russia's presidential polls being just
one month away, is facing challenge from 10 rivals including
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The 12 CIS leaders opened their summit meeting in the Kremlin
at 10:00 Moscow time (08:00GMT). It will be followed later by a
plenary meeting of the CIS Council of the Heads of State.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the 12 former Soviet republics will also have a
meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali, who
arrived in Moscow on Wednesday for a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda are eight further issues, foremost among
them a plan for developing integration within the CIS through
1997. According to CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya, the
emphasis will be on speeding up the process.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of the CIS countries realize that the processes of
integration are not moving forward as quickly as they would like,"
Korotchenya told reporters here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CIS leaders will also discuss a wide-range plan for
fighting organized crime in the CIS to the year 2000, and an
agreement on cooperation between border forces of the 12 republics.
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution, "Support for Democratic Processes in
Russia," states that stability is required for Yeltsin's reforms
to bear fruit, the Intefax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The document further links the possibilities for development in
Russia and further integration within the CIS "with the activity
of Russia's first president Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit meeting, the 12 CIS leaders will hold a
joint news conference in the Kremlin later today.

<HEADLINE> China Marks World Telecommunications Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese telecommunications
officials and experts gathered here today to mark the 28th World
Telecommunications Day (WTD) with the theme "Telecommunications
and Sports".
</P>
<P>
This year marks the centenary of the modern Olympic Games and
the year of the opening of the 26th Olympic Games in Atlanta. The
theme of this year's WTD aims to stress the links between
telecommunications and sports.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Deqiang, vice-minister of posts and telecommunications,
told today's meeting that telecommunications have been important
for the Olympic Games since the first modern Games were held in
Athens in 1896.
</P>
<P>
With the invention and popularization of radio communications
technology around the turn of the century, images and news of the
Olympic Games has been transmitted more rapidly and vividly.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to sporting competition
broadcasting. With the wider coverage of the public
telecommunications network and more advanced technology, major
international sports events such as the Asian Games and Winter
Asian Games have been covered more extensively and rapidly.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the MPT, China's communications
capacity increased eightfold from 1980 to 1995. About 1.16 million
long-distance exchange lines were added in 1995, bringing the
total number to 3.5 million lines.
</P>
<P>
To date, analog mobile telecommunications have entered the
nationwide roaming stage, and global system for mobile
communications (GSM) has achieved roaming in 15 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions and is expected to enter
nationwide roaming within this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, China is expected to double its
communications capacity in the coming five years, pushing the
country's telephone penetration rate to 10 percent in the year
2000, with 30 to 40 percent in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
World Telecommunications Day was initiated in 1968, when the
International Telegraph Union, the predecessor of the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU), was founded. It has
been celebrated worldwide on May 17 annually with themes decided
by the ITU.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Organizes Journalist Tour in Aegean to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- About 70 local and foreign
journalists here will make a tour this afternoon by Turkish
military plane to the holiday resort of Bodrum, very close to the
Turkish-Greek disputed Kardak (Imia) islet in the Aegean, Turkish
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to a Greek plan to take European
Union (EU) journalists aboard a warship to the Aegean on May 18-19,
which seriously angered Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The journalists will tour the Aegean by a warship Saturday and
a briefing will be given on the warship during the tour, the
Turkish sources said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said
that "Turkey will take the necessary precautions for the
protection of its legitimate rights and interests in the face of
this new provocation."
</P>
<P>
The Greek ambassador in Ankara has been summoned to the Turkish
Foreign Ministry on this issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nurkan called the tour a "new Greek provocation on the Kardak
(Imia) issue," referring to the conflict on who owns the twin
islets in the Aegean that brought the two NATO members to the
brink of war in January.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece disclosed Thursday that the EU journalists
would be taken on a predetermined route -- which did not include
Kardak (Imia) -- on a "luxury yacht."
</P>
<P>
Greek government Spokesman Dimitrios Rappas said that
originally the tour was to be made with a military vessel "for
economic reasons," but it was later decided to use a "luxury
yacht."
</P>
<P>
Rappas added that any "intervention" by Turkey would be
reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey nearly went to war in 1987 in a dispute over
mineral rights in the Aegean.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today called on East Asia to set itself on the
road to true peace and friendship and move forward with
confidence, said reports from Tokyo by Malaysia's Bernama news
agency.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to be confident. Let us move forward
together," he said at an international conference on the future of
Asia held in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said it was now time to launch an East Asian act of
regional statesmanship that should begin with its leaders meeting
over a host of issues on peace, friendship, common prosperity and
collective economic dynamism.
</P>
<P>
He said East Asian countries must continue with the policy to
help each other prosper as the global prosperity is threatened by
the rise of new mercantilism and new protectionism.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he was greatly encouraged by the ongoing process
in the region through constant consultations among foreign and
economic ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) as well as with their counterparts from China, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said China, Japan and South Korea and the seven ASEAN
members would attend an inaugural meeting in Kuala Lumpur on the
development of the Mekong basin.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the above three countries have also been invited
for the informal ASEAN leaders' summit in Jakarta in December,
1996.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the setting up of the East Asia Economic Caucus
(EAEC), Mahathir said the United States is still opposing the
loose forum because it does not qualify as a member
geographically.
</P>
<P>
The EAEC was mooted by Malaysia to promote economic cooperation
among countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is currently in Japan for a working visit.

commercial center in China has introduced a social assistance
system focusing on ensuring the minimum daily needs of low-income
residents.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau said
that governments at all levels extended 60 million yuan in
allowances to poor residents in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in June 1993 the city led the country in
introducing what he called the minimum livelihood insurance
system, under which the government provides allowances to local
residents to make sure that their basic daily needs are met.
</P>
<P>
The monthly allowances were raised to 165 yuan per person in
April 1995 from 120 yuan, and were raised again last month to 185
yuan per person, a 12 percent rise, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Last year 8,550 residents living below the poverty line
received such allowances, which totaled 1.46 million yuan a month,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government also provides extra allowances to low-income
people for whom the monthly allowances are still not enough to
meet their basic daily needs.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, some 80,000 people received the extra allowances,
which came to 33 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said, "When a family has a per capita income of less than
250 yuan a month, the family can apply for a grain and cooking oil
card from the government. With the card each person can buy 20
yuan-worth of grain and cooking oil a month."
</P>
<P>
To date, a special fund for poor old citizens totaling four
million yuan has provided allowances to 5,000 such people, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Charity Fund has raised 70 million since its
establishment two years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fund has extended 11 million yuan to poor people by issuing
scholarships, and providing financing to schools as well as
individual allowances, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, service centers in 100 communities provide various
kinds of services, including medical care, to low-income
residents, particularly senior people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lanzhou Opens Wider to Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- This capital of northwest China's
Gansu Province is exerting great efforts to expand economic
co-operation with other provinces and regions, as well as with
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's policy of increasing investment in its central
and western areas plus a growing interest from overseas investors
has prompted the city to improve its investment environment, in a
bid to enliven the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou gives priority to constructing public facilities, such
as railways and highways as well as urban water, heat and power
supplies. It has set up a ground satellite station and raised the
urban telephone handling capacity to 300,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
It also puts more emphasis on improving local government work
and law enforcement, to attract more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The city had absorbed nearly 600 million US dollars-worth of
investment from 34 countries and regions by the end of last year,
ratifying some 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises employing 200,000
people.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Import and Export Group did more than 31 million US
dollars-worth of foreign trade last year. And the city has become
one of the country's important bases for exporting 10 types of
industrial goods, including pharmaceuticals, woollen blankets,
measuring and cutting tools, ferrosilicon, and other silicon and
textile products.
</P>
<P>
It also exchanges information with some 100 domestic cities and
regions, and has signed more than 1,000 economic co-operative
projects with other provinces and regions, involving nearly nine
billion yuan in contractual investment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Army Retakes Rebel Heartland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan armed forces have
recaptured the whole of Jaffna peninsula, the heartland of Tamil
rebels, after three major military operations since last October,
the Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
In the three operations code-named Riviresa (Sunray) I, II and
III, the combined forces have taken full control of the peninsula
including its exits and entrances to the mainland at the strategic
Pooneryn and Kilali points.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula, situated at the northern most of Sri Lanka (396
kilometers from the capital city of Colombo) with an area of 2,500
square kilometers, has a population of 900,000 people,
predominantly Tamils who are descendants of South Indian settlers.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have
reportedly retreated into jungle hideouts in the peninsula and at
Kilinochchi and Mulativu on the mainland after the government
operations.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 civilians who were forced by the rebels to leave
their homes in the peninsula during the military push are now
streaming back to their homes, Defense Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government has launched a massive rehabilitation program to
rebuild the devastated infrastructure and re-establish civil
administration in the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The victories of the armed forces, which have brought the
peninsula under the government control after 13 years of war, are
considered as a major triumph for the People's Alliance government
of President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a 13-year war with the government,
with the peninsula as the base for a separate state. Over 50,000
people have reportedly been killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
During the period, several attempts were made to bring about a
settlement through dialogue, but each time the LTTE reneged on
cease-fires and cessation of hostilities and went back to battle.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga's main plank in both the general
elections in August 1994 and the presidential elections in
November that year was to re-establish peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Having won the elections, she initiated four rounds of peace
talks with the LTTE after establishing a cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels unilaterally called off the cease-fire and
resorted to arms once again in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga then decided to separate the Tamil community from
the militants to win local people's hearts and minds for the
establishment of peace.
</P>
<P>
Last August, she came up with a peace package of devolution to
set up a Union of Regions and grant a quite high degree of
autonomy to the regions. At the same time she decided to continue
with the military option to defeat the LTTE forces on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
Now Government troops have been successful with the recapture
of the entire Jaffna peninsula and at least the temporary routing
of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
But Kumaratunga's political package has hit several snags.
While the Tamils are happy with the extent of autonomy they will
enjoy under the package, sections of the country's majority
Sinhala community, including the powerful Buddhist clergy, are
against it.
</P>
<P>
In any event, the president would need a two-third majority in
parliament to see the package through, which she is most unlikely
to obtain, having only a wafer-thin majority at present.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the LTTE has rejected the political package and it
insists that the package can never be implemented without its
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
The government troops, although now controlling the entire
Jaffna peninsula, still have to fight the LTTE for a long time to
go, as the rebels will continue their guerrilla warfare.

<HEADLINE> Hariri to Visit Vatican to Seek Pope's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri is scheduled to leave here today to start an official
visit to the Vatican to seek a moral support of the Holy See for
his country.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will meet Pope John Paul II in the Vatican for the
second time this year and the third since the Lebanese prime
minister took his office in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Lebanese billionaire premier said that
his visit is aimed at consulting with the Pope on the Lebanese
situation in light of recent Israeli blitz on south Lebanon which
claimed more than 160 civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will also ask the Pope's moral support for Lebanon in
its political steps in implementing the April 26 cease-fire
understanding with Israel, which ended 16 days of Israeli
military strikes in south Lebanon and according to which a
five-nation monitoring committee and an international consultative
committee should be set up.
</P>
<P>
The visit to the Vatican is part of Hariri's tour of world
countries to rally political and economic support for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister returned home Thursday night from
his official visit to Belgium and the United Arab Emirates and
his private visit to France.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels Tuesday, Hariri told foreign ministers of the
15-nation European Union that Lebanon needed 1 billion
U.S. dollars a year over the next five years to rebuild the
war-devastated country.
</P>
<P>
During his private visit to Paris, Hariri held a meeting in
Chamber Elysee with French President Jacques Chirac. Hariri paid
an official visit to France last month to seek international
pressures on Israel for the cease-fire when the Israeli aggression
in south Lebanon reached the climax.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan,
president of the UAE, in Abu Dhabi Thursday, Hariri announced
that the president was "very sympathetic with us and
understanding the Lebanese problems and has expressed his
readiness for the assistance."
</P>
<P>
On his way home, the lebanese prime minister made a stopover in
Damascus to meet with Syrian Vice-President Abdul Halim
Khaddam. No details of the talks were available.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Party Leader Prods State Trade Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Communist Party leader Do
Muoi urged the country's lack-luster state-run trading firms to
spruce up in five years, to secure an edge over their domestic
competitors and prepare Vietnam for participation in international
trade organisations.
</P>
<P>
The party general secretary criticized these firms for failing
to make profit or cater to the public interest and the national
economy, saying that they are no longer a dominant force
influencing market behavior.
</P>
<P>
Competition, which is taking place daily at an intensifying
speed, will decide who will be the final winner between the
state-run and private sectors, he warned at a conference here on
Wednesday, according to the English "Vietnam News" today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's state-owned trading network has been losing ground to
private dealers since it was weaned from yearly subsidies when the
country began moving towards a market-oriented economy in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Some of the companies have gone bankrupt or been mergered,
leaving others to brave against the growing menace from their
private rivals.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it was time for the state-run trading
businesses to return to their traditional markets through closer
co-ordination with major domestic producers to stabilize the
supply of goods.
</P>
<P>
Besides, employees should also learn market expertise to
conform their activities to international practice.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the state-run trading network should become a major
player in the market so that it could guide other traders toward
socialist-oriented market activities and contribute much to the
modernization and industrialization of the country, he concluded.

DHAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Miseries in the tornado-hit
Bangladesh are mounting as diarrhea is now attacking the disaster
areas, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>

A severe tornado lashed Bangladesh's northern district of
Tangail Monday afternoon, killing at least 520 people and injuring
nearly 10,000 others. Thousands of houses and standing crops were
destroyed.

The reports said many of the survivors are now under the attack
of diarrheal diseases for want of clean drinking water as several
tubewells were uprooted during the calamity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the miseries of the survivors, who are spending days

<HEADLINE> Third Front Determined to Oust BJP Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- In pursuit of their declared
objective of dislodging the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
government on the floor of the parliament, the third front
consisting of 14 smaller parties have taken measures to keep their
flock together.
</P>
<P>
To keep a vigil against any desertions from the loosely-knit
third front, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has
decided to stay put in Delhi till "the BJP is defeated". The
president has asked the BJP government to prove majority in the
parliament by May 31.
</P>
<P>
All the MPs of the third front combination have been summoned
to be in the capital on May 18 and they will be addressed by the
front's prime ministerial candidate D. Gowda the following day.
The MPs might be flown out of the capital and lodged in far away
Kodaikanal in Tamil Nadu on Friday to prevent them from crossing
over to the BJP in the run-up to  the Lok Sabha (lower house)
session next week.
</P>
<P>
It is reliably learnt that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister
Chandrababu Naidu has taken the initiative in this regard. Two
chartered planes are understood to have been acquired for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Spokesman V.N. Dadgil has said that the Congress
would vote against the BJP government in the confidence motion and
would extend unconditional support to the third front.

<HEADLINE> BJP Government Facing Challenges Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
government formed here on Thursday is facing serious challenges
ahead.
</P>
<P>
India's Lok Sabha (lower house) has 543 elective seats. In the
534 seats declared so far during the 11th Lok Sabha general
elections from April 27 to may 7, the BJP only secured 160 seats,
far from a clear majority in the house. The BJP does not quite
have the mandate to govern the country on its own.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its limited strength in the Lok Sabha, the regional
and social concentration of its support base and its divisive
slogans have also contributed to some anxiety about political
stability and social harmony. Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and his
party must address these issues with sensitivity if they want to
win over any support from the third front, politicians here said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to winning the confidence of other like-minded or
friendly parties, the prime minister should utilize the next
fortnight to acquire a realistic understanding of the problems
facing the country and the economy. As a minority prime minister
keen to secure a majority in parliament, Vajpayee must go out of
his way to arrive at a consensus policy framework on the basis of
which other political parties will be able to extend their support
to him. He will be under pressure from the more doctrinaire and
conservative members of his party to stick rigidly to the party
line and give up power rather than compromise on basics, they
said.

WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rain poured in many U.S.
states while flash floods soaked West Virginia and Northern
California on Thursday, killing one person, rendering hundreds to
seek shelters.
</P>
<P>
Storms that dumped up to 3.5 inches on southern West Virginia
forced about 750 people to abandon their homes, closed schools and
knocked out power to about 4,300 residents.
</P>
<P>
A Cable News Network report said that Governor Gaston Caperton
declared a state of emergency in eight counties.
</P>
<P>
The overnight storm also led to flash floods in Northern
California. More than 300 people were evacuated when rain and wind
tore off a roof in San Jose, south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
About 21,400 people lost power in the storm, which poured 1.67
inches of rain on Sacramento, California, breaking a 104-year-old
record for the day of 1.16 inches.
</P>
<P>
Storms also hit the Midwest and some northeast states of the
country. Heavy rain poured in southern Michigan, northern Indiana

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Aprroves Republican's 1997 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
today approved Republican's budget-balancing plan of fiscal 1997,
etching sharp election-year contrasts with Democratic President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
By a roll call of 226-195, the Republican-controlled U.S. House
approved fiscal 1997's spending plan with a near party-line vote.
The plan promises to balance the budget by the year 2002, trim
taxes by 124 billion dollars and squeeze 700 billion in savings
from Medicare, welfare and other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the U.S. Congress propose for 158 billion
dollars in six-year savings from Medicare, 72 billion from
Medicaid, 70 billion from welfare and the earned income tax credit
for the working poor, and about 300 billion from annually approved
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate debated a similar plan but proposed a long list
of amendments.
</P>
<P>
The proposed savings are less than what the Republicans had
sought during last year's budget talks with the government. But
they are still more than the amount of savings the government
wants. Clinton has proposed in his 1997 budget plan to cut 118
billion dollars for Medicare, 54 billion for Medicaid, 41 billion
for welfare and 218 billion for annual domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
The congressional budget does not require the president's
assent. But it is a nonbinding guide for future tax and spending
bills which would surely become a center-piece in the future
budget negotiation between Congress and the government.
</P>
<P>
The arguments echoed the 16-month-long battle the two sides
fought over fiscal 1996 spending plans, highlighted by Clinton's
veto of the GOP budget-balancing package and two partial
government shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
Democrats in the U.S. Congress countered that Clinton's
deficit-cutting package proved that the budget can be balanced
without weakening crucial programs.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate leaders, White House budget chief Alice
Rivlin warned, "While the administration and Congress share the
goal of a balanced budget, we have grave concerns about the
approach contained in this resolution."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government and Congress began election year's
budget fight much closer numerically than a year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUXOR, Egypt, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
left Luxor, an ancient Egyptian capital, this morning, winding up
his five-day state visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit, Jiang sent a message to his
Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak to express his sincere thanks
to Mubarak and the Egyptian people for their hospitability and
considerate arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The message said that during this short but fruitful visit,
the Egyptian people's friendship with the Chinese people gave
him a deep and unforgettable impression.
</P>
<P>
"We have witnessed the glory civilization created by the
Egyptian people and the great achievements in building their
country," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely wish that the people of your country, under the
leadership of President Mubarak, will make greater achievements,
and that the friendly relations and cooperation between China and
Egypt will further increase," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Jiang had held talks with Mubarak on

in the economic, labor training and cultural fields during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, the first Chinese president ever to visit Egypt since
1989, had briefed Egyptian leaders on China's economic situation
and reform.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also visited The 10th of Ramadan Industrial City,
some 50 kilometers east of Cairo, and the ancient Egyptian
capital of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Luxor, some 670 kilometers south of Cairo, contains the
largest collection of temples and tombs from the Pharaonic era.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was seen off at the Luxor Airport by Luxor Mayor
Mahammed Youssef and Egyptian Education Minister Hussein Bahaa
Eddine who accompanied Jiang during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Yang Fuchang also bid farewell to Jiang and
his entourage at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's entourage includes Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen, Special Assistant Zeng Qinghong, Minister of Public
Security Tao Siju and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the third leg of Jiang's six-nation African tour
which has already taken him to Kenya and Ethiopia. He will also
visit Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Commemorates Late Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Nepal
(UML), the country's main opposition, held a mass meeting here
Thursday, commemorating its late leader Madan Bhandari and vowing
to bring down the present government in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of UML workers and supporters gathered in downtown
Kathmandu to pay tributes to late UML General Secretary Bhandari,
who was killed in a mysterious road accident three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when the jeep that Bhandari and another
leader of the UML were riding rolled down into a river near a
highway in western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
UML leaders have alleged that the 1993 jeep accident was a
conspiracy masterminded by those who did not want to see the rise
of the Communist movement in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
However, an investigation panel formed by the then Nepali
Congress (NC) government concluded that the accident was caused by
the driver's negligence.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who survived the accident, was later sentenced to
20 years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, UML President Man Mohan Ad Ikari
accused the ruling coalition government of not functioning
properly and vowed to topple down the NC-led government within
constitutional norms in the forthcoming House session before
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
He said the UML has launched a national awareness campaign in
the nearly 4,000 villages of the country to help the people judge
the performance of political parties.
</P>
<P>
A grand mass rally had been organized prior to Thursday's mass
meeting, which organizers described as a display of "people's
power."

<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- No reports have been received on
violations of a regulation banning smoking in public places in
this Chinese capital since the regulation took effect May 15.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 calls have been received by a "Ban-Smoking" hotline in
the past two days, with 50 percent of the calls asking how to quit
smoking.
</P>
<P>
All the callers, some of them heavy smokers, said that they
understood and supported the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Some of the callers suggested that the number of public places
where smoking is banned be expanded.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Beijing Daily" reported that since the implementation
of the regulation a large number of local work units have also
worked out internal rules restricting smoking and stipulated
penalties for offenders.
</P>
<P>
To enforce the regulation and fine offenders, a small army of
more than 80,000 people has been dispatched to department stores,
hospitals, schools, railway stations and other public places in
Beijing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dominican Presidential Election Going Smoothly: OAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The presidential election in the
Dominican Republic has gone smoothly and efficiently and voters
should be praised for their behavior and patience, Cesar Gaviria,
General Secretary of the Organization of American States (OAS)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria is heading a 24-strong OAS group of observers, part of
a team of more than 180 international observers, in what is being
seen as the most closely monitored election in the history of the
tiny Caribbean nation of 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
The election is being held two years earlier than scheduled
after opposition forces demanded incumbent President Joaquin
Balaguer's mandate be cut from four to two years following
accusations of his involvement in electoral fraud during the 1994
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Balaguer has opposed the presence of international observers,
claiming it is an interference in the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
But pressure from the international community has forced the
government of the tiny island to accept their presence. But
observers are being denied access to computer centers.
</P>
<P>
Balaguer, who has been president seven times since he first
came into power in 1966, has been banned from standing for
re-election and is backing millionaire businessman Jacinto
Peynado, vice-president of his government and the candidate of his
ruling Social Christian Reformista Party.
</P>
<P>
But pre-election polls have shown little support for Peynado,
with most support going for Pena Gomez from the opposition
Dominican Revolutionary Party and Balaguer's main opponent in the
1994 election.
</P>
<P>
Even so, some observers say Gomez may not get enough votes for
an outright majority of 50 percent of the ballots which means a
second round stand-off between the two strongest candidates,
likely to be Gomez and 43-year-old lawyer Leonel Fernandez of the
Dominical Liberation Party (PLD).
</P>
<P>
Some 3.75 million people are registered to vote in the
election.

<HEADLINE> EU Praises Bulgaria for Nuclear Safety Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today praised
Bulgaria for shutting down an ageing nuclear reactor for safety
tests and promised a multi-million U.S.-dollar energy aid package
in return.
</P>
<P>
"The move bolsters confidence in Bulgaria's nuclear safety," EU
Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek, in charge of central and eastern
European affairs, said in a letter to Bulgarian Prime Minister
Zhan Videnov released today.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency earlier reported that the
first reactor of the country's sole nuclear power plant, Kozlodui,
started its 48-hour countdown to full shutdown on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian experts and their German and Russian counterparts
will study samples collected from the reactor's metal cover to
assess its safety and performance.
</P>
<P>
But EU Ambassador to Sofia Tomas O'Salvan told reporters today
that Bulgarian experts will have the final say in the joint safety
test and the Bulgarian Committee for the Peaceful Use of Atomic
Energy will decided the reactor's fate.
</P>
<P>
The EU has pledged aid of one million ECU (1.2 million
U.S. dollars) for the tests and another five million (6.2 million
dollars) for a Bulgarian thermo-electric power plant to purchase
coal, O'Salvan said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Kozlodui plant, located near the Danube River
in northwestern Bulgaria and the largest in the Balkans, has six
generating sets with a total capacity of about 3.8 million
kilowatts, or half Bulgaria's annual electricity production.
</P>
<P>
The first reactor began working in 1974 and Bulgaria said
previous tests had showed it could work on safely until the year
2006.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria also hopes for a 160 million ECU (about 2 million
dollars) loan from the EU for modernization of the plant's fifth
and sixth reactors, and talks are underway.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have expressed concern over safety at a
considerable number of nuclear power plants in eastern Europe and
the former Soviet republics, which were built with Soviet
technology now widely considered outdated by current international
standards.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven major industrialized countries has forced
Ukraine to agree to close down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
by the year 2000 unless it can be modernized. Chernobyl was the
site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986 when one of
its reactors exploded, unleashing deadly radioactive fallout
across Europe.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Competition Features Ecuadoran Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran presidential candidates
are expected to compete fiercely for presidency in the first round
of elections on May 19, a poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated that none of the nine candidates is likely
to win the constitution-required outright majority of votes in the
first round. So they will vie hard for entry into the second
scheduled for July 7.
</P>
<P>
The nine candidates do not include incumbent President Sixto
Duran Ballen as the country's constitution bans a president from
re-election.
</P>
<P>
They represent more than 10 political parties and some
independent movements.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 25 years, the independent movements will
participate again in the general elections after the amendment to
the Political Constitution was made in August, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The first four are likely to enter the second round while the
rest have no chance of doing so, the poll added.
</P>
<P>
The four favorites are the Social Christian Party candidate
Jaime Nebot Saadi, the Popular Democracy-Christian Democratic
Union candidate Rodrigo Paz Delgado, the Plurinational Unity
Movement Pachakutik New Country candidate Freddy Ehlers Zurita and
the Ecuadoran Roldosista Party candidate Abdala Bucaram.
</P>
<P>
The nine candidates share viewpoints in many aspects. They all
promise to fight corruption, to eliminate poverty, to lower the
unemployment rate, to raise living standards and to guarantee
social security.
</P>
<P>
On the long-standing border dispute with Peru, the candidates
propose to resolve the problem by means of negotiations, and to
establish a good neighborly relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also want to further strengthen the economic ties with the
United States, its biggest trading partner, the European Union and
other Pacific Rim countries.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Electoral Court said that the elections will also
produce a vice-president, 82 deputies to the Congress, 21 province
governors, 27 mayors, as well as a great number of municipality
councilmen, from among 20,000 candidates.

<HEADLINE> Central American Ministers Discuss Labor Migration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Labor ministers from Central
American nations and the Dominican Republic are meeting for talks
on the problems of labor migration in the region.
</P>
<P>
More than two million migrants, many illegal, move between
countries in the region in search of work and better living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
But with little regulation, many migrants take on illegal work,
often with inferior working conditions, thus affecting a country's
labor market.
</P>
<P>
The ministers aim to promote orderly migration, and ways of
controlling labor movement according to the economic needs of each
nation.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Labor Minister Farid Ayales said there are more
than 200,000 Nicaraguan laborers in Costa Rica mostly working in
agriculture and domestic service, making up almost 15 percent of
the economically active population.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting's opening ceremony, Costa Rican Acting
President Rebeca Tryspan said that the illegal migrant work force
is hitting the country's labor market as they accept working
conditions inferior to those laid down by Costa Rican law.
</P>
<P>
But Nicaraguan Labor Minister Francisco Rosales warned against
xenophobia and advocated a free movement of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
Rosales said the migration should be regulated to prevent
illegal work and abusive labor contracts, two problems that affect
his country's relations with Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also discuss Costa Rica's introduction of
the "seasonal labor card" to regulate the presence of Nicaraguan
workers.
</P>
<P>
The labor ministers will issue a final communique on Friday at
the end of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Yavlinsky Rejects Yeltsin Election Overture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin met rival
contender Grigory Yavlinsky again today, amid a heated race for
the Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
During their 90-minute meeting, the second in two weeks,
Yeltsin and Yavlinsky discussed the political and economic
situation in the country, Yavlinsky's reformist Yabloko faction in
parliament and its presidential race activities, Yeltsin's
spokesman Sergei Medvedev said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal, reformist Yabloko
movement, is currently running third in the presidential race,
behind Yeltsin and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is facing a strong challenge from Zyuganov in the
June 16 election, has been trying to persuade Yavlinsky and two
other candidates in his election coalition, retired General
Alexander Lebed and eye-surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov, to give up
their bid for the presidency and support him.
</P>
<P>
But Yavlinsky told the NTV television company after the meeting
that he would not withdraw from the presidential race as Yeltsin
had not offered him the post of Russian Prime Minister in
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin first held talks with Yavlinsky earlier this
month. The reformer reportedly called on the president to change
his current economic policy, end the Chechen war and radically
reshuffle the government.
</P>
<P>
Although Yavlinsky hasn't ruled out completely throwing his
support behind Yeltsin, he has so far refused to join because of
policy differences with the president.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Yeltsin acknowledged the need for a
peaceful solution to the Chechen problem through trilateral
talks, in which federal officials, the Moscow-backed Chechen
government and Chechen rebel separatists would participate,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Kremlin said the two men also discussed
Yavlinsky's election platform, which was given to Yeltsin at their
first meeting earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin singled out the points in his own program which are
similar to those in Yavlinsky's and discussed a proposal by
Fyodorov to set up a coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Latin America to Develop Tourism Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries will
make efforts to promote tourism to meet with more challenges and
opportunities in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In the five-day meeting of the 39th Confederation of Tourism
Organizations of Latin America (COTAL), which ended here this
afternoon, the Latin American countries discussed the development
of tourism, air transportation and travel agencies in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Latin American tourism ministers also met here
during the meeting and issued a statement to accelerate the
development of tourism in the continent with joint actions between
official organizations and the private sector of tourism.
</P>
<P>
A campaign of corporate promotion with a strategic
commercialization of Latin America as a destination is needed, one
that could give it a solid presence in the main markets of the
world, according to a statement released at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It adds that if the Latin American countries are effectively
integrated, they can promote the production of tourists' souvenirs
and create better opportunities and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
COTAL should be the adequate environment for joining the public
and private sectors at a continental level, the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Alvaro de la Espriella, a Colombian, was
elected as president of the COTAL directive council for the
1996-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The 40th COTAL Congress will be held at Havana, Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks German Support For Extraditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is expected to urge Germany to
extradite members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) who
have been trying to rally support among Kurds in Germany for its
10-year separatist war in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who arrived in Bonn today
on a three-day visit, is expected to raise the issue during talks
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a ban on its activities, the PKK has been involved
in a number of violent demonstrations in Germany this year in
which dozens of people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz is also expected to seek Bonn's support for its bid to
join the European Union, with which it signed a tariff agreement
in January as part of moves for closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He is also looking for German support for the implementation of
a customs union between Turkey and the EU which is reportedly
being blocked by Greece because of the strained relations between
the two neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Albania Forbids Cigarette Selling to Teenagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government has banned
selling cigarettes to youngsters under the age of 18 as part of
efforts to regulate the cigarette market.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which were made public today, provide that no
cigarettes or tobacco products are allowed to be sold in
kindergardens, primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette retailers must apply for licenses from local tax
bureaux and mark "Cigarette", "Tobacco Products" and "Smoking Is
Detrimental to Health" on their shingles in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to restrict its cigarettes import
and levy special taxes on cigarettes and wines, in order to fight
the increasingly serious smuggling of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Any violators of the above regulations would face a fine
between 20,000 to 40,000 Leks (200 to 400 U.S. dollars) with all
their commodities confiscated.

<HEADLINE> State Curbs Illicit Wildlife Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- To protect wild fauna and flora,
China will take more strict measures to curb illegal international
trade in these commodities and secure special care for them in the
process of import and export, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Large volumes of illegal trade have been brought under control
by customs authorities, but illegal border trade is still rampant,
especially on the Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Thai borders, said Fan
Zhiyong, an official with the Endangered Species Import and Export
Managing Office under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The office is drafting regulations expected to be approved by
the State Council late this year or early next year to co-ordinate
and strengthen the work of customs and wildlife protection
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Export and import of wildlife require further co-operation
among the organizations, said Fan.
</P>
<P>
In February, the office issued a circular requiring licenses in
the export and import of live wild fauna and flora.
</P>
<P>
The circular also designated more than 90 temporary and
permanent reservation centers, zoos and research bases across the
country to accept and raise confiscated illegally traded wildlife.
</P>
<P>
To meet the high demand for care of live wildlife in their
transportation, the office and the Civil Aviation Administration of
China co-issued the circular demanding to stop the transportation
that may cause damages to the imported or exported live wild fauna
and flora.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Chief Dies From "Self-Inflicted" Gunshot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Chief of Naval Operations
Adm. Jeremy Boorda died Thursday apparently from a
"self-inflicted" gunshot wound, the Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
Boorda went to his quarters at the Navy Yard in southeast
Washington during lunch and was discovered later with a gunshot
wound in the chest outside the residence, officials said.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to Washington D.C. General Hospital and died in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to local news reports, Rear Adm. Kendell Pease, the
Navy's top public affairs officer, was with Boorda about an hour
before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Pease said Boorda was to have met with Newsweek's bureau chief
in his Pentagon office in the afternoon to discuss questions about
his Vietnam combat medals. The magazine was investigating whether
Boorda had worn a combat "V" decoration that he was never
officially awarded.
</P>
<P>
Pease said that when he told Boorda, at noon, what the subject
of the interview was, the admiral abruptly announced he was going
home for lunch instead of eating the meal that had been brought to
his office, the United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Newsweek Editor Maynard Parker said the
magazine "had not reached any conclusions" about the medal
controversy.
</P>
<P>
Learning the news, President Bill Clinton said Boorda's death
is "a great loss not just for the Navy, and our armed forces, but
our entire country."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who appointed Boorda as Chief of Naval Operations in
March 1994, lauded the senior officer for his energy, dedication,
good humor, and praised his role in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry described Boorda as a "sailor's
sailor."
</P>
<P>
Boorda, 56, was the first enlisted sailor in the history of the
Navy to rise to its top position. He received his fourth star in
November 1991 and the following month, became commander in chief
of the Allied forces/Southern Europe in Naples, Italy, and
commander in chief of U.S. naval forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In this capacity he was in command of all NATO forces engaged
in operations in the former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Quicker Handling of Foreign Garbage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- An official with a joint
investigatory group set up to handle the imported garbage case
today said, "Our basic task is to handle the case seriously and as
quickly as possible and stand firm on sending the waste back to
the US."
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the group fully understands the case, they
will look into its international implications via diplomatic
channels and make formal presentations to the US government and
some of its departments.
</P>
<P>
The official said that it is an immoral act for the US to ship
such waste to China.
</P>
<P>
China ratified the Basel Treaty, which bans the export of urban
waste, he said, but the US has not ratified the treaty. Still it
should not allow such waste to be shipped to other countries,
according to international practices.
</P>
<P>
He stated that some questions in the case have been clarified,
and may involve criminal behavior. This is a very serious
incident, he said, and because of that, the judicial department
will have to be involved.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this case will be dealt with by administrative
and legal means and that those who were involved in the case will
be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
At present, the case has aroused widespread concern, and the
joint group will make every effort to provide people with a
satisfactory answer, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member group are now in the city from which the waste
was moved to Beijing in September after they came from Long Beach,
California, for an in-depth probe of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denies Deadline for Agreement With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina today denied a report that there is a deadline for signing
a cooperation agreement with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The agreement is to be very different from those signed by the
EU and other Latin American countries, given the characteristics
of the present society in the Caribbean island, Robaina told the
Cuban news agency Prensa Latina.
</P>
<P>
For the agreement, "we have not had a deadline and we are not
using it for propaganda or for electoral purposes, because we have
said that such a dialogue would be long and difficult," added
Robaina.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is the only Latin American country that has no
collaboration agreement with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban minister said that Cuba advocates a dialogue, but not
a monologue with the EU, and political and ideological differences
should never hamper the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Cuba appreciates the EU's willingness to maintain links with
Cuba and its rejection of the U.S. measures to harden the trade
embargo against the island, Robaina stressed.
</P>
<P>
Havana hopes to maintain the dialogue focusing on better
understandings on the respective political and ideological
criteria, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban minister pointed out that his country is interested
in the process to negotiate a cooperation agreement with the EU
and sees it with an open mind in relation to a schedule and with
the expectation of a happy end.

<HEADLINE> No Sale of Australian Subs to Taiwan: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Minister for Defense
Ian McLachlan has ruled out the possibility of sales of submarines
to Taiwan, The Australian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a trip to the Australia Submarine Corporation in Adelaide,
South Australia Thursday, he said that if Taiwan approached the
Australian government to buy submarines, such an approach "would
not be welcomed."
</P>
<P>
He denied that the coalition government had received any
indication from Taiwan to buy the Australian-built Collins-class
submarines.
</P>
<P>
The previous Labor government under former Prime Minister Paul
Keating rejected Taiwan's last bid to buy Australian submarines in
1994 because of the potential damage to trade relations with
China, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Submarine Corporation has been contracted by the
Defense Department to build six conventionally powered Collins
class submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. The total value
of the contract was 5 billion Australian dollars (4 billion US
dollars).

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- WBC champion Mike Tyson will go
ahead for his scheduled bout against WBA champion Bruce Seldon on
July 13 as an agreement was reached among all parties concerned,
promoter Don King said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All the parties "have reached an agreement for Mike Tyson to
fight Bruce Seldon July 13 at the MGM Grand, whereby Lennox Lewis
is assured of a WBC heavyweight title opportunity," King said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the promoters for Lewis declined to confirm the agreement,
saying they were waiting for words from lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Early, the Briton filed a suit claiming he was the right choice
for a WBC title bout, which the World Boxing Council later awarded
to Tyson after his release from the prison.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Tyson won the WBC title by flooring Frank Bruno on
March 16 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled on Monday to uphold an
early restraining order that prevented Tyson from fighting anyone
other than Lewis until the lawsuit was settled.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic and
his Romanian counterpart, Ion Iliescu, signed here today an
agreement on friendship, good-neighborly relations and cooperation
between the two countries for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was formally signed after a three-hour talk
between the two presidents, which was marked by a cordial and
friendly atmosphere, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Jovan Zebic and Romanian Foreign
Minister Teodor Malescanu also signed today an agreement on
avoiding double taxation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu arrived here today for a three-day official visit to
Yugoslavia, a traditional ally of Romania.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Lilic and Iliescu said that the
agreement on friendship "marked the beginning of a new phase in
developing good-neighborly relations" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreements "rounds off a series of
agreements and contracts signed over the period, which creates
conditions for a restoration of economic ties and establishing of
higher forms of cooperation between the two neighbors," Lilic
said.
</P>
<P>
He described the economies of the two countries as
complementary, which creates possibilities for a much greater and
more successful economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believed that the strengthening of economic ties is
a precondition for other forms of cooperation, and they stressed
the importance of strengthening regional cooperation and
good-neighborly relations with all states, the Yugoslav president
said.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian president stressed the political importance of the
talks and the agreements, which naturally strengthen the good
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The (friendship) agreement comes as a confirmation of the
friendly relations and solidarity which characterize the relations
between the two neighboring countries," Iliescu said, adding that
it has created possibilities for further strengthening of economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Meets NATO Chiefs on Bosnia Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks here today with visiting NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana and NATO Commander-in-Chief George Joulwan
over issues concerning the consolidation of peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian presidential office said in a statement that the
talks had dealt with activities aimed at restoring stability and
eliminating hotbeds of confrontations and hostilities in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Both Milosevic and the NATO guests voiced the belief that the
process of comprehensive normalization of life and freedom of
movement in Bosnia would be sped up, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They also showed concerns over the sacking of the Bosnian Serb
premier by the hardline leader Radovan Karadzic Wednesday, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Karadzic dismissed pro-peace Prime
Minister Rajko Kasagic from office on the ground that the
premier's policy had "endangered the Serb national interest." But
the ouster met strong opposition from both Kasagic and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Solana told reporters that he had conveyed a
message to Serbian President Milosevic in regard to current
developments in Bosnia, namely the power struggle in the Bosnian
Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here later today from Banja Luka, the Serb
city in northwestern Bosnia, said work should proceed in the right
direction so that the positive trend in the implementation of the
Dayton accords was maintained.
</P>
<P>
In Banja Luka, Solana told reporters after meeting Kasagic that
the international community would continue to contact Kasagic and
support his moderate policy in dealing with NATO and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Since the Dayton agreement was struck last November, the
international community has refused to deal with Karadzic, who has
been twice indicted as a war criminal suspect by the international
war crimes tribunal in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> New York City's Subway Service Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, May 16 (Xinhua) -- New York City's subway service is
keeping improving after 20 years of wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
The average distance subway cars go between breakdowns
increased to 58,000 miles last year from 8,000 in 1984 when the
system was near collapse.
</P>
<P>
And Transit Authority records show the subway fleet set a new
high in March, traveling 70,000 miles without a breakdown for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, a breakdown often meant a derailment, a fire, a
burned-out motor or door that would not open -- the obvious sports
of things that make subway travel miserable.
</P>
<P>
Today, those problems are far less common.
</P>
<P>
As it has grown older, the fleet has continued to perform
better.
</P>
<P>
Transit officials attributed past improvements to vastly
improved maintenance shops, many of which were built or overhauled
in the last decade; to more rigorous routine maintenance, and to
better management of maintenance workers.
</P>
<P>
What is more important, the Transit Authority spent billions of
dollars replacing fundmental parts of the system. It junked
40-year-old cars, rebuilt 4,000 others and bought 1,700 new ones.

major assembly plant in Southeast Asia, which will need 1 billion
U.S. dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
The project is the initial step for the leading U.S. motor
company to gain 10 percent of the entire vehicle market in Asia by
2005, according to a report of the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that GM's share currently is just 5 percent in a
region dominated by Japanese auto makers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company already has smaller plants in Indonesia and
Taiwan that assemble vehicles for imported kits, and it has an
initial agreement with the Chinese government to build a factory
to assemble midsize cars in Shanghai, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said GM was impressed by the greater maturity of the
Thai market in comparison with that of the Philippines. It also
has a higher per-capita income and a higher rate of growth than
the Philippines, it added.

<HEADLINE> Germany Supports Yugoslavia's Reintegration Into World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said here today that his visit has paved the way for a
further integration of Yugoslavia into the international
community.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic
and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Kinkel said Germany
supports Yugoslavia's effort to rejoin the international community
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Germany is ready to strengthen economic cooperation with
Yugoslavia and improve bilateral ties, Kinkel told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will not support any separatist tendency
inside Yugoslavia, referring apparently to the aspirations of
ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and
Metohija. There is a strong tendency among the Albanians in Kosovo
to separate from the country, but the independent bid has been
suppressed by the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
The talks with President Milosevic and Foreign Minister
Milutinovic had focused on the implementation of the Dayton
agreement so far, the German minister said, adding that it was
essential that both civilian and military aspects of the peace
agreement be successfully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also discussed with his hosts the dismissal of Bosnian
Serb Premier Rajko Kasagic by the hardline Serb President Radovan
Karadzic. Both Germany and Yugoslavia are against such move to
undermine the peace process in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
After the one-day official visit to Yugoslavia, Kinkel left
Belgrade for home this evening.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia: Bosnian Serb Premier's Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia said the decision to dismiss the legally
elected Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic was "illegal and
undemocratic, and consequently unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"The decision was taken without usual parliamentary procedure
and without a vote in the Serb parliament," the Yugoslav
Information Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who was indicted as
war criminal by the international war crimes tribunal, sacked his
premier Rajko Kasagic Wednesday because Kasagic's policy and
cooperation with international community had "endangered the
interests of the Serb people and the nation."
</P>
<P>
But Kasagic announced today that he rejected the decision by
Karadzic and would continue staying in office until a new
government is elected.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav government underlines that the Dayton peace
agreement has paved the way for negotiations and for a just and
lasting settlement of the Bosnia crisis. The agreement is fully
supported by the international community and protects the
interests of the Serb side," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
This was why the decision must be nullified and Serb parliament
members must be enabled to state their views in a democratic
procedure," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Central America Oppose Measures Against Open Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada and six Central American
countries today expressed opposition to the unilateral imposition
of measures that affect third countries which contradict the
international accepted rules of open trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and leaders of Nicaragua,
Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Belize said in a
joint communique issued this afternoon that they "expressed their
firm opposition to the unilateral imposition of any measures that
affect third countries which contradict the internationally
accepted practices, principles and rules of open trade and
investment."
</P>
<P>
"Such impositions create uncertainty and instability for the
international investment regime and trading environment," stressed
the communique, signed by Chretien and the six Central American
leaders who are here on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, Chretien and the Central American leaders also
"underlined the fundamental right of sovereign states to pursue trade
and economic links with countries of their choice."
</P>
<P>
They were obviously directing these remarks to the United States,
especially to its new anti-Cuban law, known as the Helms-Burton bill.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law purports to extend the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to
the operations of foreign companies and business people who invest in
Cuba. They could be sued in U.S. courts for "trafficking" in property
confiscated by the Cuban government from those who fled to the U.S.
and become U.S. citizens.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Central America Pledge to Eliminate Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada and six Central American
countries today pledged themselves to support the total
elimination of mines in the Central American region, which were
one of the most lethal legacies of the past hostilities.
</P>
<P>
This pledge was made in a joint communique released after the
meeting today between Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and
leaders of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Belize, who are here on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"While the leaders recognized that Central America has made
important advances in attaining peace, reconciliation and
development, the leaders noted that one of the most lethal
legacies of these past hostilities was the continued presence of
thousands of anti-personnel mines which continue to take the lives
of innocent civilians and impede social and economic development
in the mined areas," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the leaders "pledge to support a resolution at the OAS
(Organization of American States) General Assembly in June calling
for the total elimination of these devices," it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they also agreed to support those
international agreements on the prohibition of the manufacturing
and marketing of mines.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian prime minister reiterated his support for the
demining efforts that are presently being undertaken in the region
and stated his government's determination to assist in the Central
American demining program, the communique said.

"We are greatly indebted to China for the very substantial,
military, political and diplomatic support that we got during our
struggle for freedom and independence," the president told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We would be very happy to show the president of China that this
is the country we liberated, these are the people we also gave
freedom and independence to," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a country you can rely upon for formidable lasting

<HEADLINE> Canada, Central America Say No to Exterritorial Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada has enlisted the support of
Central America in its fight against the U.S. Helms-Burton
legislation, which tries to extend U.S. court jurisdiction to
foreign business operations in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien held discussions here
this morning with leaders of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Costa Rica and Belize, who are here on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the media after the discussions, Chretien said that he
and the six leaders discussed among other things "the problem of
the Helms-Burton legislation" and agreed that they will make joint
efforts in fighting against the U.S. use of exterritorial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
"We...come to the conclusion that we are to make sure that no
country use exterritorial legislation that affects the sovereignty
of other nations," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"Laws of different countries must be respected," echoed
President Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua, who is the chairwoman of
the Central American leaders delegation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S law, known as the Helms-Burton bill, purports to extend
the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to the operations of foreign
companies and business people who invest in Cuba. They could be
sued in U.S. courts for "trafficking" in property confiscated by
the Cuban government from those who fled to the U.S. and become
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, foreigners who "traffic" in confiscated property
-- and members of their families -- could be barred entry to the
United States. It is supposed to come into effect on August 1.
</P>
<P>
Canada has opposed the bill vehemently before and after it was
adopted by the U.S. congress and signed by President Bill Clinton
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
In its fight against the bill, Canada has been joined by Mexico
and the European Union, who have accused the U.S. of violating the
North American Free Trade Agreement and the very principles of the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bill also incurred opposition from Central America and
other American nations, who are opposed to any imposition of the
laws and policies of one country upon another.
