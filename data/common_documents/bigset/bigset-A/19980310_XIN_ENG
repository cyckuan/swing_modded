<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Respond to China's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan compatriots feel
disappointed at Taiwan Authorities' failure to respond to
President Jiang Zemin's appeal for holding cross-straits political
negotiations at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Yang Guoqing, president of the
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, who is attending the
Ninth National People's Congress in session here since last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The key factor to developing relations across the Taiwan
straits is to officially put an end to the state of hostility in
accordance with the principle that there is only one China and
hold political negotiations at an early date, he said.
</P>
<P>
All previous economic and business routine talks have been
halted by political issues, which worried Taiwan compatriots, said
the 62-year-old, Taiwan-born Yang, who came to China in the
capacity of a Chinese with Taiwan origin residing in Japan in
1953.
</P>
<P>
Yang's view was shared by other NPC deputies of Taiwan origin.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yiming, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the
Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that he, too, was
disappointed at the lack of sincerity by Taiwan authorities on
bilateral political negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Yang said, "I understand the feelings of Taiwan compatriots
who are longing for stability and peace. The principle of "One
country, two systems" is the best option for the solution of
Taiwan issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Taiwan authorities to take into account the
reiteration made by Premier Li Peng in his government report to
the NPC current session.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Albania Sign Protocol to Fight Border Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Albania signed here
Monday a protocol to strengthen the two countries' cooperation in
combating the increasing border crimes.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, signed by Greek Merchant Marine Minister Stavros
Soumakis and Albanian Interior Minister Neritan Ceka who is
accompanying President Rexhep Mejdani to visit Greece, provides
for joint patrols by the border police and Greek harbour police
corps for the more effective policing of the two countries' sea
borders.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries are expected to sign an
educational cooperation agreement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the cooperation protocol came after Mejdani
discussed with his Greek counterpart Costis Stephanopoulos the
rights of 300,000 ethnic Greeks living in southern Albania and the
growing tension in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians comprise 90 percent of the nearly two million
population.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both sides stressed the need of broadening
their relations in all sectors and of seeking peaceful solution to
the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani promised that his country would respect the ethnic
Greek minority's rights in accordance with international
standards.
</P>
<P>
For Greece, it allowed last year a large number of Albanian
illegal immigrants to register and work there.

<HEADLINE> McLaren Not to Be Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The McLaren team will not be
punished by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) over the
way Dave Coulthard allowed his teammate Mika Hakkinen to overtake
him and win Sunday's Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
FIA's decision on Monday followed a formal complaint by
organisers of the Australian race, according to the FIA.
</P>
<P>
The FIA said in a statement that "team orders" specifying the
finishing order of drivers within a team had existed in motor
sport since the beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
It would therefore not be right to criticise or sanction
Mclaren for what it did at Sunday's grand prix, said the
statement.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Donates 50,000 Tons of Grain to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea announced Monday that it
will donate 50,000 tons of grain, worth about 10 million
U.S. dollars, to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to the World Food Program's
appeal for food aid of 378.2 million dollars this year to the
DPRK, which has suffered food shortages because of droughts and
floods in past years.
</P>
<P>
Seoul had extended 5.2 million dollars to the DPRK last year
out of its promised 10 million dollars' aid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean National Red Cross is expected to
propose this week inter-Korean Red Cross talks to discuss food
donations by the private sector, whose provision of grain could
amount to 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Unification Kang In-duck said Monday that
Seoul will continue to donate aid to the DPRK through the Red
Cross and international relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
But with government-to-government food aid, massive aid would
have to be preceded by inter-Korean talks, he said.

MOSCOW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has for the first
time become the leading investor in Russia, Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said before departing for his U.S. visit,
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said his four-day visit will mainly deal with
economic issues. He is expected to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Vice President Albert Gore and attend the 10th session
of the Russian-U.S. Commission for Economic and Trade Cooperation,
said the Itar-Tass news agency.

The Russian premier said the trade volume between the two
countries stood at about eight billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also denied again that Russia had transferred
missile or nuclear technologies to Iran or to any other country.
</P>

"Russia has not transferred and shall not transfer (either
missile or nuclear technologies) anything to Iran or other
countries," the prime minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic development,
Congress President Sitaram Kesri Monday announced his decision to
resign as the Congress president.
</P>
<P>
He said in a press conference here he said he had taken the
step in view of the developments in the past two months. "Have you
not seen how things took shape during the last two months? No man
with self-respect could tolerate this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last two months has seen frequent references by the party's
star campaigner and widow of former Prime Minister Sonia Gandhi
that the party " needed a right leadership to make it strong and
vibrant".
</P>
<P>
He made a veiled attack on Sonia Gandhi at the press
conference, but he did not elaborate on it. He said that he would
convene a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the
highest policy-making body of the party, Tuesday to decide the
date for the election of the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP)
and he made it clear that he was not a candidate for the CPP
leadership.
</P>
<P>
83-year-old Kesri was elected the Congress president on June 9
last year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Begins Inquiry into Cause of Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain began to investigate the
causes of mad cow disease on Monday, one of the worst public
health scandals in the country.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister jack Cunningham ordered Lord Justice
Nicholas Phillips to head the inquiry into mad cow disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
Phillips has promised that there will be no witch-hunt and that
the aim is not to find fault, but to see what can be learned from
previous errors.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely important inquiry. Many people have been
affected, some tragically, by BSE and Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease
(CJD, the human equivalent). I hope this inquiry will reveal
events and decisions which led to the spread of these diseases,"
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would also ask Prime Minister Tony Blair for an
extra six months to consider the evidence. The inquiry is
currently due to report by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The first case of BSE was found in November 1986 but the
British government did not officially announce BSE's existense
until March 1996. So far 24 cases of new-strain CJD have been
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The costs of the investigation, including a website which will
carry daily transcripts and witnesses' submissions, are estimated
at 10 million pounds (16 million U.S. dollars).

BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz on Monday commended Arab world's popular and official
position toward his country which suffers from the seven-year-old
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with a visiting Yemeni delegation, Aziz described
as important and positive Arabs' support to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni delegation is led by member of Yemeni Consultative
Council and head of Red Crescent Society Saeed al-Hakeemi, the

medicine to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz praised Yemen's support of Iraq's demands for lifting the
embargo imposed on its people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed the sanctions on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
For his part, al-Hakeemi expressed happiness that Iraq did
succeed to resolve the recent crisis with the United Nations over
weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people is brave and has endured so much, said
al-Hakeemi, stressing that all Arab countries are with Iraqi
people, he said.

Al-Hakeemi called for the immediate and comprehensive lifting
of the embargo imposed on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> BIS: Asia Crisis By-Passes Some Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Currencies in Latin American and
East European countries in the fourth quarter of 1997 were little
affected by the Asia economic crisis, a bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Basle-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also
said that equity indices in North America and Europe rapidly
recouped their losses.
</P>
<P>
The risk premium on Latin American and Eastern European
countries' foreign currency securities quickly retreated from
their late October peak, according to the BIS.
</P>
<P>
The subdued pace of securities issues in the second half of the
quarter reflected borrowers' willingness to delay issue in
anticipation of improved conditions as much as outright rationing
by international investors, the BIS said.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that this view was supported by the fact that
issues launched by highly rated borrowers found a very favorable
market reception.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of improvements in external financial indicators
in many of these countries, the BIS believed that questions could
be raised over lessons drawn from the recent events.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
is due here on March 15 on a visit to forge closer links with
Egypt, the Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cook's three-day stay in Egypt falls within a tour of the
region aimed at projecting a bigger British profile in the
Arab countries as the current chairman of the rotating EU
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Britain and these states already
exceeded 12 billion sterlings (20.04 billion U.S. dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
Cook will arrange and set an exact date for the visit by
British Prime Minister Tony Blair to the Mideast next month, a
move seemingly designed to plaster over the fault line perceived
in London's relations with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Hot on the heels of the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspection,
Britain and the U.S. have been much criticized throughout the Arab
world for applying double-standard approach to issues of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Britain's resolve to vitalize its relations with Arabs
manifests itself in the speech delivered by Cook in London
recently before a meeting of the Arab-British Friendship
Society.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, he stressed Britain's unshakable desire to
cultivate an Arab-British partnership, particularly in light of
the deeply-rooted relations between the two sides and the
strategic importance of the Middle East region.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urged to Help End Kosovo Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Albanian President Rexhep
Mejdani on Monday urged neighboring Greece to help defuse the
growing tension in Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The tension in Kosovo would pose "a serious threat" to peace in
the Balkan region, Mejdani said after meeting his Greek
counterpart, Costis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), should play its
role in helping to seek a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani, who arrived here Monday for three days, was on his
first official visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece has reiterated that the Kosovo issue should be resolved
through dialogue, with respect for the rights of ethnic Albanians
and the unity and sovereignty of the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
In January, Greece offered to host a meeting between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of the ethnic Albanians,
Ibrahim Rugova, and Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano to help
settle their problems.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was an autonomous province that formed part of Serbia
until 1989 when Serbian authorities revoked the autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Violence in Kosovo has been growing this year following the
non-implementation of an education agreement reached between
Milosevic and Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
Tension heightened there after a Serbian police patrol and
local ethnic Albanians engaged in fierce cross-fire that killed
four policemen and 16 Albanians on February 28.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Five deputies to the on-going
Ninth National People's Congress gave a general picture of China's
rural economic growth and grass-roots work at a press conference
held here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junxian, a Communist Party secretary in Nongan County, a
grain producer in northeast China's Jilin Province, said his
county has reaped good grain harvests for years thanks to Party's
rural policies and favorable geological conditions there.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he said, the county earned 5.5 billion yuan (663
million US dollars) from agricultural production, 20.1 times the
figure for 1978, and reaped in 1.97 million tons of grain, 3.8
times the 1978 figure. Farmers' per-capita annual income rose to
2,600 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianzhi, a Party secretary from a mountainous area in
Shandong Province, said local people have become no longer needy
by growing vegetable, which have been sold to 29 Chinese provinces
and six countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local farmers elected a village managing committee
which serve them wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
He Qiongying, a municipal Party secretary from east China's
Shandong Province, said it is essential to implement to the letter
the state's relevant policies on easing the farmers' burden, and
that anyone who violates the policies will be punished.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Lawmakers Have Unanimous Views on Major Issues (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending the
first session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature, have shown astonishing unanimity in their
views on a series of major issues concerning the country's past
and future development in the session's first stage.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five days, nearly 3,000 NPC deputies from 34
delegations have examined a government work report by incumbent
Premier Li Peng, China's draft development plan and budgets for
1998 and a bold government restructuring plan submitted by the
State Council, the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Since this NPC session will elect a new central
government, lawmakers have mainly focused their attention on the
accomplishments of the current government and relevant experience
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
While sharing a feeling of satisfaction about China's
achievements in the past five years, they generally agreed to Li's
summarization of the experience for these years' development,
which they said will provide significant guidance for China's
future development.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts describe the current NPC session as another
major attempt of the country since the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) last September to
comprehensively review its development path and experience.
</P>
<P>
They note that since the session will translate the guidelines
of the 15th CPC National Congress into a state will, it's of
great significance to the attainment of China's development goals
at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers noted that after two decades of reforms and
opening to the outside world, top Chinese decision-makers have
gained more accurate knowledge of China's national conditions, and
have handled complicated relations between reforms, development
and stability fairly well.
</P>
<P>
The ability of China's collective central leadership to
maintain an excellent command of the overall situation under
complicated circumstances is a key factor for all successes of the
past years, and also a reliable guarantee for the country's future
development, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In their group discussions, legislators also voiced their
approval for targets and tasks for China's economic and social
development this year put forth by the premier in his report.
</P>
<P>
Most of them believe that the goal of an eight percent economic
growth is realistic and attainable, but not easy to reach.
</P>
<P>
Under the impact of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, a
practical option for the Chinese government in its attempt to
stimulate economic growth is to expand domestic demand through an
appropriate increase of investment, the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
However, they suggested that the government should continue to
maintain a relatively-tight fiscal and monetary policy, pay
special attention to the prevention of redundant construction, and
inject the bulk of its investment in key sectors like
communications, environmental protection, infrastructure
development, industries supported by high and new technologies,
and housing.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also noted that with reforms, especially the
reform of state-owned enterprises, entering a critical stage, it's
very important for the government to cautiously handle various
social conflicts and strive to eliminate hidden dangers in the
national economy, particularly in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that a major characteristic of the current NPC
session, convened at a time when profound changes are taking place
in China's economic and social structures, is that both senior
officials and lawmakers from grassroots units have shown greater
concerns about the interests of the general public.
</P>
<P>
They noted that issues like re-employment of laid-off workers
and reducing farmers' economic burdens have been frequently
mentioned in speeches of central government leaders during their
panel discussions with local delegations of NPC deputies.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Lawmakers Have Unanimous Views on Major Issues (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Council plan of institutional restructuring has
become another major topic in the legislators' discussions these
days.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers have used words like "long-expected",
"inevitable", "practical" and "realistic" to express their
appreciation of this plan, which will kick off the largest
government reform since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
They generally believe that this plan, which has responded to
the urgent need of a socialist market economic system, will be
approved by the current NPC session without any difficulty.
</P>
<P>
But they expressed the hope that the plan, once adopted, would
be carried out earnestly and smoothly to ensure a success.
</P>
<P>
Most legislators pointed out that the "bottleneck" for China's
state enterprise reform at present is the re-employment of
laid-off workers and an early establishment of a social security
system.
</P>
<P>
They said that once these difficulties are overcome, reform of
state enterprises can be pushed forward smoothly.
</P>
<P>
There are also quite a few lawmakers who stressed the
importance of sustainable development and raised proposals on the
protection of the environment and resources.
</P>
<P>
Starting tomorrow afternoon, the NPC session will enter its
second phase, when deputies will focus on hearing and examining
work reports by the NPC Standing Committee, the Supreme People's
Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Some Congress leaders Monday
welcomed Sitaram Kesri's decision to resign as the party
president.
</P>
<P>
It was definitely good for the future of the party. It was also
a clear indication that he wanted to hand over the reins of the
party to the "younger generation", said party senior leader Sharad
Pawar.
</P>
<P>
Kesri's decision to quit showed that Congress leaders can
always rise to the occasion, said another senior party leader G.
Nabi Azad.
</P>
<P>
It was time for Sonia Gandhi to take over the presidentship of
the Congress, party leader G. Vyas said.
</P>
<P>
83-year-old Kesri was elected the Congress President on June 9
last year following the resignation of P. V. Narasimha Rao.

<HEADLINE> More Firms Liquidated in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 132 companies in
different sectors of the economy in Zimbabwe have either been
liquidated, placed under judicial management or declared
insolvent during the past 14 months due to a harsh economic
climate, a business information and service provider said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Dun and Bradstreet Company, Fernando
Aleixo told the Zimbabwe News Agency that last year alone, 92
firms were liquidated, eight placed under judicial management and
16 declared insolvent.
</P>
<P>
Aleixo said that this year 14 companies have been liquidated
and two declared insolvent.
</P>
<P>
The sectors most affected were clothing, engineering,
hospitality, construction, manufacturing, and trade and commerce
which had seen 83 companies collapsing, leaving thousands of
people without jobs.
</P>
<P>
" The general business outlook for 1998 is not good, we expect
more companies to liquidate than in 1997,'' Aleixo said.
</P>
<P>
''The reasons why companies are liquidating are high interest
rates, depreciation of the Zimbabwean Dollar, inflation, bad
management and competition.''

<HEADLINE> UK Beef Consumption Increases by 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The British people have gained more
confidence on their own beef by consuming nine percent more beef
than last year, according to a government report published on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the Agriculture Ministry's National Food
Survey, said the increase, to 110 grams per person a week, showed
it was back in line with the declining long-term tread.
</P>
<P>
The amount of beef eaten by Britons has been in decline for
more than a decade, and in 1996 the consumption plunged by 17
percent compared to the previous year after the government warned
that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) could be transmitted
to humans in the form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
So far, 23 Britons have contracted the new form of CJD which
scientists studying mad cow disease have identified.
</P>
<P>
British exports of beef have been banned by the European Union
for almost two years, dealing a heavy blow to British beef
industry and cow breeding.

<HEADLINE> Two More Banks Increase Lending Rates in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Two more commercial banks in
Zimbabwe Monday announced increases in minimum lending rates as a
result of the prevailing market conditions and tight money market
rates.
</P>
<P>
The increases in lending rates by 1.5 percent to 35 percent by
First Banking Corporation and Barclays Bank Zimbabwe follows the
same move by Standard Chartered and Stanbic last week as
instability that has been gripping the money market since the end
of 1997 continues, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our minimum lending rate has been increased by 1.5 percent to
35 percent per annum with effect from March 1, 1998. Deposits
rates have also been adjusted," said First Banking Corporation in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "The rate increase is in response to
prevailing market conditions and reflects a general tightening in
money market rates."
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks last hiked minimum lending rates by three
percentage points to 33.5 percent last December following a three
percentage point increase in the rediscount rate by the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the hikes in lending rates to the current
high cost of money on the market caused by the shortage of cash
created by the Central Bank to control money supply growth.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Determined to Revamp Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Tourism Henry
Kesgey has said that the government had made great efforts to
ensure tourists' security in a bid to revamp the country's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Sunday when he met with the
Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (WTO),
Francesco Frangialli in Berlin, Germany, the Kenya News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that effective machinery had been put in
place to enhance the security of tourists visiting the East
African country.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the recent murder of a British tourist in
Kenya was an isolated and unfortunate criminal act which was
being pursued in the court of law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kenyan government was urgently addressing the
extensive road damages caused by the El Nino phenomenon over the
past four months.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, WTO secretary-general lauded the efforts made
by the Kenyan government to enhance tourists security in the
country and noted that security was the key to successful tourism
promotion campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister is on a tour to European countries
including Germany, Italy, France, Britain and Sweden to market
Kenya as one of Africa's best destinations for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Kosegey said late last month that his ministry would
aggressively market Kenya and improve its image abroad in the
world, especially in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tourism, the country's number one foreign exchange
earner, is undergoing "the worst times since independence in
1963" with tourists visiting the country decreasing from 850,000
in 1994 to about 600,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the decline of the country's tourism
mainly to the uncollected rubbish everywhere, badly damaged
roads, insecurity and violence, and water and power shortages.

<HEADLINE> Sitaram Kesri Resigns as Congress President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic development,
Congress President Sitaram Kesri Monday announced his decision to
resign as the Congress president.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, he said that he had taken
the step in view of the developments in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
"Have you not seen how things took shape during the last two
months? No man with self-respect could tolerate this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last two months has seen frequent references by the party's
star campaigner and widow of former Prime Minister Sonia Gandhi
that the party "needed a right leadership to make it strong and
vibrant."
</P>
<P>
Kesri made a veiled attack on Sonia Gandhi at the press
conference, but he did not elaborate on it.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would convene a meeting of the Congress Working
Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the party,
Tuesday to decide the date for the election of the Congress
Parliamentary Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he was not a candidate for the CPP
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Congress leaders welcomed Sitaram Kesri's
decision to resign as the party president.
</P>
<P>
It was definitely good for the future of the party. It was also

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African government has
allocated 50 million Rand (about 10 million U.S. dollars) to poverty
relief projects countrywide, the welfare authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi handed out the checks,
part of the special anti-poverty fund announced by the Finance
Ministry last year, to 1,139 projects across the country at a ceremony
in Cape Town Monday, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The checks had been issued directly to the projects instead of
provincial coffers to ensure that within a few days the money would be
in the hands of those projects, Fraser-Moleketi said.
</P>
<P>
The projects would target women and poor communities, especially in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the South African population live below the 301-Rand
(61 dollar) poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Exploring Rural Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Lanqing, vice-premier of the
State Council, stressed the importance of exploring the rural
market to expand sales of consumer and capital goods as well as to
meet the need of farmers.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion attended by deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC),in session here since last
Thursday, he said that, while there are huge amounts of surplus
goods held in stock in cities, farmers in the vast countryside do
not have easy access to markets and, when they do have access to
markets, often very few varieties of goods are available there.
</P>
<P>
Neither manufacturing departments nor sales outlets have paid
enough attention to exploring the rural market, said Li, who is
also Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive goods sell well in the countryside as long as they
meet farmers' needs, and manufacturers of such goods can have good
economic returns, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Modern commercial businesses including chain stores should
also establish their presence in the vast countryside," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also urged accelerated development of markets
for second-hand goods in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says No Decision on Re-entry to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Sinn Fein leader said Monday his
party would not decide whether to return to the Northern Ireland
peace talks until after a meeting later this week with Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republic Army(IRA), said at a press conference in Belfast
that "Mr Blair has agreed to meet Sinn Fein. As soon as that
meeting takes place and we have had the opportunity to express our
concerns... then Sinn Fein will be in a position to judge how and
when we re-enter the talks process."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was suspended from the talks two weeks ago until
Monday because of the alleged involvement of IRA guerrillas in two
killings in Northern Ireland last month.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has requested such a meeting with Blair on the crisis
and the Downing Street has expressed readiness to meet with Adams
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the damage the suspension had done to confidence in
the talks process was being underestimated, according to BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
The other political parties in the peace talks resumed
negotiations in Belfast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments have set a deadline in May
for the parties to come up with a settlement in the dispute over
British rule of Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament in Hot Debate on Removing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Following heated debate,
Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Monday demanded Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai to decide whether to remove the gravesite of
Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslims four years ago in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Temper flared at the meeting of the Knesset Interior Committee
as leftwing and righwing lawmakers differed sharply over the issue
of removing Goldstein's tomb in the Kiryat Arba settlement
adjacent Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Jewish extremist Goldstein gunned down 29 Muslim prayers
inside the Tomb of Patriarchs (Ibrahim Mosque called by Arabs)
in February, 1994. He was killed by other Muslim prayers and
late buried in Kiryat Arba. His gravesite has since been
turned into a pilgrim site for Jewish extremists, who provoked
the Arab anger by holding memorials at the site every year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli peace movement Peace Now and leftist politicians have
been calling for the removal of Goldstein's tomb from Kiryat
Arba, a move strongly opposed by Jewish settlers and rightwing
politicians.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leftist party Meretz's lawmaker Ran Cohen has
tabled a bill to the Knesset demanding for the relocation of
Goldstein's gravesite. At the meeting, Cohen said it is a
disgrace to the State of Israel that Goldstein's gravesite
remains there ever since the Hebron Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Communist Hadash Party's lawmaker Ahmed Saad also came out in
support to Cohen's position, saying that Goldstein's gravesite
should be removed to a new garbage dump in the Negev desert.
</P>
<P>
But Benny Elon, of the extremist rightwing Moledet Party,
counter-charged the leftist politicians for exploiting the issue
to attempt to uproot the Jewish communities in Hebron and Kiryat
Arba. But even he admitted that Goldstein was a murderer whose
tomb should not be turned into a pilgrim place.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Halpert, lawmaker of the the rightwing religious party
United Torah Judaism, joined Elon in opposing the removal of
Goldstein's gravesite citing the Jewish religious laws.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Salah Tarif, of the opposition Labor Party,
finally ruled that the issue would be handed over to the defense
minister to decide by the end of next week the fate of Goldstein's
tomb. Tarif himself also believed that Goldstein's tomb must be
removed to bring an end to the lingering controversy over the
issue.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Governments to Stop Sending Asylum-Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) has urged European governments to stop sending
rejected asylum-seekers from Kosovo back to the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR statement released here on Monday came in the wake of an
upsurge in violence in Kosovo which left dozens of people dead.
</P>
<P>
"Given the current situation in Kosovo, UNHCR urges governments to
suspend the return of rejected asylum-seekers from Kosovo on
humanitarian grounds," said Dennis McNamara, UNHCR's Director of
International Protection.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians whose asylum applications have been rejected
should not be sent back until the situation in the province returns to
stability, UNHCR said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
European countries have regularly returned rejected asylum-seekers
to Yugoslavia, according to UNHCR. The overwhelming majority of
asylum-seekers from Yugoslavia are ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Until now, UNHCR has not objected to Kosovo Albanians being sent
back, as long as their asylum claims have been thoroughly reviewed.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR estimates that there are currently more than 150,000 people,
mostly Kosovo Albanians, who are in line for return, based on
bilateral agreements between countries of asylum and Belgrade
authorities.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, UNHCR expressed alarm about the recent upsurge in
violence in Kosovo, urging all concerned to make every effort to
prevent a further escalation which could trigger new waves of
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges to Advance Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (WEST BANK), March 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Jordanian
Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal Monday called on both Israeli and
Palestinian leaders to advance the peace talks as the
Iraqi-U.N. crisis over arms inspection has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Hassan
told reporters that since so much have been achieved in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, it is important for both sides
to continue it.
</P>
<P>
He said the peaceful resolution of the Iraqi crisis indicates
that the Israeli-Palestinian dispute could also be settled under
the auspices of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Hassan stressed that the related parties should act in
accordance with the international legitimacy and implement the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the agreement signed with Israel is not a
bilateral agreement, but an international agreement, calling on
the international community to make further efforts to advance the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been deadlocked for a
year. The Palestinians have repeatedly accused Israel of
deliberately hindering the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel is insisting that the pullback from the West
Bank, a key factor in the peace process, was contingent on the
implementation of the Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that obstacles do remain in the negotiations with
Israel, but it is important to overcome the obstacles and keep the
stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's trip in the Palestinian self-rule area came after
Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon's visit to
Amman Sunday night, which improved the strained relations between
Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The relations were strained by a failed assassination attempt
by two agents of Israeli secret service Mossad of a Hamas (Islamic
Resistance Movement) leader in Amman last September.
</P>
<P>
Hassan will also meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday in Tel-Aviv to discuss ways of pushing forward
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Earth Tremor Hits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.2 on
the Richter Scale hit Cyprus Monday afternoon, but no injuries or
damages were reported, according to Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Kyriacos Solomis of the Geological Survey
Department as saying that the quake occurred shortly after 1300
local time (1100 GMT), with the epicenter pinpointed at some 230
kilometers northwest of Paphos, in the sea area between Cyprus and
the Greek island of Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
The tremor lasted about ten seconds.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 an earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale hit
the island. Around 50 people were slightly injured and many houses
in Limassol and Paphos were damaged.
</P>
<P>
A total of 67 people were killed in earthquakes in the past 100
years in Cyprus, which is situated in the second major seismic
zone in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Police S. Lebanon If Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. peacekeeping forces are
ready to carry out their due responsibilities in south Lebanon if
Israel withdraws from the region, the forces' spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Timor Goksel, spokesman of the 5,400-strong U.N. Interim Force
in South Lebanon (UNIFIL), made the remarks when meeting with the
southern commander of Hezbollah resistance movement Sheikh Nabil
Kawou.
</P>
<P>
Goksel said that the U.N. forces have not been officially
informed about the Israeli conditional offer to pull out from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that it is willing to withdraw from south
Lebanon if the Lebanese government agrees its security
arrangements, including disarming Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has been spearheading the
guerrilla's resistance against Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern areas from
cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kawou said that Israel wants to avoid further losses and is not
interested in withdrawing from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his party will continue to fight the Israeli
occupying forces, adding that the resistance movement will not be
affected by the Israeli maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL was established in March 1978 after Israeli first
invasion of Lebanon. But the forces have been unable to fulfill its
mission of bringing peace to southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Ready to Meet Turkish Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
is willing to meet Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash if
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan extends an invitation to the
leaders of the two communities in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides was speaking to
reporters here Monday after a meeting between Clerides and
visiting U.S. State Department Cyprus Coordinator Tom Miller.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the Cypriot government is prepared to discuss
the substance of the Cyprus problem in order to reach a
comprehensive solution.
</P>
<P>
"We have the good will to work toward a settlement with
determination and seriousness," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides disclosed that Miller reiterated the
U.S. administration's determination to step up its efforts to
settle the Cyprus question within the framework of the
U.N. initiative.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government's decision to purchase the
Russian-made surface-to-air missile system S-300 was brought up
at the meeting between Clerides and Miller.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is now understood that the S-300s are part and
parcel of the substance of the Cyprus question and the Republic's
security.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed an agreement to purchase the S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles from Russia early last year, and the missiles are due to
arrive on the island later this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision was criticized by the U.S. and some other western
countries, and Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if
they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
But the Cypriot government has reiterated that the deal could
be canceled if President Clerides' proposal for demilitarization
of the island is realized, or the bicommunal peace talks make
progress.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that ways to overcome obstacles in efforts to
solve the Cyprus problem were also discussed at the
meeting. "There are many ways to back the U.N. efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two Cypriot communities' leaders held two rounds of
U.N.-sponsored peace talks last summer, which ended in failure due
to Denktash's refusal for further talks because of the European
Union (EU)'s decision to start accession negotiations with the
Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Last week Denktash sent a letter to Clerides in which he
essentially rejected an agreement between the two sides, which was
reached over 20 years ago, to establish a federation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his long-standing demand for recognition of
his breakaway Republic unilaterally established in 1983 in
northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides returned the letter as it was totally unacceptable in
terms of substance and ethics.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Urges Political Dialogue on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the Contact
Group on former Yugoslavia ended the one-day emergency meeting on
Kosovo here Monday, calling on the Yugoslav government and ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo to resolve their disputes through peaceful
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook condemned both the Serbian security
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army for their violent actions,
which have killed at least 80 people.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the authorities in Belgrade to investigate the
very serious allegations of extrajudicial killings. If these
accusations are borne out we expect the Yugoslav government to
punish those responsible," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Under the final statement of the meeting, the Contact Group,
comprising the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy, adopted the following punishment measures:
</P>
<P>
-- request the U.N. Security Council to consider "a
comprehensive arms embargo" against both the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY) and its Kosovo region;
</P>
<P>
-- refusal to supply equipment to the FRY which might be used
for internal repression;
</P>
<P>
-- Denial of visas for Senior FRY government officials
responsible for repression actions in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
-- Moratorium on government financed credit support for trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian delegation at first rejected all the
suggestions, but later agreed to accept the first two measures
after Cook having an urgent telephone conversation with Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who did not attend the London
meeting himself.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group ministers, which have decided to meet again
on March 25 to assess the response of the Yugoslav government,
also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights and the Organization for Security and Cooperation on Europe
to send separate missions to the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides left here Monday for Athens for talks with Greek Premier
Costas Simitis on the Cyprus problem and Cyprus' accession course
toward European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Clerides told reporters here that he
leaves for Athens at the invitation of the Greek premier to
exchange views on some issues.
</P>
<P>
"During our discussions, we shall exchange views on the
substance of the Cyprus problem as well as on our accession
course," he added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "all matters pertaining to these two issues
will be discussed."
</P>

This is Clerides' first visit to Athens since he was re-elected
in February's presidential elections.
</P>

<HEADLINE> About 5.3 Percent of Zambians Under 13 Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian senior official revealed
here Monday that about 5.3 percent of Zambians by the age of 13 years
are regular smokers, Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chairing a national conference on tobacco or health, Nelson
Magolo, Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health,
said that studies show that 39 percent of Zambian men smoke
cigarettes while seven percent of women smoke.
</P>
<P>
And the consumption among the youth is alarming and has extended
to substances like industrial glue, aviation oil, petrol and bio-gas
from sewage, according to Magolo.
</P>
<P>
The effect of smoking on the young, said Magolo, include
addiction, lung diseases, cancer and low intellectual development
which reduces them to resistance to infection.
</P>
<P>
Magolo lamented that the cost to health care and
family looking after chronically ill patients is overburdening to a
developing country like Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has no explict policy on tobacco, it has
made available legislation to control tobacco use in the country,
said Magolo.
</P>
<P>
Zambia enacted a statutory instrument in 1992 which compels
tobacco manufacturers to label cigarette packets with a health
warning and stipulates that smoking in public places is banned and
sale of cigarettes to children is restricted.
</P>
<P>
The law also restricts cigarettes advertising in both electronic
and print media, said Magolo.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Set up Soup Kitchens in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food Program
(WFP) will set up soup kitchens in war-ravaged Sierra Leone to feed
the neediest people, a report reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Conakry at the weekend, WFP Representative Patrick
uckley said an initial 5,000 - 6000 people have been targeted as the
most needy, but added that the situation around the southern and eastern
towns of Bo and Kenema remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
The soup kitchens will be set over the next few weeks in capital
Freetown, with some food-for-work schemes, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Buckley admitted that a general distribution of food is widely
expected, but said the WFP will not do that.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said WFP expects the shortage of food for the general
public to be solved by commercial supplies, which will resume as
normalcy returns.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of aid food arrived in Freetown in mid-February,
when the West Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG drove the military
junta of Johnny Koromah out from capital.
</P>
<P>
Buckley said food shipment will now spread to the interior and will
continue for at least three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
Complaining that "security is still the main problem", Buckley said
a U.N. team would travel to Bo to assess the security situation there.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's elected president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who has been
in exile in Guinea since being ousted by Koromah's coup last May, will
return to Freetown Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Urges Russia to Give Up Idea of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Latvian Foreign Ministry Monday
warned Russia not to apply economic sanctions against Latvia, the
Interfax news service reported.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to influence Latvia by economic sanctions will draw a
negative response from the European Union countries and other
partner states," Latvian Foreign Ministry's secretary Maris
Riekstinsh said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the statement of Russian presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky who stated last Saturday that
Moscow could limit trade with Latvia over the recent violation of
the rights of Russian-speakers in the Baltic state.
</P>
<P>
Riekstinsh Monday met with the EU ambassadors accredited in
Riga to brief them on the Latvian government's stance over the
scuffles with police during the picket on March 3.
</P>
<P>
According to the Latvian Foreign Ministry's press-center, the
ministry's posture rests on a Foreign Minister's report which said
that police acted in strict compliance with republican laws and
official instructions.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Latvia's Foreign Ministry is likely to
present a note to Russia's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday on the
incident of March 3.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Belarus Sign 4 Documents on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Belarus Monday signed four
letters of understanding and a joint communique at the end of the
official visit of Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko to
Tehran, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating the letters of understanding, the report
said that the two countries announced readiness in the joint
communique to raise their trade volume five times from 20 million
U.S. dollars at present to 100 million dollars by the end of the
coming Iranian year (to start on March 21).
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here for Syria, Lukashenko said that the
agreements signed during his visit to Tehran were all in
conformity with the international criteria and target no other
country, the Iranian official news agency IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his negotiations with the Iranian officials
focused on promoting trade and economic cooperation between the
two countries, adding that Belarus would support Iranian
interests in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the
eastern European states while Iran in turn would support
Belarussian interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"I declare here that Minsk and Tehran believe in multipolar
world and that international system would be strong when it
remain multipolar," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said that Iran
and Belarus reached agreements on oil and gas and experts of
the two countries would start technical studies.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have the same views concerning some
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also stressed that the accords and close relations
between Iran and Belarus would harm no other country.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko arrived here Friday night for an official visit,
during which he held talks with Khatami and Vice President Hassan
Habibi and met with Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges U.S. to Pay U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday once again called on the United States to clear
its 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Annan, scheduled to pay a one-day visit to Washington on
Wednesday, made the appeal in an article carried in today's New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
He said when he meets with U.S. President Bill Clinton and his
administration officials during his visit, he is to discuss both
the Iraq and debt issues.
</P>
<P>
The doors of the bankrupt U.N. "are kept open only because
other countries in essence provide interest-free loans to cover
largely American-created shortfalls," he said.
</P>
<P>
A cash-starved U.N. can only benefit aggressors, violators of
human rights, drug dealers and international criminals and arms
merchants, while impeding humanitarian work, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he has made a number of reforms, including
a U.N. budget cut and management tightening measures since he
came to office 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
A renewed partnership between the United Nations and the United
States is as much in the interest of the United States as the
United Nations, the Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
"But It has to be paid for," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan met with visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohanned Saeed
al-Sahhaf Monday morning for talks on new UN "oil-for-food"
program and issues concerning the implementation of an UN-Iraqi
agreement on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
No informations were immediately available for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said that the talks addressed an
offer by the UN Security Council to allow Iraq to double its oil
sales to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars for six months.
</P>
<P>
The new program will begin to be carried out when Iraq presents
its detailed plan for the distribution of the oil and food and the
UN chief approves the plan.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for expanding the amount of oil Iraq can sell to
buy food and medicine for its impoverished people was approved by
the Security Council last month.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq says that it cannot meet that target because its oil
industry is in disrepair after more than seven years of sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian MP's Call for Investigating Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 9 (Xinhua) - The speaker of the Tanzanian
National Assembly (parliament) rejected Monday the request by a
group of members of the Assembly to summon the Legal and
Constitution Committee to probe the recent police killing of
unarmed citizens.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of parliament Pius Msekwa said in a statement that
there is no evidence to show that the Constitution was violated
as was accused in the MPs appealing letter and no special
committee can act on a matter which is still in the court.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposed investigation was also limited by
the financial ability of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We all know that national budget now is using cash budget
system which means that the government expenditure is only for
the allocated amount each month," he added.
</P>
<P>
Late last week, MP Idrissa Msabaha, supported by the signature
of his 22 colleagues in parliament requested Pius Msekwa to
investigate the recent acts by the armed police against unarmed
citizens, with some causing deaths in Kigoma, Morogoro,
Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Mbeya and Dar es Salaam regions.
</P>
<P>
He demanded a meeting to be convened before the next
parliamentary session scheduled for April in Dodoma to verify
whether the police killings could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
On February 13, police opened fire on a rioting group near a
downtown mosque in Dar es Salaam, killing two people in the first
bloody and large-scale confrontation between police and citizens
since Tanzania's independence in 1961.
</P>
<P>
In northern Arusha region, police reportedly killed six
suspected bandits also in February.

<P>
In his recent letter to CGC secretary Ayatollah Ahmad Janati,
Karubi said that the country's Elections Law did not authorized
the CGC to approve or reject the qualifications of any candidate
but only empowered the CGC to generally supervise elections in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The CGC's right to approve the qualifications of candidates
came under question after it disqualified several famous left-wing
candidates for the forthcoming Majlis by-elections, including
former minister of heavy industries Behzad Nabavi, a major
supporter of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami in the president
elections last May.
</P>
<P>
Karubi, secretary of the Society of Combatant Clergymen in
Tehran (SCC), said that according to Article 53 of the Elections
Law approved by the Majlis in 1983, the Elections Executive
Commission has the right to approve the qualifications of
candidates while the CGC only has the right to make comment on the
qualifications of those who was rejected.
</P>
<P>
He quoted contexts of the Elections Law to confirm his
remarks, adding that it was the CGC that announced the right for
itself to approve qualifications of candidates in 1991 in an
explanation about the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the left-wing factions launched strong
criticism to the CGC and a students' group the Unity
Consolidation Office (UCO) staged a protest rally a week ago
outside Tehran University, triggering a violent clash with
supporters of a right-wing faction.
</P>
<P>
However, Janati claimed Friday that the elections law passed by
the Majlis empowered the CGC to approve the qualifications of
candidates, adding that any objection to CGC's right should be
discussed in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the accusation that the CGC became an organ of the
right-wing factions, saying that the CGC works were independent
and neutral, free from influence from any factions.
</P>
<P>
So far, top Iranian leaders including President Khatami,
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, kept silence over the issue. But many
observers here believed that the issue would be solved only
through an intervention by the top leaders.

<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- French language will become a compulsory
subject in Nigeria's junior secondary schools next
year, the official News Agency of Nigeria reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of principals and exmination officers at the
weekend in Minna, Professor Dibu Ojerinde, the registrar of the
National Board for Educational Measurement said the decision has been
taken by the National Council of Education.
</P>
<P>
Ojerinde regretted that most students have remained indifferent to
the language, due to the lack of teachers, inadequate textbooks as
well as cultural and religious barriers.
</P>
<P>
The idea of making French as the second official language has been
advocated by Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha, saying that
it is a necessary step to strengthen Nigeria's ties with many of its
French-speaking neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The idea may also has to do with the fact that France has been
taking a more flexible position towards the military government of
Abacha, than many of its west partners.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports on Final Procedures for Inspecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday reported to the United Nations Security Council on
the finalization of procedures for inspecting Presidential sites
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan said the Special Group should comprise
senior diplomats, in the capacity of observers, appointed by the
Secretary-General of the United Nations and expers drawn from the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the number deemed appropriate by
the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM and the Director General of IAEA.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Special Group shall operate under
the established procedures of UNSCOM and the IAEA together with
specific detailed procedures given the special nature of the
Presidential sites, in line with the relevant resolutions of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The report says the functions of the senior diplomats should
be: to observe that the provisions of the Memorandum of
Understanding and the present specific detailed procedures are
being implemented in good faith, to report on any matter they deem
appropriate to the functions of the diplomatic observers.
</P>
<P>
The functions of the experts from UNSCOM and IAEA are: to
determine the need for the performance of mandated tasks within
a Presidential site, to determine the date and time for entry
into the Presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
On the report of inspection of the Presidential sites, Annan
said it should be prepared by the Commissioner of the Special
Group appointed by the Secretary-General and submitted by the
Executive Chairman of UNSCOM to the Security Council through the
Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
Annan said these specific detailed procedures may be revised
from time to time in the light of experience in their implementation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief and the Government of Iraq reached the Memorandum
of Understanding on February 23 which avoided a possible American
military strike against Iraq and ended the standoff between the
United Nations and Iraq over the weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Memorandum, a U.N. Special Group will
be established to address Iraq's legitimate concerns relating to
national security, sovereignty and dignity.

MAPUTO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Mozambican Liberation
Front (Frelimo) has reaffirmed that the local election will be
held in 33 towns across the nation on May 29 as schedule.
</P>
<P>
The reaffirmation was made at a central committee meeting of
the ruling Frelimo which ended here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the meeting said that the

The Mozambican national Election Committee admitted that some
voters' registration books were lost in November and December
last year during the registration, and some who could only reach
their legal voting age after May 29th also registered.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Leoneans Preparing for Kabbah's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The people in Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, are in a festival mood Monday, busy cleaning up to
welcome the return of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah from exile in
neighboring Guinea on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian community in Freetown is particularly happy as
some of them, who are in the city doing business, were seen
singing and dancing along the streets to the center of Freetown,
the British Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Many people fled Freetown after the military junta seized
power through a coup last May 25, ousting the democratically
elected government led by President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Life in Freetown has become very hard since Sierra Leone's
west African neighbors and the United Nations imposed economic
sanctions and arms embargo on the country in a bid to force the
junta to quit office.
</P>
<P>
When dialogue and sanctions failed, the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG launched a military offensive
and dislodged the junta in Freetown in the middle of last month.
</P>
<P>
Things have since turned for the better day by day as the
much-awaited international relief goods began to arrive,
activities returned to government offices, shops, banks which all
closed during the rule of the junta.
</P>
<P>
Fuel, which was under strictly banned from entering Sierra
Leone in the past nine months, began to come back in Freetown
again over the weekend and the main roads from the capital to the
north of the country have been reopened to safe civilian traffic.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Monday quoted oil industry officials as
saying that the current price of diesel was approaching its
pre-coup level in the capital and a ship containing gasoline had
already arrived.
</P>
<P>
Bus fares also dropped by half, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although there are still not much food and drink in Freetown,
local people are said to be in high spirit because the junta has
gone and democracy has come back.
</P>
<P>
While continuing tracing the remnants of the junta forces and
allied rebels, ECOMOG is also beefing up security in Freetown for
Kabbah's return, expectedly in the company of General Sani
Abacha, chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and Nigerian head of state.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that three other west African leaders would be
present at Kabbah's reinstatement ceremony in Freetown Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They are Ghanaian President Lansana Conte, Gambian President
Yayah Jammeh and Liberian President Charles Taylor, who the BBC
said, might not been welcomed by Sierra Leoneans because of his
support to the junta.
</P>
<P>
The presence of ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Couyate and
a U.N. delegation are also expected.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he would
like to go to Freetown to attend the ceremony to celebrate
Kabbah's return personally or send a strong delegation.

<HEADLINE> Khufu Pyramid to Be Closed for Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops)
will be closed to tourists for eight months since April 1 to make
way for interior and exterior repairs, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pyramid of Khufu, the largest of the famous three Great
Pyramids in Giza, Cairo, dating back to the 4th Dynasty (2251-2528
BC), is Egypt's major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Zahi Hawas, director of antiquities for all of Giza, said
damage has been done to the interior of the Khufu Pyramid due to
poor ventilation. Humidity has reached a high level with mounting
numbers of visitors, causing salt crystals to build up on walls of
the inner chambers.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the eight months for repair, the exterior masonry
of the pyramid will be restored, the wooden staircase leading to
the chambers will be renovated, while new lighting, electricity
and ventilation systems will be installed, according to Hawas.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah Ali Gaballah, head of Egypt's antiquities authority,
Monday explained the move as part of an integrated project to
rehabilitate the surrounding Giza Plateau, which hosts the three
Great Pyramids and Sphinx.
</P>
<P>
The closure falls less than a month after the smallest of the
kings' pyramids in Giza, Menkaure, was reopened on March 3 after
18 months of restoration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is building a camel and horse park to
keep camel owners from hawking tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Giza governorate has also built a huge fence to seal off
the antiquities areas from intruders from nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the revamping of the pyramids area, however,
is yet to come. To mark the completion of 10 years of restoration
work on the Sphinx, celebrations are scheduled to take place at
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
There are estimated 6,000 tombs in the pyramids area alone,
only 46 of which are open to the public.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Foreign Minister Begins Week-Long Talks in U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Saeed al-Sahaf Monday began a week of talks here with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other U.N. leaders on the new
U.N. "oil-for-food" program.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf, who is leading a delegation of deputy ministers from
Iraq' oil, trade and health ministries, first met with Annan at
the Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
He then had a meeting with new U.N. Deputy Secretary-General
Louise Frechette of Canada, who will now be in charge of Iraq's
"oil-for-food" program.
</P>
<P>
On February 20, the U.N. Security Council approved a proposal
by Britain and other countries to expand the oil selling level of
Iraq to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars for six months to improve the
growing humanitarian crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is currently allowed to sell only 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other goods
for its impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
The new program cannot begin until a detailed plan is worked
out for distributing goods.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Sahaf's talks with Annan and other U.N.
leaders was to negotiate a better deal for the distribution plan,
Iraqi and U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation is also expected to hold talks with U.N.
leaders on the implementation of a recent agreement between Annan
and the Iraqi leadership on arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, eight Iraqi presidential palaces will be
open to U.N. arms inspectors seeking to determine whether Iraq has
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Annan Monday set rules for the procedure of arms inspections
in the Iraqi presidential palaces.

<HEADLINE> France Satisfied with Contact Group Approach to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- France is satisfied with the
approach adopted by the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia in London on Monday toward the crisis in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
"It is the French approach which has prevailed," said
Gazeau-Secret when she was asked to comment on the outcome of the
meeting of foreign ministers of Britain, France, the United
States, Russia, Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group urged both the Yugoslav government and ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo to resolve their disputes through peaceful
dialogue, and condemned both the Serbian security forces and
"Kosovo Liberation Army" for their violent actions.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman praised the member countries of the Contact
Group for preserving their unity, because the endorsement of the
whole text of measures by Russia "gives more weight to the
message sent to (Yugoslav President) Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
She said that the measures taken by the Contact Group are
balanced because they let Belgrade "clearly catch a glimpse of "
the perspective of its reintegration into the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also praised the Contact Group for condemning
terrorism and calling on countries concerned not to support
terrorism through arms supply.
</P>
<P>
"There is a unanimity of the countries of the Contact Group on
the principle of respecting the territorial integrity of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and on the fact that the group is
neither in favor of independence of Kosovo, nor the status quo,
but wants a status of autonomy for this region (Kosovo)," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Call for National Strike Defied Largely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A planned one-day nation-wide
strike by Zambia's public service workers failed to take place
Monday as most of them reported for work across the country.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Lusaka, some government ministries have
registered a 100 percent turn-out.
</P>
<P>
According to a snap survey conducted by the Zambian News
Agency (Zana) late in the afternoon, workers were busy in their
offices while police kept vigil at the premises of the
ministries.
</P>
<P>
At the Finance Ministry, many workers said they hadd been
working normally since morning and all their colleagues had
reported for work.
</P>
<P>
At the Roads Department of the Ministry of Works and Supply,
all the workers had come for work, a senior engineering assistant
at the department Jonathan Chizalira said.
</P>
<P>
Policemen, some in full riot grear, kept guard also at the
downtown and the Zambia University Hospital, the largest hospital
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants in Luapula province in the north of the country
shunned the call by the Zambian Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) to
force the government to rescind the planned wage freeze.
</P>
<P>
All public service workers in Mansa, the capital of the
province, reported for work Monday, although some workers might
have refrained from participating in the strike for fear of
losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Others said that local union leaders did nothing to publicize
the necessity of the strike.
</P>
<P>
They did not convene any meetings after the call for the
industrial action was made, they said.
</P>
<P>
Luapula Province Permanent Secretary Maybin Mubanga last
Friday managed to convince the workers not to participate in the
"illegal" nation-wide work stoppage because the matter was still
under negotiations between the government and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
In Chipata, the capital city of Eastern Province, the strike
did not achieved its desired impact.
</P>
<P>
The only disruption in the provision of services to the public
was reported at local Chipata General Hospital where some labor
leaders werer understood to have harassed some medical staff,
urging them to stay away from their work.
</P>
<P>
The pharmacy reportedly closed and some patients at the
Out-Patient Department and the Chest Clinic with minor ailments
were turned away.
</P>
<P>
In Ndola, northern city of the country, almost all civil
servants in various government departments reported for work.
</P>
<P>
Some workers said they reported for work because of a
government circular last Friday issued a warning of stern action
to any worker who stays away from work Monday.
</P>
<P>
The workers however warned the government to quickly resolve
the issue of the wage freeze because they will not allow
themselves to be suppressed or intimidated forever.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a heavy presence of police officers clad in riot
gear were reportedly deployed in various parts of the town
center.
</P>
<P>
In other cities like Solwezi, Mufulira, Kitwe, Mongu and
Kabwe, the call was also largely defied.
</P>
<P>
But ZCTU President Fackson Shamenda said in Kitwe that he was
satisfied with the response of the workers in terms of the
government intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Labor Minister Newstead Zimba warned the
public service workers of instant dismissal if they take part in
the strike.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that unions organizing the strike risk being
de-registered because the planned work stoppage is illegal and
infringes on industrial law.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU General Secretary Alec Chirwa said early last week: "It
is unthinkable to impose a wage freeze on workers in a
liberalized economy" and "worse still the government is imposing
a wage freeze on workers who are earning far below a living wage,
this is the most inhuman treatment government can inflict on
workers."

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Parliament Debates New Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese national assembly
(parliament) held an extraordinary session Monday to start debating
the new draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, which was recalled from a recess that would have
normally ended early next month, is scheduled to debate the draft
until the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The draft will then be put to a nation-wide plebiscite at an
appropriate date so that it will be enforced by June 30 in
commemoration of the 9th anniversary of the revolution which
brought Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to power.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir formed a committee last October to work out the draft
constitution which was completed in January.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session, al-Bashir said that foremost among the
issues incorporated in the constitution is the cause of freedom.
</P>
<P>
He said that there have been five parliaments since
independence in 1956, but they have failed to draw up a
constitution acceptable to the majority of the Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
The new draft constitution, he said, is rather comprehensive
and embraces the decrees promulgated by the salvation revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government issued on June 30, 1989 a
constitutional decree to legitimize the performance of the
government in the absence of a constitution.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the first constitution in Sudan was
adopted in 1956 upon the country's independence. It was first
suspended in 1958, but was re-enforced in 1965.
</P>
<P>
The last constitution was suspended with the outbreak of
al-Bashir's national salvation revolution on June 30, 1989.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday urged Congress to pass health-related legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
"I want it to go down in history as a Congress that saved
lives, by passing the patient bill of rights, by passing tough and
sweeping tobacco legislation," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an American Medical Association national conference,
Clinton renewed his call for Congress to pass legislation
establishing a "bill of rights" for the nearly 90 million people
enrolled in federal health care programs.
</P>
<P>
"There is utterly no reason not to do this this year," Clinton
said, noting that Congress has as few as 70 working days left
before adjourning for the fall election season.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration this week is expected to step up a
campaign for anti-tobacco legislation now stalled in Congress.
</P>
<P>
While noting that the tobacco issue is complicated by various
conflicting interests, Clinton said, "The big picture is clear:
every single day -- even though it is illegal in every state in
America -- 3,000 kids start to smoke. One thousand of them will
die early because of it. This amounts to a national epidemic and a
national tragedy."

WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
killed and about 2,000 were evacuated in southern Alabama as the
region was flooded after a weekend of drenching rain sent a
swollen creek gushing through a break in a levee.
</P>
<P>
Emergency officials closed roads and warned the flooding might

without power.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people were injured in Florida and one person was
killed in North Carolina Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Parties Concerned to Settle Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday called on the parties
concerned to resolve the Kosovo problem by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The Greek appeal came after Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
held talks with visiting Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani on
issues of the growing tension in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
and the rights of the 300,000 ethnic Greeks living in southern
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Greece was unreservedly opposed to both terrorism and any
change in existing borders in the Balkan region, he said, adding
that Athens urged the parties involved to have "a sincere and
substantial dialogue" without preliminary conditions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this would lead to a resolution of the
problems of the region through the recognition of broad autonomy
in Kosovo without a change of borders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mejdani, who began Monday his first official visit
to Greece, said that the tension in Kosovo posed a threat to peace
and stability in the region. He called on Greece, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) to
help bring an end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
As for Albanian-Greek relations, he described their ties as
"excellent," saying that Albania needed Greece's support in its
economic reforms and Greece would continue to back the neighboring
country's efforts to join Euro-Atlantic structures.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival here, Mejdani also discussed with his
Greek counterpart Costis Stephanopoulos the situation in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the nearly
two-million population.

JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of Angolan
refugees from Namibia will start as soon as the situation becomes
stable to guarantee their safety, Southern African Broadcasting
Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a Namibian official as saying that the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees was monitoring developments in
Angola. But it failed to say when the official made the remarks.

<P>
Goagoseb said a committee to carry out the repatriation had

He said the team would carry out a repatriation-awareness
campaign with refugees at a camp about 250 kilometers north of
Windhoek.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Ready to Improve Ties With Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday reiterated readiness to
improve relations with the Gulf states, but called on them to
persuade the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to solve the territorial
disputes with Iran through "bilateral negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Iran is interested in broadening and strengthening of
relations with the regional countries, Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said, but adding there exists a need
to find common grounds for bringing about cooperation and exchange
of mutual views.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the remark in a response to the final statement
of the 66th foreign ministers' meeting of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers announced in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
on Sunday that the GCC states welcomed improving relations with
Iran since they have seen "positive policy trends" from the
government of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and the recent
visit of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that a new amicable atmosphere has been created
for cooperation between the GCC states and Iran after the election
of Khatami as Iran's new president last May.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran gives importance to the bolstering of further
friendly relations and cooperation with the GCC members, adding
that the cooperation among regional countries is a vital factor
for regional security and in settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dissatisfaction with the GCC statement announcing
support for the UAE's claim on its sovereignty over the islands of
Abu Musa, the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs at the mouth of the
strategic Hormoz Strait.
</P>
<P>
Both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the
three islands, which are mainly under Iran's control since the
British colonists withdrew from the region in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Tehran favors a bilateral negotiation to solve the issue while
Abu Dhabi attempts to seek a solution through the International
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers also expressed "deep regret" that
Iran has not responded to the call by the UAE and the GCC to solve
the Tehran-Abu Dhabi dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In return, Mohammadi stated that the Islamic Republic of Iran
expects the GCC to persuade UAE to reopen the door for bilateral
negotiations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran is all set to reactivate the stalled bilateral
negotiations with the UAE, he said, adding that a bilateral
negotiation is the only possible way of settling down of the
issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the territorial dispute, Iran and the GCC states
warmed up their relations after Khatami's government stated to
pursue friendly and peaceful relations with regional countries.

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motions Against Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Monday rejected two motions of no-confidence, which accused the
coalition government of hindering the development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a special session of the Knesset, 45 members voted
against the motions and 42 voted for them, and 3 abstained.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak,
who presented one of the motions, said that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should hold responsibility for the
slowdown in economy and the high rate of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are currently 190,000 unemployed workers in
Israel, but the government remained deaf to the calls and cries of
the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Netanyahu has not kept his promises to develop the
economy and should go home.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Netanyahu of trying to hold back the
facts that the economy was slowing down. He said that the
recession was the result of Netanyahu's hard-line policy in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's coalition government currently has a slim majority
of 61 in the 120-seat Knesset.

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks International Charter on Electronic Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Commission
official reiterated the appeal for an international charter on
global electronic services.
</P>
<P>
A European Union press release Tuesday quoted Commissioner
Martin Bangemann as saying that in a borderless environment,
global problems require global solutions.
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, they (global problems) need to be addressed
in a consistent manner at international level," said the
commissioner during his weekend trip to the United States. He
urged for an open and market-led approach.
</P>
<P>
He called for an industrial round-table meeting which would be
a first step in the consensus building process leading up to an
international charter.
</P>
<P>
Bangemann also urged the private sector to play a more active
role in international communications policies.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner complained that governments and international
organizations tended too often to adapt yesterday's rules to
today's world, and often too slowly.
</P>
<P>
Market operators should lead in identifying bottlenecks and
priorities in global communications and information technology
issues, and bring them to the attention of governments worldwide
so that problems can be tackled in a global perspective, he said.

"I believe that an improved, more coordinated international
agenda by both industry and governments is absolutely essential to
reducing the number of regulations required, and avoiding
uncertain, incompatible and fragmented rules," said Bangemann.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, early last month adopted a proposal by Bangemann, together
with Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan, on strengthening
international coordination on electronic services.
</P>
<P>
The EU telecommunications ministers have endorsed the
commission's decision and asked the commission to submit a
progress report in May.

<HEADLINE> Crimes Against Women, Children Increase in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Crimes against women and
children are increasing in Nepal in the common forms of rape,
child prostitution, child marriage, child servitude, kidnapping
and child labor, said a report released recently in the country.
</P>
<P>
Marriage age in Nepal is very low. By the time they reach 15,
34 percent of women are already married and 10 percent bear
children, said the report called "State of the Rights of the Child
in Nepal, 1998" released by the Child Workers in Nepal Concern
Center (CWIN), an non-governmental organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
In some communities in the southern Terai plain, the tradition
of child marriage has children as young as seven years old engaged
for marriage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Child abuse and neglect is very much a part of social reality
in Nepal, the report said, adding that in 1997 the CWIN had
recorded 587 reported child abuse cases all over the country
including rape, trafficking, missing and abduction, murder, child
marriage and excessive torture of child workers.
</P>
<P>
Street children are among the major victims of child abuse and
neglect in Nepal, the number of the cases stands at 5,000, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The exploitation of children through prostitution, pornography
and sex tourism is a growing form of commercialized violence, with
girls as the main victims.
</P>
<P>
And the trend of sexual violence and rape is increasing in both
rural and urban areas in Nepal. In 1997 the CWIN had recorded a
total of 110 cases of rape and sexual violence involving women and
children ranging in age from 18 months and 45 years, the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 200,000 Nepalese women and children
who have been trafficked to India are forced into prostitution in
different parts of the country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Child labor is also an integral part of Nepal. At least one
million children are working as child laborers and 40,000 are
bonded laborers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that children are made the victims of growing family
violence and crimes, adding that in 1997 it had recorded
altogether 47 cases of child killings including 21 of infant
murder.
</P>
<P>
About 75,000 children die every year in Nepal, with 55 percent
caused by malnutrition and about 13 percent by Hepatitis B, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of education, the report said about 3.2 million
children have enrolled in schools, accounting for only 68 percent
of the total school-aged children.
</P>
<P>
Despite equal constitutional rights to all children, gender
discrimination is more than obvious in every walk of life in
Nepal, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said girls are discriminated against boys from the moment of
birth. According to statistics, girls work two time more than boys
whereas their participation in school is almost two times less
than that of boys.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Official on Government Role in Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong
official said here Tuesday that the government would strive to
create an environment to ensure the sustainable growth of the
productivity of the local industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen ruled out the
possibility that the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government would take a "pro-active" approach to encourage
industry, which many people said has been in decline.
</P>
<P>
"Many functions that used to be performed in house have been
farmed out ... So, much of what used to be counted as
manufacturing is now called services," Tsang said in a speech
Tuesday at the annual dinner of the Hong Kong Federation of
Industries.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong manufacturers have moved their factories and
workshops to southern China and Southeast Asia to take advantage
of the cheap labor and low rents there. The financial secretary
said: "It's just that the nature of industry and its environment
impact has changed."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that what was really important for Hong Kong is
productivity. According to the official, Hong Kong keeps an
average annual increase of 13.7 percent in productivity, which
sets the economy apart from most regional competitors.
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues and I are determined to act vigorously and act
consistently to ensure that you have an environment in which you
can maintain those vital gains in productivity," he told the
participants.
</P>
<P>
The government would work hard to improve the quality of
education, upgrade infrastructure, and take other actions to help
increase the productive capacity of Hong Kong economy, he added.

<HEADLINE> Noted Religious Figures Calling for Enacting Law on Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A noted Chinese Buddhist proposed
that a law on religion be enacted to deal with new developments in
the religious field.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puchu, head of the Buddist Association of China, said
the rule of law is what China is pursuing.
</P>
<P>
Without a national religious law, a religious legal system
cannot take shape in China no matter how many local laws and
administrative regulations are adopted governing religious
activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, also a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, who is present
at the annual CPPCC session, said religious work in China is to
carry out the policy of freedom of religious belief. "The
principle will remain unchanged," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
China has five religions, namely Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism,
Islam and Christianity with more than 100 million believers
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials reiterated not long ago that China will
continue to implement a policy of religious freedom while
administering religious affairs according to law.
</P>
<P>
Fu Tieshan, head of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association
and bishop of the Beijing Diocese, said that to manage religious
affairs according to law will not contradict religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
With a law in place, religious properties and religious places
will be better protected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bishop noted that religious bodies are social organizations
which own different facilities and organize various activities.
They should be put in the framework of the country's legal system.

<HEADLINE> 88th Yonex All-England Open Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 320
competitors representing 58 countries and areas have gathered here
for the start of the Yonex All-England Open Championships Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China, which took four of the five titles last year, sent 21
competitors to the Championships hoping to keep its supremacy in
the badminton world.
</P>
<P>
However, the miss of name Dong Jiony, the All-England men's
champion, in name list caused surprise among observers here.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to find the reason why", a spokesman for the
organizers said. "It's disappointing to lose the defending
champion, of course, but it will not detract from the event."
</P>
<P>
Owing to financial hardship caused by the economic crisis in
the Far East, some Asian countries have sent smaller squads to
this year's championships, but all the big names in the area are
present.
</P>
<P>
As far as British players are concerned, it is the first time
in the tournament's 99-year history that no home players have been
seeded.
</P>
<P>
But England National Coach Asger Madsen said on Monday "Our
players have prepared well for the Championships. They have been
training hard and I expect this effort to be reflected in their
performance."
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that it will take time before
England can approach the standard of the Asian players.

<HEADLINE> Thomas &AMP; Uber Cup Finals - Definitely Hongkong In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The International
Badminton Federation (IBF) has confirmed that the Thomas &AMP; Uber
Cup Finals will go ahead in Hongkong as planned on 15-24 May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Together with its commercial partners, the Federation has been
investigating new lines of funding and sponsorship from a variety
of sources, according to an announcement here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These have proved encouraging and the Federation is confident
that deals can be arranged which will cover the cost of both the
Finals and the preliminary stages.
</P>
<P>
The financial difficulties in Southeast Asia have had other
repercussion. IBF had considered postponing the Thomas &AMP; Uber
Finals but the new developments have made this unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Datuk Punch Gunalan, IBF Vice-President stressed the importance
of a successful launch for this elite series of seven tournaments,
four of which are planned for Southeast and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We want to give the best possible value to sponsors. As
several of the seven countries are under severe economic pressure,
it makes sense to reschedule," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lu Shengrong, IBF President, is confident that the current
problems are only a temporary setback. "By the beginning of the
year of badminton's third Olympics in Sydney, the sport expects to
be well and truly back on track," she said.

<HEADLINE> All Tackles from Behind to Be Punished, FIFA Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- FIFA told coaches and referees
Tuesday that all tackles from behind should be punished with a red
card at the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"All tackling from behind is considered to endanger the
physical integrity of the opponent, so no tackling from behind
will be tolerated by FIFA," a report quoted the world body's
general secretary Sepp Blatter as saying.
</P>
<P>
The International Football Association Board, the game's
law-making body, passed an amendment to Law 12 on fouls and
misconduct at a meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
The amendment designates the tackle from behind as serious foul
play and therefore a sending-off offence, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, referees at the workshop wondered whether the tackle
had physically to endanger a player for the tackler to be sent off.
</P>
<P>
Coaches and referees at the workshop asked for clarification of
the new ruling, and Blatter told them that all tackles from behind
should receive red cards.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for the referee to see if a tackle is
dangerous or not because all tackles (from behind) put in danger
the physical integrity of the opponent," Blatter was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on Ganges Barrage Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The three-day international seminar
on the feasibility of the proposed Ganges Barrage project in
Bangladesh ended here Tuesday after adopting a three-point plan of
action.
</P>
<P>
Under the action plan, the studies would assess the technical
and economic viability of the project, such as its impact on the
environment and the social and economic development in the
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Participants pledged to support the feasibility study of the
project, to determine the optimal use of the Ganges water
resources made available following the signing of a 30-year Ganges
water sharing treaty between Bangladesh and India in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study of the project was expected to start
within four or five months and the construction of the project
would take about four years after necessary studies were
completed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The water sharing treaty had opened the opportunity of
undertaking projects for the development of the Ganges water
resources, Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina said at the inaugural
session of the seminar jointly organized by the Bangladeshi Water
Resources Ministry, Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to act now on the best possible option...for
improving the life and livelihood for our people on the water of
the Ganges," she said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, on "water resources management and development in
Bangladesh with particular reference to the Ganges River," was
attended by some 150 delegates, including 59 from foreign
countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The much-talked-about barrage near Bhanga, Faridpur, some 112
kilometers northwest of here, has been planned for protecting the
southwest region of the country which reports said has been
seriously affected by the Farakka Barrage of India.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the barrage was needed to utilize the Ganges
water properly, after the signing of the Ganges water sharing
treaty, to protect the world's largest mangrove forest of
Sundarban, maintain environmental balance and ensure
socio-economic development in the southwestern region.

in legislation, said Zhu Senlin, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress (GPPC),

Guangdong has been playing its role as an "experimental ground"
in the field of legislation, he said at a panel discussion
attended by deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress, in

<P>
In the past five years, the Standing Committee of the Guangdong

<P>
Sixty-five percent of the laws and regulations, numbering 99,
cover the fields of market economics, economic management,
ecological protection and promotion of scientific and
technological progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province has also supervised the enforcement of these laws

<HEADLINE> India Carries Out Terrorist Activities in Pakistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain Tuesday called on the world community to take
note of India's interference in his country's internal affairs by
carrying out terrorist activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the international community to take note of these
developments which are taking innocent lives, damaging property
and attempting to destablize Pakistan," said Hussain at a press
conference held here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"India's involvement in terrorism is threat to peace, security
and stability of South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan's security agencies have collected
conclusive evidence proving that India was behind recent series of
bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
The blasts were "carried out in a consistent pattern
--detonated either on bus stands or on railway platforms" through
its intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hussain further said that the terrorism perpetrated by New
Delhi in Pakistan "is aimed at destablizing a neighboring country
having a strong government unlike India and reflecting attention
from its prevailing political uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said India wants to hoodwink the international
community by deflecting its attention from the troubles caused by
popular, spontaneous and indigenous uprising in held Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> HK NPC Deputies Encouraged by Jiang's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Deputies from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth National People's
Congress, China's top legislature, in session here since last
Thursday, said today that they have been greatly encouraged by a
speech made by President Jiang Zemin in a panel discussion with
them on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that Jiang's speech has reflected the firm
resolution of the central government to implement the principle of
"one country, two systems" and will further improve people's
confidence in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Joseph Lee Chung-tak, who is chairman of the Hong Kong
United Youth Association, noted that Jiang didn't raise any demand
on Hong Kong's future development or the operation of the SAR
government, as he usually did in panel discussions with NPC
delegations from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"This difference shows that the central government has kept its
promise of not interfering with Hong Kong's internal affairs and
has highly trusted the SAR government," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Raymond Wu Wai-yung, a member of the Hong
Kong SAR Basic Law Committee under the NPC Standing Committee,
Jiang's speech is both comprehensive and realistic, and his
analysis of Hong Kong's current situation and future prospects is
very inspiring and encouraging.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang explicitly analyzed the basic conditions for
Hong Kong to preserve its long-term prosperity and stability. This
will greatly help us to see our own advantages, maintain full
confidence and make concerted efforts to overcome difficulties,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Fei Fih, UNICEF executive member in Hong Kong, said that
Hong Kong people have felt the central government's great concerns
and resolute backing for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability
throughout the transitional period before Hong Kong's return and
the eight months and more after the return.
</P>
<P>
"It's all because of this that Hong Kong people can maintain a
strong confidence in the face of negative economic impact," she
noted.

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Turmoil Affects Shanghai Export Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The financial turmoil in Asia
has had a dampening effect on the '98 East China Export Commodity
Fair, which runs from March 5 to March 14 in Shanghai, fair
officials say.
</P>
<P>
In the first five days, 4,500 businessmen have visited the fair
and daily trading stood at 102 million US dollars, down 16 percent
and 17.4 percent, respectively, from last year's fair.
</P>
<P>
The annual event, which started in 1991, is sponsored by
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces,
Shanghai, and the cities of Nanjing and Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
Most of the overseas participants are from Asia, but this year
the number from Indonesia and the Republic of Korea is down
drastically, while the number of Europeans and Americans was down
by less than 10 percent, and the number of businessmen from West
Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania has increased 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
European countries and the United States now rank first and
second, respectively, in trading for the first time, and the three
former leaders, Hong Kong, Macao, and Japan have taken the back
seat.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech products and large enterprises from Anhui, Zhejiang and
Shanghai have been active, but textiles and light industrial goods
are in the lead, officials say, and predict even more active
trading in the coming days. However, they believe that this year's
trading will lag behind last year's 2.23 billion US dollars
worth.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures about Indonesia: Indonesia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The General Session of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Indonesia's highest
legislative body, Tuesday entered its climax by re-electing
incumbent President Soeharto to his seventh term of office.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the nation's highest legal body was a smooth
affair, reflecting Indonesia's preference for politics by
consensus rather than by confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the president and vice-president are elected once
every five years by an oral vote of the 1,000-strong MPR, over
half of whose members are directly appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
The MPR includes the 425 members of parliament (MPs) directly
elected in Parliamentary elections and another 75
president-appointed MPs from the Armed Forces, plus a further 500
presidential appointees.
</P>
<P>
Recognized political parties, of which there are only three in
Indonesia, are invited to put forward presidential candidates to
the MPR's five-yearly General Assembly Session, which is usually
held from March 1 to 11.
</P>
<P>
However, no rival candidates have been presented since Soeharto
came to power 32 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 76, was renominated early last month by the ruling
party Golkar and then the powerful Armed forces and regional
representatives expressed their support to the renomination. The
two minority party -- the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) also received Soeharto as the
only candidate of president at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
"Since there was only one presidential candidate, according to
the law Soeharto is automatically formalized as president," the
chairman of the Assembly Harmoko announced Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The MPR members stood up and applauded. There was no
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will also elect a vice president and endorse State
Policy Guidelines for the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. arms inspection team
headed by the American Scott Ritter left here for Bahrain Tuesday,
after finished its work "perfectly and without any problems."
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Hussam Mohammed Ameen, director of Iraqi
National Monitoring Department, the Iraqi counterpart of the
U.N. Special Commission on scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted Ameen as saying that Ritter's team
ended its work three days before schedule and left here for
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
"Scott Ritter informed the Iraqi side that he had accomplished
his mission perfectly and without any problems, thanking the Iraqi
side for cooperating with his team," Ameen said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter's 50-member team, which included 12 Americans, six
Britons and 10 Australians, arrived here last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, a 16-member inspection team headed by Ritter
was barred from carrying out any activities by the Iraqi
government on grounds that its composition was imbalanced. That
team included nine Americans and five Britons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other arms inspection teams continued their routine
activities Tuesday with full cooperation from the Iraqi side, said
Ameen.

<P>
Ameen said 10 inspection groups visited 17 sites which are

<HEADLINE> Private Entrepreneurs Get Rights To Be Model Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in China,
private businesses have been given permission to be recognized as
"model workers", after the federation of trade unions of Shandong
Province pushed for this recently, saying that private
entrepreneurs should be given the right.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only staff and workers of state-owned and
collectively-owned enterprises and farmers could compete for the
honor, but the policies worked out at the 15th National Party
Congress made the change possible, according to Wang Xinghai,
director of the federation's production and protection department.
</P>
<P>
The Party Congress, which was held last September, removed some
of the worries about ownership, and new policies in many places
have helped develop the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In Shandong alone, by the end of 1997, there were 2.54 million
family businesses, employing 5.46 million people, and 77,000
private enterprises with more than a million employees.
</P>
<P>
People working in the private sector now account for 11.5
percent of the province's total number of employees, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
Wang says the private economy has become a major part of the
social productive forces, the rural economy, and a major source
of employment.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Guangdong Province approved the
nomination of the country's first private-businessman model
worker, but Shandong has become the first to make it official.

<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's first test-tube baby,
Zheng Mengzhu, celebrated her 10th birthday in Beijing today at
the invitation of Beijing Medical University's No. 3 Hospital,
where she was born.
</P>
<P>
She said that she was happy that so many people came to
celebrate. More than 20 children who were test-tube babies were
present.
</P>
<P>
Zheng was born March 10, 1988. She weighed 3.9 kg. There were
many reports about her in China, calling it an important event in
reproduction and a milestone in dealing with sterility through
modern methods.
</P>
<P>
"She was a very lovely baby," said Dr. Zhang Lizhu, who created
the first test-tube baby in China.
</P>
<P>
Zheng's mother, Zheng Guizhen is a primary school teacher in
north China's Gansu Province. She was 39 years old then and did
not become pregnant 20 years after her marriage.
</P>
<P>
She says her daughter has been very healthy and began school at

Zheng Mengzhu's father said that Mengzhu is 1.5 meters tall and
weighs 40 kilograms.
</P>

success rate of 25 percent. A dozen hospitals in China have the
service and have had about 1,000 test tube babies.

ABU DHABI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani will visit Egypt to improve the bilateral
relations, the official Qatari News Agency (QNA) reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The emir "has accepted (Egyptian) President (Hosni) Mubarak's
invitation and is likely to visit Egypt," QNA quoted Fawaz al
Attiyah, Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was delivered by Egyptian Minister of Education
Hussein Kamel Bahauddin during a trip to Doha last week.
</P>
<P>
Al Attiyah expected the visit will come after a meeting of the
foreign ministers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
members due to be held in Doha on March 15-19, QNA said.
</P>
<P>
The Doha-Cairo ties soured after Egypt was accused to have a
hand in a coup attempt to topple the Qatari government in 1996,
which Egypt has denied.
</P>
<P>
The disputes were exacerbated when Egypt, among others,
boycotted the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference
Qatar hosted last December.

the hosting of the FIFA Youth Championship next year as it
prepares for the 2006 World Cup, a Nigerian official said in Abuja
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Youth and Sports Minister Air Commodore Emeka Omeruah
said after signing a contract for the rehabilitation of 10
stadiums in the country that the number of stadium has been
increased from eight to 10 to meet FIFA's requirement for hosting
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of work on the 10 stadiums, Nigeria will be
in comfortable position to bid for the hosting of the year 2006
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Omeruah's remark is the first official reaction to a recent
report that FIFA has asked Nigeria and South Africa to bid for the
year 2006 World Cup, saying that it is willing to give the hosting
right to an African country for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the successful hosting of the 1999
FIFA Youth Championship will be a major boost to Nigeria's bidding
for the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Another possible boost will come from Nigeria's national
football team, the Super Eagles, if the 1996 Atlanta Olympic
champion could meet the wide high expectation on it at the France
World Cup this June.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Grain Production and Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
called for developing in-depth processing of grain and farm
produce to increase farmers' incomes and improve people's living
standard.
</P>
<P>
This will play a positive role in maintaining a stable and high
grain output in China and improving the efficiency of the
country's agriculture, Li said here today at a group discussion
attended by deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
from northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
"Heilongjiang, one of China's leading grain producers, should
speed up the processing of its farm produce if it wants to become
an agricultural power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the difficulty to sell and store some kinds of
farm products is a temporary phenomenon. "There is a growing
demand for grain in China," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"We should make every possible means to enhance the role of
agriculture as the economic base of the country, increase grain
production and develop grain processing to meet market needs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also called for developing border trade which he
said conforms to the strategy of diversifying China's foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
He urged Heilongjiang to sum up experience in border trade,
build more export-oriented production bases and improve the
quality of its export goods.
</P>
<P>
The premier described Heilongjiang as a treasure house of
natural resources and spoke highly of its role in supplying the
nation with petroleum, grain, coal and timber. He urged the
province to improve infrastructures so as to fully tap its
economic potential.

ABU DHABI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has agreed to the
deployment of P-3 surveillance aircraft by the United States on
its soil later this year, the official Qatari News Agency reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<P>
But he did not elaborate on the number of the planes to be

Washington, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and the U.S. signed a defense cooperation accord after
the 1991 Gulf War, which drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Pursuing "Name-Brand Strategy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Companies in some Chinese
provinces have been encouraged by local governments to create
name-brand goods to improve their competitiveness, according to
a government official.
</P>
<P>
Qin Yongfa, a State Economic and Trade Commission official,
made the remark while addressing an international symposium on
name-brand strategies, in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The action comes as a result of the fact that the domestic
market is well on its way to becoming a buyers' market and a large
group of trans-enterprises have entered the Chinese market and
challenged Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy has become more closely tied to the global
economy in recent years, Qin said, with imports and exports
accounting for 40 percent of the country's economy, and with 200
of the world's top 500 companies doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have come to see that they can only count
on quality, new techniques, and good service if they are to
compete in the world market, Qin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangdong Province has already started a
name-brand project, and 180 of its name-brand products had 94.5
billion yuan in sales and about two billion US dollars in exports
in 1997..
</P>
<P>
The name-brand strategy is still at a preliminary stage in
China, he said, and Chinese name-brand goods still cannot hold
their own against international brands.

WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in the leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A virulent strain of streptococcus bacteria has infected 117
Texans in the past three months, killing 26 people.
</P>
<P>

government to do more to ensure that its child-care facilities are
safe and staffed by workers free of criminal histories.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A vast storm system over the weekend caused deadly flooding
in the South and heavy rain and high winds in the New York region,
and hurled a bitter onslaught of snow, ice and frigid temperatures
from Wisconsin through Nebraska that blasted Midwesterners out of
their smugness over a winter that almost wasn't.
</P>
<P>
-- Most Americans deeply distrust the Government, despite the
end of the Cold War, the robust economy and satisfaction in their
own lives at a 30-year high, a survey found.
</P>
<P>

-- Lockheed's acquisition of Northrop Grumman faces broad
opposition on antitrust grounds from the Justice Department and
the Pentagon, the companies' largest customer.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Calls for Experiment on Euthanasia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese lawmaker suggested here
today that China should enact a law on euthanasia, or mercy
killing, and allow hospitals in some large cities to start the
practice of euthanasia on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
"China is expected to become an aged society by 2000. It's
already high time that we took the issue of euthanasia into
consideration," said Hu Yamei, a deputy to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, in session here
since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old Hu, who is honorary president of Beijing
Children's Hospital, put forth the same suggestion at previous NPC
sessions as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Shanghai are the two cities where Hu suggested for
the earliest experiments of mercy killing.
</P>
<P>
"Euthanasia can only be applied to patients suffering from
incurable diseases under the precondition that it is the patients'
own wishes and has the consent of their family members," said Hu.
"It also must be approved by local civil affairs departments and
carried out in designated hospitals."
</P>
<P>
She noted that each year she receives letters from many people,
especially from retired revolutionary veterans, who expressed
great concern about progress regarding the issue of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
"Mercy killing can relieve the patients of great pains, save
unnecessary medical expenses and reduce the psychological and
economic burdens of the patients' families," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
She called it a misconception that only longevity indicates
social progress, and said that a modern society should have modern
ethics on life.
</P>
<P>
She also blamed traditional Chinese culture and ideas and
feudal superstition for hindering the practice of mercy killing.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China's news media have been involved in
several fruitless debates on the legality of euthanasia, which is
also in dispute in most parts of the world. Only a few nations
have reportedly greenlighted mercy killing on a trial basis.

BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Leipzig will hold its first China
days, according to Thomos Gindele, a representative in Beijing, at
the International Trade Fair for Passenger Transport and Goods
Traffic, from May 6 to 9.
</P>
<P>
May 7 and 8 will be set aside for "China Days Transport and

</P>
<P>
China Days will be the core of the Fair, which is one of 18
regularly held international fairs, Gindele says.
</P>
<P>
Wang Derong, vice-president of CCTA, had said after the Munich
Fair's China Days last year that CCTA would help Chinese
businesses cooperate with European colleges for the second event,
in Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
The global economy and different ways to move goods on the
domestic market mean that China needs to improve the quality of
its transport and logistics, Wang said, expressing the hope that
China Days can help increase contacts with sectors in Germany and
other countries.

<HEADLINE> New Police Warning System Operating In Southern Delta Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Police in south China's
Guangdong Province today began using a satellite-based warning
system to improve security in the Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The network is being used offshore near Zhuhai, Huizhou, Hong
Kong and Macao, according to provincial police officers involved
in offshore security. Police boats using the system have been
equipped with a ground positioning system (GPS).
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the local police have experimented with setting up
an offshore warning system in some coastal cities to crack down on
smuggling and pirate operations.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 million yuan has been spent on the project, and an
integrated police service system is expected to take shape in
Guangdong's coastal area by June.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the offshore warning system has been
used in 6,000 criminal cases, involving 11 groups of pirates and
200 instances of smuggling and trafficking in contraband.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today called on
the country's massive number of township enterprises to improve
management, step up technical innovation and take an active part
in international competition.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call in a group discussion with deputies from east
China's Zhejiang Province to the National People's Congress (NPC),
in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China's township enterprises are fairly highly
adaptable to market changes. A number of township enterprises,
despite having achieved a fair level of economies of scale from
manual operations, still need to adjust their product mix,
increase the "technology content" of their products and further
enhance their adaptability to the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there are still a large number of labor-intensive
township enterprises in China. Greater efforts should be made to
sharpen the competitive edge of these enterprises to cope with
intensifying competition at home and abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign trade sector, Li said that, in addition to
improving product quality and taking appropriate measure to
promote exports, China should carry out reform of its foreign
trade system in greater depth and in a planned and systematic way.
</P>
<P>
The premier also called for reducing production cost and
exploring more markets overseas for Chinese products.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Mahathir's Yangon Visit Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The two-day official visit of
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to Myanmar, which ended
here Tuesday, has further strengthened the bilateral ties between
Myanmar and Malaysia, bringing the bilateral cooperation including
trade and economic cooperation to a new stage, some observers here
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's first trip to the country after Myanmar's entry into
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) last July also
marked part of Malaysia's efforts to enhance bilateral ties with
neighboring countries and consolidate ASEAN unity.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar official media said Mahathir's visit is a milestone in
the annals of bilateral relations and the visit has also further
strengthened the existing ties and enhanced better understanding
on issues of national and regional interest.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar takes Mahathir as its strong ally when he put up a
stiff fight to get Myanmar into ASEAN amid obstructions by a
western group, the media said.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Mahathir were his wife Siti Hasmah, Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Deputy Minister of International
Trade and Industry Kerk Choo Ting and Secretary-General of
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Datuk Abdul Kadir.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Mahathir held talks with Senior-General Than

Since then, Malaysia has encouraged its private sector to
participate in trade and investment in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Some Malaysian firms began establishing wood-based industry and
manufacturing industry in Myanmar's Shwepyithar and Pyinmabin
industrial zones on contracts in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hoteliers stepped in taking up some hotel projects and at the
same time they extended hotel business training to Myanmar youths
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Under the two countries' technical cooperation program, Myanmar
technicians were trained in Malaysia which contributed to the
development of human resources in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also provided nurses and doctors to meet Malaysia's
needs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two countries were prepared to take part in
setting up a railway linking ten Southeast Asian countries and
China, which was discussed during visits of Malaysian Transport
Minister Ling Liong Sik to Myanmar in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Malaysia expanded its investment in Myanmar by being
engaged in the infrastructural development of the country's
largest foreign-invested industrial zone -- Thanlyin-Kyauktan --
in the capital with the Gentine Co. taking up the project of
building four container wharves out of 17 at the zone.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, two more Malaysian firms were also
respectively involved in the exploration and production of oil
and natural gas in the country's Tanintharyi coast and generation
and distribution of electricity in the southern part of the nation
on contracts.
</P>
<P>
More and more Malaysian entrepreneurs came on study tours
later, seeking for business venture opportunities with Myanmar
counterparts through business forums.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Malaysia brought in capital
of 587 million U.S. dollars in 25 permitted projects at the end of
1997, standing as the fourth largest foreign investor in Myanmar
after Britain, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the two countries' bilateral trade ties, it has been
 maintained for the last several decades with relatively small
volume. However, it grew from 64.8 million U.S. dollars in 1992-93
fiscal year to 192 million dollars in 1996-97 ended in March,
traditionally favoring Malaysia in the balance of trade, according
to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures indicate that the two countries' bilateral
trade amounted to 151 million dollars in the first ten months of
1997, up from 88.5 million dollars in the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Malaysia established diplomatic relations in early
1958. The exchange of visits of the two countries' state leaders
in two recent years significantly contributed to the further
development of their bilateral ties and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Investigation of Pyramid Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Tuesday ordered the thorough investigation of a millions-of-pesos
pyramid scam whose victims include the wife and daughter of Vice
President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the National Bureau of Investigation will be the
lead agency to look into the scam allegedly masterminded by
Josephine German, wife of Estrada's public relations consultant
Aurelio Reli German.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered the agency to find out how Josephine
German managed to defraud at least 20 people of 800 million pesos
(20 million U.S. dollars) without being unmasked sooner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos called on the victims to cooperate by
providing vital information to the probers so that they can get to
the bottom of the case.
</P>
<P>
Josephine German reportedly started her business in 1989 by
asking people to invest while assuring them of high interests in a
very short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Her business went big time last year when she began inviting
rich and prominent people to invest millions of pesos. However,
she started having problems with the business during the first
week of February this year and then fled abroad.
</P>
<P>
Estrada had asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to cancel
the passport of the suspect and sought her deportation.
</P>
<P>
Ramos declined to make any conclusion pending the result of the
investigation, saying he does not want to make any conclusions at
this stage "because we do not have too many details about the
matter".
</P>
<P>
Estrada is the presidential candidate of the united opposition
in the May 11 elections. He has been the front-runner in most
popularity surveys on the presidentiables.

<HEADLINE> China's First Trial Futures Market Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange (CZCE), the country's first market for grain futures
trading on a trial basis, has become the world's 15th largest in
terms of transaction volume, said CZCE chairman Li Jingmou here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is in Beijing attending the annual session of the
National People's Congress, said the Zhengzhou market's regulatory
functions on grain prices has been accepted by China's central
government and international futures trading circles as well.
</P>
<P>
Futures trading, considered a way to reform China's grain
circulation system, began first as an experiment in China. After
grain futures trading has proved successful and relevant laws are
enacted, it is expected to be introduced to other areas.
</P>
<P>
The grain circulation system is one of the five economic areas
where reform will be carried out this year, according to Chen
Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission,
delivering a speech at the ongoing session of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Conditions are ripe now for such a reform, said Li Jingmou, who
enumerated the following reasons to support his view:
</P>
<P>
-- Good agriculture harvests for three consecutive years,
providing ample grain reserves for reform;
</P>
<P>
-- The establishment of a grain reserve system with 7.5
billion kg in reserves able to stabilize grain prices;
</P>
<P>
-- The establishment of a grain marketing system.
</P>
<P>
"It's high time for China to push ahead with such a reform,"
said Li, who also acknowledged that such a reform must be
conducted in a prudent way since it concerns the interests of 800
million Chinese farmers.

ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Tuesday that it
had solid evidence to prove that the Indian Intelligence Agency,
Research and Analysis Wing, was involved in recent acts of
terrorism in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Conclusive evidence in possession of the government of
Pakistan clearly pots to the fact that these terrorist acts were
masterminded and executed by the Research and Analysis Wing," said
a Foreign Office spokesman in a press release issued Tuesday,
according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that recent bomb blasts in Pakistan, which
caused loss of innocent lives, "are a part of a well orchestrated
plan of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"The latest replay of this abominable violence was in crowded
passenger trains where sophisticated time devices were used," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "dastardly acts of violence have also been
carried out to ignite strain violence in Pakistan resulting in the
killing of foreigners."
</P>
<P>
"The perpetrators of these heinous crimes, who are obviously
trying to divert attention from the collapse of a system spawned
by successive weak governments, can never succeed in intimidating
the government and the people of Pakistan, nor dilute their
resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms," he added.
</P>
<P>
Such dastardly acts will only serve to vitiate the atmosphere
in a region that is already tense and volatile, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Three bomb blasts took place in the last two days in Pakistan,
out of which two were in a passenger train. The incidents killed

WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Steve Sampson, United States
national coach, will name the core of his World Cup squad this
month, according to a report from San Diego on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Countries have until June 2 to inform the game's governing body
FIFA of their official squad of 22 for the World Cup to be begun
in Paris on June 10.
</P>
<P>
But Sampson says he will privately notify 10-15 players they
will be going to France 98 to relieve them of the pressure.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to start giving certain individuals
confidence they are on the team," Sampson was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is a high level of anxiety associated with making the
World Cup team. I want to relieve that."
</P>
<P>
One of the complaints players had with former coach Bora
Milutinovic was they never knew whether they would be picked or
not, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Chris Henderson, who played in the 1990 and 1994
World Cups, approved Sampson's decision.
</P>
<P>
American form has gone up and down recently. A high point was
the 1-0 win over world champions Brazil but that was followed by
defeats to Mexico 0-1, the Netherlands 0-2 and Belgium 0-2.
</P>
<P>
England-based goalkeepers Kasey Keller and Brad Fielder,
strikers Eric Winalda and Ernie Stewart, midfielders John Harkes,
Claudio Reyna and Preki Radosavljevic, and defenders Eddie Pope,
Marcelo Balboa and Thomas Dooley all look likely to make Sampson's
first choice.

BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao today said Taiwan authorities are seeking
their own benefits by taking advantage of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan devalued the currency by 10 percent in
October, causing a slump in the stock markets of Hong Kong and
some Southeast Asian countries, worsening the financial turmoil in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that some Taiwanese politicians led a number of
business executives in carrying out activities to enhance
substantial relations with certain countries by committing
themselves to economic assistance or financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In taking advantage of the financial turmoil they have
demonstrated their selfishness, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the "One China" policy of the Chinese government,
stressing that China does not oppose any non-government economic
and trade contacts between Taiwan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
But it resolutely opposes countries that have diplomatic
relations with China in making of official contacts of any form
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese position has the understanding and support of many
countries and the attempt of the Taiwan authorities is doomed to
failure, Zhu said.

<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is already looking beyond
the hosting of the FIFA Youth Championship next year as it
prepares for the 2006 World Cup, a former Nigerian official said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Air Commodore Emeka Omeruah, retired Nigeria's Youth and Sports
Minister said in Abuja after signing a contract for the
rehabilitation of 10 stadiums in the country that the number of
stadium has been increased from eight to 10 to meet FIFA's
requirement for hosting the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of work on the 10 stadiums, Nigeria will be
in comfortable position to bid for the hosting of the year 2006
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Omeruah's remark is the first official reaction to a recent
report that FIFA has asked Nigeria and South Africa to bid for the
year 2006 World Cup, saying that it is willing to give the hosting
right to an African country for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the successful hosting of the 1999
FIFA Youth Championship will be a major boost to Nigeria's bidding
for the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Another possible boost will come from Nigeria's national
football team, the Super Eagles, if the 1996 Atlanta Olympic
champion could meet the wide high expectation on it at the France

<HEADLINE> HK Fund Sales Remain Subdued in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Gross sales of unit trusts in
January 1998 slumped to 203 million U.S. dollars, the lowest since
November 1995, the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA)
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Continuing uncertainties over the outcome of the Asian
financial crisis and further falls in regional currencies produced
extremely slack inflows in the first month of the year, HKIFA
Chairman Peter Lord said.
</P>
<P>
With redemption hitting 261 million U.S. dollars, the month
recorded net outflows of 59 million U.S. dollars. This was also
the fourth consecutive month that the industry registered net
outflows.
</P>
<P>
The industry recorded net outflows of 88 million U.S. dollars
in the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
"However," Lord pointed out, "it seems that, on a
month-on-month basis, gross sales have been dropping at a reducing
rate."
</P>
<P>
Gross sales in November dropped by about 30 percent over
October. In December sales went down by 16 percent and in January
by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We note that in February, sentiment has improved and in
general investors have a higher propensity to invest. However, we
would not expect sales to rebound immediately," Lord said.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA consists of 45 fund management companies as
full/overseas members and has about 40 associate members including
trustees and other professionals which are involved in the
creation and administration of funds.

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed firmer
after an active session on the Singapore market, as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) rose by 7.39 points to
finish at 1546.05 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that buying was encouraged by the firmer trend in
regional currencies, and especially, the market was buoyed by
optimism that Indonesia would forge a compromise with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Light foreign fund buying helped to lift prices, particularly
those of blue chip stocks, they note.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume increased to 343.87 million units, valued
at 357.58 million Singapore dollars (about 218.04 million US
dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 268 to 72, while 273
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 31.71 million units. It was followed by
M. Resources which had 27.72 million shares traded. MBf Capital
was next with 21.01 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
NorBorneo led the gainers of the day as it rose by 46 cents to
finish at 3.92 Singapore dollars. Jurong Shipyard increased by 35
cents to end at 7.9 Singapore dollars, while Gentings was up by 32
cents to close at 4.92 Singapore dollars.
</P>

Singapore dollars. Asean Fund fell by 70 cents to close at 7.8
Singapore dollars. DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals Rising in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Macao rose by
6.6 percent in January this year, reversing the declining trend of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department on Tuesday show that visitor arrivals reached 621,334
in January, up 6.6 percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due mainly to Hong Kong visitors, whose
number surged by 37.3 percent. Tourist arrivals from the Republic
of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asian nations, Australia and
Europe all dropped sharply, by at least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Macao received some 7 million tourists last year, down 14
percent from 1996. The decline was blamed as the mixed result of a
wide coverage of Macao crime rates, the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia and fewer visitors from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tourism contributes about 40 percent of tax revenues of the
government of Macao, which is known for its Oriental casinos and
South European-style buildings. Its annual international music
festival and Formula 3 Grand Prix are also major attractions.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Army Building (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of new circumstances, Jiang said, the Party Central
Committee and the CMC have set forth new strategic principles for
military development, and have stressed the importance of
improving army strength with science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The new principles aim at enabling the Chinese army to win
victories in local wars that are fought with modern technologies,
especially with high-technologies, and place emphasis on the
quality rather than the quantity of troops, he explained.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the modernization of national defense and the
army is a long-term historical task that requires constant efforts
of several generations.
</P>
<P>
"We must take Deng Xiaoping Theory as our guidance and study
the characteristics and laws of national defense and army building
under new circumstances in a down-to-earth manner, to further
improve our work," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It's also very important to correctly handle the relationship
between economic development and the building of national defense,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Building a modernized army and national defense is a guarantee
for the country's safety and modernization drive. But without a
highly developed economy, it's also impossible to promote the
modernization of national defense and the army," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"We must always insist on taking economic development as the
central task while paying adequate attention to modernizing
national defense, and seek a coordinated development for both the
economy and national defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Unremitting efforts should be made to promote the style of hard
work and plain living in the whole army, to improve the ability of
officers and soldiers to resist the corrosive influence of any
decadent ideology and culture, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Leading officers must play an exemplary role in promoting
frugality and thrift and opposing extravagance and waste. This is
by no means a trivial matter, but a major political issue
concerning the morale of the Party and the army and the success or
failure of our cause," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the army deputies that this year China would make
greater efforts to combat corruption and build a clean Party and
government.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher as Asian Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar continued
to follow the fortunes of its northern neighbors Tuesday, firming
as Asian currencies began to show signs of strength.
</P>
<P>
The Australian unit finished the local session at 66.82 U.S.
cents, from 66.58 U.S. cents Monday.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank head of foreign exchange Craig Busch said the
Australian dollar traded in a range of 66.58 to 67.00 U.S. cents,
"it has really been chopped around on the fortunes of Asian
currencies."
</P>
<P>
The local currency reached its intraday highs as the Asian
currencies began to firm. "Aussie just followed the Asian
currencies today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also Indonesian President Soeharto was returned to office for a
seventh term. Indonesian House Speaker Harmoko told an electoral
committee meeting that Soeharto was the only candidate for the
post and declared he will lead the country for the 1998-2003 term.
</P>
<P>
Against the Indonesian rupiah, the U.S. dollar fell to
IDR10,600 from IDR10,900 the previous day.
</P>
<P>
"Dollar/yen came off in the afternoon as well, and that put a
bit of support under the Aussie," Busch said.
</P>
<P>
The local market has recently seen the 66.50 to 66.60 U.S.
cents level hold, and buyers were expected to push the local
currency up to 67.50 U.S. cents on the topside.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar closed here at 85.00 yen, down
slightly from 85.26 yen Monday, it was also at 1.2201 marks, up
from 1.2184 marks.

<HEADLINE> HK Repatriates Two Planeloads of Illegal Vietnamese Migrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of 274 Vietnamese were
returned by air to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Tuesday, on the 113th and
114 flights under the Orderly Repatriation Program (ORP), the Hong
Kong government announced.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred and forty-eight were deemed illegal immigrants
while 26 considered migrants. The majority of them arrived in Hong
Kong in 1997, with the remaining in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
The returnees comprise of 220 men, 36 women, 11 boys and seven
girls.
</P>
<P>
The group brought to 11,860 the total number repatriated on 114
ORP flights since October 1991.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Security Bureau showed that since the
emergence of the Vietnamese boat people in 1975, Hong Kong has
received over 200,000 people from Vietnam. Of these, some 143,000
have been resettled in third countries and over 69,000 returned
to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
But the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government is still
working hard in negotiating with the Vietnamese government so that
the problem of the Vietnamese boat people would be solved as soon
as possible, said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government announced in January this year the scrapping
of the port of first asylum policy, imposed on Hong Kong by the
British Government in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The abolition meant that there would be no more special
treatment to illegal Vietnamese arrivals in Hong Kong in future.
They would be treated in the same way as are illegal arrivals from
any other country.

it appears the problem of stomach illness has increased," said
Michael Osterholm, Minnesota's state epidemiologist, at the
conference which began Sunday and runs through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found an average of one stomach illness per person
annually in a study of 86 families conducted in Cleveland between
1948 and 1957. But in the last two years, studies in five places
around the United States have found a rate of 1.4 illnesses per
person annually. In Minnesota, the rate is 1.8, said Osterholm.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rise to two possible reasons. The first is
that almost half the money Americans set aside for food is spent
in cafes and restaurants, where diners are vulnerable to the
safety practices of workers who are young and poorly paid and may
not wash their hands, Osterholm said.
</P>
<P>
The other is the push to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables
all year round, which forces the United States to import more
products from other countries with less stringent cleanliness
standards, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in 1996 more than a third of all
cantaloupes, 74 percent of green onions and 79 percent of
cucumbers were imported from Mexico.

<P>
PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States will
resume talks Tuesday in Washington on opening their air markets to
each other, said a French official.
</P>
<P>
During the previous round of talks last month in Paris, the two
sides failed to reach agreement to give free access to their
airports to air companies of the two countries, because of the
French concern that unbridled competition from American air
companies could damage Air France.
</P>
<P>
But the French Foreign Ministry estimated that an agreement is
possible.
</P>
<P>
Air France is now prevented from carrying out its already
signed cooperation programs with U.S. companies of Delta and
Continental because of the absence of an open space agreement
between France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already signed open space agreements with
a number of European nations, including Germany, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Austria.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji today
emphasized the importance of a good management for state-owned
enterprises to get prosperous.
</P>
<P>
"Only by having a good management can state-owned enterprises
fundamentally improve their operational situation," said Zhu, also
a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, in a group discussion
attended by deputies from Sichuan Province to the National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that supplies now exceed demand on the market,
indicating that "we've bid farewell to an economy of shortages."
</P>
<P>
"One the other hand," he said, "it shows that there have been
too many redundant construction projects."
</P>
<P>
"That is why it is high time we readjusted the industrial
structure and the product mix," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that some state-owned enterprises have been heavily
debt-ridden and some have not been able to turn to profitability
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"An important reason for this is that these enterprises do not
have a good group of executives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some executives do not feel guilty in the least when their
businesses are suffering great losses. How can such enterprises
change for the better with such people in charge?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot put an end to state-owned enterprises continuing to
lose money without solving the leadership problem in enterprises
and without changing the outdated management structure," he said.

BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to heighten its
sense of discipline, maintain a high degree of stability and
unity, and build a smaller but stronger army with science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central
Military Commission (CMC), made these remarks at a meeting of PLA
deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, in session here since last Thursday.
</P>

"All officers and soldiers of the army must heighten their
sense of discipline, persistently subject themselves to the
command of the Party Central Committee and the CMC, and always
maintain a high degree of stability and unity of the troops, to
accomplish excellently various tasks given by the Party and the
people," Jiang told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
Party committees at all levels in the army should make
persistent efforts to arm the mind of officers and soldiers with
Deng Xiaoping Theory and guidelines of the 15th CPC National
Congress and carry out the Party's line, principles and policies
in an exemplary way, to provide an active support for the
country's various reforms and undertakings, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the whole army, especially leading officers at
all levels, to enhance their awareness of the overall situation,
treat correctly the adjustment of interests, and voluntarily
subject themselves to and serve the country's overall situation.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that due to the rapid development of high

military circles of the modern world.
</P>

"As a global military reform keeps gaining momentum, military
powers in the world have one after another readjusted development
strategies for their armies, in a bid to speed up army
modernization and overtake other countries in army quality," Jiang
noted.

LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Prices for grain and soybean
futures increased lightly Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as
heavy snow and rain swept across North and South Americas.
</P>
<P>
In early trading, wheat for May delivery was 4.5 cents higher

Analysts say wheat futures were boosted by concerns that the

Corn futures were boosted by news that heavy rains fell over
the weekend in Argentina, where the harvest of a large corn crop
is getting under way, they said.
</P>
<P>
One reason behind the higher prices for soybean futures, they
believe, is coming from the fears that bad weather will delay the

<HEADLINE> Israel Achieves Big Drop in Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit in 1997
fell to 3.6 billion U.S. dollars from 5.3 billion dollars in 1996,
registering a 32.1 percent plunge, the Haaretz daily reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics has attributed the
decline of the trade deficit mainly to an increase in exports, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
Figures have shown that Israel sold 32 billion dollars worth of
goods and services last year, 1.5 billion dollars more than those
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also received a unilateral transfer of 8 billion dollars
last year, witnessing a rise of 200,000 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its imports of goods and services last year stood
at 43.6 billion dollars, about the same as those in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking of the trade deficit is a further evidence of an
economic slowdown in Israel, as it indicates that the internal
consumption is slumping.

Israeli Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman and State Budget
Director David Milgrom will announce plans later this week to

<HEADLINE> China's Top Judge Calling for Continued Crack-Down on Crimes (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past five years, the scope of civil affairs cases
subjected to trial have been increased steadily with a number of
disputes involving properties increasing remarkably, and there is
somewhat a change in the type of civil cases. Consequently, the
number of criminal cases increased with each passing year.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, people's courts in China have handled
13.5 million first-ruling civil cases, at an average annual growth
rate of 10.72 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of economic cases has been on the
rise, with the emergence of new-type cases, filtrating into the
economic spheres and new and high-tech fields. The amount of
claimed funds totalled 937 billion yuan in the past five years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To further increase the protection of the intellectual
right the Supreme people's courts and some higher and intermediate
people's courts have set up their own intellectual tribunals and
formed a contingent of judges. They have settled a total of 16,894
cases covering patent, trademark and copy rights, representing an
average annual rate of 5.83 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that intellectual achievements have won respect
from the whole society and been protected by law, he added.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases involving foreign nationals also grow year
by year. People's courts in the country completed 19,074 such
first ruling cases in the five-year period, up 14.57 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
Administrative cases involve the acts of unfair law-enforcement
by many administrative departments and, through the handling of
such cases, the rights and interests of citizens were protected
and public security and administrative organs were guaranteed to
perform their duties in accordance with law, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
Establishing a compensation system constitute a new trend in
development of socialist democracy and legality. All people's
courts at or above the intermediate level have set up their
compensation committees since the "Compensation Law" was put into
effect in 1995.

million court verdicts were passed, he noted. A direct economic
loss of 26.5 billion yuan was retrieved for the state and

</P>
<P>
The people's courts in China have taken the crackdown on

bribery, embezzlement of public funds and fraudulent practices in
Party and government leading bodies and government administrative,
law-enforcing, judicial and economic management departments.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,610 officials at and above the county or division

<HEADLINE> China's Top Judge Calling for Continued Crack-Down on Crimes (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past three years, the people's courts across China
have handled 870 such cases, 364 of which were paid by government
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Whether written judgement and other law documents can be
implemented has a direct bearing on the dignity of state laws and
materialization of lawful rights and interests of the parties
involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6.689 million cases other than criminal ones were
concluded with a sum of 268.5 billion yuan claimed in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
People's courts at all levels have been attaching great
importance to supervision over adjudication, and unfair or
erroneous verdicts will be firmed corrected in accordance with
law, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
They received 3.38 million visits or letters of complaints
lodged by people in all parts of the country in the past five
years and gave 20.56 million replies. People's courts examined
complaints and petitions in real earnest, promptly filed cases in
accordance with law or set forth for re-trial if necessary, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, people's courts have implemented a
series of reforms including those in public trial, enhancing of
the courts' functions, and opening public investigations, debates
and cross-examinations in to bid to subjected court trial under
the supervision of the masses of people. Moreover, China has
formulated and promulgated the Law on Judges.
</P>
<P>
The people's courts have earnestly investigated and punished
those acts in violation of laws and disciplines.
</P>
<P>
However, Ren stated, there still exist many weakpoints and
problems, and some of them are serious. In some cases, the law was
not strictly enforced and the verdicts passed by some courts were
unfair. Moreover, protectionism from localities and various
departments have seriously interfered in the court judgment, he
added.
</P>
<P>
And effective measures will be made to solve these problems
with particular measures to be taken to eliminate crimes committed
by those who misuse their powers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Major tasks for 1998 and a longer period to come are to enforce
laws in an earnest manner, go in for reforms in courts and build a
contingent of judges to so as to provide a judicial guarantee for
pushing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics into
21st century, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators of the
Philippine government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) resumed their talks in Sultan Kudarat, the southern
province of Maguindanao, on Tuesday, the Philippine News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chair for political affairs, was
quoted by the report as saying that the meeting which is scheduled

<HEADLINE> Asia Crisis' Impact on Growth Serious: ADB President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis is
producing serious consequences for the economic growth in the
region over the next few years, but the region still has the
strong foundation for recovery, Asian Development Bank (ADB)
President Mitsuo Sato said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a senior policy seminar on Managing Global Financial
Integration in Asia, Sato said that the consequences of the crisis
for growth in Asia over the next few years are serious and several
countries will experience negative economic growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Depending on how quickly and decisively (the) economies act,
some recovery may occur in 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Social costs of this recession will also be very large.
Inflation rates, unemployment, and poverty levels will be high.
Indeed, as a direct result of what is happening in Asia, there
will be slower global growth this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, Sato said, over the medium term and a longer term, growth
recovery will depend on the determination with which Asia tackles
underlying institutional, governance, and structural problems.
</P>
<P>
There are grounds for optimism that bold steps necessary to
rehabilitate and strengthen economies will be taken, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once this challenge has met, the strong foundations that have
propelled growth in the past should once again come to the fore,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day seminar, the participants will discuss
emerging lessons and prospective challenges of globalization for
the region.
</P>
<P>
High level officials from 12 ADB Members, the private sector
and multilateral agencies are attending the meeting, which was
jointly sponsored by the World Bank and the ADB.
</P>
<P>
Other topics for discussion are perspectives and implications
of the current (Asian financial) crisis, challenges for
macro-economic management in an integrated environment, dealing
with financial distress and capital markets reform.

<HEADLINE> Legal Profession Becoming More Attractive to Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The yearly application process
for taking the lawyers' qualification examination is still three
months away. And yet many Chinese between 20 and 40 are rushing to
buy guidance materials and sign up for preparation schools.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, more than 500,000 people have taken the
exam, though less than one fifth have passed it. However,
increasing number of people have passed the exam year by year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Lawyers Department under the Chinese
Ministry of Justice earlier this week told Xinhua that the legal
profession has become an admirable one to many Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Now lawyers are playing an increasingly important role in
China as a result of improvements in the country's legal system
and the development of the market economy," the official said,
adding that these are the main reasons why becoming a lawyer is
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, in the past five years Chinese
lawyers served as legal consultants to more than 250,000 work
units and participated in the handling of nearly seven million
criminal and civil cases or disputes.
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers in China also have provided good legal services to
various key national construction projects like the Three Gorges
Dam Project and the Shanghai Metro Project, contributing greatly
to the smooth operation of these projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the official said, the role played by lawyers has
drawn more attention in such sectors as finance, securities, real
estate, intellectual property rights, international trade and the
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
The official estimated that by the end of this century, there
will be 150,000 Chinese lawyers. The figure will reach
250,000-to-300,000 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers in China may find more roles to play in the future, as
the 'rule by law' principle is being more and more respected and
the nation's market-oriented reform is deepened," the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Host Regional Meeting on Transnational Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
host the Asia-Pacific Regional Ministerial Meeting on
Transnational Crime in Manila from March 23 to 25.
</P>
<P>
The decision to host the meeting showed the government's
reaffirmation of its commitment to combating transnational
organized crimes, Secretary of Department of Interior and Local
Governments Epimaco Velasco said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, interior and home affairs ministers from 50
countries in the Asia-Pacific region and 150 other participants

crime syndicates whose illegal activities include money
laundering, drug trafficking and firearms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of these countries are now taking serious cognizance
of the threat posed by transnational crimes to the socio-political
and economic stability of their respective nations," Velasco said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objective of the ministerial meeting is to
provide a forum by which nations can plan a concerted global
effort to combat crimes which have become a menace worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Transnational crimes recognize no boundaries, religion,
ideologies and race. They wreak havoc on the people and their
countries," he said, adding that the best approach to combat them
is through a unified and well-coordinated plan of action among
nations.
</P>
<P>
Among the expected output of the meeting is a "Manila
Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Organized Crime and
Corruption," which is to be signed and approved by the 50 interior
and home affairs ministers by the end of the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, participating countries will also each
present a technical paper detailing the state of peace and order
in their countries and the efforts made in the campaign against
transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Local Governments Manuel Sanchez
said the three-day meeting is a wider follow-up to the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Conference on
Transnational Crimes which the Philippines hosted and sponsored
last December.

<HEADLINE> Government Restructuring Program Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The institutional restructuring
program of the State Council, China's highest governing body, was
adopted today by an overwhelming majority at the third plenary
meeting of the First Session of Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC), in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress heard
explanations on institutional restructuring of the State Council
by Luo Gan, state councillor and concurrently secretary general of
the State Council, according to the decision, which was reached to
adopt the program after examinations and discussions among the
deputies.
</P>
<P>
The current institutional restructuring is focused mainly on
the government departments under the State Council. Besides the
General Office of the State Council, the departments under the
State Council will be trimmed to 29 from 40, a major structural
reform move to be carried out in an active but prudent manner.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the current restructuring is to form a highly
efficient, well-coordinated and standardized administrative
system. It is also aimed to further improve the system of public
servants, build a contingent of administrators who are competent
and professionally specialized, and gradually institute a
government administrative structure with Chinese characteristics
to comply with the socialist market economic system.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's National Carrier Strives for Curbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's national carrier Middle
East Airline (MEA) has announced a plan to curb losses, the
Lebanese Daily Star newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The airline will achieve its goals by canceling unprofitable
flights and increasing the frequency of the remaining, Mohammed
Hout, MEA's chairman of board of directors, told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"By increasing worldwide connections, and making efficient use
of resources, planes and employees, the company will save 20
million U.S. dollars (in a year)," he was quoted by the Daily Star
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The national carrier witnessed a loss of 53 million dollars
last year, Hout said, adding that this is a proof that the old
flight network, designed for Lebanese expatriate travel, is no
longer appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The airlines will suspend eight unprofitable services by June 1
and concentrate its activities on more promising markets.
</P>
<P>
To suspend some of the flights does not mean less activity of
MEA, instead, it will have a 26 percent increase in weekly flights
and a 46 percent rise in using its aircraft, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that MEA will form four subsidiary companies,
including one for airport maintenance and service which began to
operate on March 1.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Tanzania Plant Crops to Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 refugees in a
refugee camp in west Tanzania's Tabora Region have started to
plant crops to feed themselves rather than wait for relief
supplies, a member of parliament has said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees at Kigwa camp have cultivated 2,000 hectares of
agricultural crops setting a good example of farming at Igalula
Ward in Tabora rural areas, the member of parliament for Igalula
constituency, Tatu Ntimizi, told the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
Refugees from eight countries have planted maize, beans for
food and cash crops like tobacco, sunflower for profit so as to
reduce reliance on food supplies from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other relief agencies, she
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The MP said the refugees are from the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, the Sudan, Kenya, Angola, Uganda and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees have shown that agriculture is the mainstay of
any person, and have set a good example for other people living
in the constituency," Ntimizi was quoted by the newspaper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains this year, however, have destroyed up to 3,200
hectares of various crops in Igalula alone. Assistance of 100
tons of food and medicine is required for over 600 people
surrounded by water in the ward, she said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Tanzania plays host to about 340,000 refugees,
UNHCR statistics indicated.

<HEADLINE> Australia Ranks Second in World Car Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Australians are the second most
frequent victims of motor vehicle theft in the world behind the
United Kingdom, according to figures to be presented at a
conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian national conference of the International
Association of Auto Theft Investigations (IAATI) will discuss ways
of fighting and reducing car theft in Australia.
</P>
<P>
NRMA (a car insurance company) investigations manager Kieran
Gavin, who represents the Australian chapter of IAATI, said in a
statement released Tuesday that more than 122,000 vehicles were
stolen in Australia in 1996, a 9.3-percent rise since 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was a rate of 11 vehicles for every 1,000 registered.
</P>
<P>
"These rates place Australia second behind the UK in relation
to motor vehicle theft," Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates put the cost to insurance companies at around
650 million Australian dollars (442 million U.S. dollars) a year,
which was returned to the community in higher premium costs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, car theft has a major economic impact, in addition to
the inconvenience and upset for the victims of such crime," he
said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier figure from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
showed that 75 percent of car theft was opportunistic and 25
percent professional.
</P>
<P>
The most common locations are streets and footpaths (37
percent), garages and driveways (18 percent) and car parks (16
percent).

<HEADLINE> Wild Manchurian Tigers Believed in Changbai Mountains (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Hu Shaofeng, another official from the Jilin
Provincial Forestry Bureau, during the Chinese Lunar New Year
traces of Manchurian tigers were found in Jiaohe city. The
sighting was confirmed by provincial experts.
</P>
<P>
Manchurian tiger is a large-size meat-eater mainly inhabiting
Russia's Siberian area and the northeastern part of China. China
is believed to have fewer than 20 Manchurian tigers because of the
loss of forests and hunting.
</P>
<P>
Huichun is located in the Tumen River delta area, part of the
Changbai Mountain area and neighboring Russian. Though it does not
belong to the Changbai Mountains Nature Reserve, the city's dense
forests provide a favorable environment for Manchurian tigers to
reside. There have been numerous reports of wild tigers in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Deshan, deputy director of the Huichun City Forestry
Bureau, said that nine cows have been eaten by tigers since August
of 1997, when a 400-kilogram cow was attacked and eaten up on
Naozigou village's pastureland in Madida Township. Local experts
and experienced villagers confirmed the attacks on domestic cattle
were by Manchurian tigers.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 15, another villager met with a Manchurian tiger on his
way to work and escaped by luck.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zhengjie from the provincial academy of forestry said
that, since a ban on hunting in the Changbai Mountains went into
effect decades ago, the number of wild animals including wild deer
and boar has increased rapidly, which would provide plenty of food
for tigers.
</P>
<P>
However, cattle are easy prey for tigers.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the protection of wild animals, local
governments have also passed regulations to compensate farmers who
suffer losses from the endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Chen Xitong to be Prosecuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chen Xitong, a former secretary
of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), will be prosecuted soon on charges of embezzlement of
public funds and dereliction of duty following the end of
investigations into his case.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors began investigations into Chen's case in accordance
with law from September, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate, when he delivered a work report at
the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), in
session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Investigations into and prosecution of serious cases of
embezzlement, bribe taking and dereliction of duty, especially
those involving leading officials, indicate that China's
anti-corruption campaign has intensified," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, when China launched a new round of anti-corruption
campaign, procuratorates at all levels have been dealing with
crimes committed in Party and government organizations, and
administrative, law-enforcement, judicial and economic
administrative departments, crimes involving officials above the
county level in particular, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, procuratorates at all levels have
prosecuted a total of 180,000 people on charges of bribe taking,
embezzlement of public funds and dereliction of duty, among whom,
2,903 are county-level officials, 265 prefecture-level officials
and seven ministerial-level officials.

<HEADLINE> Australian Tourism Hit by Asian Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia's tourism industry is
hit hard by the Asian economic crisis with official statistics
predicting a 5-percent fall in international visitor number this
year.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the tourism industry met with government ministers
here Tuesday to discuss the impact of the Asian economic crisis
and their call for a reinvestment package.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Council of Australia (TCA) said in a statement that
the 5-percent drop means an 800 million Australian dollar (536
million U.S. dollars) cut in earnings and 216,000 fewer people
visiting Australia.
</P>
<P>
TCA Managing Director Bruce Baird said in the statement, "The
Australian tourism industry is at a crossroads and in need of
strategic reinvestment to develop new markets, drive growth from
traditional markets and maximize the tourism advantage from Sydney
2000."
</P>
<P>
"As the nation's major employer, providing one in nine jobs, it
is essential to develop strategies that boost the industry."
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson said that while there has been
a downturn from some key Asian markets, "the government, through
the Australian Tourist Commission, is running major new campaigns
to bolster traditional, high-yield markets such as the United
States, the United Kingdom and Japan."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting, which involves Trade Minister Tim Fischer
and Industry Minister John Moore, would also provide worthwhile
input into the National Action Plan for Tourism, soon to be
presented to the cabinet, he added.

<HEADLINE> Flood Season Arrives Early on Middle Reaches of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The flood season has started one
month earlier than usual on the Xiangjiang and Zijiang rivers,
both branches of the Yangtze River, China's longest.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain since March 6 has brought the earliest flooding to
the Hunan Province region recorded since 1910.
</P>
<P>
Hunan water officials said flood peaks at various monitoring
points range from 2.2-to-5.9 meters higher than the alarm
level. This kind of flooding occurs once every 5-to-10 years.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, there has been more rain than usual in Hunan
Province. The water levels of the Xiangjiang, Zijiang, Yuanjiang,
Lishui rivers -- the four major branches of the Yangtze in the
middle reaches -- and Dongting Lake are 2-to-3 meters higher than
normal.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Hunan was unprepared for the early, sudden and
violent flooding. Anti-flood and water conservation projects under
way were not scheduled for completion until just before the
traditional flood season.
</P>
<P>
The province had to release some water from major reservoirs
along the Xiangjiang and Zijiang rivers.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has issued urgent circulars calling
for "an immediate readiness for the battle against floods."

<HEADLINE> Tung Strongly Confident in Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Monday
told the German businessmen that he has strong confidence in the
future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a dinner party hosted by German business leaders at
the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce
(DIHT), Tung attributed his confidence above all to the
implementation of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's idea of "one
country, two systems" which gives Hong Kong a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Tung, on his first official visit to Germany after Hong Kong's
return to China last July, also stressed that despite the
financial turmoil affecting Southeast Asia, Hong Kong is capable
of maintaining its competitiveness without the devaluation of the
Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong needs not to devaluate its currency in order to
compete, Tung said, thanks to its 98 billion U.S. dollar foreign
exchange reserve, the third highest in the world, as well as
advantages that other Asian countries do not have.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's service sector turnout accounts for 85 percent of
Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP), he said, plus predicable
policies, low taxes as well as the rule of law in the area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong, which boasts healthy economic structure
and well-regulated financial markets, is free of the macroeconomic
policy faults as the Asian countries hardest hit by the financial
turmoil have.
</P>
<P>
Tung reiterated that Hong Kong will stick to its 14-year-old
linked exchange rates, which the latest polls show are supported by
70 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The position has received strong support from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and if necessary, will also get financial
support from mainland China, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, Hong Kong is not only defending its
currency, it is also planning to invest massively in the near
future in education, housing, transport and information technology.
</P>
<P>
In answering a question, Tung expressed the strong belief that
the Chinese currency Renminbi will not devaluate, just as Chinese
leaders have stated.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the dinner party, Juegen Heraeus, chairman
of the China working group of the Asian-Pacific Committee of the
German Economy, praised the efforts by the central government of
China and the local government of Hong Kong to maintain the value
of RMB and Hong Kong dollar, which has served as the stability
anchor in the financial markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that China, including Hong Kong,
will make efforts in order to launch an energetic new start for
economic growth in Asia as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Predicts IT Growth in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with
Microsoft, a global computer software giant, has predicted
increased investment in information technology (IT) in Kenya, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in Kenya has been phenomenal. The market grew by
30 percent last year," said Felipe Sanchez Romero, the Microsoft
Regional Director for Africa, Mediterranean and Middle East
(AMME).
</P>
<P>
However, intensive surveillance on piracy and prosecution of
culprits will have to be implemented if the region is to attract
increased foreign investment in the field, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Microsoft boss was in Kenya to attend a Microsoft business
conference aimed at launching the Microsoft Small Business
Server, a product designed for the African market.
</P>
<P>
The small business server offers users the benefit of running
a networked, computerized office at a minimum cost and with
little or no technical support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he announced that Windows'98 would be launched in
Kenya later this year.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the Year 2000 computer problem, called
"Millennium Bug," would affect most organizations, unless urgent
measures are taken to control the problem.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of all computers in Kenya are designed with
two-digit years which will require conversions by 2000. It is
believed that without corrective measures, more than 75 percent
of all business applications will fail at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Wild Manchurian Tigers Believed in Changbai Mountains (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations investigation
team claim they have found traces of three-to-five wild Manchurian
tigers in the forests near Huichun, a city in northeast China's
Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The finding confirms local reports that nine cows had been
eaten by tigers in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Manchurian tigers have been considered on the verge of
extinction for decades in northeast China, their original home.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. delegation, formed by four Russian experts and one
from the United States, has completed an eight-day investigation
on wild Manchurian tigers in the forests of Huichun near the
Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
During their investigation, the U.N. team found tiger prints on
the snow-covered ground along with their excrement, resting places
and bones of other animals they had eaten.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Jilin Provincial Forestry Bureau, who is
accompanying the delegation, quoted the delegation members as
saying the the group of Manchurian tigers near Huichun probably
includes at least one tigress.
</P>
<P>
A Russian expert reportedly said this is a different species of
tigers from those discovered in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) began
investigating Manchurian tigers two years ago. They completed
their investigation in Russia amd were continuing their studies in
northeast China this year. The aim of the investigation is to make
clear the number of Manchurian tigers and to take effective
measures to protect them.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is still under way in Jilin province's
Wangqing County, some 70 kilometers away from Huichun.

<HEADLINE> China's Election System Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) and its standing committee have improved China's
election system and made the process of election more democratic
by enacting and amending election laws, a leading legislator said
here today.
</P>
<P>
During the term of the Eighth NPC, two change-of-term elections
were held, one for people's congresses at the township level, and
the other for local people's congresses at the county level and
above and for the NPC, said Tian Jiyun, a vice-chairman of the
Eighth NPC Standing Committee, at the third meeting of the Ninth
NPC First Session held here today.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth NPC Standing Committee also took charge of the
election of deputies to the Ninth NPC in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR). In accordance with the method of
election for NPC deputies to the Ninth NPC in the HKSAR adopted by
the NPC, it approved a list of members for an Electoral College of
the HKSAR. And election was conducted in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Hong Kong to elect its own NPC
deputies to the highest organ of state power as an independent
electoral body since it returned to the embrace of the motherland.
It is an important symbol of Chinese citizens among Hong Kong
residents having a say in state affairs as masters of their
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Change-of-term elections are an important democratic process in
which the entire people participate, he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to law violations in elections, the NPC Standing
Committee instructed relevant departments and localities to make
immediate corrections and deal with violators severely, thereby
ensuring smooth elections, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Funds Needed for Taihu Lake Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday's Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily" quoted the survey as
saying that the water-quality turnaround will be achieved by 2010
and maintained for another decade.
</P>
<P>
The needed investment does not cover the input of local
enterprises to turn themselves into "clean production," which is
also expected to be a huge sum.
</P>
<P>
Even with such an investment, however, water quality in the
western part of the lake will deteriorate again by 2020 as economy
in the region grows rapidly.
</P>
<P>
It takes 5 to 15 years to pollute a lake, but 15 to 100 years
to restore it, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The two-year survey has provided large amounts of information
on the general pollution situation in the Taihu Lake valleys.
</P>
<P>
The survey also covers the lake bed, for the first time
gathering information on pollution of the mud and its part in
contributing to the lake's over-nutrition.
</P>
<P>
China has approved the Plan for Preventing and Treating Water
Pollution of the Taihu Lake during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000). All factories in the Taihu Lake area are required to
meet discharge standards this year.

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Enhances Supervision on Law-enforcement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior legislator Tian Jiyun said
here today that the Eighth NPC Standing Committee has, over the past
five years, gone on giving the same emphasis on the examination
and supervision over the law implementation as on law-making.
</P>
<P>
Through the examinations, various administrative departments,
courts and procuratorial organs have improved their work in
law-enforcement, laws are implemented better and the people have
become increasingly aware of laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), made remarks at the third
plenary meeting of the First Session of the Ninth NPC in his
report on the work of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the Eighth NPC Standing Committee has
examined the implementation of 21 laws and decisions on the related
laws, and the special committees of the NPC have also conducted
examinations on the implementation of the relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the foundation of agriculture in the national
economy and promote the growth of agriculture and rural market
economy, the Standing Committee has examined the implementation of
Agriculture Law for consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee has made arrangements on inspecting how
the Environmental Protection Law, Water Law, Forestry Law, and
other laws concerning environment and resources were implemented.
"Fairly Good results have been attained," he said.
</P>
<P>
In view of existing problems prevalent in the order of market
economy, the Standing Committee has examined, among other laws and
regulations, the implementation of Anti-Unfair Competition Law,
and the Law on the Protection of Consumers' Right and Interests,
</P>
<P>
These examinations have played a positive role in improving the
contingents of law-enforcement workers, overcoming protectionism
practiced in some areas and by some departments, and straightening
out the market order.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NPC Standing Committee has examined the
implementation of more than 10 laws and decisions, including the
Law on Education and Law on Scientific and Technological Progress.

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Enhances Law-Enforcement Supervision (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the field of work supervision, a system in which the NPC
Standing Committee hears and deliberates the reports of the State
Council and its subsidiary departments, the Supreme People's Court
and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, has been formed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the Standing Committee has heard 34
work reports of the above-mentioned organs, which involved banking
business, foreign trade, education, building a clear and honest
government, agriculture, forestry, civil aviation, reform of large
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and alleviating farmers'
burdens.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the country's major reform measures and hot topics
about which the masses of people care, the reports have
contributed greatly to acquainting the Standing Committee with the
progress of reform, and supervising the reform and the
implementation of measures for development, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
Local people's congresses have, in recent years, pioneered some
effective ways of organizing deputies to assess the work of
governments, courts and procuratorates, appraise the performance
of officials whom the people's congress and its standing committee
have elected or decided to appoint.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local people's congresses and their standing
committees have urged relevant departments to set up the system in
which law-enforcing workers should held responsible for their own
work, and the system in which people responsible for causing cases
of misjudgment will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"The Eighth NPC Standing Committee affirms such experience and
methods and supports local people's congresses to exercise their
supervisory power according to law," Tian Jiyun said.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the Eighth NPC Standing Committee has
exerted great efforts to carry out the supervisory
responsibilities endowed by the Constitution. However, supervision
remains the weak points in the work of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
At present, the failure to abide by the law, laxity in law
enforcement, letting law-breakers go free, law-breaking by
law-enforcing personnel and acceptance of bribes remain severe in
some areas and departments.
</P>
<P>
"The masses of the people complain much about the problems and
ask the NPC and its Standing Committee to strengthen supervision,"
Tian Jiyun said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee should take more measures to further
improve and strengthen the examination and supervision over the
implementation of laws. The examination and supervision must be
more effective and formalism must be guarded against, he said.

<HEADLINE> Paintings of Austrian Artist Max Weiler on Display in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one representative
paintings of Austrian artist Max Weiler went on display in the
China Art Gallery here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his
Austrian counterpart, Wolfgang Schuessel, attended the opening and
ribbon-cutting ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel addressed the opening ceremony, saying that it is
Austria's honor to present Weiler's works as part of the '98 China
Year of International Fine Arts (CYIFA) series.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will further enhance cultural exchanges between
Austria and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel praised the cultural contacts in music, opera and
fine arts between the two countries in recent years, and cited
such cooperation as "milestones in the development of friendly and
fruitful relations."
</P>
<P>
Born in 1910, Weiler is one of the most famous modern painters
in Austria.
</P>
<P>
Exhibiting works in China has long been a cherished wish of
Weiler, 88, who identified himself with principles he found in
Chinese landscape painting of the Song Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The artist combined the Chinese style with modern European
abstract art and created stylish, heart-touching paintings.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was organized by China's Ministry of Culture and
the Austrian Foreign Ministry and presented by the China
International Exhibition Agency and the China Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
The works on display, mainly from the Vienna Art History Museum
and private collections from other countries, are considered among
his best.

<HEADLINE> More Beijing Residents Investing in Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of Beijing stock
investors has surged in recent years, indicating that residents of
the Chinese capital are becoming increasingly aware of financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
The number of stock-trading accounts in Beijing has soared by
an average 137 percent each year since the market was opened
in 1993, hitting 1.11 million by the end of last year. Of the
accounts, 99.5 percent have been opened by individual investors.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors in the Chinese capital opened 2,977
stock-trading accounts last year, up 79.6 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid growth rate in the number of trading
accounts, there is still great room for further development of the
stock market, which was started years after those in the major
coastal cities in the east and south, experts say.
</P>
<P>
They expect another 600,000 stock-trading accounts to be opened
in Beijing this year.
</P>
<P>
China's stock market was opened in the early 1990s when two
stock exchanges were set up in Shanghai and the special economic
zone of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
China now has 757 listed companies and more than 34
million stock investors. The market capitalization of the listed
firms was valued at 1.81 trillion yuan at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia: 3 Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's highest legal body,
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), is holding its General
Session to endorse the country's State Policy Guidelines for the
next five years and elected a president Tuesday, and will elect a
vice president on Wednesday. The MPR consists of five factions --
the ruling Golkar Party and its alliance the Armed Force and the
regional representatives, the United Development Party (PPP) as
well as the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
The following are the profiles of the three parties:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Development Party (PPP), an Islam-oriented group,
was set up in 1973 after merger of four Islamic parties. At the
beginning, the new party bore the symbol of Kaabah, the Muslim
shrine of Saudi Arabia. In 1987, however, the PPP replaced the
symbol with a five-point star.
</P>
<P>
Most of the party's constituents are Ulema and students of
Pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in the rural areas, mainly in
Java.
</P>
<P>
One of the four former parties making up the PPP is Nahdlatul
Ulama (NU), which has some 30 million supporters and is the
country's largest Muslim organization. Struggles for positions
among leaders of the four factions led to the withdrawal of NU
members from the PPP in 1987, thus undermining the party's
position in that year's general election.
</P>
<P>
There is no official information about the size of the party's
membership.
</P>
<P>
The PPP, which is chaired by veteran politician Ismail Hasan
Metareum, won 22.66 percent of the vote in the sixth general
election held in May last year, about six percentage higher than
that of the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
-- The Golkar, set up by a group of military and civilian
leaders in 1966, was the dominant socio-political force during
President Soeharto's 32 years of administration. It claims a
membership of 36 million out of a population of 202 million in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Its Chairman is Harmoko, the first civilian to hold the
position since it was established.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, which has won each of the six elections in the
past, won more than 74 percent of the vote in the general election
held in May last year. In 1992, it won 68 percent of the vote. The
party enjoys full backing from the military, government
bureaucracy and leading businessmen.
</P>
<P>
-- the Indonesia Democratic party (PDI) is an alliance of
several Christian and nationalist parties set up in 1973.
</P>
<P>
In its history, the PDI was pockmarked by internal strifes. The
party has become weaker since 1996 when the party's two factions
conflicted.
</P>
<P>
The PDI, which won 15 percent of the votes in the 1992 general
election, claims a membership of 16 million. However, it only
obtained 3.07 percent of the vote in last year's general election.
</P>
<P>
The two small parties have not gotten any ministerial post in
the cabinet since Soeharto became president in 1967.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China is making progress in protecting consumers' rights and
interests.
</P>
<P>
Consumers' associations at all levels received 42,207
complaints in 1997, and 98.78 percent of them were resolved,
recovering 22.78 million yuan for consumers.
</P>
<P>
The associations gave priority to some "hot spots" or
"headaches" that received the most consumers'
complaints: commodity quality, housing, tourism, medical
treatment, health-care products, means of agricultural production,
fraud in the service sector, exaggerated advertising, interior
decoration and dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
The associations conducted 4,498 market inspections last year,
and law enforcement departments collected nearly one million yuan
worth in fines and confiscated goods based on information gained
through inspections.
</P>
<P>
On March 15 of last year, Consumers' Day, the province's
consumers' associations organized 35,800 people to participate in
the publicity effort, received on-the-spot 7,867 complaints, and
provided consulting services for more than a million people.

<HEADLINE> Northern, Western China Reporting Growth of Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern and western areas of
China are reporting rapid growth in foreign trade, according to
information released at a commodity fair here.
</P>
<P>
The areas chalked up 16.6 billion U.S. dollars in foreign trade
in 1997, up 17 percent over 1996. Tianjin, a major outlet for
foreign trade with these areas, increased its freight volume for
foreign trade by 18.6 percent last year, according to the
information.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yixuan, a special representative of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to Tianjin, said the
northern and western areas are comparatively backward regions
economically, but these areas have made up each other's
deficiencies through increased cooperation, which has led to a
greater degree of opening-up in their economies.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing China Tianjin Export Commodity Fair, which began on
March 8, is a regional fair jointly started by a dozen provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities of northern and western
China. So far, nine similar fairs have ever been held.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 3.09 billion U.S. dollars of export
business deals were struck during the previous eight commodity
fairs, which drew a total attendance of more than 20,000 overseas
business representatives.
</P>
<P>
Such fairs have also increased cooperation among the hosts.
Tianjin has put forward a strategy of linking its economic
development closely with that of the northern and western areas. A
group of cooperative projects are being implemented.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Port authorities have pledged to improve its computer
network and infrastructure for customs clearance, as well as to
simplify checking procedures to create better conditions for
interior areas to increase their exports.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hong Kong's Economic Prospects Are Bright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For years Hong Kong's economy has
kept growing at an annual rate of about five percent. Affected by
the Asian financial crisis, the government of the HK Special
Administrative Region sets growth for this year at 3.5 percent,
leaving doubts whether the economy can pick up speed again.
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong members of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who
are here attending the committee's first annual session, expressed
belief that Hong Kong's future remains promising.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC members, including noted industrialists, financial
specialists and university professors, said Hong Kong will shake
off the influence of the financial crisis and resume normal
economic growth by relying on its solid economic foundation,
high-quality government and strong economic support from the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
According to Mun Kin-chok, a professor from the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong has nearly 100 billion US
dollars in foreign exchange reserves, an efficient financial system
and a sound supervisory system.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, the regional government has shown a
strong capability to handle the financial emergency; the
confidence of Hong Kong people in the Hong Kong dollar has not
weakened, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are Hong Kong's advantages in having continued economic
development," Mun Kin-chok said.
</P>
<P>
Facing the Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong has adhered to the
practice of pegging its currency with the US dollar and dealt with
emergencies in a proper way. On the other hand, Hong Kong plans to
invest more than 230 billion Hong Kong dollars in the next five
years in infrastructure development in an attempt to promote
internal consumption and stimulate economic growth, the professor
said.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ka-mun, director of board of Peregrine Securities (China)
Ltd., said the regional government has invested heavily in
infrastructure such as housing and road construction to raise the
competitiveness of Hong Kong as a financial and trade center in
the Asia-Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
The first fiscal budget announced by the regional government
not long ago shows that Hong Kong has taken flexible measures in
the face of the Asian financial crisis and that Hong Kong is
strong financially and has the ability to handle its finances,
said Ng Chu Lien Fan, chairman of Hong Kong Tung Wui Securities
Co.
</P>
<P>
Hu Fa-kuang, chairman of the Hong Kong Ryoden Electric
Engineering Co. Ltd., said that the momentum of high economic
growth in the mainland will greatly boost economic expansion in
Hong Kong, providing opportunities for Hong Kong businessmen.

Hakuba on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway won her third straight

<P>
Myklebust, despite having a cold, dominated the difficult Snow
Harp course in Hakuba with a time of 19 minutes 19.9 seconds to

</P>
<P>
Myklebust, now 54, also collected four gold medals in
Lillehammer four years ago and two each in 1992 and 1988, and she
is determined to quit the sport after Nagano to concentrate on
her work as a physiotherapist.

<HEADLINE> China to Replace 350,000 Obsolete Automobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China will replace a record
350,000 obsolete automobiles this year, 50,000 more than in 1996
and 1997.
</P>
<P>
An official with the National Automobile Replacement Leading
Group said that a plan has been worked out and will be carried
out.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, 289,000 automobiles will be replaced in
the country's provinces and metropolitan areas, including 176,000
trucks and 44,000-plus cars. In addition, the military will
replace 61,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that expediting China's auto replacements will
assist the growth of the country's auto industry as well as reduce
urban pollution.
</P>
<P>
China's auto production has grown at an annual rate in excess
of 20 percent since 1991, with output currently exceeding 1.2
million.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of vehicles has brought increasingly serious
air pollution problems. A survey shows that more than 50 percent
of many large cities' air pollution comes from auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
China's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) said
that battling urban auto pollution has become a major focus of the
country's environmental effort.
</P>
<P>
A NEPA official said China will check trucks annually and ban
those with serious pollution problems as well as worn-out city
buses. In addition, some relevant ministries have passed strict
regulations on scrapping worn-out automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Shanghai plans to replace 2,000 buses with
new ones in the next two years. Some experts in Beijing have also
proposed developing natural-gas-fueled autos to curb the city's
serious air pollution.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 4,000 natural-gas-fueled autos on the road
which are all considered in good operation.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislature Scores Marked Progress in Law-Making (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior legislator Tian Jiyun said
today that the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) and its
Standing Committee accelerated the pace of legislation and enacted
laws for the all sectors of socialist market economy over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of laws have been passed with their quality
improved," he said, noting that "the laws have laid a foundation
for a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Tian, vice-chairman of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, made
the remarks while delivering a report on the work of the Eighth
NPC Standing Committee at the third plenary meeting of the First
Session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
During their tenure of office, the Eighth NPC and its Standing
Committee deliberated a total of 129 draft laws and decisions on
the certain law issues, passed 85 laws and 33 decisions on certain
laws, and approved 60 bilateral and multi-lateral international
treaties, conventions and importment agreements, Tian Jiyun said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the Constitution passed at the First Session
of the Eighth NPC incorporated the following contents into the
Constitution: "China is in the primary stage of socialism", "the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics", and
"the adherence to reform and opening to the outside world."
</P>
<P>
The guilding status for the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics was established in the form of the
fundamental law of the country.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee designated the acceleration of
economic legislation as its primary task and, centered on the main
links of market oriented economic setup, striving to construct a
legal system framework for the socialist market economy, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the revision and improvement on the Law of Criminal
Procedures and Criminal Law constituted a major event in China's
socialist legislation, and a batch of major laws were formulated
and revised, concerning such spheres as the development of
socialist democracy and politics, education, science, health,
physical culture, environmental protection and national defense.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the vacancy of laws was filled up in some areas,
and contents in the legal system enriched, so that the country's
political and social life has further embarked on the track of
legalization, Tian Jiyun said.

<P>
In accordance with the basic policy of "one country, two
systems" and the specifications in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), the Standing Committee
drafted the Law on Stationing Troops in the Hong Kong SAR, and
some other relevant laws and decisions.
</P>
<P>
the Standing Committee set up the Preliminary Committee of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, and the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR according to law.
</P>
<P>
"All this has played an important role in ensuring Hong Kong's
smooth transfer and its prosperity and stability," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee has been paying attention to making laws
in accordance with the Constitution and the overall interest of
the country and the fundamental interest of the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Persevering efforts were made to integrate legislative work
with major decisions on the country's reform and development, and
conscientiously study and draw on the good experience of
legislation in other countries on the basis of China's realities.
</P>
<P>
Adequate importance should be attached to the mass line in
legislative work and the initiative of various aspects aroused,
and attention and support should be given to local legislation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he noted, there exist some weak points and
problems in legislation work despite remarkable achievements
scored. Some major laws concerning the market economy have not yet
been worked out, and some existing laws are not complete, whereas
some other laws, with relatively general terms, are not easy to
operate. The power of legislation should further be defined and
law-making procedures have still to be further improved, Tian
said.

<HEADLINE> China Commended For Not Devaluing Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China has made great contributions
to economic and social stability in Asia by deciding not to
devalue its currency amid the current financial crisis in the
region, said economists at the Asian Development Forum here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference by a group of economists, Robert Lawrence
of Harvard University said China is very responsible in the face
of a currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although devaluation of currencies in other East Asian
countries has exerted great pressures on its exports, China
promised not to devalue its currency in order to maintain regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
If China devalued its currency, the regional crisis would get
even worse, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's earnest attitude toward the crisis was also
reflected in its commitment to reforms in the country's banking
system and state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Other economists also said that as an economic power in Asia,
China's attitude toward the crisis has contributed to economic and
social stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the Asian financial crisis will end, Vinod Thomas,
director of the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank,
said the history of the past financial crises in Asia and other
regions shows that a financial crisis is unlikely to end too soon.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what decisive measures will be taken by
individual countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economists are attending a week-long Asian Development
Forum, which brings together 350 economists, journalists and
government officials to discuss East Asia's development priorities
and needed policy reforms after the outbreak of the financial
crisis.

northwest, is expected to complete some airport expansion projects
at a cost of 1.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Government-led investment in infrastructure development to
drive economic growth in underdeveloped areas has been a
successful practice internationally," he said.

Construction of infrastructure projects is not limited to
Xinjiang. To promote economic development, the central government
plans to invest a total of 800 billion yuan in resources
development projects in the country's central and western regions
during the period of 1996-2000. Key projects in these regions
total 2,000 in number, 43 percent of the country's total.

<P>
Besides government funding, above 60 percent of loans China
gets from foreign governments and international institutions is
being used in these regions, and 80 percent of them are
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
In Henan, China's most populous province, up to one million kw

100 km of newly-built railways will be put into use annually in
the next few years, according to deputy Li Chengyu from the

will have improved its infrastructure markedly. The province can
then direct its investment focus to new and high-tech sectors," Li
said.

<P>
Abudul'ahat Abudurixit, also an NPC deputy and chairman of
Xinjiang Ugyur Autonomous Region, said the region, which makes up

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Parliament Fails to Pass Law on Abandoned Flats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Parliament has failed
to pass a bill designed to invalidate wartime decisions on
abandoned houses in the Croat-Muslim Federation.
</P>
<P>
The handling of abandoned houses is one of the biggest
obstacles to an earlier return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sarajevo declaration on the return of refugees,
adopted earlier in February, the wartime law on abandoned flats
was to become invalid at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Both houses of the Bosnian parliament met Monday to discuss the
bill proposed by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, all pre-war tenancy holders who abandoned their
homes during the war would be guaranteed the right to regain
them. Those who subsequently moved into these houses should be
provided with alternative accommodation.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the Party of Democratic Action, Semiha
Borovac, also proposed an amendment under which wartime decisions
on the allocation of abandoned flats would not be automatically
proclaimed invalid but "could be rescinded at the party's request."
</P>
<P>
The proposal was supported by her party at the House of
Representatives, but the Croatian representatives voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The federal parliament's House of Peoples adopted the law in
its initial form, as put forward by the federal government,
without the amendment.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's MPR Endorses State Policy Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) has endorsed the 1998/2003 State Policy Guidelines,
the blueprint for national development over the next five years,
sources at the MPR said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MPR approved the Guidelines last night at its plenary
session attended by five factions in the highest legislative
body, said the sources at the sidelines of Tuesday's session
during which President Soeharto was re-elected to his seventh term
of office.
</P>
<P>
When presenting their final views at Tuesday's session,
government factions in the Assembly -- ruling Golkar party, the
Armed Forces and regional representatives -- approved the
guidelines with optimistic comments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and
the United Development Party (PPP) cautioned the next government
about bumpy roads ahead because of the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The State Policy Guidelines, which consist of six chapters,
cover a wide range of issues for the next government to address in
the coming five-year term starting next month.
</P>
<P>
Like the 1993/98 Guidelines, the new ones still put emphasis on
the economy as the prime mover of the development. The Assembly
requires the government to implement the policies with improved
efficiency and greater public participation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1968, President Soeharto's New Order government (compared
with Soekarno government) have worked around five-year national
development plans, known as Repelita. The government also run
25-year long-term development plans.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the long-term plans are to bring Indonesia
toward a prosperous, just and self-sufficient society.
</P>
<P>
The MPR General Session, which started on March 1, will end on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Advances to Evert Cup Tennis Quarter-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- World top-ranked player Martina
Hingis of Sqitzerland swept past Meike Babel of Germany Monday
night, advancing to the quarter-finals of the 1.25 million
U.S. dollars Evert Cup tennis tournament held at Indian Wells,
California.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, making her first appearance in the event, used just 51
minutes to dispose of Babel, 6-2, 6-0. She is to face Anna
Kournikova of Russia or Chanda Rubin of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Swiss girl, who displaced Graf as the No. one
player in the world last March, captured this year's Australian
Open, her fourth Grand Slam title in two years. But she has not
advanced to the finals of any event since losing to world No. 2
Lindsay Davenport in the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 12-2 this season, finished 1997 with 12 singles titles.
</P>
<P>
Former No. one Steffi Graf of Germany, the third seed and a
two-time champion at the Evert Cup, continued her return from knee
surgery when she faced No. 11 Ai Sugiyama of Japan in a
third-round match.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the 1994 and 1996 champion, is playing in just her second
tournament and fourth match since undergoing season-ending knee
surgery. After several setbacks in her comeback attempt this
season, she finally made her debut at last month's Faber Grand
Prix in Germany, losing to Sabine Appelmans in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, No. 15 Natasha Zvereva of Belaru ousted sixth
seed Irina Spirlea of Romania by 6-3, 7-5. And unseeded American
Sandra Cacic upset ninth seed Sandrine Testud of France by 4-6,
7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3).

<HEADLINE> Vegetable Prices Soar in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable prices in New
Zealand have soared in recent days, prompting complaints from
customers and supermarkets alike, the Wellington newspaper The
Evening Post reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said prices for such common vegetables like lettuce,
cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage have doubled or even tripled
those last year.
</P>
<P>
Customers are complaining about the prices and supermarkets
have to put up notices apologizing for the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets said they are losing money despite the high
prices. For instance, one cauliflower is selling for 3.99 New
Zealand dollars (2.3 U.S. dollars), but its cost for the
supermarket itself stands at 4.2 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon is being blamed for the price rises with
hot wet weather in prime growing areas causing vegetables to rot
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that three months will be needed for bringing
the supply back to normal as a planting cycle usually takes that
long.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Eases Rules on Lending to Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has proposed
to relax restrictions for Bangkok International Banking Facilities
(BIBF) to increase cash available to local exporters, the Bangkok
Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the country's efforts to boost export, which is
crucial for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
According to central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi,
regulators are to make three changes in BIBF operations.
</P>
<P>
First, the central bank will reduce the minimum loan through
BIBF to exporters from 2 million U.S. dollars to 500,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The change is effective for borrowers who generate more than
half their revenue from exports. Those who generate more than half
their revenue through product sales or services to exporters are
also involved.
</P>
<P>
Second, BIBF will be allowed to buy unrestricted amount of
foreign currency-denominated export bills from local firms.
</P>
<P>
Previously, BIBF were allowed to buy letters of credit at
discount only from overseas sources, excluding importers and
exporters of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Third, BIBF are to be allowed to guarantee foreign-currency
debt, including letters of credit, for local clients borrowing
from Thai commercial banks or overseas institutions.
</P>
<P>
Local bankers are said to welcome these changes, saying they
would ease liquidity pressures in the economy and boost foreign
capital in the system.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is still waiting for the approval by Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.

<P>
TOKYO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government approved
four financial system reform bills on Tuesday, including those
designed to implement the "Big Bang" sweeping deregulation of
financial markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bills were formulated by the Finance Ministry in line with
proposals put forward last June by the Securities and Exchange
Council and two other advisory panels on financial issues,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
They feature liberalization of brokerage commissions, changes
to the current licensing system to a register-based one for new
entrants to the securities business, and abolishing barriers
between the banking, brokerage and insurance businesses by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Of the four bills, two are aimed at promoting special-purpose
companies to scrutinize property-backed bad loans owed by Japanese
banks.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to submit the bills to the Diet
(parliament) by the end of this week so they can be enacted by the

<HEADLINE> Mekong Sub-region Investment Projects Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Some investment projects under
the great Mekong sub-region economic cooperation program will be
suspended for another two years because of the financial crisis in
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Krisda Piampongsant, director of the ASEAN trade and economic
affairs division, said Tuesday that the projects were postponed
after considering that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had to
provide huge loan packages to help bail out cash strapped Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Krisda was speaking at an on-going seminar on a training
program called export promotion for greater Mekong sub-region
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to participants in the seminar, the ADB currently
fell short of funds to help carry out the Mekong projects.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has provided more than 12 billion U.S. dollars to
Thailand in its bailout package, and has provided funds to
Indonesia and south Korea, which are also facing steep economic
downturns.
</P>
<P>
Under the Mekong program, the investment projects cover the
following areas of development sectors: transport and
communications, energy, telecommunication, human resources and
development, tourism, environment and natural resource management.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to open a gateway to the Chinese
market. Moreover, if the proposed ASEAN free trade area is
established in 2003, the program, especially its transportation
projects, will help boost the flow of goods and investment through
the region.
</P>
<P>
Priority transportation projects include upgrading connections
linking Ho Chi Minh city of Vietnam, Phnom Penh of Cambodia, and
Bangkok. The projects will also build a road between Chiang Rai of
Thailand and Kunming of China via Laos.
</P>
<P>
Between Thailand and Laos, there will be a linkage of both land
and air transportation networks. The tourism industry is seen as a
sector with high potential, and participants in the program have
joined efforts to offer river tour packages for the booming Mekong
river area.

SOFIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Romania are leading the
way in a new era of cooperation in the Balkans, Bulgaria Foreign
Minister Nadezhda Mihailova said Monday.
</P>

Bulgarian-Romanian ties can serve as a model for bilateral

Monday.

Plesu said, "This day aroused in us a feeling of regional
responsibility and confidence in the prospects for our
cooperation."
</P>

The two governments were willing to join the EU and NATO and to
cooperate in regional stabilization and integration in Europe,
Plesu said.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to issue a joint statement asking to be
removed from the EU's visa blacklist at the European Conference on

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Declines to Take up Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court,
increasingly skeptical of efforts to give minorities special help
without proof of discrimination, on Monday refused to revive a
Florida county's affirmative-action program for awarding
construction contracts.
</P>
<P>
The court turned down Dade County's argument that
discrimination in the local construction industry is severe enough
to justify an effort to aid black-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
The court also declined to hear an appeal by a minority
contractors' group that sought to reinstate portions of similar
programs in Dade County for companies owned by Hispanics and women.
</P>
<P>
The affirmative action is a formal effort to provide employment
and education opportunities for women and ethnic minorities to
overcome past patterns of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The justice has strictly limited programs of affirmative action
in state and local public works projects since 1989, saying such
efforts must be narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of past
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"We know there is discrimination and that it's unfortunately
alive and well," said Thomas F. Pepe, a lawyer who represents the
Allied Minority Contractors Association. "It's just that it's very
difficult to prove discrimination."
</P>
<P>
With the proper research on the continuing effects of
discrimination, it is possible to win court decisions upholding
affirmative action programs, Pepe said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Supreme Court said federal programs that aim to
help minorities must meet the same strict standard required of
state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The high court also has restricted the use of racial
considerations in drawing election districts, while lower courts
have cut back on affirmative action in public university admission
policies.
</P>
<P>
In another affirmative-action case Monday, the court rejected
an appeal of a former Nevada college professor who said she was
discriminated because she is white.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Re-elected Indonesia's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Soeharto was re-elected President
of Indonesia on Tuesday for a fresh five-year term, making the
retired general one of the longest-serving heads of state in the
world.
</P>
<P>
His re-election, a foregone conclusion, was agreed upon by the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) without taking a
poll.
</P>
<P>
"Since there was only one presidential candidate, he is
automatically formalized as president according to the law,"
Chairman of the Assembly Harmoko said at the 10th plenary session
of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest legislative body which started
its general session on March 1 will end on Wednesday after
endorsing the State Policy guideline for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's re-election was assured early last month when the
main political groups, including the ruling Golkar party and the
powerful military, gave him their supports.
</P>
<P>
Since he came to power in 1967, Soeharto has stood unopposed in
all seven elections in the giant Southeast Asian country with a
population of 202 million.
</P>
<P>
The re-election is the climax of the Assembly which consisted
of elected parliamentarians and a slightly greater number of
appointed members.
</P>
<P>
The president will take his oath of office at the Assembly on
Wednesday after which representatives will elect and swear in the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
The election of the vice president will be held on Wednesday
before the conclusion of the Assembly meeting that day .
</P>
<P>
All five assembly factions -- the Armed Forces, the ruling
Golkar Party, the United Development Party (PPP), the Indonesian
Democratic party (PDI) and regional representatives -- have named
State Minister of Research and Technology Yusuf Habibie as the
sole candidate for the vice presidency.

<HEADLINE> China to Spend One Billion Yuan on Marine Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China will spend one billion yuan
(120 million US dollars) in developing marine science and
technology before 2000, an oceanologist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Jianhai, deputy director of the Marine Research Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said nine research projects
related to marine science and technology have been included into
China's national program for scientific and technological
development from 1996 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The projects, which cover ocean environment monitoring,
offshore oil and gas exploitation and comprehensive use of marine
resources, have a total investment of approximately one billion
yuan," said Xiang, who is also a deputy to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature in session here
since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his institute is expected to receive 50 million
yuan in research funds this year alone, while the country totally
spent less than 100 million yuan on marine science and technology
in the previous five-year period from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
"With a growing pressure from population, resources and the
environment, the mankind has been increasingly compelled to seek
economic growth from the oceans, and the next century will witness
a comprehensive development of marine resources by humans," the
oceanologist predicted.
</P>
<P>
China has a coastline of more than 18,000 km and three million
sq km of sea territories, or one third of its land space.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that by 2050, the population in China's
coastal areas will surge to 50 percent of the country's total from
the current 40 percent, with at least 800 million people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the early 1990s, marine economy in
China has maintained an average annual growth rate of about 22
percent, doubling the average growth rate of China's gross
domestic product in the past five years. In 1996, the total output
value of China's marine economy reached 285 billion yuan (35
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Xiang acknowledged that China still lags far behind
the developed countries in terms of marine science and technology
and in developing marine resources.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing session of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
several CPPCC members have suggested that the central government
set up a special committee to regulate and promote the country's
marine economy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Likely to Call For Emergency Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry and the
Bank of Thailand would likely call for emergency aid if the baht
comes under attack, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said.
</P>
<P>
"The baht riding between 45 and 46 baht per U.S. dollar is
normal. But if the baht slides much lower, we may call for
financial help from the IMF," Tarrin told reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the aid would help strengthen the country's foreign
reserves which currently stand at 26.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The baht on Monday ended lower at 44.50 to the dollar, compared
with 44.40 at the previous close trading.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the baht's weakness to Indonesia's failure
to secure another batch of loans from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Tarrin admitted that the IMF's delay over Indonesia's rescue
loan as well as the ailing banking sector in Malaysia have had a
moderate impact on the baht.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was confident that the support of leaders from
both the United States and Japan would help get investors
confidence back on track soon in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In another development, analysts of U.S.-based international
rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Monday met with Thai
authorities for a review after the agency earlier lowered
Thailand's rating to junk bond status. Moody's rival, Standard and
Poor's, met with the authorities last week, the Nation newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We invite the rating agencies to review Thailand's ratings and
get updated information," Tarrin said.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebel's Bomb Kills Five in Eastern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A policeman and four civilians
were killed Monday evening in a bomb blast carried out by rebels
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at Eravur, Eastern
Province of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The bomb missed a military convoy it had targeted at, but
devastated the area including several shops and injured two other
policemen and 15 civilians, according to the Island newspaper
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the bomb had been assembled into a tractor by
the LTTE rebels and placed in a motor garage to wait for the
convoy to pass.
</P>
<P>
Although the convoy arrived on time, the blast had no effect on
it but instead blew up the tractor driver and cleaner to pieces.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who are fighting for survival in the north where
government forces have launched a major offensive to clear 75
kilometers of roadway through rebel-held territory, have been
launching attacks in other areas to divert attention from the
north.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 15-year-old war for a separate
state in the country's north and east. The government says more
than 55,000 people have been killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Last week a lone LTTE suicide bomber drove his vehicle into
Downtown Colombo, killing 38 people and injuring about 300 others.

<HEADLINE> Dai Ethnic Charm Lures Tourists to Festival (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Yan Hanpeng, 60, once wondered how
the Water Splashing Festival could lure increasing tourists to
remote Xishuangbanna.
</P>
<P>
"We've celebrated the festival for generations, and it is only
now that it has become a tourist attraction," said Yan, a member
of the Dai ethnic group from Gasa Township.
</P>
<P>
As tourists kept coming, he decided to open a Dai inn, which
has become a booming business.
</P>
<P>
Through more direct contacts with his guests, he has a better
understanding of tourists and their interest in the Dai folklore.
</P>
<P>
"They are obsessed with every bit of our life, from the unique
festivals and bamboo houses, to the colorful costumes and food,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna in southwest China's Yunnan Province is China's
only autonomous prefecture of the Dai ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 1.8 million tourists across China and the
world visited Xishuangbanna, which is also known for its vast
tracts of untouched tropical rainforests, where herds of wild
elephants live.
</P>
<P>
The Water Splashing Festival, which is held around March 12, is
a highlight for tourism. According to the Dai tradition, people during
the festival put on their best clothes and splash water on each
other to extend their best wishes. During the festival, there are
usually a dozen fully loaded daily flights bringing tourists from
Kunming, the provincial capital, to Jinghong, the prefectural
capital. Hotel rooms are so full that tourists have to make
reservations early.

Xishuangbanna tourist authorities have opened several Dai
villages to tourists. Climbing up the steps, guests enter a
suspended bamboo house where they see how traditional and modern
ways of life are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
Travelers can also take a walk in the village where they can
appreciate Dai dancing and singing, and buy local products in
village shops.
</P>
<P>
The Dai people are devout Buddhists and all Dai boys become monks
at the age of 7 or 8. In almost every village there is a Buddhist
temple, which also draws tourists.
</P>
<P>
Despite their cultural and tourist value, some Dai villages
have been destroyed to pave the way for modern construction. In an
effort to preserve the Dai culture and architecture, and to
develop tourism, the provincial government has designated a number
of Dai villages to retain the original layouts and architectural
style forever.
</P>
<P>
The government has also worked out rules governing the
preservation of forests and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
"With so many people interested in and taking care of our
culture and the living environment, we feel closer to the world,"
Yan said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Indonesian President Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
Tuesday was re-elected to a seventh five-year term (1998-2003).
Here is a profile of the president.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was born in a farmer family in the densely-populated
Central Java on June 8, 1921. His father was a village staff in
charge of water distribution service.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a royal offspring. I am the son of Kertosudiro, a
village staff responsible for water distribution service with no
piece of land at all," Soeharto said in his biography.
</P>
<P>
He only received formal education at a junior high school, but
later with the military training and education, he won his laurels
and obtained the highest military and civilian positions.
</P>
<P>
Starting as a non-commissioned officer in the Dutch colonial
army and a member of the Indonesian militia during the Japanese
occupation, Soeharto was promoted to the country's military
leadership when he distinguished himself during the fight for
independence in the second half of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was regimental commander, brigadier general and major
general from 1945 to 1962. From 1970 to 1965, he worked as deputy
chief of army staff and then as chief of army staff between 1965
and 1968.
</P>
<P>
He became acting president in 1967 to replace Indonesia's
founding president Soekarno. Then he became president in 1968. He
has since run unopposed and elected by acclamation for six times.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was Known as the "father of development" in Indonesia.
Under his leadership, Indonesia's per capita gross domestic
product jumped from a mere 60 U.S. dollars in 1966 when he came
into power to the current more than 1,000 dollars. Indonesia, the
formerly world's largest rice importer, became self-sufficient in
the crop in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto also drove Indonesia's economy away from a
dependency on oil and gas export earnings by boosting exports of
manufactured products, textiles and wood products.
</P>
<P>
At present, Soeharto is leading his country to cope with the
monetary crisis that started in July last year and hit other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has played an important role in international affairs,
especially in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and the Non-Aligned Movement. He supports the South-South
cooperation and the establishment of a new political and economic
order in the world.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 76, has three sons and three daughters who have
already given him a number of grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Italy's Efforts in Joining Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Finance and economy ministers from
the European Union endorsed Italy's admission to the single
currency after hearing Rome's plans to cut its national debt and
budget deficit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government plans to reduce the budget deficit to
1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2001 and cut the
national debt to 100 percent in six years, Italy's Treasury and
Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said at a meeting of EU
ministers in Brussels today.
</P>
<P>
Though skeptical of Rome's resolve to slash deficit and debt
figures in the future, Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm
expressed satisfaction with Ciampi's plans.
</P>
<P>
"Just on the basis of 1997 accounts one could have many doubts
about the sustainability of Italy's efforts," he said. "But today
Ciampi illustrated to us a plan that goes up to 2001."
</P>
<P>
He said he was sure Italy's budget deficit and national debt
would continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
"The plan has the support of parliament, and this is a crucial
point because it means that budgetary rigor will carry on in
coming years," Zalm added.
</P>
<P>
Italy also gained some support from its EU partners to reduce
its national debt, which at 121 percent of GDP is twice the 60
percent criterion for participating the economic and monetary
union.
</P>
<P>
The European Monetary Institute will urge countries with high
national debt, namely Belgium and Italy, to cut the rate to 60
percent in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Ciampi has unveiled a plan to reduce the rate to
the required level within 12 to 18 years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Issues Temporary Provisions on Transient Children's Schooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A temporary provision has been
issued jointly by China's National Education Commission (NEC) and
the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) to ensure that all transient
children attend school.
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that in many of China's coastal areas and
large cities, more transient laborers are bringing their families
with them. This increases the number of transient children and
creates a problem for the government in providing schools.
</P>
<P>
In a circulation released today, both the NEC and the MPS urged
related departments to take active measures to create more
educational opportunities for transient children.
</P>
<P>
According to the temporary provision, the main channel for
transient children's schooling is to go to local full-time public
schools.
</P>
<P>
The provision also calls for the establishment of special
private schools for transient children.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Proposes Barter Trade with Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Vietnamese trade delegation has
proposed a system of barter trade with Thailand to boost bilateral
trade and limit dependence on hard currencies, Commerce Ministry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation held
Monday, senior officials from both countries held wide-ranging
talks on trade and investment, technical cooperation, cooperation
on energy, fisheries, transportation, tourism and order at sea.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese delegation, headed by Vice Minister of Planning
and Investment Vu Huy Hoang, proposed a barter trade with Thailand
to realize the target of one billion U.S. dollars in bilateral
trade this year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries witnessed 700-million dollar trade volume
last year, a jump of about 20 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Both Thailand and Vietnam would like to reduce their dependence
on hard currencies after the baht and the dong depreciated against
the dollar since the financial crisis broke out in last July.

<HEADLINE> Sino-UNDP Project to Disinfect Stored Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A sino-UNDP project launched
earlier this years is protecting stored grain from pests through
advanced radiation technology in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will invest a total of 1.3 million US
dollars in this project while receiving 452,000 US dollars in
grant assistance from the United Nations Development Program to
demonstrate reusable and clean methods of ridding warehouses of
agricultural pests.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out in Beijing and Fangcheng port
in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, an important grain
transfer station.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua Science Park, affiliated with Qinghua University, and
Fangcheng Harbour Administration are the implementing agencies.
</P>
<P>
A rough estimate puts China's post-harvest grain losses at 92
million tons per year, nearly 20 percent of the gross grain output
of the country.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of that, or 23 million tons worth five billion
US dollars was lost to insect infestation.
</P>
<P>
The country's current methods of chemical fumigation are not
only expensive and unsafe but also environment hazardous.
</P>
<P>
Radiation technology can decrease and eventually eliminate the
use of chemicals in grain disinfestation, helping to protect the
environment.

GENEVA -- Currencies in Latin American and East European

The Basle-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also

The risk premium on Latin American and Eastern European
countries' foreign currency securities quickly retreated from

The subdued pace of securities issues in the second half of the

<P>
URUMQI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have recently
succeeded in digging a fresh-water well in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region's Lop Nur area.
</P>
<P>
This is the first fresh water well in this so-called "dry pole"
of the world.
</P>
<P>
The 465-m-deep well produces 452.5 cubic meters of water daily.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, a team from the Regional Geological Inspection
Bureau has gone to the Lop Nur 11 times to work.
</P>
<P>
The Lop Nur was a lake in the past, surrounded by forests and
grassland. Since 1972, it has been a dry and barren landscape, and
many scientists and explorers gave their lives because of the lack
of water, while working there.
</P>
<P>
The authorities concerned have decided to set up a transfer
station where the well is located, with houses and trees and grass
to protect travelers from the sun.

<HEADLINE> China Eximbank Funding Two Ventures in Cameroon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China (Eximbank) has signed two Chinese government concessional
loan agreements with the Cameroon National Investment Corp,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources have reported that the loans, worth tens of
millions of yuan, will be used to establish two joint ventures in
Cameroon: a tyre renovation factory and a tractor assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
China's Gansu Tyre Factory and Wuhan Tractor Plant will be
involved in the two projects which will create job opportunities
for Cameroon and help the development of that country's rubber
industry, agricultural machinery and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The projects will help promote China's export of machinery
equipment and technology, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government concessional loans are now a major part of
China's foreign aid program since China decided in 1995 that it
would no longer provide interest-free loans to other counties. It
aims to expand the scale of China's foreign aid to help developing
countries promote their economic growth and fortify Sino-foreign
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, the Eximbank had provided such loans on
nearly 30 projects in such fields as oil exploration, forestry,
gold mining, fish processing, automobile assembly and railway
upgrading. The loans mainly go to the developing countries, like
Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Papua New Guinea and Guyana.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments Decline in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign equity investments
registered with the Philippine Central Bank dropped 17.8 percent
to 1.053 billion U.S. dollars last year from 1.281 billion dollars
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The drop was indicative of the foreign investors' skittishness,
an aftermath of the regional currency crisis, the Business World
Tuesday quoted central bank director for economic research Diwa
Guinigundo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Guinigundo said the July 11 de facto devaluation of the peso
last year resulted in the outflow of dollars as foreign fund
managers began repatriating their investments.
</P>
<P>
"In the first nine months of last year, we already saw
portfolio investments and direct investments go down," he said.
</P>
<P>
The largest drop in registered investments was seen in the
manufacturing sector which contracted 65 percent to 172.19 million
dollars from 477.69 million dollars in 1996, the latest data from
the central bank showed.
</P>
<P>
Investments in banks and other financial institutions fell 56
percent to 226.36 million dollars from 513.26 million dollars.
Investments in banks, in particular, showed a drop of 67 percent
to 112.6 million dollars from 342.98 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
An increase was only exhibited in investments for the
construction and public utilities sectors.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the construction sector, composed of transport
facilities, infrastructure, building and general engineering, rose
to 242.75 million dollars from just 45.36 million dollars the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Business Booming at Port on China-Vietnam Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hekou County on the
Sino-Vietnamese border, formerly a marshland, has grown into a
boomtown since the state approved a port there in 1992 as part of
the nationwide effort to open wider to the outside.
</P>
<P>
Le Kien Hong, a Vietnamese businessman, buys several hundred
tons of potatoes in Hekou every month, before he moves them back to
his home country through the port.
</P>
<P>
"People in my country like potatoes very much, but we don't
have enough," Le said. "That's why I have chosen the potato
business. And what's more, China's potatoes are of high quality
and at low prices."
</P>
<P>
The county faces the Vietnamese town of Lai Cao across the Nanxi
River, straddled by a 200-meter bridge which enables trains,
vehicles and pedestrians to pass. The city proper now has smooth
roads, new buildings and crowds of people.
</P>
<P>
Every day, several thousand traders come and go through the
port. The county had more than 700 million yuan in imports and
exports in 1997 -- 18 times that of 1989, 600 Vietnamese-funded
warehouses, and 180 border trade businesses opened by
Chinese provinces, according to local statistics.
</P>
<P>
Hekou has a population of 80,000, but it now receives more than
3,000 tourists from at home and abroad daily. It has built 33
hotels with 2,700 beds and telephone service accessible to 120
countries and regions, said the county's deputy magistrate, Long
Shiqiu.
</P>
<P>
"It's no more than 300 kilometers to go by train from Hekou to
Hanoi, capital of Vietnam. So farm produce and agricultural
byproducts, and metals like tin and copper in southwest China, are
being shipped overseas, while cotton yarn, gasoline, and
cigarettes are moving into China," he added.

<P>
NANJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The authorities of Nanjing, the
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, plans to take steps to
protect the old residential area where high-ranking government
officials lived before 1949.
</P>
<P>
The Kuomintang government, which ruled China from 1911-1949,
had a program called the Capital Program to build Nanjing, then
the nation's capital. Many famous Chinese architects were involved
in the urban planning and construction scheme in the 1920s and
1930s.
</P>
<P>
The current program is designed to protect the old style of the
streets in that area and any buildings and houses that were built
later and are not in the traditional architectural style will be
torn down.

<P>
FUZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
found ways to help its handicapped citizens take part in social
activities and enjoy a normal life.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Board of the Provincial Federation of the
Handicapped Cai Yuanting explained its methods at a recent news
conference in Fuzhou, the capital.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has 1.61 million people with mental or physical
handicaps, accounting for 4.76 percent of the province's
population.
</P>
<P>
To assist the handicapped, the local government has established
some 300 grassroots stations and 70 special schools for them, and
in recent years, 24,000 cataract patients, nearly 4,000 deaf
children, and more than 7,000 polio patients have gotten help
through government programs.
</P>
<P>
The government has also provided at least 10 million yuan in
special funds to help poverty-stricken handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still 150,000 handicapped people in Fujian
living with poverty, and nearly 35 percent of school-aged retarded
children in the province are out of school, while 30 percent of
adults with handicaps are jobless, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Eleven provincial government departments recently held their
annual campaign to increase support for people with
handicaps.

<HEADLINE> WHO Reaffirms Passive Smoking Causes Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
reaffirmed here Monday that passive smoking causes lung cancer in
non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
WHO made the statement at a time when the organization was, in
recent news reports, accused of suppressing information and having
withheld from publication its own report of a study which
supposedly failed to scientifically prove that there is an
association between passive smoking and a number of diseases, lung
cancer in particular.
</P>
<P>
The results of this study, WHO stressed, are very much in line
with the results of similar studies both in Europe and elsewhere:
passive smoking does cause lung cancer in non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that the study found that there was an estimated 16
percent increased risk of lung cancer among non-smoking spouses of
smokers. For workplace exposure the estimated increase in risk was
17 percent.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, WHO recalled, according to usual scientific
practice, a paper reporting the main study results was sent to a
reputable scientific journal for consideration and review.
</P>
<P>
That is why the full report is not yet publicly available, WHO
said. Under the circumstances, however, the authors of the study
have agreed to make an abstract of the report available to the
media.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely important to note that the results of this
study are consistent with the results of major scientific reviews
of this question published during 1997 by the government of
Australia, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State
of California," said Neil Collishaw, acting chief of WHO's Tobacco
or Health Unit in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"A major meta-analysis of passive smoking and lung cancer was
also published in the British Medical Journal in 1997," Collishaw
said. "From these and other previous reviews of the scientific
evidence emerges a clear global scientific consensus, passive
smoking does cause lung cancer and other diseases."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It may Consult U.N. Before Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Monday
that it may consult with the other members of the U.N. Security
Council before any military action against Iraq if it failed to
abide by its agreement on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"If we got to the point where there were serious questions
about the government of Iraq's willingness to honor the memorandum
of understanding, we would of course be consulting with members of
the Security Council," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect urgent deliberations to occur if there was any
abrogation of the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on remarks by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan who said Sunday that he believed the United States was
"required" to consult with the United Nations before resorting to
any military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. had to strike, I think some sort of consultations
with the other members would be required," Annan told the ABC TV
program "This Week" Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the United States has repeatedly said it believes it
already has the authority to launch a military strike if Iraq
violates the agreement it struck with Annan last month to allow
U.N. weapons inspectors into sensitive Iraqi sites.

When asked whether the United States has from previous U.N.
resolutions adequate authority to take air strike on Iraq, McCurry
said, "That is exactly our position."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, McCurry said the United States had "a
different view" on "consultations" that Annan believed were
necessary before any U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry said he had made the earlier remarks because he
"wasn't completedly familiar with the secretary-general's
remarks."
</P>
<P>
He believed what Annan had said "simply that he expected the
United States would consult further in the event that there was
need to take additional action there if there were abrogation of
the agreement of understanding between the United Nations and
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Asked what the White House would do if it met resistance to
using force during consultations, McCurry said, "We have had very
high-level consultations with all the members of the Security
Council."
</P>
<P>
"If there were an abrogation of this current memorandum of
understanding by the government of Iraq, our judgment is: the
disposition regarding use of force would be much

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Tells Israel: Not to Play Tricks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday called on the Israeli government not to play "tricky games"
on the Mideast peace, saying only building trust will help break
the deadlock, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Israeli Maariv newspaper, the Egyptian
leader said the ball is now in the Israeli court concerning the
long-stalled Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
If Israeli leaders really want to solve the problem of South
Lebanon as they have said, then they should solve the Palestinian
problem and build trust with Syrians first, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks which started in 1991 were put on hold
after a string of suicide bombings hit Israel in early 1996. The
negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis have been stalled
for a year due to Israeli settlement buildings in occupied Arab
lands and delayed Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrians see what is happening with the Palestinians and
have no faith in you," Mubarak said, calling upon the Israelis to
implement all the deals signed with the Palestinians without
manoeuvering.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president did not deny the lukewarmness plaguing
Egyptian-Israeli relations, explaining that some professional
associations have a tough stand against cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The public opinion (in Egypt) is excited," said the president,
blaming this on Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the Monday interview, Mubarak refused to suggest a certain
percentage for Israeli redeployment in the West Bank, saying that
the size of withdrawal should be reasonable to the satisfaction of
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to ensure the security of Israel you should show
the necessary flexibility," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he cannot tell Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat the kind of redeployment or size of
withdrawal he should accept, otherwise the Egyptian side may be
blamed by the Palestinians for what consequences might ensue.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who frequently visits Egypt and consults Mubarak, calls
for Israeli withdrawal from 90 percent of the West Bank. The
Israeli government has not come up with a final proposal, but
analysts said 40-50 percent withdrawal would be the most that
could be offered.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to have peace treaty with
Israel, in 1979, but ties have remained cool. The relations
plummeted after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took
power in May 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arms Inspection in Iraq Goes on Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Nine U.N. arms inspection teams
visited 13 sites Monday in Iraq, and these visits were made with
full cooperation from the Iraqi side, an Iraqi government
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for Iraqi National Monitoring Department, the
Iraqi peer of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament
in Iraq, said that of all sites visited by the arms inspectors
Monday, three sites are not under monitoring.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inspection team led by American Scott Ritter
carried out its inspection from Sunday morning until early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. office in Baghdad refused to comment on the news that
Ritter's team visited accessory buildings of presidential
palaces.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed on February 23 by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, inspections of presidential sites should be carried
out by UNSCOM inspectors with the presence of senior diplomats
appointed by Annan.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, a 16-member arms inspection team led by Ritter
was barred from carrying out its activities by the Iraqi
government on the ground that its composition was imbalanced. That
team included nine Americans and Five Britons.
</P>
<P>
A new 50-member team led by Ritter returned to Baghdad last
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Boost Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, one of the two Arab
countries having peace treaty with Israel, signed several trade
agreements with the Jewish country here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed at a press conference after a
meeting between King Hussein of Jordan and visiting Israeli
Minister of Industry and Trade Natahn Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky and his Jordanian counterpart Hani Mulqi signed a
mutual recognition document regarding the Irbid Qualified
Industrial Zone (QIZ) in northern Jordan. Exports from the zone to
the United States are entitled to be duty-free.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the two ministers signed an agreement on establishing
an Israeli laboratory in Amman to examine Jordanian goods to
ensure they comply with Israeli specifications.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mulqi said that he also discussed with
Sharansky the renewal and expansion of a bilateral trade protocol,
which expires in October and grants tariff reduction of up to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the current talks could boost trade
volume of bilateral trade in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Jordan and Israel was no more than
35 million U.S. dollars in 1997, which was an essential leap over
that of 1996, said Mulqi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordanian-Israeli joint committee during their
Monday meetings discussed means of developing bilateral trade
relations and facilitating Jordan's trade with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), Mulqi added.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the two sides also signed a joint letter
to request European Union (EU)'s duty exemption for Jordanian and
Israeli exports to EU countries, according to Mulqi.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Jordan signed a trade partnership agreement
with the EU, allowing its products free access to Europe. Israel
has already had such agreement with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky arrived here Monday as part of efforts to restore
bilateral relations strained by Israeli agents' botched
assassination attempt on a Hamas (Islamic Resistance
Movement) leader here last September.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan is
scheduled to visit Tel Aviv on Tuesday in the first trip to
Israel by a member of Jordanian Royal family.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries that
reached peace treaty with Israel.
