   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones is shooting for an unprecedented
four gold medals at the World Track and Field Championships,
planning to postpone a bid for five titles until the 2000 Olympics.
But don't rule out Jones bringing home five World Championship
golds.
</P>
<P>
   She captured the 100 meters Sunday in a championship-record
10.70 seconds for her first gold of the competition. It was the
second gold of the meet, however, for her family. Jones' husband,
C.J. Hunter, won the shot put title Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off the emotional victory with C.J. last night and
coming in to get the victory tonight, I am extremely excited,''
Jones said. ``The plan for this whole week is to get a total of
five gold medals for the family and we started out in wonderful
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene also began his bid for multiple gold with a bang,
winning the men's 100 meters in 9.80 seconds, the second-best time
in history and only a hundredth of a second off his world record of
9.79 set in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' triumph came against the deepest field in World
Championship history, with six athletes dipping below 11 seconds.
Inger Miller was second in a lifetime-best 10.79 and Ekaterini
Thanou of Greece was third at 10.84. Gail Devers, the 1992 and 1996
Olympic champion, was fifth in 10.95.
</P>
<P>
   Jones dipped under the championship record _ and the fastest
time in the world this season _ for the second time in two days. In
Saturday's quarterfinals she ran 10.76 to break the record of 10.82
seconds set by Devers and Merlene Ottey of Jamaica in the 1993
World Championships at Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Running into a 0.1-meter-per-second headwind, Jones and Thanaou
came out of the blocks first. Jones, running in lane five, felt the
presence of Miller and Thanaou in lanes three and four, then pulled
away at the midpoint to capture her second consecutive world title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nailed my start today, which is very important for me,''
Jones said. ``I think that is the reason I pulled off the victory.
. . . I knew I had to be extremely ready and on my toes. I think I
executed very well today. I put it all together. Before I stepped
into the blocks, that was going through my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a feeling of exhilaration when Jones, 23, crossed the
finish line, thrusting both arms in triumph and giving the United
States its fourth consecutive World Championship victory in the
women's 100. Two years ago in Athens, Ga., Jones called her win the
most memorable after returning to track from basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victory in `97 was to this point the most exciting and
most important race in my life simply because I established myself
as a dominant athlete in the world of track and field,'' Jones
said. ``This is more exciting and more fun than it has ever been.
The fact that I can start off this week feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will try for her second gold in the nine-day competition
in the long- jump final today. She will also run in the 200 meters
and either the 400- or 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 100, Greene stumbled out of the blocks but was even
with Canada's Bruny Surin by 60 meters. Greene edged away in the
final 10, pulling Surin to second in a Canadian-national-record
9.84, which equaled Donovan Bailey's former world-record time of
9.84 set at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Dwain Chambers of Great Britain was third in 9.97. Americans Tim
Harden and Tim Montgomery were fifth and sixth in 10.02 and 10.04,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning was very shaky, but I did not panic,'' Greene
said. ``I stayed in control of myself and I was able to come to my
top-end speed smoothly. . . . When I finally started moving, I was
just thinking `I can come back and get them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 27, has been running with a similar attitude throughout
the 100-meter rounds. The 1996 Olympic 400-meter gold medalist from
USC lowered her personal best three times. She ran 10.86 in the
quarterfinals to dip under her best of 10.95 set in 1995. In
Sunday's semis, Miller timed 10.81 before knocking off
two-hundredths more in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the final, you have to let everything out,''
said Miller, who trains at UCLA and is the daughter of Jamaican
Olympian Lennox Miller. ``I'm going to critique my race with my
coach (Bruins sprint coach John Smith) and see how I can improve,
but I'm happy. There's nothing to complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the women's heptathlon, Shelia Burrell of Reseda was the top
American, placing 11th with 6,162 points. The Cal State Northridge
assistant track coach entered the second day in 13th place, posting
marks of 19-2} in the long jump, 148-9 in the javelin and 2:11.52
in the 800. Burrell, the 1999 national champion, ran the 800 with
her right ankle heavily taped and had to be helped to the medical
area by two volunteers after the event because of arch pain.

Hartford Civic Center Coliseum by Promise Keepers, an evangelical
Christian ministry. The group is trying to increase attendance at
its rallies. More than 12,000 men had packed into the basketball
arena for the rally. The group has largely faded from public view
since its ``Stand in the Gap'' rally drew hundreds of thousands of
men to the National Mall in Washington in 1997. The group has
shrunk but is still huge, with 180 full-time employees and annual
revenues of $41 million. (George Ruhe/New York Times Photo)

adjustments and managed to expand during Russia's financial crisis.
For a time, it had looked as if the financial crisis that struck
Russia last August would sound the death knell for restaurants like
Yolki-Palki, a chain of Moscow eateries aimed squarely at the small
but emerging middle class. The plunging ruble was sending costs
through the roof and scaring away customers. ``You really have to
be prepared for anything in this country,'' says the owner Arkady
Novikov. (Jacqueline Mia Foster/New York Times Photo)

altered seed crops, says testing is the only way to determine if
protesters' concern about dangers of such crops is justified.
``Let's face it, there are a lot of considerations in Britain that
don't apply elsewhere,'' says Fiddaman, ``the fact that agriculture
is not spread out across broad spaces but is close to inhabited
areas and the whole tradition here of wanting to keep land pure and
unspoiled even by conventional agriculture.'' (Carlos

CLEMENCY OPENS OLD SCARS FOR SONS OF BOMBING VICTIM
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the bomb planted by Puerto Rican terrorists
in a Wall Street restaurant exploded 24 years ago, the sons of a
banker slain in the blast have etched the details in their memories
with a clarity that mirrors the crisp winter sunshine that day.
</P>
<P>
   They remember returning from school for lunch to their suburban
New Jersey home and hearing on the kitchen radio about an explosion
in far-off Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They remember watching their mother lay out the long, flat
strips of pasta for a lasagna dinner, a favorite meal both boys
requested to mark their recent birthdays. And they remember being
called in early from their games to find a knot of men in dark
suits who told them there would be no need to race to the train in
the late afternoon. Their father, Frank T. Connor, would not come
home again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung on to the memories of my childhood, more than other
kids, I think, because that is all I had of him,'' said Joseph
Connor, who was 9 then and is now 33, the same age as his father on
the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced on Aug. 11 a conditional offer of
commutation for 16 members of the group that claimed responsibility
for the attack at the restaurant, Fraunces Tavern, which killed
four and injured more than 60 people. Now Joseph and his older
brother, Thomas, 35, veer between outrage and gloom when they say
no one will ever be held accountable for their father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group claimed responsibility for the attack, no
individual ever did, and no one was ever charged in connection with
the bombing. None of those being offered clemency were convicted of
shedding blood.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers believe that the president is pandering to Hispanic
voters in New York to help his wife's likely Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling about the clemency is that it is something that is
completely politically motivated,'' Thomas Connor said. ``It's to
help Hillary get the Puerto Rican vote. There is no other
possibility. To say these people are nonviolent is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has rarely granted clemency. Of 3,042
applications filed since 1993 seeking a commuted sentence, Clinton
had granted just three, according to the Office of the Pardon
Attorney at the justice department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that no one had ever been tried for my father's
death,'' Joseph Connor said. ``But it made me feel good that
members of this organization had been put away for a long time. To
have them be released tears open the whole wound again. I mean, why
release terrorists? Why?''
</P>
<P>
   The group that claimed responsibility for the bombing, the Armed
Forces of National Liberation _ known more commonly by its Spanish
initials, FALN _ sought immediate independence for Puerto Rico.
Between 1974 and 1983, law enforcement officials attributed at
least 130 bombings to the group and designated it a terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 were convicted of crimes like seditious
conspiracy, possession of an unregistered firearm or interstate
transportation of a stolen vehicle. Some were sentenced to more
than 50 years in jail, sentences the president deemed out of
proportion with the crimes, administration officials said. Most
have already served 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the FALN, William Morales, who is suspected of
being one of the main people behind the Fraunces Tavern bombing,
escaped from a prison ward in Bellevue Hospital in 1979 and now
lives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Fraunces Tavern attack by a reporter from The
Cleveland Plain Dealer in 1993, Morales said it was a response to
an attack on a group of nationalists in Puerto Rico that had been
coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The FALN said the same thing in a note left at the bombing, the
bloodiest attack for which they claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound heartless to say it that way, but it is hard to
fight a war without bystanders getting injured,'' he said during
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   In offering the commutation, Clinton required that each person
first renounce the use of violence and agree to comply with normal
parole requirements. Those conditions were protested by the
politicians and organizations who have lobbied for the releases for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nydia M. Velazquez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York,
for example, said the releases should be unconditional. ``The
political nature of the charges gave way to disproportionate and
unjust sentences _ placing conditions on them now is a continuation
of the injustices that began almost two decades ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Connor brothers consider renouncing violence to be a
minimum requirement before members of the group they hold
responsible for their father's death go free.
</P>
<P>
   The commutations were extended after a high-profile campaign
that included appeals from former President Jimmy Carter and
Cardinal John O'Connor, but there is no organized group of FALN
victims, the Connor brothers said, and no prominent advocates for
their side.
</P>
<P>
   They say that other people who were wounded in the group's
attacks, including three former New York City police officers whose
injuries range from blindness to lost limbs, are also outraged
about freedom for the convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never apologized for what they have done, they have
never renounced violence,'' Thomas Connor said. ``They got
extremely long sentences because of the violence of their
organization, for which they took credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connors said that they have no opinion on the issue of
Puerto Rican independence, and that they think the people of the
island should be allowed to vote to determine their own future.
They believe their father would have felt the same way. (Puerto
Ricans have consistently voted against independence.)
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, the sons' lives mirror their father's. Both have
young families and live in the suburbs. They live near their
mother, who remarried about five years after the bombing. Both sons
are also New York bankers. Both are wary of drawing attention to
themselves; they do not want their pictures taken or any details of
their family lives printed.
</P>
<P>
   The father was an assistant vice president of Morgan Guaranty
Trust when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wrestled in high school, other kids had their dads
there, I never did, `' Joseph Connor said. ``He missed so many life
events _ my graduation from college, my wedding, the birth of my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by that I don't think about him,'' he said.

adjustments and managed to expand during Russia's financial crisis.
For a time, it had looked as if the financial crisis that struck
Russia last August would sound the death knell for restaurants like
Yolki-Palki, a chain of Moscow eateries aimed squarely at the small
but emerging middle class. The plunging ruble was sending costs
through the roof and scaring away customers. ``You really have to

altered seed crops, says testing is the only way to determine if
protesters' concern about dangers of such crops is justified.
``Let's face it, there are a lot of considerations in Britain that
don't apply elsewhere,'' says Fiddaman, ``the fact that agriculture
is not spread out across broad spaces but is close to inhabited
areas and the whole tradition here of wanting to keep land pure and
unspoiled even by conventional agriculture.'' (Carlos

   (NYT4) NEW YORK -- Aug. 22, 1999 -- OBIT-CASTELLI-1, 8-22 -- Leo
Castelli, the New York art dealer in his Manhattan gallery in 1997.
Castelli, who played an extraordinary role in shaping contemporary
American art and fostering international acceptance of painters
like Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Roy Lichtenstein, died
on Saturday at his Manhattan home. He was 91. Castelli emerged as
one of the most influential American art dealers of the century in
the late 1950s, when Abstract Expressionism began to ebb, and for
decades helped develop and promote the Pop, Minimal, Conceptual and
Neo-Expressionist movements. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times

The St. Louis Cardinals Mark McGwire hitting his 50th home run the
year against the New York Mets on Sunday at Shea Stadium. McGwire
made history once again by becoming the first player to reach 50
homers in four consecutive seasons. McGwire's 50th homer looked
routine compared to his first-inning blast. He led off the seventh
with a fly ball that just cleared the outstretched glove of Shawon
Dunston in left-center and landed just over the 396-foot sign.
Still, the Mets came from five runs down to beat the Cardinals 8-7.

the year against the New York Mets on Sunday, in the first game of
a double-header. Big Mac launched the monstrous homer, an estimated
502 feet, in the first-inning, and shattered a light bulb on the
scoreboard. Still, the Mets came from five runs down to beat the
Cardinals 8-7 on Edgardo Alfonzo's RBI single in the ninth inning.

THE BIG CITY: TOLLS IN THE HAMPTONS WOULD UNCLOG ROADS 
</HEADLINE>
 - CITY-NYT (ms) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people of the Hamptons have it in their power to help all
Americans, and, in the traditional spirit of the Hamptons, they can
make out quite nicely themselves, too. They can show everyone else
how to end traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on failed strategies _ building more
highways, trying to limit sprawl, exhorting people to drive less _
Hamptonites can buy their way out of traffic. They can afford to
adopt economists' favorite method of unclogging traffic: road
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   If slots on highways were priced like airline seats or telephone
calls, traffic would not come to a standstill at rush hour. The
rates could be raised during peak periods to prevent demand from
exceeding supply. The theory has always made wonderful sense, but
until recently it seemed much too complicated to try on a real
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Now road pricing become technically feasible thanks to
electronic toll systems. Some, like EZPass, use radio waves;
others, like one used on a tollway in Toronto, photograph each
license plate. In the newest systems, drivers don't even have to
slow down for the toll to be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   With the technological problem solved, the only remaining
obstacles are political. Once drivers are accustomed to the free
use of a road, they are outraged by the idea of paying for it. In
most places, politicians who supported a new toll would be accused
of gouging the middle class and banishing the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hamptons are a special place. The New Yorkers who brave
the bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Montauk Highway, Route 27,
could not object convincingly to a toll. How could they complain
about price-gouging when they're paying $50,000 a month for a small
beach house that is not even on the beach? How could they pretend
to care about excluding the poor when they are headed for towns
zoned to keep out the middle class?
</P>
<P>
   The logical place for a toll is at the entrance to the Hamptons,
where Route 27 crosses the Shinnecock Canal and narrows from four
lanes to two. You could start with a toll just at peak hours on
weekends. Although some Hamptonites doubt that any toll would make
a difference _ one investment banker told me he would not be
deterred by anything less than $1,000 _ road experts are confident
it would not take much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a wealthy area like the Hamptons,'' said Peter Samuel,
the editor of Toll Roads Newsletter, ``I suspect that a couple of
bucks would be enough to make a difference. After all, you don't
need to deter many people. Just getting 20 percent of the drivers
to avoid Route 27 at peak times could get traffic flowing much more
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   However much of a toll it takes _ $2, $5, $25 _ there could be
protections for the non-rich local residents and workers. There
might be no toll on the alternative route across the Shinnecock
Canal, the Montauk Highway. Or perhaps both routes would be tolled,
but the locals would be exempted, just as they're now exempted from
the fees summer renters pay for parking permits at the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel B. Klein, an economist at Santa Clara University, points
to a precedent in New York State last century, when private
turnpikes allowed free passage to people living within a mile of a
toll gate. But it would make more sense, he said, to give the
locals some incentive to stay off the road during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might charge locals at a discount rate _ say, 50 percent
of the toll, or maybe just 10 percent,'' Klein said. ``There still
might be complaints from locals who have to cross the canal
frequently. But if they're using the road a lot, they'll appreciate
how much time they've saving. They might be paying only 10 percent
of the toll each trip, but they'll be reaping 100 percent of the
benefits of improved road conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   As a further enticement, the locals could be allowed to pocket
the toll revenues. The money could be divided up equally among all
local drivers, so that EZPass (or whoever operated the system)
would mail out an annual rebate check to drivers living east of the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money might also be earmarked for a popular local
cause, like buying up farmland so that it is protected from
developers. That way the locals could enjoy more open space in
their towns without having to pay for it. And the visiting drivers
could finally enjoy some open space in front of their windshields.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It's Saturday, time for my weekly errands on Broadway. I start
at the Food Emporium between 89th and 90th. On the lower level, the
food demonstrator presents me with an eggplant dip and a Greek
Easter salad; the bakery has samples of French nut cake, the deli
has samples of ham and the fish department offers imitation crab.
Upstairs, the meat department gives chunks of its store-made
sausages.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks down, I stop at Hot and Crusty, which invites me to
sample their muffins and bread. On to Zabar's, cheese and
raisin-nut bread samples and several varieties of pate on crackers
_ whitefish, smoked salmon, crab, lobster _ distributed throughout
the store.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, on the way, Godiva chocolates, a new addition to the avenue,
which invites passers-by to sample their brewed coffee and
chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   The 76th Street market _ cheese chunks and their hummus on bread
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   One more stop. Citarella on 75th Street. Cheese and samples of
pastry on the upper level and poached salmon on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   Getting full! Enough _ no dinner tonight.

</P>
<P>
   Players: Barbara and Aaron Cooper, and their granddaughter
Shauna Gillen, 10, dragging her feet, obviously hot and tired.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cooper: ``If you're tired, think how I feel. I'm seven times
your age.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cooper: ``You can figure that out. You're good in math.''

   Shauna: ``I don't do math in the summer.''

   The recent spell of hot weather reminded David Fishlow of his
return to New York in the 1970s after a stint in Texas. He thought
he would make the sweltering day more bearable by having a
remembered summer treat of his Bronx and Queens childhood. He and
some colleagues from his office took off for lunch at a nearby
delicatessen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have the borscht with sour cream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borscht?'' said the waiter in an incredulous voice. ``Who's
got borscht?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it says on the menu ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Menu, schmenu,'' the waiter said (he really said this, Fishlow
recalls). ``I got no borscht.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what kind of soup do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of soup? Look at the menu!''
</P>
<P>
   Fishlow's conclusion: ``I knew I was home.''

   A man who wishes to remain anonymous was having his
complimentary continental breakfast at a motel in upstate New York.
At a table nearby, a little girl of 7 or 8 had already helped
herself and was starting her breakfast. Soon her mother, carrying
coffee and toast, joined her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, these are the best bagels I ever had!'' the little girl
said. ``Look at the sprinkles on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, dear,'' her mother replied. ``Those kinds of bagels are
called doughnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the man said, he knew they were from New York City.

   My 7-year-old granddaughter, Sarah Bressler, was driven to her
piano lesson each week by her mother, Irene. The early burst of
enthusiasm dimmed when she found that some practicing was required.
A few trips later, she sat in the back seat complaining: ``I don't
want to go there. I don't like music. I don't want ...''
</P>
<P>
   Her exasperated mother asked, ``What do you want?'''

<P>
   ``You know what I really want?'' Sarah replied. It starts with a

   The H &AMP; H bagel truck was in front of Rhea and Martin Basroon as
they drove up to a tollbooth on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   They were slightly impatient and curious as the truck remained
at the booth a little longer than expected. Finally, it moved on,
the Basroons moved up for their turn and the reason for the delay
was instantly apparent _ the tollbooth worker was holding a freshly
delivered bag of bagels.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a regular delivery? An unexpected gift? They asked but
they'll never know _ the worker's mouth was full of bagel.

GIULIANI'S CONTROL IS CRUX OF DEBATE OVER POLICE REVIEW BOARD
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After Nick Noe graduated magna cum laude from Brown
University last May, he accepted an offer to work as an
investigator for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the New York
City agency that examines complaints of police misconduct. But the
Giuliani administration overturned his hiring this summer, Noe
said, when it learned of his youthful indiscretion: he had worked
for Democrats as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Noe says officials at the review board, which calls itself an
independent agency, admitted to him that City Hall rejected him
largely because his resume listed too many summers spent
volunteering for Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   He says the rejection made him so angry that he signed up last
month as a volunteer for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's likely Democratic foe if he runs in next year's
race for the U.S.Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so maddening to me that this would happen for so
explicitly political and seemingly vindictive reasons,'' Noe said.
``Being political and being a Democrat should not be something that
removes you from a job.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials dispute Noe's account, insisting that he was
rejected for nonpolitical reasons that they would not specify. But
the level of control that the mayor's office exerts over the review
board's hiring, over the appointment of its governing panel and
over the size of its budget has become part of the continuing
debate over the board's independence, efficiency and structure, a
debate that is likely to grow louder in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Police Commissioner Howard Safir has said he
envisions an expanded role for the review board within the police
disciplinary process because the quality of its investigations has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that process is being scrutinized by
investigators from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn. The
investigation is focusing on whether the police department has
effectively disciplined officers who use excessive force. As part
of their review, the investigators studied statistics that show
that, for a variety of reasons, the department does not discipline
half of the officers against whom civilian complaints are
substantiated by the review board.
</P>
<P>
   Although police officials have defended their disciplinary
record as strict, federal investigators have already concluded that
the offending officers often escape punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are now negotiating possible improvements in
police discipline with the Giuliani administration, and the
discussion is likely to consider methods of strengthening the
review board. Though the prosecutors will not discuss their
negotiations, critics of the review board said a major improvement
would be to increase the panel's independence from the executive
branch. Now, the critics note, the mayor has the final say on all
hiring, appoints all of the panel's 13 members and selects its
chairman.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS, AFTER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Californians voted to outlaw the use of race in
public-college admissions, liberals viewed it as the end of both
affirmative action and the quest for equal education for poor
minority students.
</P>
<P>
   But the death of affirmative action has thrown a klieg light
onto educational inequality. With minority students who would once
have graduated from California's elite universities being shut out,
political pressure is building for the state to use its budgetary
and regulatory powers to bring urban schools into line with those
in more affluent communities.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus for strong, state-level action has created a
coalition of liberals and conservatives and is animating even Ward
Connerly, the University of California regent who masterminded
Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action. He now seems torn
between his hatred of affirmative action and the need to preserve a
minority presence at the elite universities and in the professions
that draw from them.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly still agitates against affirmative action outside
California _ and he opposes policies inside the state that might
resurrect it surreptitiously. But earlier this year, he backed a
somewhat progressive measure in California that benefited a few
minority students by guaranteeing college admission to everyone in
the top 4 percent of high school graduating classes statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly explained the decision with statistics that show no
diminution in the quality of incoming college classes as a result.
Although the measure is quite modest, Connerly's decision to back
it seemed to signal that he had softened his hard-line views.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly has now surprised both liberals and conservatives by
endorsing a class-action lawsuit brought against the state by the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. He was
particularly strident in The Los Angeles Times, saying of the suit
``I would almost like to join it myself.'' An ACLU lawyer said the
group was ``shocked to be on the same page as Ward Connerly'' but
welcomed the added firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The suit bears a striking resemblance to Brown vs. Board of
Education and accuses California of depriving black and Latino
children of the free and equal public education that the state
Constitution entitles them to.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's engagement has attracted attention from California's
congressional delegation and members of the state Legislature, some
of whom are said to be crafting legislation based on the ACLU suit.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint focuses on the advanced-placement classes that the
public colleges take into account in admissions decisions and that
are typically missing from poor schools. California law requires
every high school to prepare qualified students for the public
university. In addition, the state's Education Department strongly
recommends that schools appoint a staff member to administer
advanced-placement classes.
</P>
<P>
   Affluent schools in white neighborhoods offer courses and
guidance in abundance. But the poorest districts often neglect to
offer them, Connerly said, ``because they feel the students
wouldn't take them and succeed academically. It becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof to the contrary can be found at Garfield High in Los
Angeles, a mainly Latino school depicted in the film ``Stand and
Deliver.'' In 1976, Garfield offered no advanced-placement classes
in math _ but 30 students signed up for advanced-placement calculus
as soon as it was offered. Ten years later, Garfield ranked fourth
in the nation in the number of students who took the AP test in
calculus.
</P>
<P>
   In California, blacks and Latinos make up 45 percent of the high
school population _ but only 13 percent of the advanced-placement
test takers. The shortfall of advanced-placement courses has been
found to afflict rural areas as well, putting low-income whites at
a competitive disadvantage when they apply to college. As a
class-action suit, the ACLU complaint covers ``similarly situated
persons,'' which includes these rural whites.
</P>
<P>
   California's education department was stunned by the lawsuit _
partly because the inequalities in the complaint have been taken
for granted for decades. Connerly sounded like an old-style
liberal, saying that state officials ``needed a gun to their
heads'' before they would give black and Latino Californians the
education they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said he opposed affirmative action because it
undermined the society's view of minority competence and because it
``masked'' educational inequality. His hostility toward affirmative
action seemed more credible to some voters because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how the same Californians view his
appeal for closing the gap between schools that serve affluent
whites and those that serve poor minority students. In any case,
Connerly needs to work as hard to redress the inequalities as he
did to kill affirmative action. Having closed one door, he has a
moral obligation to open another.

EDITORIAL: EXECUTIONS MADE EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and state
judges from the three states of that circuit _ Georgia, Alabama and
Florida _ convened last week at an Atlanta resort to discuss how to
expedite state death-penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ostensible goal was to improve the process, there is
little doubt that improvement in this context usually means
speeding up executions by making it harder for death-row inmates to
appeal. Featured speakers included Judge Edward Carnes of the 11th
Circuit, an outspoken death-penalty advocate, and Edith Jones, a
federal appeals judge from Texas who has been a severe critic of
lawyers who file death-penalty appeals.
</P>
<P>
   It is chilling that the judges of the 11th Circuit, which has a
moderate record on executions, should be seeking guidance from
states like Texas. Texas has been ruthlessly effective in executing
184 inmates since 1982, a frenzy made possible in part by courts
willing to deny appeals even in egregiously unjust circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The judges at the conference may think they are simply
discussing effective caseload management, but the application of
the death penalty in this country is so grossly unfair that any
honest discussion must begin by examining the system's fundamental
defects.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants in capital cases are often represented by
inexperienced or incompetent trial lawyers working for a pittance.
Federal and state statutes and Supreme Court decisions have greatly
limited courts' abilities to consider meritorious constitutional
claims by death-row inmates. Many states pay little or nothing for
post-conviction proceedings, forcing condemned inmates to represent
themselves or seek volunteer lawyers for help.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a system in which some people die because they had
bad lawyers and no real shot at a full and fair review, while
others fortunate enough to get better counsel are spared the death
penalty. A lucky few, helped by pro bono lawyers who take up their
causes, have actually been proved innocent after years on death
row.
</P>
<P>
   Moving this flawed system along more smoothly will only increase
unjust outcomes.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SEVILLE, Spain _ Maurice Greene was shoehorned into a middle seat
on the crowded connecting flight from Madrid, twisting, wriggling
and trying to get comfortable, when the man to his left tapped him
on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you traveling to Seville to watch the races?'' the man
asked in a thick German accent.
</P>
<P>
   Greene turned, smiled and pointed to a large color photo on the
front page of a sports section being read by another passenger
across the aisle. It showed a sprinter with his arms raised in
triumph beneath a headline that read, in Spanish, ``Blazing
Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon,'' replied the man. ``You don't look to be that fast of
a little bugger.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was probably, about 30 minutes later, the thought going
through the mind of the would-be sneak thief in the airport baggage
claim area as he tried to make off with the wallet of former
University of Texas hurdler Larry Wade, only to be caught from
behind by the fastest man on the planet over 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is to world record holders what The Blair Witch Project
is to the film industry _ a frighteningly unlikely success story.
And the scariest thing seems to be that he has still not reached
his limit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite stumbling out of the starting blocks for the first
several steps, Greene engaged Bruny Surin in a dramatic
side-by-side, stride-for-stride duel and eventually ran down the
Canadian in the stretch to claim his second straight gold medal in
the 100 meters Sunday night at the World Track and Field
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's time of 9.80 was .01 off his world record set in June,
but it was still the second-fastest 100 meters in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's pretty amazing to be able to stumble at the
start and still wind up with a 9.80,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   No more amazing than Greene's stunning rise to the top of the
sprint world.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Greene had given serious thought to quitting
track and field to find a career in the real world. Struggling
mightily to pay his bills, he was eking out an existence on cash
from several part-time jobs and a loan from his training partner,
Ato Boldon.
</P>
<P>
   Then a shocking thing happened. Greene won the 100-meter title
at the U.S. national meet in June 1997, posted the three fastest
times of the year by an American, then stunned the sport two months
later by capturing the gold medal at the World Championships in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   At precisely the time when Carl Lewis was hanging up his spikes
on a long, glorious career and the talk around the track was the
end of U.S. dominance in men's sprinting, along came this raw,
talkative, fast little bugger to take the baton and carry on the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beware the phenomenon,'' Greene said before the start of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what he is, an entirely different kind of
sprinter than the men who had held the 100-meter record over the
past decade. Canada's Donovan Bailey embraced the role of the angry
outsider from north of the border. Leroy Burrell was quiet and very
unassuming. Lewis was the statesman, the standard-bearer for his
sport, carrying the air of a professor with all of the answers. Ben
Johnson was the bullet-headed pit bull before his reign ended in
steroid-fueled disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   So along comes the tiny 5-9 Greene, who rolls his shoulders like
a boxer before a fight as he approaches the starting block but
makes every trip out seem like a giggle-filled romp to the end of
the block with a playful puppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to not be happy about,'' he said. ``It wasn't
long ago when I was worrying about paying my rent, and now I'm
living on top of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected the 100 final to be as compelling or the winning
time so fast. The field was without an injured Boldon, the only man
to beat Greene this year. Also missing were Bailey, the defending
Olympic champ who is recovering from injury, and former U.S. world
medalist Dennis Mitchell, who has been suspended in the ongoing
drug scandals. Then Frank Fredericks, the silver medalist at the
past two Olympics, scratched from the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   There would be nobody to push Greene. Or so it was thought. But
Surin, running to Greene's immediate right, gave him all he could
handle. Until the last 25 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's lean won it at the wire, and Surin, who thought he had
the race won, snarled in anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out slow, I was thinking, `I can come back and
get them,''' Greene said. ``And in the last 10 meters I knew I had
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boldon has seen the comebacks up close so many times in their
workouts. Maurice lives to catch people from behind. The would-be
thief at the Seville airport learned that the hard way when he
tried to make off with Wade's wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed the guy's arm right away,'' Wade said. ``But the
security guards turned around and grabbed me. Meanwhile, the guy
dropped my wallet and started to run away. That's when Maurice went
after him. The guy had a 10-yard head start, and Maurice caught him
in 25 and turned him in to the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad to have the world's fastest man as my best
friend. But I guess it should have been an omen. Maurice ran down a
thief, and then he ran down Surin.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a quick and persistent little bugger.

EDITORIAL: DRUGS FOR AIDS IN AFRICA  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Aug. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The average African nation spends less than $10 per person each
year on health care. The mix of drugs, including the new protease
inhibitors, necessary to turn AIDS from a death sentence into a
chronic disease, costs at least $12,000 per person each year. That
disparity virtually guarantees that most of the 22 million Africans
infected with the AIDS virus will not get the best available
treatment. Few will even be able to afford less expensive
life-prolonging drugs such as AZT or ddI or _ far cheaper and just
as crucial _ medicines to fight the infections that accompany AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is now arguing with South Africa about a new law in
that country that could allow South Africa to make cheap versions
of still-patented drugs or import them at less than the
manufacturers want to charge. The debate is important, and it has
revealed the need to broaden the administration's policy, which has
been dominated by trade issues and the desire to protect U.S.
pharmaceutical patents. Washington should stop pressuring South
Africa to change the law, but even then far more will need to be
done to get lifesaving medicines to poor Africans with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge is to increase the availability of already
affordable drugs. Last month, the administration announced a $100
million effort to fight AIDS in Africa. It will buy and help
countries use some cheap treatments, like medicines for
tuberculosis and other AIDS-related infections, and drugs to
prevent mother-child transmission.
</P>
<P>
   While some pharmaceutical manufacturers, most recently
Bristol-Myers Squibb, are making substantial donations to fight
AIDS in poor countries, they want to see governments or health
organizations bear the cost of AIDS drugs. But most of the newer
ones are far too expensive. Many third-world countries have long
responded to the high cost of patented drugs by copying them,
sometimes for a tenth of the patented price. The pharmaceutical
industry argues that this pirating discourages the search for new
medicines, as patented drugs are priced high in part to allow
manufacturers to recover the research and development costs of all
their projects, even the unsuccessful ones.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies, and the Clinton administration's trade
negotiators, have fought the efforts of third-world countries to
manufacture or import cheap versions of still-patented drugs. U.S.
trade pressure on Thailand throughout the 1990s, for example,
caused the country to put restrictions on its manufacture of cheap
patented drugs and ban their import, which AIDS doctors say reduced
the country's ability to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   What really worry the drug industry today, however, are the new
intellectual property rules of the World Trade Organization. Over
Washington's objections, poor nations won the right to make
patented drugs in certain situations, especially when there is a
``national emergency.'' While Washington says it objects to
technicalities in the new South African law, the larger reason
trade officials have pressed so hard is that the industry fears
South Africa could set precedents, within the world's trade rules,
for the manufacture of cheap drugs. Drug makers have sued in South
African courts to block the law.
</P>
<P>
   While defending intellectual property is important, the
narrowness of the administration's views is dismaying.
Pharmaceutical companies would lose little if they found legal and
controllable ways to let poor countries _ which offer scant market
anyway _ reproduce drugs or buy them cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the most important AIDS drugs were
discovered in the National Institutes of Health, or with government
grants. Two examples are ddI and the protease inhibitor Norvir.
That financing may well give Washington the right to allow the
World Health Organization to license the drugs' manufacture, for
sale only in poor nations in case of emergency. The administration
should explore this option for all such vital medicines developed
at taxpayer expense. The desires of America's pharmaceutical
companies have been the overwhelming force driving U.S. policy on
the issue of drugs in poor nations. Surely the needs of 35 million
people infected with HIV worldwide should count for more.

EDMONDS TAKES REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 c.1999 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jim Edmonds was not in the Anaheim Angels
lineup Sunday, his first day off since returning from shoulder
surgery Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said his shoulder felt fatigued, the result of playing
in 19 consecutive games. With the Angels all but eliminated from
the playoffs, it was a no-brainer to give the center fielder a
chance to recharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll catch up a day and see how it goes,'' Edmonds said. ``It
just feels tired, that's all. I've got to use common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a setback, especially considering Edmonds
wasn't supposed to return to the outfield until last Friday, a
target date he reached two weeks early. He hadn't missed a game
since his return, making 19 consecutive starts _ five at designated
hitter, one at first base, 13 in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, he hasn't lacked for arm strength. He made an
impressive throw to gun down Dean Palmer at second base Saturday
night. But at the plate his shoulder appears to bother him. In 71
at-bats, Edmonds is hitting .225 with one extra-base hit (a double)
and seven RBI. He has shortened his follow-through to take stress
off his shoulder, robbing him of his familiar opposite-field power.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he's trying to get his timing down, something
hitters normally accomplish during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep saying I'm still in spring training, but it's more
like I'm not even into February yet,'' Edmonds said. ``I don't have
it together at the plate, but I don't plan on hitting .220 the
whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   __ DiSarcina out: As expected, shortstop Gary DiSarcina did not
start because of a deep contusion on his right shoulder blade. He
made a career-high three errors Saturday night, two of them on bad
throws that might have had to do with the injury. He is listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   A pick-off throw by Joe Borkowski hit DiSarcina on Aug. 13 in
Detroit, then a Jaime Navarro fastball nailed him in almost the
same spot Tuesday in Chicago. DiSarcina further aggravated the
injury when he made a diving stop of a Gregg Jefferies grounder
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I find a way to get the ball over there,'' DiSarcina
said of his three-error game. ``But I didn't even come close.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Need reinforcements: With two regulars out and the club
carrying 12 pitchers, Angels manager Terry Collins didn't have many
options on the bench Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Switch-hitting Matt Walbeck and right-handed Andy Sheets were
the only position players remaining, though Edmonds was available
if necessary.

ARIZONA'S NEWEST TOWN INVITING TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YODAVILLE _ It's Arizona's newest town. But don't expect the
citizens in the harsh desert near Mexico to vote or pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the 120 inhabitants, if you want to call stick
people that, are raked regularly with bombs, missiles and
machine-gun fire. Powerful lasers sweep their streets.
</P>
<P>
   This is Yodaville, a village of 167 buildings, some four stories
high, made from thousands of stacked, surplus cluster bomb
containers. It resembles a bleak, nightmarish Lego-land.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners say it's vital for training for future
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Finished two months ago, Yodaville, 35 miles southeast of Yuma
on the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range, is the U.S. military's
first urban bombing range. It is replete with streets, street
lights and civilian and military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even looked in Hollywood to try to find fake trees. We also
looked for power poles and lines. But we ran out of money,'' Marine
Maj. Jim Parrington said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there has been a crying need for such a training site
since 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in the streets of Mogadishu,
Somalia, in 1993. The Marines say that their mission will become
increasingly urban since 70 percent of the world's population is
projected to be in cities by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pilots in Somalia, Maj. Floyd Usry, came up with the
concept of the training village. Since ``Yoda'' was his radio call
sign, Marine engineers took to calling the site Yodaville.
</P>
<P>
   The mistaken attack on the Chinese Embassy in Kosovo also
pressed the need for more accuracy in urban warfare. But Parrington
said the military's problems in city fighting go all the way back
to the savage battle for the provincial Vietnamese capital of Hue
30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In World War II, we could make it miserable for whole city
blocks,'' Parrington said. ``But things are different now. You have
to pinpoint the threat and attack it precisely.''
</P>
<P>
   Laser-guided weapons have their limitations in urban fighting.
Laser sight lines often can't be established because of the speed
of planes and targets in tight surroundings. Laser beams also
bounce off glass surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. military is trying to develop small bombs,
in the 25- to 50-pound range, for urban warfare rather than the
standard 500-pound bombs of the past, Parrington said. That,
coupled with accuracy and developing new city bombing tactics, are
the focus at Yodaville.
</P>
<P>
   There's a decidedly Third World feel to the place.
</P>
<P>
   A mock soccer field is painted green on the edge of town.
Streets are narrow. There's a large shantytown.
</P>
<P>
   And talk about ambience. The seeringly hot desert teems with
sidewinders and an occasional scrub creosote bush or cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps engineers first had to clear mounds of used weapons
at the construction site. Now, spent bomb casings and other ammo
litter the entrance to town near sickly ocotillos coated with a
grimy gray dust.
</P>
<P>
   Hornet and Harrier jets scream over the saw-toothed ridge of the
nearby Gila Mountains, and deliver their payloads from high over
the town as military observers measure their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Kevin Smith, the Marines' construction foreman, said he
thought the brass had lost its mind when it ordered the town to be
built to scale last October in an area 800 feet by 1,000 feet. But
eight months and round-the-clock rail delivery of more than 23,000
cluster-bomb containers later, the town was ready for bombing on
June 9. Each of the containers measure 2 feet by 6 feet and 2 feet
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the project would have cost $14 million if contracted
to civilians. But Marine Corps engineers took on most of the
construction chores and $2 million was spent on outsiders to build
the roads. Actually, the roads are sand covered with black
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The completion of Yodaville set off shock waves in militia
groups around the country, who weren't aware that it is a mock town
in a military area. Some thought that the Marines were attacking an
Arizona town at the behest of the New World Order.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Phoenix office of the FBI was in the dark. It sent a
message to an Internet group that monitors militias last month
seeking more information about Yodaville.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 sorties are planned for Yodaville, including
those by attack helicopters, in its first six months of operation.
Each day brings a different military scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Hornet jets were scouring the town at low altitude
looking for fleeing enemy troops and vehicles. The bad guys are
easy to spot since they are clad in camouflage. Friendly troops
wear green. Villagers wear nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   One jet streaked above the town at 1,000 feet, firing
diversionary flares while looking for anti-aircraft guns. The pilot
found an armored personnel carrier instead on a street between two
of the largest buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped an inert bomb, which was supposed to send up a white
puff of smoke on impact. But there was no smoke nor trace of the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no!,'' barked Capt. Scott Halverson, an Army Cobra pilot,
into his telephone, noting that the bomb was way off target. ``The
impact was in a no-drop zone.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   But the following operations went much better.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot dropped three bombs within 30 yards of a jeep.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wouldn't have been anything left of him,'' Marine Capt.
Sean McPherson said. ``This is the best day we've had as far as
nearness to targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents in Yuma just hope none of those targets are
real people.
</P>
<P>
   Yodaville was built only seven miles from the border and is near
a popular crossing site that begins at a rural truck stop in
Sonora, just south of the bounder, said Al Casillas, a Border
Patrol spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Casillas added, Yodaville poses extreme risks
to illegal immigrants crossing into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents fear that its appearance of being a town
and streetlights at night will lure unsuspecting illegal immigrants
in search of water into harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we track a group of illegals onto the range, we let the
Marines know and they close down their operations,'' Casillas said.
``That generally happens twice a week. But you wonder how many
others are out there. We just hope this doesn't become a major
attraction and that they have enough water to walk more than seven
miles.'' &QL;

<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Hurricane Bret pummeled a largely
uninhabited region of the Texas coast with 140 mph winds Sunday,
apparently sparing heavily populated areas major damage from the
Category 4 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people from Brownsville to Galveston evacuated
low-lying coastal areas, clogging public shelters and filling
motels as far inland as San Antonio as the first hurricane to
strike Texas in a decade made landfall in sparsely populated Kenedy
County.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush declared seven South Texas counties disaster
areas and called on President Clinton to issue an ``expedited
presidential disaster declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my fellow Texans say a prayer for those fellow Texans
that are in harm's way,'' Bush said at a news briefing in Austin,
Texas, Sunday afternoon. ``A disaster comes like a thief in the
night sometimes. I hope this storm, as ferocious as it may seem,
will not affect human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi Mayor Loyd Neal said Sunday evening that damage
in the city of 275,000 had been minimal, mainly downed trees and
roof shingles blown off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been a major, major storm hitting Corpus
Christi,'' said Neal, who runs an insurance agency.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding remained a major threat. Forecasters said the storm
could dump 10 to 15 inches of rain as it moved inland. There also
was concern that a storm surge would push water 10 to 15 inches
above normal levels, particularly in bays.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,600 Texas National Guard troops were put on standby
near San Antonio to provide assistance to hurricane victims, and
all available state troopers were helping evacuate people and
coordinate emergency activities.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the compact but powerful storm came ashore in late
evening in Kenedy County, aiming the brunt of its force at the
heart of the 825,000-acre King Ranch between Corpus Christi and
Raymondville. The legendary ranch, founded in 1853 by Capt. Richard
King, is bigger than Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The storm quickly weakened as it moved inland, falling to a
Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Graham, meteorologist with the National Weather Ser'' vice
in Fort Worth, said at a Department of Public Safety briefing in
Austin Sunday night that the landfall in Kenedy County minimized
the storm's impact on Corpus Christi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But ... it ain't over yet. We've got a long way to go with
this thing,'' Graham said, referring to the potential for
flooding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Raymondville, a citrus farming community of 8,800 about 30
miles south of where the eye came ashore, wind gusts of up to 75
mph ripped off roofs and blew down trees and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we can just pray the Good Lord spares our
town,'' Mayor Joe Sosa said about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, pastor of the non-denominational Raymondville Christian
Center, urged those in flood-prone areas to seek shelter at a local
funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds extended up to 40 miles from the storm's
eye, whipping debris through Raymondville. Streets were deserted
except for a few cars that sought shelter under gas station
awnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting hit pretty hard right now, but there's no way of
telling whether we've seen the worst of it yet,'' said Pete
Fresquez, who was operating Raymondville's emergency hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Lebore Montoya, 45, a resident of Mexico who was trying to get
to Corpus Christi to be with his family, sought shelter at a gas
station in Raymondville when the storm hit. ``At a time like this,
I really want to be with my wife and kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's path was similar to that of Hurricane Allen, which
came ashore in the same region with 185 mph winds in 1980, causing
$55 million in property damage and killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   While winds of more than 100 mph were buffeting the scrub brush
and marshes of the coastal ranchland, wind gusts had not exceeded
55 mph in Corpus Christi as of 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Despite nonstop warnings of the approaching storm, people turned
out at Cole Park on the Corpus Christi bayfront in late afternoon
to see the impact of the edge of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Kira Ware, a married college student, took a Suburban-load of
relatives including her 5-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show her what a hurricane is like,'' Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   As choppy waves smacked the rocky shore and sheets of rain began
falling, Ricky Rodriguez showed the view to his 11-year-old
daughter and her 13-year-old cousin. Then they headed home where
Rodriguez said he had a backup electric generator and, to see them
through the storm, ``a bunch of horror videos.''
</P>
<P>
   The landscaped boulevard along the bayfront was littered with
palm fronds shaken loose from trees. Fishing boats and yachts were
beached on traffic islands as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   In Corpus Christi Sunday night, the major concern was that the
storm surge might push water over the 15-foot seawall and flood
downtown, which is lower than the man-made barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross and government officials in Corpus Christi decided
against opening shelters in the city, opting instead to wait until
Monday to assess the damage and see if the shelters were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings extended for about 200 miles along the coast
from Brownsville to Port O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville residents spent a hurried weekend preparing for the
storm. Moderate rain fell sporadically Sunday, but there was
otherwise no hint of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island, the barrier island linked to Brownsville by
a causeway, was evacuated by early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Builder's Square on Texas 48, which is the road off the
island, manager Charlie Velasco said his store remained open until
2 a.m. as buyers streamed in asking for sheets of plywood and
particle board to protect their windows.
</P>
<P>
   At least 6,000 sheets passed through his checkout counters by
midday, Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally don't sell one-tenth of that in a weekend,'' he
said. ``I got 1,100 sheets in last night at 11. By midnight, they
were gone. They say war is good for the nation's economy. I guess a
hurricane is good for my store's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Brownsville residents fled low-lying areas and
filled at least two shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were scared our house would be flooded, so we came here,''
said Molly Oyervides, 46, who huddled on the hallway floor of a
school with her 10-year-old daughter. Her husband, who works
nights, was curled up asleep on a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The school district provided cold-cut meals, bottled water and
soft drinks for those who sought refuge in the shelters, said
Maricela Zarate, the school principal who was doubling as a shelter
operator.

   ``SELECTED NON-FICTIONS'' &QL; 
By Jorge Luis Borges (Viking, $40) &QL; 
``The angels are two days and two nights older than we: The Lord
created them on the fourth day, and from their high balcony between
the recently invented sun and the first moon, they scanned the
infant earth, barely more than a few wheat fields and some orchards
beside the waters.'' With his essay ``A History of'' ``Angels,''
written in 1926, Borges rescues us from the tripe written on the
subject in recent years and leaves us to wonder whether Wim Wenders
read this before he made his haunting film about angels, ``Wings f
Desire.'' ``I always imagine them at nightfall,'' Borges writes,
``in the dusk of a slum or a vacant lot, in that long, quiet moment
when things are gradually left alone, with their backs to the
sunset, and when colors are like memories or premonitions of other
colors. We must not be too prodigal with our angels; they are the
last divinities we harbor, and they might fly away.'' This is the
third volume in Viking's centenary edition of Borges' work in
English, coming after ``Collected Fictions'' and ``Selected
Poems.'' Borges wrote thousands of pages of non-fiction _ essays,
book and film reviews, lectures, encyclopedia entries, historical
surveys and notes on politics and culture, and from them, editor
Eliot Weinberger chose 161 pieces. Most appear in English for the
first time. The rest were newly translated for this edition. Among
the films reviewed (albeit briefly _ as Weinberger notes, Borges
never wrote anything long) are ``King Kong'' and ``The Petrified
Forest.'' Among the books: William Faulkner's ``Absalom! Absalom!''
and Ellery Queen's ``The Door Between.'' It's a marvelous
collection, published to celebrate what would have been Borges'
100th birthday in late August. &QL;

HEARTWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By James Lee Burke &QL; 
(Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this novel is a bit busy _ to say that it's complex is to
give it too much credit _ but Burke is so much better than other
crime writers that he pulls it off anyway. From the first pages,
we're aware of his virtuosity, although that seems like an odd word
to apply to a man whose characters are world-weary moralists and
vicious schemers and whose setting in this new series (in wake of
his books about Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux) is a Texas hill town
called Deaf Smith. The hero is Billy Bob Holland, the former police
officer/Texas Ranger-turned-defense attorney, last seen in
``Cimarron Rose.'' In the early pages, Billy Bob suffers the return
to town of a rich man named Earl Deitrich, who long ago wooed and
married Peggy Jean Murphy, the local beauty who was Billy Bob's
high-school lover. Billy Bob is still hung up on Peggy Jean, and
she is still hung up on a boy who died in Vietnam _ both obsessions
that are difficult to believe as the book progresses. Their
attraction is further complicated because the cowboy Billy Bob
takes on as a client is accused of stealing $300,000 in bonds from
Peggy Jean's husband. More plot description would merely make you
dizzy _ suffice it to say that Burke makes all of his characters,
even the odd ones, as real as a Texas moon, and his setting becomes
a character in itself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING ON THE WIND: &QL; 
ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE &QL; 
WITH MIGRATORY BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Weidensaul &QL; 
(North Point, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thre are some shorebirds that fly non-stop from the southern tip
of South America to the coast of New Jersey _ a trip that takes 10
days, an astonishing 240 hours of uninterrupted flight. And there
are Arctic terns that each autumn fly across the Atlantic to
Europe, then south along Africa to recross the Atlantic toward
South America, finally wintering off of Antarctica. In spring,
writes the author, ``they reverse course, moving up southern Africa
and lancing back to Canada _ a figure eight inscribed on half the
globe, a track that returns them, often as not, to precisely the
same sheltered nook where they nested the summer before.'' Is there
anything more miraculous, more ethereal, more mysterious than the
epic migrations of birds? Weidensaul explores the process with
eloquence, meticulous research and considerable reverence _ and it
does not hurt that his subject is rife with fantastic facts. Did
you know that there are hummingbirds that cross the Gulf of Mexico
twice each year and tiny warblers that fly non-stop from New
England to South America? Did you know that albatrosses leaving the
nest might pass the next four years without touching land?
Weidensaul spent more than six years researching his book,
traveling 70,000 miles by plane, car, boat, horse and foot _ and
yet, he says, he covered fewer miles than a sandpiper would in its
short lifetime, propelled only by muscle and the instinct to trace
those invisible pathways in the sky. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DAYS OF INFAMY &QL; 
By Michael Coffey  &QL; 
(Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A companion volume to the History Channel's documentary
``Military Blunders,'' this is a survey of mistakes that had
terrible consequences. If the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's chauffeur
had asked directions in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, he would not
have taken the wrong turn that led to the archduke's assassination.
If the captain of the Lusitania had steered in a zig-zag pattern as
advised, he might have avoided the torpedo that sank the ship and
drew America into World War I. If naval commanders had not
underestimated the threat of air power, the British would not have
suffered the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse, two of their
finest ships. If German fliers attempting to destroy oil tanks on
the English coast had not lost their way and bombed the outskirts
of London instead, orders (on both sides) to avoid populated areas
might have stood, saving civilian lives during World War II. You
like war stories? Coffey has war stories, and they prove just how
slender the thread of fate can be. &QL;

   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Hurricane Bret pummeled a largely
uninhabited region of the Texas coast with 140 mph winds Sunday,
apparently sparing heavily populated areas major damage from the
Category 4 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people from Brownsville to Galveston evacuated
low-lying coastal areas, clogging public shelters and filling
motels as far inland as San Antonio as the first hurricane to
strike Texas in a decade made landfall in sparsely populated Kenedy
County.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush declared seven South Texas counties disaster
areas and called on President Clinton to issue an ``expedited
presidential disaster declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my fellow Texans say a prayer for those fellow Texans
that are in harm's way,'' Bush said at a news briefing in Austin,
Texas, Sunday afternoon. ``A disaster comes like a thief in the
night sometimes. I hope this storm, as ferocious as it may seem,
will not affect human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi Mayor Loyd Neal said Sunday evening that damage
in the city of 275,000 had been minimal, mainly downed trees and
roof shingles blown off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been a major, major storm hitting Corpus
Christi,'' said Neal, who runs an insurance agency.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding remained a major threat. Forecasters said the storm
could dump 10 to 15 inches of rain as it moved inland. There also
was concern that a storm surge would push water 10 to 15 feet above
normal levels, particularly in bays.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,600 Texas National Guard troops were put on standby
near San Antonio to provide assistance to hurricane victims, and
all available state troopers were helping evacuate people and
coordinate emergency activities.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the compact but powerful storm came ashore in late
evening in Kenedy County, aiming the brunt of its force at the
heart of the 825,000-acre King Ranch between Corpus Christi and
Raymondville. The legendary ranch, founded in 1853 by Capt. Richard
King, is bigger than Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The storm quickly weakened as it moved inland, falling to a
Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Graham, meteorologist with the National Weather Ser'' vice
in Fort Worth, said at a Department of Public Safety briefing in
Austin Sunday night that the landfall in Kenedy County minimized
the storm's impact on Corpus Christi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But ... it ain't over yet. We've got a long way to go with
this thing,'' Graham said, referring to the potential for
flooding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Raymondville, a citrus farming community of 8,800 about 30
miles south of where the eye came ashore, wind gusts of up to 75
mph ripped off roofs and blew down trees and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we can just pray the Good Lord spares our
town,'' Mayor Joe Sosa said about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, pastor of the non-denominational Raymondville Christian
Center, urged those in flood-prone areas to seek shelter at a local
funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds extended up to 40 miles from the storm's
eye, whipping debris through Raymondville. Streets were deserted
except for a few cars that sought shelter under gas station
awnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting hit pretty hard right now, but there's no way of
telling whether we've seen the worst of it yet,'' said Pete
Fresquez, who was operating Raymondville's emergency hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Lebore Montoya, 45, a resident of Mexico who was trying to get
to Corpus Christi to be with his family, sought shelter at a gas
station in Raymondville when the storm hit. ``At a time like this,
I really want to be with my wife and kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's path was similar to that of Hurricane Allen, which
came ashore in the same region with 185 mph winds in 1980, causing
$55 million in property damage and killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   While winds of more than 100 mph were buffeting the scrub brush
and marshes of the coastal ranchland, wind gusts had not exceeded
55 mph in Corpus Christi as of 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Despite nonstop warnings of the approaching storm, people turned
out at Cole Park on the Corpus Christi bayfront in late afternoon
to see the impact of the edge of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Kira Ware, a married college student, took a Suburban-load of
relatives including her 5-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show her what a hurricane is like,'' Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   As choppy waves smacked the rocky shore and sheets of rain began
falling, Ricky Rodriguez showed the view to his 11-year-old
daughter and her 13-year-old cousin. Then they headed home where
Rodriguez said he had a backup electric generator and, to see them
through the storm, ``a bunch of horror videos.''
</P>
<P>
   The landscaped boulevard along the bayfront was littered with
palm fronds shaken loose from trees. Fishing boats and yachts were
beached on traffic islands as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   In Corpus Christi Sunday night, the major concern was that the
storm surge might push water over the 15-foot seawall and flood
downtown, which is lower than the man-made barrier.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Brownsville residents spent a hurried weekend preparing for the
storm. Moderate rain fell sporadically Sunday, but there was
otherwise no hint of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island, the barrier island linked to Brownsville by
a causeway, was evacuated by early Sunday.

ARMY HAS QUIETLY BEEN REPLACING LEAD AMMO WITH `GREEN BULLETS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAKIMA TRAINING CENTER, Wash. _ Crouched over a radio microphone
high atop the turret of his command vehicle, Col. Mark Hertling
watched down range as the treeless terrain bucked and heaved in
response to his every command.
</P>
<P>
   Culminating six months of training at Fort Lewis and a month of
arduous field maneuvers here, Hertling supervised a live-fire
exercise involving a dozen tanks, armor vehicles and artillery
pieces assigned to his unit, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry
Division. As Hertling barked orders into his radio, the ground
underfoot literally shook with the impact of artillery shells and
tank cannon rounds as hundreds of rounds of rifle and machine-gun
fire crackled.
</P>
<P>
   Both at Fort Lewis near Tacoma and here at this 322,400-acre
desert warfare training center, the Army's need for realistic
combat training and the service's responsibility for careful
management of a fragile environment coexist in a delicate balance,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   One long-term environmental issue that has attracted the
service's attention in recent years is the potential environmental
threat from lead-based ammunition and a research initiative to come
up with a ``lead-free'' bullet.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare, the Army has designed new small-arms
ammunition that replaces lead with the inert heavy metal, tungsten,
and has begun mass production of this so-called ``green bullet,''
said Jim Arnold, chief of the pollution prevention and
environmental technology division of the Army Environmental Center,
in a telephone interview from Aberdeen, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tungsten, lead-free bullet is being put into production as
we speak,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials and scientists say the two most likely health
hazards from lead-based ammunition occur at indoor rifle ranges,
where inadequate ventilation may expose soldiers to minute lead
particles in the air, and at outdoor ranges and impact areas that
lie over freshwater aquifers that are the source of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said lead from small arms or artillery buried in the soil
of ranges or impact areas poses no threat by itself. ``You need to
look at it on a site specific basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we started taking a harder look at the `green
bullet' was at some installations ... the Army should be taking a
hard look at site-specific conditions,'' Arnold said. He declined
to identify any specific bases that may have a potential pollution
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Lewis officials say there is no known evidence that lead
ammunition is threatening water sources at the Pierce County base
or at Yakima. There are 67 live fire ranges and four artillery
impact areas at Fort Lewis and another 21 live fire ranges and
artillery impact areas at Yakima which are clearly marked and used
for no other purpose, said Fort Lewis spokeswoman Lt. Col. Melanie
Reeder. At Yakima, there are 46,000 acres, constituting 14 percent
of the total center acreage, that are used for live-fire and
artillery impact areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Corps takes very, very carefully the stewardship we assume
of all areas under our responsibilities,'' Reeder said. ``There are
incredible initiatives in place to preserve water, wildlife and
foliage both here at Fort Lewis and Yakima.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead pollution issue made headlines in Massachusetts two
years ago when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the
use of live ammunition at a National Guard base on Cape Cod on
grounds the toxic metal was leaching into an aquifer that
constitute's the peninsula's sole source of drinking water. Army
officials later disputed the EPA conclusion, calculating that it
would take several hundred years for the pollution to reach the
water table.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Massachusetts incident prompted the Army to
accelerate production of lead-free ammunition as a result in any
event, Arnold said. The service is already replacing M-16
ammunition with the tungsten round and has a goal of implementing
lead-free ammunition for other small arms including the Squad
Automatic Weapon machine gun, M-60 machine gun and .50 cal. machine
gun within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd Brigade's exercise at Yakima was typical for an Army
unit that size, Hertling said. The 3,900-person brigade will have
shot off about 500,000 rounds of live ammunition when the
two-month-long Yakima maneuver ends next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Army uses video simulators to train tank and artillery
crews, it is essential for soldiers to ``get out in the dust and
fight with sleep deprivation,'' Hertling said. During the Yakima
exercise, each M1A1 crew has been able to fire 55 tank cannon
rounds apiece, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armywide, soldiers fire about 400 million rifle rounds a year in
life-fire training, officials say. Since each .223 cal. bullet
fired by the M-16 assault rifle contains about 32 grains of lead
(or .0023 oz.), the Army calculates that each year over 900 tons of
lead metal is fired into rifle range target areas or live-fire
zones armywide.

MICROSOFT AND ALLIES SET SIGHTS ON SERVERS &HT;    BY HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Squeezed by declining profit margins in the
desktop computer market, Intel, Microsoft and their PC-industry
allies are eager to move up the computing food chain.
</P>
<P>
   They've already taken over a good chunk of the market for
technical workstations and departmental servers, the machines that
store files and run applications for corporate work groups and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ``Wintel'' vendors have set their sights on an even more
lucrative business: selling the high-powered machines required for
corporate data centers, Internet service providers and major Web
sites. This month they're rolling out a flurry of new systems
designed for just such uses _ and backing them up with a full-scale
marketing mobilization aimed at information-technology
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, analysts say, the ``Wintel'' axis almost certainly
will take over a good part of this market. But in the near term _
perhaps a year or more _ the incumbent leaders in the big-server
arena, notably Sun Microsystems, may have less to fear than the
hype suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, already the largest vendor of small servers, last week
threw down the gauntlet with its first two ``eight-way'' models _
computers that put eight of Intel's most powerful microprocessors
to work in parallel. Code-named ``Thunder'' and ``Lightning,'' the
new machines will ship with Microsoft's Windows NT Server operating
system though they're also capable of running some versions of
Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Today (August 23) Hitachi, which has been offering eight-way,
Intel-based servers since January, will follow with the
announcement of enhanced models. During the next few weeks, Dell,
IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Unisys and nearly 20 others are expected to
join the race.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to top-of-the-line Intel Pentium III Xeon
processors, they'll all use Profusion, a new set of surrounding
chips developed by Intel's Corollary subsidiary, which enable the
Xeon processors to work in parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, HP and IBM already sell high-powered servers that, like
Sun's, run some flavor of Unix on their own ``RISC'' chips.
Although they'll continue to offer these non-Wintel machines, at
least for now, they're also jumping on the Intel eight-way
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   The main selling point for the new systems, compared with
current Unix options, is price rather than performance or
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they're cheap, at least by PC standards: The Compaq
machines, now dubbed the ProLiant 8000 and 8500, will range between
$20,000 and $80,000. Hitachi's new VisionBase 8890R, with a custom
version of the Profusion chip set that Hitachi says increases
performance up to 30 percent, will go for $30,000 to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   But in comparison to current server options offering similar
levels of performance, those prices look like bargains. An
eight-way RISC system easily can cost three, four or five times as
much or even more.
</P>
<P>
   Why the huge differential? RISC server vendors develop their own
proprietary microprocessors, chip sets and operating system
software. The companies offering the new Intel eight-way servers
are following something much closer to the PC business model: By
relying on Intel for their processors and chips sets and on
Microsoft for the OS, they get the benefits of common standards and
economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Similar economics have enabled PC-makers to take over most of
the low-end server market with systems equipped with one, two or
four Intel processors. A recent white paper from International Data
Corp. estimates that in 1999, Intel chips will account for 85
percent of unit shipments in server systems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Dataquest analyst Kimball Brown, ``For a file and
print server, e-mail, groupware, even a basic HTTP (Web) server,
it's crazy not to go to Intel _ it's drastically cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Wintel camp could face a tougher battle now that it's
trying to sell bigger servers, which are intended to run
``mission-critical'' applications such as order-processing,
reservation and e-commerce systems.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the Profusion technology is new and
relatively untested in the field. When Intel acquired Corollary in
1997, it said Profusion would reach the market in 1998, but
technical glitches have forced repeated delays.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of history may be a red flag for many IT
professionals, who tend to be risk-averse when it comes to the
applications from which their organizations earn their bread and
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the OS problem. The newly announced systems will
ship, for now, with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. That OS isn't
considered particularly efficient in taking advantage of even
four-way Intel-based servers, and Microsoft acknowledges that it
wasn't designed for eight-way hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Even the vendors promoting the new servers admit that NT 4.0
doesn't take full advantage of their hardware. Michael Krieger,
vice president of server marketing at Hitachi Data Systems in Santa
Clara, said that with the current Microsoft OS, going from four to
eight processors improves transaction-processing performance by
only 1.3- or 1.4-fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as good as anyone would like,'' he said. ``It's
definitely not as good as Unix.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Krieger and everyone else committed to the Intel
servers, the situation should change this fall, when Microsoft
finally ships Windows 2000, the long-delayed successor to NT.
Windows 2000 Advanced Server, one of the four versions Microsoft
will offer, is designed specifically to take advantage of up to
eight processors. Microsoft said last week that it's on track for
release before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the bugs that often have plagued new Microsoft OS
releases, few IT professionals are likely to deploy Windows 2000 in
mission-critical applications immediately, especially because it's
due to arrive on the eve of the Y2K transition. Most customers are
expected to wait at least for Microsoft's first ``Service Pack,''
or bug-fix collection.
</P>
<P>
   As analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group put it, ``It
kind of stretches the limits of credulity to talk about deploying
mission-critical software on a platform that's largely untested.
Probably eight-way doesn't become real until Windows 2000 does.''
</P>
<P>
   But the OS isn't the only software issue. Applications that now
run on RISC Unix machines needed to be ``ported,'' or converted,
then tested and tuned on the Intel chips and Microsoft OS before
they could be moved to the new servers. Even applications that
currently run on smaller Intel-based servers generally will need to
be tuned up to get the full benefit of the new servers' extra
processors.
</P>
<P>
   All of this takes time. ``You don't just say, `The hardware went
from four processors to eight, so I'm going to move all my apps.'
That's absurd,'' said Dataquest's Brown. ``It's a long-term, slow
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, said James Gruener, an analyst at the Aberdeen
Group in Boston, the eight-way servers are ``just the first of
several ingredients that are needed to make up the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many companies might order one or two of the new
machines now for testing, and a few who are particularly
performance-starved might put them to work immediately, the
analysts all agreed that large-scale deployment won't occur until
at least next year, probably not until the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Giga's Enderle said, the servers will have at best a
modest effect on the financial fortunes of Intel and its partners
in the eight-way initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But in a larger perspective, this month's server introductions
might look more significant. ``Most of all,'' Gruener said, ``it
will change the way Intel servers are perceived by the people who
buy servers. Judging by the benchmarks, it's pretty clear that they
now have the power to handle midrange tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that,'' Gruener said, ``is a real turning point.''

MACHINISTS TELL BOEING THEY WANT MORE JOBS PROTECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The International Association of Machinists told The
Boeing Co. on Sunday that it must take greater steps to preserve
union jobs, including eliminating special promotion rules, if it
wants to avoid a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the union are locked in intensive talks to reach a
new contact for 44,000 Machinists by Sept. 1. The union, fueled by
a fear that the company will farm many Boeing jobs out to other
companies and to cheaper labor markets, has made the preservation
of jobs its key issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see what they are planning and it doesn't look good,''
Bill Johnson, head of IAM's District Lodge 751, told hundreds of
workers at a rally Sunday outside a SeaTac, Wash., hotel, the site
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The union has called on Boeing to scrap a system that allows
managers to protect a certain number of jobs from layoffs and to
promote a set number of people over others with more seniority.
That debate is only a preview of the larger issues negotiators will
tackle this week over how to preserve jobs at the aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it's willing to address the union's
concerns, but it's also fighting to retain tools it believes are
vital to managing its work force and workload.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing plans to continue to hire some outside firms to
help it build airplanes, it doesn't plan to send the majority of
regional Boeing jobs to other areas, according to a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the Boeing business plan,'' said Peter Conte, a
spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
   While the union is fighting to preserve jobs, the company is
fighting to preserve its future as a competitor in the airline
business, Boeing officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The company, currently the world's largest commercial airplane
manufacturer, must hold down its costs to succeed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps are preparing to enter the critical second week of
negotiations, which will culminate Friday when the company promises
to hand the union a final contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The week got off to a bad start Sunday, as union negotiators
complained that Boeing officials abandoned the talks for most of
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to get off the nickel,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials have met with the union every day, according to
Conte, and they decided to take Sunday morning off to meet family
obligations and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, officials from both sides of the bargaining table admit
they are making progress. Despite the disagreement over job
security, the union's lead negotiator said there was a 50-50 chance
that the Machinists would strike.
</P>
<P>
   And even though union leaders said the company wants to avoid
the issue of job security, they believe union members are in an
excellent position to extract concessions because Boeing is
scheduled to deliver a record 620 airplanes this years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to get exactly what we want,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But some Machinists were skeptical they would succeed without a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable,'' said Scott Kincaid, who works at
Boeing's Everett plant. ``It's about time to draw the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Machinists probably will render their judgment Sept. 1, when
they vote to either accept or reject the company's offer. The
current pact will expire Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The final contract will also have influence far beyond the walls
of Boeing's plants.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is the nation's largest exporter and a massive
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders and many large U.S. manufacturers are keeping a
close eye on the negotiations.

SWEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Dan Duquette can do without the kind of
reminder former Sox pitcher Aaron Sele gave him Sunday night while
beating the Sox, 6-0, completing the Texas Rangers' three-game
sweep of the staggering Olde Towne Team.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be even worse come October, if the Red Sox are watching
the playoffs on TV while Sele is pitching for the division-winning
Rangers, who scored two runs before Tim Wakefield retired a batter,
got another home run from Rafael Palmeiro (his fourth of the
weekend and seventh in seven games), and broke it open with two
more runs in the seventh, the last on Rusty Greer's triple off the
top of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 games left, Sunday night's loss dropped the Sox, losers
of four in a row and five of their last six, a game behind the
Oakland A's in the wild-card race, the first time since Aug. 12 the
Sox have trailed for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can score runs easily, other times it's like
pulling teeth out of a duck,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said
after Sele extended a weekend of misery for the Sox, who failed in
all three games to come up with hits when they needed them.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were 0 for 3 with runners in scoring position in Friday
night's 4-3 loss, 1 for 11 in Saturday night's 9-2 loss, and after
Jose Offerman lined deep to center fielder Tom Goodwin with two on
and two out in the seventh, their last scoring chance of the game,
0 for 4 Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bunched their hits,'' Williams said, ``and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were outscored, 19-5, in the sweep after being shut out
for the first time since Aug. 5, when they were beaten, 8-0, by the
Angels in Anaheim. This was only the second time this season
they've been swept in a three-game set; they lost three straight in
Montreal June 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made good pitches when he had to,'' DH Butch Huskey said of
Sele, who allowed eight hits, seven of them singles, in pitching
his second complete-game shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an overpowering pitcher, but he threw both breaking
ball and fastball in good spots. When a guy is doing that, he's
going to be tough. (Rangers pitchers) were like that the whole
series. They didn't make too many mistakes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele won 19 games for Texas last season and with 14 wins is on
his way toward matching or exceeding that this season. Meanwhile,
the Sox, so strapped for pitching they rolled Wakefield out of the
bullpen to start for the first time since June 8, have little to
show for the trade in which they sent Sele to the Rangers two years
ago this November.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz, who was supposed to be the regular catcher, hit
some big home runs a year ago last April, then was gone by June by
mutual discontent. He wasn't happy as a part-timer with the Sox,
and Duquette had little tolerance for the King. Leyritz went to San
Diego, and the players the Sox got in return (pitchers Carlos Reyes
and Dario Veras) are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   All that the Sox have to show for Sele is Damon Buford, a
part-time outfielder who is on the disabled list. And Buford, who
can expect a hefty raise in arbitration this winter, may be gone
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially after losing a couple in a row, I think everybody
has been trying to do too much,'' said rookie Brian Daubach, whose
first-inning single was the only time in eight at-bats this weekend
that he got the ball out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be OK, especially if we can get a couple of runs early.
We don't have to worry about anybody else, there's still plenty of
time left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belleville Basher has cooled off since driving in 15 runs in
four games last weekend. He was, of course, not alone in his
futility. Troy O'Leary had a single, but struck out with a runner
on third and is just 2 for his last 32. John Valentin also had a
single, but he's 4 for 32.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox now have scored three runs or fewer in six of their last
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to get back in a good groove,'' Daubach said.
``I couldn't keep swinging the way I've been the last couple of
weeks, but I've just got to keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``They not only made good pitches, they made some real good
defensive plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who has won seven of his last eight decisions to improve
his record to 14-7, did not retire the Sox in order through the
first seven innings. But it wasn't until the fifth that the Sox
advanced a runner as far as second base, the sixth before they had
a runner on third, and the seventh before they had their first
extra-base hit (Darren Lewis's two-out double) and Sele had issued
his first walk, to Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, with runners on first and second and no outs after
singles by Jason Varitek and Lewis in the fifth, grounded into a
double play, and Offerman tapped to first to leave Varitek at
third.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin singled to open the sixth, but was erased at second on
a terrific play by shortstop Royce Clayton, who went deep in the
hole to glove Daubach's bid for a single and went airborne to throw
out Valentin. Daubach took second on a grounder to the right side
by Nomar Garciaparra and third on a wild pitch, but was left there
when O'Leary struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who recorded 17 ground-ball outs, has pitched at least
seven innings in his last five starts and trails only Pedro
Martinez (17) and Baltimore's Mike Mussina (15) in wins, even with
an earned run average that only Sunday night dropped under 5
(4.91). He also has become a strikeout pitcher. He entered the game
with a team-leading 138 whiffs, fourth in the league, and struck
out five Sunday night.

MICROSOFT AND AOL'S CYBER WAR &HT;    By TOM STEIN
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In this corner, weighing in with annual sales of
$19.7 billion, an operating system that controls the vast majority
of the world's personal computers, and a Web browser used by
three-quarters of all Net surfers, the one, the only Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposing corner, with $4.8 billion in sales, an
unparalleled subscriber base of 18 million Internet users, and the
fiercest reputation in the online world, the amazing America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest powerhouses in corporate America are squaring
off in a battle that may determine who will control the next
generation of computing.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, Microsoft Corp. and America Online have been
engaged in an increasingly bloody slugfest centered around all
things Internet. So far, the battles include instant messaging,
Internet access, online bill paying and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things represent the future of computing,'' said Rob
Enderle, an analyst with the Giga Information Group. ``Whoever
fails to adapt won't be around in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The two titans are duking it out for the hearts and minds of
consumers who are relying more and more on the Internet for
entertainment, communications and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   AOL chief executive Steve Case is playing his cards close to his
vest. Although many observers think the two companies are on a
collision course, &LR;   &LR; he said AOL doesn't want to battle Microsoft's
core business. ``I have a lot of respect for Microsoft,'' Case told
the Washington Post early this year. ``I continue to live in fear
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, AOL clearly has Microsoft worried. After all,
the first time these behemoths went toe-to-toe, it was AOL who came
out on top.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book ``aol.com,'' by Kara Swisher, Microsoft
CEO Bill Gates tried to buy AOL six years ago. Gates invited Case
to Redmond and told him, ``I can buy 20 percent of you, or I can
buy all of you. Or I can go into this business myself and bury
you,'' the book stated.
</P>
<P>
   Case declined the offer. Instead, AOL grew stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft went on to launch the Microsoft Network (MSN), an
online service that closely mimics AOL's mixture of content and
community. In 1995, Microsoft began bundling MSN with its Windows
95 operating system. The logic was that consumers quickly would
turn away from AOL in favor of the preinstalled Microsoft service.
Four years later, Microsoft has only 2 million subscribers, while
AOL has nearly 10 times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft is not a company that shies away from a good
fight, especially when it thinks someone is encroaching on its
turf. And increasingly, that's what AOL seems to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, AOL swallowed up Netscape, Microsoft's
biggest rival in the Web browser market. ``That's when AOL really
identified itself as a primary competitor (to Microsoft),'' said
Enderle. ``As soon as that happened, Microsoft changed its focus to
address the AOL threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Softletter, a computer industry
newsletter, has an even simpler take on the brewing hostilities.
``Anybody big is Microsoft's enemy,'' he said. ``AOL sits atop a
monster-sized market, and Microsoft's in a position where they have
to go after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Microsoft launched its first pre-emptive strike
against AOL with an attack on instant messaging, the Internet
application that alerts Web surfers when their friends are online
and allows them to communicate through text messages in real time,
without the lag of regular e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   AOL currently reigns supreme in instant messaging, with about 65
million users. Microsoft did not even have a messaging product
until last month, when it entered the market with a bang, quickly
signing up 1.3 million users. Unlike other messaging products, MSN
Messenger boasted interoperability features that allowed users to
communicate with friends on AOL's offering.
</P>
<P>
   An outraged AOL claimed that Microsoft was gaining unauthorized
access to its subscriber lists and blocked MSN Messenger customers
from communicating with its user base. Microsoft, for its part,
kept looking for new ways to worm its way into AOL's messaging
service.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist of fate, Microsoft now is the one calling for
fairness and open standards in the messaging market and is
recruiting a host of partners to support this mission. Last week,
it even opened up the protocols for its Messenger software so that
any instant messaging product could communicate with MSN Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, too, is lining up its own allies, such as Apple, Sun
Microsystems and EarthLink, in an apparent attempt to create a
standard around its product.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual observer, this might seem like a childish game of
cat-and-mouse, but instant messaging means big business. The
software represents a powerful platform for sending target
advertisements to the millions of people who remain glued to their
computer screens for large portions of the day. Some observers
predict that some of the billions of dollars now spent on Web site
advertising soon could shift to the instant messaging platform.
</P>
<P>
   Another important battlefront is Internet access. Today, AOL's
18 million members pay $21.95 per month for dial-up access to the
Internet, while the 2 million subscribers to the Microsoft Network
service pay $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   AOL gets more than three-quarters of its revenues from its
subscribers, while MSN subscriptions are a mere drop in the bucket
for Microsoft. That's why Microsoft last month floated a trial
balloon suggesting it soon would begin to offer free _ or greatly
discounted _ Net access through MSN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Internet access strikes at the very heart of AOL,'' said
Tarter. ``This is a classic Microsoft strategy. You reduce your
price below what the market leader can afford and watch as they
bleed to death. Then you come in and gradually raise your price
back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has declined to elaborate on its intentions. AOL has
resisted the bait and adamantly refuses to lower its prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the tussle over Internet access could be the precursor to a
more critical battle down the road: broadband, or high-speed
connections to the Internet. The so-called broadband future is
supposed to transform the Internet into a vehicle for delivering
video, audio, games, software and even e-commerce directly to the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is a channel to deliver products and services, and
whoever owns that channel will control a huge new market,'' said
Enderle.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is attempting to stitch together its own broadband network
by striking high-speed access deals with telecommunications giants
like Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications. Microsoft, meanwhile, is
forging alliances with cable companies, which are expected to be
the most popular providers of high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that AOL is in a bitter struggle to get access
to the cable lines controlled by AT&AMP;T. Microsoft recently took a $5
billion stake in AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts don't expect broadband to become entrenched with
the general public for another five years or so, they said it's
critical for both AOL and Microsoft to start laying the foundation.
``Whoever has the better strategy now will be in the best position
to dominate going forward,'' said Joe Laszlo, an analyst with
Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   As AOL and Microsoft continue to fight for Web customers, new
battle lines are being drawn. The latest is online bill-paying
services that allow customers to make, say, their car payments
through the electronic transfer of funds via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft began to offer online bill-paying last month on its
MoneyCentral Web site, while AOL has said it was strongly
considering launching a similar service for its members.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lucrative market. The number of households paying
bills online will climb from 2 million this year to 11 million in
2003, according to the Yankee Group research firm.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, online bill-paying can give that all-important
``stickiness'' to a Web site. Analysts believe that Internet users
are likely to give their loyalty to a single site that provides
them with a vast range of compelling services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online billing is important because it provides AOL, Microsoft
or whoever with the opportunity to become the next Visa,`` said
Barry Parr, an analyst at International Data Corp. ``If you are the
system by which all Internet payments get cleared, then you can
extract a piece of that action.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of online billing is that the more time users
spend on the Web managing their money, the more likely they are to
actually spend online. Both AOL and Microsoft are confident that
users of their financial services will stick around to shop on
their sites.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they're furiously developing virtual shopping malls
where consumers can hunt for cars, make travel arrangements and buy
clothes and other goods.

   &UR;  &LR;  So far, the war between Microsoft and AOL has been confined
to Internet. But some industry experts believe that AOL may go
after Microsoft where it really hurts _ namely, the Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of the people who log onto the Net domestically
do so through AOL,'' said Phil Leigh, a financial analyst with
Raymond James &AMP; Associates. ``For them, the real relationship is
with AOL, not Windows. AOL so far hasn't taken steps to wrest
control from the Windows operating system, but it could. What's to
prevent AOL from offering free word processing or free spreadsheet
programs?''
</P>
<P>
   Although most observers feel that the Internet is big enough for
both AOL and Microsoft, others are not so sure. ``If I was running
AOL now, I'd be terrified because Microsoft does not lose,'' said
Tarter. ``It may take Microsoft a while to ramp up, but it's pretty
rare that a competitor walks away alive.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is betting it will be the exception to the rule.

JONES CAPTURES 100 METERS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Wherever you go through this sultry Andalusian
city, you see the Nike ad touting Marion Jones, the best female
sprinter in the world. In it _ legs outstretched, arms reaching,
jaw set _ the 23-year-old American phenomenon flies toward the
landing of a long jump. Leaving Estadia Olympico, your first
glimpse is along the banks of the Rio Guadalquivir; the next is on
a deserted stretch of the Avenida de la Palmera; soon it looms
again next to a busy sidewalk cafe on Calle Enramadilla.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is everywhere inside the stadium, too, as she tries to do
what no athlete before her ever has done: Win four gold medals at
the World Championships of Track and Field, at 100 and 200 meters,
the long jump and, most likely, the 4 x 400 relay. She has made it
clear she will be disappointed with anything less.
</P>
<P>
   The first step was taken Sunday night when Jones won the 100
meters in 10.70 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year,
to defend her world title. Although American Inger Miller ran a
strong second in 10.79 in her third personal best of the meet
(``It's not a one-woman show,'' Miller said afterward. ``There's
going to be a rivalry going into 2000'') and Jones was quick to
praise both Miller and bronze medalist Ekaterina Thanou of Greece,
who ran a 10.84, all eyes were on Jones Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, as they have
been since she arrived here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal for this week is to get five total (gold medals) for
the family, and obviously we've started off in fine fashion,'' she
said, referring to her just-completed 100 meters and the shot-put
victory Saturday night of her husband, C.J. Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but Seville is just the beginning, a virtual
warmup for next year. The oft-stated goal for 2000 Olympics: Gold
medals in the 100, 200, long jump, and both relays. If she
succeeds, she will be the first track athlete ever to do so,
surpassing the four golds won by Jesse Owens (1936) and Carl Lewis
(1984) and the three by Florence Griffith-Joyner (1988), whose
world records in the 100 and 200 (10:49 and 21:34) Jones is
stalking (10.65 and 21.62 so far, making her the second-fastest
woman ever at both distances).
</P>
<P>
   The schedule here is grueling, with Jones competing seven of the
nine days. Next up is Monday night's long jump final, for which
Jones qualified Saturday with the third-longest jump of the
competition, which she sandwiched between the first and second
rounds of the 100 meters before hanging around the track to watch
Hunter win gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I can start off the week like this feels
great,'' she said. ``But there's no time for a celebration here.
I've got to get refocused and ready to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   After jumping Monday night, she will arrive early Tuesday for
the first round of the 200 meters at 10:45, try to rest in the
afternoon, then return for the second round at 6:35. If all goes
well, she will compete in the 200 semifinal Wednesday and the final
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally come the relays. The master plan is for Jones to run the
4 x 400, but that could change depending on fatigue. After her
three individual events are done (``Hopefully I am happy with three
wins there,'' said Jones) her coach, Trevor Graham, ``will look
into my eyes and tell if I am ready to run the 4 x 400 (relay) and
he said if he does not feel at this point that I am ready he is not
going to put me out there and under the stress of running the 4 x
400. Then I will go out and run the 4 x 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Many see Jones, always articulate and ready with a smile, as the
potential savior of track and field in the United States. (It
doesn't need any help in the rest of the world, where it and she
are already huge.) Others, if one believes the buzz on the
Internet, fear she is raising expectations too high, setting
herself up for failure, by proclaiming her intentions so
forthrightly.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, CEO of USA Track &AMP; Field, insists neither is
true. ``Marion has no responsibility for the sport,'' he said.
``It's no individual's responsibility to save, rescue, build,
whatever other term you want to use. That's my job, and USA Track &AMP;
Field's job.'' Nonetheless, if she succeeds in making Olympic
history, ``she has the opportunity to be the first woman on a
global scale to transcend sport. Pele did it, Muhammad Ali did it,
Michael Jordan did it. No woman has ever done it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones announcing her goals so early, Masback _ a former
world-class miler _ said: ``I assume she didn't do it lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey began in earnest at the US national championships in
1997, where Jones reemerged on the track scene after three years of
playing top-notch basketball at the University of North Carolina,
where she was a freshman point guard on the 1994 team that won the
NCAA title. She gave up her final season of eligibility to return
to what she calls her first love, a sport in which she was fourth
in both the 100 and 200 at the 1992 Olympic Trials (declining a
spot as relay alternate) and still holds the US high school record
at 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   She promptly won the 100 and long jump, won the 100 at the World
Championships later that summer, and by the end of the year was
ranked No. 1 in the world at both the 100 and 200. Last year, she
was undefeated until Heike Drechsler of Germany beat her in the
long jump in the last competition of the year. As fate would have
it, Drechsler is injured and not competing here.
</P>
<P>
   Although a sprained knee earlier this season has helped mar her
long-jump record _ Jones has lost twice to Drechsler and once to
American Dawn Burrell at US nationals _ her sprint string is
intact, having not lost at 100 meters in 25 races going back to
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as relaxed as I could have been,'' Jones said of her
race Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. ``That says a lot, that I was a little bit
tense in the race and still ran 10.70.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does.

PATRIOTS OFFENSE AHEAD OF DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A year ago at this time the assessment of
the Patriots was that they had a solid defense, but the offense was
suspect because of injury-prone receivers and rookie tailback
Robert Edwards, who still hadn't emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Flip-flop that and you have the proper perspective of the 1999
Patriots after they have split a pair of exhibition games,
thrashing the Dallas Cowboys Saturday night, 34-14, after losing to
the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The offense clicked in familiar fashion as quarterback Drew
Bledsoe worked wonderfully with wide receiver Terry Glenn, tight
end Ben Coates, and his running backs. The offensive line protected
Bledsoe well, although it didn't run-block as well as the coaches
would have liked. Still, there should be no worry about this team
scoring points.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, a unit once considered one of the best in the AFC
has some work to do before it regains that status. Certainly the
effort was strong Saturday night, despite missing three injured
starters (Ted Johnson, Henry Thomas, and Chad Eaton).
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were doing cartwheels over Willie McGinest being
able to go all out for 17 plays and his sack of Dallas backup
quarterback Jason Garrett. It appeared linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer
began to understand his role and his importance in the middle of
the field, while the undermanned interior line got gutsy efforts
from Chris Sullivan, rookie free agent Garrett Johnson, and last
year's fourth-round pick, Leonta Rheams.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary, 25th against the pass a year ago, made some
plays. Chris Carter has intercepted passes in each of the
exhibition games in attempting to fill the void left by the
departed Willie Clay. And despite one poor play, Tebucky Jones
seems more equipped to be a factor in coverage and a viable player
if one of New England's starters at the corners _ Ty Law or Steve
Israel _ goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't screw it up. We adjusted better,'' said defensive
coordinator Steve Sidwell. ``Dallas gave us relatively tough
adjustments that we had to make that we did better with than we did
against Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell isn't ready to promise a championship just yet, but
weeks of intense training have paid off. The players are beginning
to understand and feel comfortable in the basic defense, and when
Sidwell introduced new wrinkles such as the middle linebacker blitz
and the corner blitz, Katzenmoyer and Israel got there in time to
at least disrupt the quarterback's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Weak-side linebacker Tedy Bruschi flew around the field and made
plays, but the most pleasing aspect of the night for the Patriots
was McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he has to do for us to be a successful team,''
said Sidwell. ``When we're rushing four guys he has to go in there
and get 'em. I think he's been doing a good job. From what we see,
he's rushing the passer better in practice than he ever has since
we've been here, so we're pleased with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Patriots must keep McGinest healthy, expand his number
of plays over the next two games, and, according to Sidwell, ``get
him in game shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell said Katzenmoyer's performance was like night and day
from last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big-time improvement,'' said Sidwell. ``He knows what he's
doing. He knows how to take on a block, knowing where his fit is in
the defensive scheme. It's not easy to get all that figured out. He
made marked improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell said of the steady Sullivan, ``Chris is always going to
give you a great day of work,'' and of Garrett Johnson added,
``he's a great battler.'' He said Jones, ``looked real bad on one
play _ the one where he missed a tackle. He got spun around in the
coverage. Otherwise, I'd have to see the film to see how he did
overall.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question the Patriots have depth problems. The
interior defensive line is lacking a solid veteran who can take the
load off Thomas and Eaton. But Johnson has a great chance to take
that role. The linebacking corps is still smarting from the losses
of free agent Todd Collins and Johnson (torn biceps tendon), but
here, too, the Patriots are giving Billerica's Dana Cottrell a
chance to shine. Cottrell played well with the second unit. In the
secondary, Kato Serwanga did some good things in the nickel
package, an area in which the Patriots were torched last year.
Again, the presence of one more veteran would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were high on their performance Saturday night, but
it was a preseason high, not a regular-season one. The defense has
yet to be given its full set of marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   It appears McGinest is doing well, and Katzenmoyer has begun
taking steps toward what looks to be a promising career. Say what
you want about Glenn being important to the success of the
Patriots, but the team desperately needs McGinest's pass rush and
Katzenmoyer's toughness. Without them, the Patriots won't be able
to keep up in the toughest division in football, in which the
high-powered offenses of New York, Miami, Buffalo, and Indianapolis
have to be held in check.

WEB SITES FOR WOMEN ARE FLOURISHING &HT;    BY MEKEISHA MADDEN
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Mary Foust was planning her wedding, she
needed help on everything from catering to floral arrangements to
seating charts.
</P>
<P>
   But the 44-year-old Sausalito stockbroker didn't want to shell
out thousands to hire a wedding planner. So Foust turned to the
Internet and San Mateo's Women.com Networks Inc. for advice on
planning the event and answers to etiquette questions. There also
was a wedding checklist to keep her on schedule and a gown model to
help her visualize the style of wedding dress that would look best
on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great resource,'' said Foust, whose wedding is in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com is banking on consumers like Foust, who turn to the
Web for the kind of information they traditionally got from women's
magazines, plus everyday uses like e-mail and the sense of
community that the Web can foster. Women.com has an exclusive deal
to post articles from Hearst Magazines, whose stable includes
Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Harper's Bazaar and Marie Claire.
But it tries to branch beyond that, with everything from stock
quotes to career advice and book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of information on Women.com has made the site the
No.1 online women's network, with 4.4 million unique visitors a
month, according to Media Metrix, a Net ratings service.
</P>
<P>
   As women go online in droves, industry analysts say the
potential for Women.com and other female-oriented sites is
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive space,'' said Lisa Allen, senior
analyst for Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm.
``Women are huge decision-makers when it comes to buying, and
advertisers are all vying for a piece of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The site has some influential backing. The Hearst Corp. owns 50
percent of Women.com. In June, Women.com sold a 2 to 3 percent
slice of the company to Torstar, the Canadian company that
publishes Harlequin romance novels, for $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com had planned to raise approximately $46 million by
selling 3.75 million shares to the public this month. That would
give it a valuation of as much as $540 million. But the recent
slump in Internet stocks has prompted Women.com to delay its
initial public offering indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad season for the stock market, and if you look at
the market last year around the same time, it was bad then, too,''
said Anna Yen, Women.com's head of investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com's reluctance to go public isn't surprising given
what's happened to its main competitor, iVillage.com of New York.
Launched in 1995, iVillage had a stunning public debut in March,
more than tripling on its first day, from $24 to $80.13. It soared
to $113.75 within a month. But since then, the stock has been on a
precipitous slide. It rose 63 cents to close at $41.50 Friday
(August 20).
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street may not be ready for a Women.com debut,
industry watchers say conditions for the site's popularity have
never been better.
</P>
<P>
   Women are surfing the Net in ever-increasing numbers. In less
than two years, the gender gap has narrowed, from 21 percent more
men online to only an 8 percent difference, according to the
Strategis Group, a research and consulting firm in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, 39 million women (38 percent of the adult
female population) in the United States were on the Internet, the
survey found. And many of those women hold the family's purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers have fueled an explosion in sites devoted to all
things female.
</P>
<P>
   Both iVillage.com and Women.com have chat rooms, personalized
e-mail, information ranging from investments to fashion and
creating personalized home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Women.com has more eyeballs, iVillage also attracts a
fair number of users _ 3.8 million visitors monthly. iVillage's
revenues for the quarter ended March 31 were $6.5 million, up from
$2.2 million in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   But iVillage and Women.com can't rest on their laurels. Experts
predict that Women.com and iVillage may find a formidable opponent
in newcomer Oxygen.com from Oxygen Media Inc. Run by Geraldine
Laybourne, who made Nickelodeon a cable giant, the site is backed
by Disney, America Online, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and
talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. In addition to its Web site, Oxygen
Media is planning a cable TV channel.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com is trying to differentiate itself by going beyond
articles on beauty and health. The site _ and many of its
competitors _ want to be one-stop Web portals where women can log
on and never leave. Women can create their own home pages and get
investment and financial information.
</P>
<P>
   The site began in 1992 _ before the explosion of the World Wide
Web _ as a dial-up subscriber-based Internet service, called
Women's Wire. Founders Ellen Pack and Nancy Rhine, who hatched the
idea online, envisioned it as a way to get women to plug into the
online opportunities for networking and information. It moved to
the Web in 1995, ahead of many competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The site has grown since its humble beginnings in Pack's guest
room and now has 90,000 pages of content and 220 employees _ 80
percent women, 20 percent men. The Web site has writers, editors
and a number of doctors, consultants and other experts.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen, who analyzes women's Web sites, said the longevity of
Women.com and others like it will depend upon the site narrowing
its focus, making the sites geared toward a specific type of woman.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com and iVillage ``look the same and offer content in
similar areas, and there remains to be some shakeup,'' she said.
``What both sites need to realize is that there is a big difference
between 20-year-old college-aged women and 40-year-old professional
women. Focusing the reach to just one group will help them last in
this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Foust, who uses Women.com's e-mail and gets daily updates on her
wedding checklist, said the site is not without flaws. Like lots of
sites, Foust said, Women.com has too many ads.
</P>
<P>
   But advertising is the lifeblood of Women.com, according to
Women.com Networks CEO and President Marleen McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers, who include big names such as Ford Motor Co. and
Clinique, account for the majority of Women.com's revenue. Because
the company is in a pre-IPO quiet period, it would not disclose the
exact amount. Revenue also comes from Web site production. For
instance, Women.com was paid to produce interactive Web sites for
New Woman and Redbook magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com also makes money from e-commerce. It has links to
several online shopping sites: home movie retailer Bigstar.com;
Styleclick.com, a men's and women's fashion retailer; and
PlanetRx.com, a Web drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   Other revenue sources include sales generated by Astronet, an
online astrology site, and a cut of magazine subscriptions for
Hearst's 10 magazines when users subscribe to them on Women.com's
site.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com has a content office in New York and sales offices in
Los Angeles and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Pack hopes that Women.com, which has yet to generate a profit,
someday will be a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Partnerships with Hearst, Disney and other big names are going
to help bring Women.com into the spotlight, Pack said. According to
its prospectus, Women.com may never become profitable and,
according to Reuters, as of June 30 had accumulated $56.5 million
in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a long time to become profitable,'' said Pack, 34.
``Right now, we're building our market presence and market share.
It (also) takes a long time to build a national consumer brand. If
you could make a profit as soon as you started a company, everybody
would be doing it.''

 CLASSIC-BOS  
 McGINNIS HAS SENIORITY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Forget the Cohiba cigars and the Dom Perignon.
</P>
<P>
   After a 4-foot birdie on the second playoff hole Sunday gave Tom
McGinnis a $180,000 triumph over Hale Irwin in the BankBoston
Classic, his first victory on the Senior PGA Tour, McGinnis
celebrated without a shred of pretense.
</P>
<P>
   After he arrived at the clubhouse of Nashawtuc Country Club for
his press conference, McGinnis opened a pack of Marlboros, lit one
up, and ordered an ice cold bottle of Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   When a can of Rolling Rock and a plastic cup were placed in
front of him, McGinnis examined the green aluminum container and
said, ``Rolling Rock? Is that a local brew?'' Then, cracking open
his victory beer, McGinnis smiled broadly and said, ``Well, Rolling
Rock it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared the huge Nashawtuc galleries were set to
hail Irwin as the event's second three-peat champion, McGinnis, a
51-year-old native of Memphis, wound up being the toast of the
Senior Tour's oldest tournament after shooting a final-round
5-under-par 67 for a 54-hole total of 11-under 205.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all such a shock,'' said McGinnis, whose biggest payday
of his tumultuous PGA Tour career was the $4,100 he got for fifth
place in the 1976 Ed McMahon-Jaycees Quad Cities Open. ``I didn't
think that I had a chance to win the tournament. Then I got in a
playoff, and I knew it would be a feather in my cap to beat him. I
mean, I had already beat 76 other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was one more?
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis birdied the 18th hole of regulation after he hit a
marvelous chip out of the left rough, over a greenside bunker,
within 1 foot of the hole to go 5 under for the day and 11 under
for the tournament. Two-time defending champion Irwin, who shot a
final-round 68, reached the 18th in three shots and missed a chance
to win it outright when his 20-foot attempt from beneath the hole
stopped about 6 inches shy of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a great putt on (No.) 9 for a birdie and got it close
on 10 and 11, and then never really made another birdie, including
the two playoff holes,'' said Irwin, who has been hampered lately
by tendinitis in his left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play badly, but I kept misfiring on a lot of little
shots,'' he added. ``I think, subconsciously, the wrist may have
been a little bit of a problem in not getting a lot of shots to the
hole. Over the last week or so, I've been hitting a lot of shots
short of the pin and it's just not enough club in getting them back
there, so I think a couple of days rest will be really nice. My
congratulations to Tom, because he played the 17th hole like it was
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   After both players two-putted for par on the first playoff hole
at the 18th, Irwin went to the par-3, 170-yard 17th and hit it
within 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Was it time for Irwin to finally breathe easy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to wake up one day and understand that the
Senior Tour is not a bunch of over-the-hill guys,'' said Irwin, the
tour's No. 2 money winner with $1,672,855. ``They can play golf and
Tom McGinnis is one of them. He happens to be a person we haven't
heard a lot of, but he can play, witnessed by the way he played
today. Certainly there was no fold in his game over the two holes
that we played.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident when McGinnis followed Irwin by getting a
6-iron to bite the green and stop 4 feet below the pin. When Irwin
just missed his birdie chance, sliding it past about 2 feet,
McGinnis said, ``I was grinning, because I knew I was not going to
miss mine. There was no way I was going to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, McGinnis sized up his putt (``Straight
uphill,'' he said) and knocked it home to capture a check that
increased his season earnings to $394,614, leaving him 35th on the
money list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no quit in him. He's got a lot of intestinal fortitude
and is just a scrambling player who's had to play for his life,''
said Wayne Gilmour, McGinnis's caddie from Liverpool. ``He knows
all the tricks of the trade, and he knows how to deal with
everything. This is not really pressure, because he knew he had 100
grand or 180 grand, so there's not much pressure there (in the
playoff). We were already in the final, and we just had to get rid
of one more guy and Hale was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many packs of cigarettes McGinnis, a chain-smoker, had
smoked on the course Sunday, Gilmour said, ``Oh, about 1 1/2. I
went through two packs myself _ and I don't even smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McGinnis, ``I really wasn't that confident out there today.
I knew I was going to stay cool out there, but when I got to 10
under then looked up at the board and saw Hale go to 11 under
(after a 5-iron to 7 feet for a birdie 4), I actually thought, `Oh
well, I'm just playing for the money now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis wound up winning more than enough money to keep him
supplied with smokes and suds _ the spoils of his victory _ for at
least the foreseeable future.

IRWIN HAPPY WITH SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-IRWIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Twenty-four hours before teeing off in Sunday's
final round of the $1.2 million Senior PGA Tour BankBoston Classic
at Nashawtuc Country Club, Hale Irwin predicted the finish was
shaping up as a pretty good horse race.
</P>
<P>
   A betting man would have made Irwin, the two-time defending
champion, a chalk favorite. Jay Sigel and George Archer, with whom
Irwin shared the lead, would have drawn much place and show
support.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McGinnis might have been as much of a long shot as, well,
Mr. Ed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was McGinnis, who has toiled in near obscurity, who
charged down the stretch and caught Irwin in two playoff holes,
winning with a short birdie putt on 17. That put a $180,000 ticket
into his hands and relegated Irwin to also-ran for the first time
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if you want to call a check for $105,600 and 11
straight sub-70 rounds over the 6,773-yard Nashawtuc layout
also-ran status. The 11 straight sub-70 rounds equals the mark set
by Lee Trevino in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-34_68 and 205 total just wasn't good enough for Irwin, who
won BankBoston last year with 201 and in 1997 with 203. Irwin
wanted to join Chi Chi Rodriguez as the only men to win this
tournament three straight times. Rodriguez won in 1986, '87, and
'88 when the tournament was the Digital Seniors Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The end came on the par-3, 170-yard 17th, when Irwin missed a
7-footer for birdie and McGinnis calmly drained a 4-footer for his.
The pair had halved the first playoff hole, the 18th, with pars.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin seemed to be in control and steaming toward another win
with birdies on nine, 10, and 11 to go 11 under. Never did he
think, though, that when he canned the 7-footer on 11, that it
would be his last birdie of the day. He parred the last seven holes
in regulation and the two in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't do that and expect to win,'' said Irwin,
``especially here at Nashawtuc where birdies are very obtainable.
You can't win if you don't birdie over the last nine holes. You
can't do that on any golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play badly. I kept misfiring on a lot of little
shots. Subconsciously, the wrist (tendinitis) may have been a
problem in not getting a lot of shots to the hole. Over the last
week or so, I've been hitting a lot of shots short of the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get the ball to the hole the last few holes and it
cost me. My congratulations to Tom. He played the 17th hole like it
was easy. He just had a superb (33-34_67) round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said yesterday, if I could have a chance playing the
last nine holes, I'd be happy, so theoretically I'm happy.
Three-peats are hard to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said it really didn't surprise him that it was McGinnis
that ended his BankBoston reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is going to wake up one morning and realize that the
Senior Tour is not a bunch of over-the-hill guys,'' he said. ``They
can play golf and Tom McGinnis is one of them. He happens to be a
person we haven't heard a lot of, but he can play. He's not a
fluke. He's a good player and he'll win again out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he left the interview room, Irwin turned and thanked
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great ride,'' he said, ``and fun while it lasted.''

MONSTER.COM MAY HAVE CREATED ONE WITH ONLINE PEOPLE AUCTIONS &HT;    BY DAVID LAZARUS
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco   Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kerry Sheridan O'Leary considers herself a
decent copywriter, well versed in advertising and marketing, and
speaks fluent French to boot. Some employer, she figured, would be
willing to pay at least $45 an hour for her services.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there haven't been any takers. Rather, there haven't
been any bidders.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, 25, put herself up for sale at Monster Talent Market,
the Web's first full-time auction of human beings. The site now is
being joined by a handful of imitators, and the big boys of the
online auction world _ eBay, Yahoo and Amazon.com _ are open to
selling free-lancers as well.
</P>
<P>
   But are people auctions really the next big thing to hit the
Net, or just the latest in a long line of fads? And will this
change the way free-lancers operate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be very cutting edge,'' said O'Leary, a
Burlingame free-lancer. ``It could be a marketplace for skills.
Unfortunately, I haven't had any responses yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Liz Willner, 33, a Berkeley free-lance Web designer
who auctioned herself off for a minimum $75 an hour. She listed her
services at Monster Talent Market after hearing an ad for the site
on the radio. Now she thinks ``it was a stupid idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for free-lancers,'' Willner said. ``I don't know why
they claim that. When you fill out the questionnaire, you see that
it's really geared toward people looking for regular salaries and
full-time jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a lengthy tour of Talent Market's listings, with dozens
of profiles examined in a variety of categories, confirmed that the
vast majority of job seekers were looking for full-time gigs.
</P>
<P>
   No less significantly, not a single active bid could be found
for anyone. Not one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been an overwhelming number of bids,'' conceded
Craig Besant, vice president of marketing for Monster.com in
Maynard, Mass. ``But we think it's going to work and that people
are going to make hires.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea probably looked great on paper. Because eBay and the
rest have demonstrated a ready online market for buying and selling
collectibles and other goods, why not an established venue where
independent contractors can seek top dollar for their services?
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor saw no reason to doubt the
validity of the concept, and he rolled out Talent Market on July 4
_ Independence Day for free-lancers _ as the company trumpeted its
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it's a free service, and that's why about 60,000
people have listed their profiles at the site. Soon, though,
Monster plans to introduce a ``nominal cost'' of about $5 per
listing.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, in turn, will be asked to pony up $5,000 in advance
for five hires. If they sign contracts with fewer than five people,
the remainder would be refunded, Besant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to a thousand dollars a head,'' he said. ``We
feel it's a fair price and substantially less than what they would
pay to headhunters.''
</P>
<P>
   The honor system is a factor. Monster is hoping that employers
will be truthful about making hires and not cut a separate deal
after eventually receiving a person's contact info, thus skirting
that $1,000 commission.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one example of why the effectiveness of online
people auctions remains in question. Another is that even with
60,000 listings, Besant said ``less than 50'' have found jobs via
Talent Market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he noted that it took Monster.com, the Web's biggest pool
of job openings and resumes, nine months before anyone was hired
through the site.
</P>
<P>
   EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said the leading online
auctioneer has no plans at present to introduce sales of human
beings. But he pointed out that there have been listings for
tech-related services from individuals in the site's computer area,
and said the company would comply if users demanded a separate
channel for people auctions.
</P>
<P>
   EBay is where a group of 16 Internet workers put themselves up
for sale this spring for no less than $3.1 million, though the
offer was withdrawn a couple of days later.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of those workers, John Kinsella, has launched his own
online people auction, Bid4geeks.com, with dozens of job-hunting
propeller-heads up for grabs (but receiving only a handful of
bids).
</P>
<P>
   An outfit called eLance, meanwhile, is gearing up to allow
companies to post projects online and allow free-lancers to submit
electronic bids, and a similar service is on tap at Freeagent.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else, there's clearly a market for online recruiting.
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that U.S.
companies will be spending as much as $1.7 billion by 2003 to track
down new employees via the Internet, compared with $105 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 3 million resumes now posted online at about
30,000 job-related sites.
</P>
<P>
   But most, if not all, of these resumes are for people seeking
steady work. For free-lancers, the Gypsies of the job market, the
name of the game is still networking and referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free-lancers have to market themselves like crazy,'' said
Betsy Keefer, president of Freelance Online, a directory of about
1,300 free-lancers-for-hire. It's virtually unheard of, she said,
for an employer to compete monetarily for a free-lancer's services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most free-lancers aren't hired because of how much they
cost,'' Keefer observed. ``They're hired because of their
qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Carles, a senior producer at Yahoo, agreed that
networking, not auctions, is how a free-lancer finds work. For this
reason, she said, her site isn't hurrying to establish an outlet
for buying and selling people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an area for services right now,'' Carles said, ``but
we're not sure that the market's there yet. If it gets there, we'll
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon spokeswoman Sharon Greenspan said additional auction
categories are added ``as they become popular.'' If people auctions
catch on, she said, Amazon will cut its own slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Nidositko, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston,
isn't convinced that auctions, whether of Beanie Babies or
free-lance French speakers, will remain among the hottest
attractions on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auction format is novel,'' she said. ``It's a way to keep
people coming to a site. But it's not clear how long it will
last.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Monster Talent Market, Nidositko also came up short in
finding any active bids, and said the service ``doesn't seem
particularly successful at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster's Besant insisted that Talent Market ``is a work in
progress,'' and said future listings may be expanded to include
writing or design samples.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that free-lancers who list themselves with the
site one day may be eligible for some form of health insurance
coverage or discounts on office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auctions are a way for you to market yourself on the Web,''
Besant said. ``People respond to the whole concept of auctions.
It's very reinforcing to know that employers are upping the bid on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When they're actually bidding, that is.

SIGEL'S BEST SHOT NOT QUITE ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-SIGEL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ There must be something in the New England air
that brings out the best in Jay Sigel. He won an emotional US
Amateur championship at The Country Club in 1982, breaking down as
he talked about the magic of the moment. He won the prestigious
Northeastern Amateur at Wannamoisett CC three times, a record.
</P>
<P>
   So didn't it figure that he would become a factor on the PGA
Senior Tour after he became a late convert to the professional game
as age 50 approached? Especially when the venue shifted to
Nashawtuc CC for the BankBoston Classic? When he missed makeable
putts in Sunday's final round to settle for a tie for third, just
one shot out of the playoff between Hale Irwin and Tom McGinnis, it
solidified Sigel's regional presence again.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling during a year in which he has been limited by
nagging shoulder injuries, Sigel followed up his runner-up position
to Irwin a year ago, when he trailed by two, and a tie for second
in 1996 when he and Tom Wargo trailed Jim Dent by one. He has
earned $268,050 without a victory in the six years he has played in
this tournament since he stepped away from a profitable insurance
partnership in the suburbs of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically lodged in 45th place on the Senior Tour
money list in a year in which he has had five top 10 finishes
before Sunday's third place matched his two previous lows, in the
Senior Slam and the Legends of Golf, Sigel rekindled the fires in
the home stretch when he hit an 8-iron to 6 feet on the 11th to set
up a run of three straight birdies. He ran in putts from 15 feet
and 18 feet on the next two holes.
</P>
<P>
   That pulled Sigel within one of the lead tenaciously held by
Irwin, who was seeking to join Chi Chi Rodriguez (1986-88) as the
only three-time winner of the Senior Tour's oldest 54-hole event,
which will celebrate its 20th birthday next year at Nashawtuc.
There were solid runs at birdie putts on the final two holes on
this dark, overcast, and chilly afternoon before a robust and
appreciative crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played pretty solid coming in,'' said Sigel, ``and if I can
take anything from this tournament that would be it. The shot I hit
on 17 was a pleaser. I hit the putt just the way I wanted to. It
actually hit something. I don't know what. It just threw it off to
the right. The putt on 18 was exactly what I thought it took. I was
pleased with that when it left the putter. It was a good finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bogey I took on the (par-5) fifth was the killer. I hit it
pretty well off the tee. I was playing safe. I didn't think I could
get it home. I had a funny lie on a mound. I ended up under a tree.
I was on the green about 40 feet away and I three-putted. Instead
of making a 4, I made a 6. I played OK other than that on the front
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The hole that got Sigel untracked and started his climb into
contention was the 11th. ``I must have outhit George (Archer) and
Hale by 25 yards,'' he said. ``They're out there with 5-irons, and
the pin was tucked right over the bunker. Hale hits first and hit
it about 6 feet. George hit second and hits it 6 feet. I hit an
8-iron and hit it about 6 feet. I asked them at that point if they
wanted me to play on through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately I made it. I got into position to win, so overall
I'm pleased. I felt I was back in the game after 13, but not having
birdied 10 from right in front of the green hurt. I thought I was
in the game. I hit good shots coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to get yourself in position and test yourself,'' said
Sigel, who led the field by two shots after an opening-round 67.
``It's been a heck of a test. It's been a tough year. I just
haven't played that well. I did a lot of good things this week. For
the most part I've played fairly well when my shoulder didn't hurt.
I'm encouraged. I really do like the golf course. It's part of my
good play.''

JAMES TAPS PARNEVIK, COLTART 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently undaunted by the fact his team already is laden with
Ryder Cup rookies, European captain Mark James Sunday added another
inexperienced player to his 12-man team that will take on the
United States next month at The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing one captain's pick that was no surprise (Jesper
Parnevik), James shocked many by choosing Scotland's Andrew
Coltart. In so doing, James bypassed Bernhard Langer, a veteran of
nine Ryder Cups, as well as Ian Woosnam (eight) and Nick Faldo
(11). Faldo's selection was considered a long shot at best, though
his candidacy had been trumpeted in recent weeks by Europe's best
player, Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   But James gave more emphasis to recent form than experience in
choosing Coltart, 29. ``It doesn't matter who has been there
before,'' said James Sunday after the BMW International Open in
Munich, ``it's the standard of players you have here now.'' It was
an indication that Langer, Faldo, and Woosnam had failed to show
James they were on top of their games in recent weeks. Coltart,
said James, has played very well and finished higher than Langer
and Faldo at the recent PGA Championship at Medinah Country Club
outside of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Coltart means Europe will field just five
players with Ryder Cup experience _ Montgomerie, Parnevik, Lee
Westwood, Darren Clarke, and Jose Maria Olazabal. Coltart and six
others _ Paul Lawrie, Miguel Angel Jimenez, Sergio Garcia, Jarmo
Sandelin, Jean Van de Velde, and Padraig Harrington _ never have
played in golf's most prestigious team event.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, said James, the decision did not come down to
Coltart or a veteran, but to Coltart or another inexperienced
player, Robert Karlsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough decision,'' said James of passing over the
Swede, who was 11th in the standings, in favor of Coltart, who was
12th. ``He handled it with real calm, with equanimity. Not much I
can tell him. I can apologize for not picking him, but that's not
going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson had entered the BMW International in 10th place in the
European standings but got bumped when Harrington finished second,
behind Montgomerie, earning enough points to jump from 13th to
10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Padraig was under the most severe pressure again (he had to
finish second to make the team) and he had that bad start (4 over
par through four holes) and coped with that and came through and
delivered the goods,'' said James.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington played the remaining 14 holes at 4 under to finish
one shot ahead of Jarrod Moseley and three behind Montgomerie, who
won for the fifth time this season on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson's 65 Sunday tied for low round, but it vaulted him to
just a tie for ninth. He needed to finish third.
</P>
<P>
   The choice between Coltart and Karlsson, said James, ``was a
desperate decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One other choice never had to be made, though James confirmed
that had he finished in the top 10 (he finished 13th), ``I would
have played'' and Ken Brown would have captained the team.
</P>
<P>
   James and his team were scheduled to leave Sunday night for the
US, where they will play in this week's NEC Invitational in Akron,
Ohio.

L.A. MARCH SEEKS TO SILENCE HATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some 500 people of different races and religions
used the streets of suburban West Hills to march against hate
Sunday, demonstrating their commitment to resisting bigotry and
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us agree we will not allow this darkness to put out our
light,'' Universalist Unitarian Community Church representative
Gwynne Guibord told marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us agree we will not allow fear to grip our hearts and
silence our voices.''
</P>
<P>
   The March Against Hate was one of numerous community events held
in Los Angeles following the shooting of five people at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center and the slaying of a mail carrier in
Chatsworth two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say avowed white supremacist Buford O. Furrow Jr.
targeted Filipino-American postal worker Joseph Ileto because he
was a minority and a federal employee, and he targeted the
community center because its members are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was indicted on a federal murder charge Thursday for
which he could face the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   While Furrow allegedly said he intended the shootings to be a
``wake-up call'' for Americans to start killing Jews, in some
respects the opposite has happened since then, marchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Jews, Christians, whites, African-Americans, Latinos and other
groups have come together in the last two weeks in a number of
rallies, forums and public discussions to not only condemn the
shootings, but to work on preventing hate crimes and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of dividing us, it has united our community as never
before,'' said Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Granada Hills, as he
marched down Fallbrook Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Participants braved the near triple-digit heat and walked about
one mile down Fallbrook, from Saticoy to Vanowen streets, then held
the ``Rally in the Valley'' at Shadow Ranch Park, across from a
Jewish community center on Vanowen.
</P>
<P>
   They carried signs against hate and chanted, ``We march for
peace'' and ``No more hate,'' as cars whizzed by, honking their
horns in approval.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers and speakers said that while Americans must resist
intolerance, they should not learn to hate the groups that preach
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow ourselves to become like those who seek to
destroy our lives,'' said Rabbi Aron Kreigel of Temple Ner Maarav
in Encino. ``For if we are, we shall find the haters have destroyed
our souls also.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, called for a number of
legislative changes at the state and federal level to prevent and
prosecute hate crimes, including: adding a tagging agent to
explosives which would allow officials to trace their source after
an explosion; instituting stricter gun controls, including
crackdowns on gun shows; teaching tolerance in schools; and
supporting a bill pending in Congress to expand the definition of
hate crimes to include sexual orientation, gender and disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all targets of opportunity for those who hate,''
Sherman said, referring to a phrase Furrow allegedly used to
describe why he shot Ileto. ``The question is, What shall we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the marchers was a group that had experienced directly
fighting a much larger group of haters _ a local Jewish War
Veterans post whose members battled the Nazis in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Leventhal, a member of the San Fernando Valley-based Post
603, said they mistakenly thought they were defeating bigotry when
they defeated Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went into the service a long time ago to end this, and
it certainly hasn't ended,'' said Leventhal, 82, a Studio City
resident. But, he added, society has continued to make gradual
progress since then.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's march, sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Interfaith
Council, also marked the kickoff of the Turn On a Love Light
campaign, which urges residents to turn their porch lights on
through Aug. 29 to demonstrate goodwill toward their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The march was aimed at almost every type of hate crime, with
speakers addressing crimes against gays and lesbians, the
handicapped, Latinos, women, Jews and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sends a message to the hatemongers,'' said Sid
Gold, a Woodland Hills psychiatrist who was among the marchers.
``It shows we're not gonna take it anymore.''

RANGERS ARE AMAZING, BUT CAN THEY MAKE YANKEES DISAPPEAR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ And now, the New York Yankees. The final
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the best record in the American League since the
All-Star break kept rolling along Sunday night, defying gravity,
ignoring what used to be tradition, outrunning even those
precocious Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing Texas Rangers, behind the amazing Aaron Sele, tidied
the trimmings on an amazing three-game sweep of the wild-card
contending Boston Red Sox on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   For three nights, the Rangers brandished timely hitting,
Octoberesque pitching and rally snuffing defense. We saw Esteban
Loaiza, almost cast adrift in the July bulrushes, win on Friday. We
saw Rick Helling and the Yale-lock bullpen win on Saturday. We saw
the Rangers' most reliable magic act, The Great Palmeiro, make four
baseballs disappear into thin air.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday night, we saw Sele, the human Indiana Jones episode,
darting into and out of trouble. The Rangers' 6-0 victory was his
14th.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Yankees arriving for three games, beginning
Monday, it opens the door for either (A) a sobering dose of
reality, or (B) hints of a New World Order, as far as the Rangers
are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, the Rangers haven't defeated the Yankees since
the Grover Cleveland administration. (Actually, New York has
mastered the Rangers 21 of 31 times, dating to the beginning of
1997).
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now, as the sweep of the Red Sox
boldly suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well,'' left fielder Rusty Greer observed. ``I
think our pitching staff has been overlooked in all this. We've
done a lot of good things _ hit the ball well and played good
defense. But it all begins with pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele proved that by going the distance for his second
complete-game shutout of the season. It wasn't a Renoir, by any
means. But it at least belongs on the family refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Sele surrendered Red Sox hits in each of the game's first seven
innings. Yet each time, he seemed to snuff the threat with a timely
ground-ball out or on a spotlight defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was trying to do was to throw strikes,'' Sele said,
after beating his former team for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't any more complicated than that. Sele walked only two
and stayed ahead of hitters, relying on his curve ball, when he
most needed to. Sele tossed a large bouquet in the direction of his
defense, which made a half-dozen rally dousing plays behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starting pitchers should be doing what's going on right
now,'' said shortstop Royce Clayton, whose into-the-hole
sleight-of-hand play in the sixth inning was one of the night's
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season, they were said to be our Achilles' heel.
Right now, we just have to tip our hats to them. Everybody up and
down the lineup is doing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the Rangers may have enjoyed the best of the
pitching matchups in the weekend series. Conspicuously not taking a
turn for Boston were Pedro Martinez and an injured Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Yankees, meanwhile, the Rangers will face a hot Andy
Pettitte, David Cone and Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates will counter with, in order, John Burkett,
Mike Morgan and Loaiza. Clearly, the home team's recent magic will
be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play good ballclubs, it's how well you pitch,'' Oates
said Sunday night. ``You look at the series against them last year
(the AL divisional series), and I thought we pitched well. We gave
up, what, nine runs in three games?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played them very close. You go back and look.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates is right. But the feeling persists among Rangers faithful
that the home team is never far from a recurring case of the
Pinstripe Flu. Palms sweat. Knees and bats turn weak.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But in simple black and white terms, the Rangers hold
baseball's best record since the July break _ 27-11, a mark that
allowed them to put elbow space between themselves and even
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   But now, can they make even the Yankees disappear?

SOMETIMES OPPORTUNITY DOES KNOCK &HT;    By STAN BUNGER and JAN BOYD
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ It started like so many other product pitches:
Someone knocked at the door of our KRON-TV bureau here, wondering
if it would be possible to talk with someone inside about a
``really interesting new company.''
</P>
<P>
   We try to discourage this sort of sneak attack, else we'd never
get any work done around here.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to say ``no'' to a bunch of earnest teenagers, all
decked out in trade-show badges.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors turned out to be students at California High School
in San Ramon, Calif. They'd come to San Jose for the LinuxWorld
Conference. Their badges identified their company as Vector Crew
Development. Apparently, Vector Crew Development isn't big on
corporate structure because the guy in charge, Aaron Wadler, lists
his title as ``The Big Cheese.'' Poised, confident and very
familiar with the world of computers, he'll be entering 11th grade
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And what exactly is Vector Crew Development's business? A flavor
of the free Linux computer operating system known as Sinux. Wadler
says Sinux is designed to work with home-automation software, which
allows users to control things like lights, sprinkler systems and
air conditioners from their computers. It also supports recording
and playback of MP3 music files. Their first version is now in
public release.
</P>
<P>
   No big investors, no fancy offices, no marketing plan. Just a
bunch of kids hacking away at source code. Enough to want to make
us answer the door more often.
</P>
<P>
   Crash Test.
</P>
<P>
   You can do all the focus group research you want, hire all the
best engineers to tweak and fine-tune things, but what it really
comes down to with any new product is: Does it work?
</P>
<P>
   Craig Lynar, vice president of marketing at Etak of Menlo Park,
Calif., found out the hard way that, yes, Etak's new service does
work. Etak is in the map and navigation business. Its Traffic Touch
service delivers updated traffic information to users of the
wireless Palm VII handheld computer.
</P>
<P>
   A subscriber can customize the service so that information about
accidents and traffic jams on his commute route shows up on the
Palm VII screen.
</P>
<P>
   Lynar's job is to sell the world on the virtues of knowing
what's on the road ahead. But he became a guinea pig when he was
involved in an accident on Interstate 680. ``Someone rear-ended
me,'' Lynar said, ``and I actually timed it. It was two minutes
before the incident popped up on the Traffic Touch screen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news, as far as Lynar was concerned. The bad
news? He says it took the California Highway Patrol more than three
hours to get an officer out to take a report.
</P>
<P>
   Some things, technology can't fix.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld Cash.
</P>
<P>
   And from the ``you gotta be a geek to love it'' category: A Palo
Alto (Calif.) startup called Confinity hopes to persuade you to
carry your cash in your PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Confinity's soon-to-be-released PayPal software lets you
download cash value via the Internet. You can debit a checking
account or charge the cash against a credit card. Either way, you
wind up with digital cash in your handheld computer.
</P>
<P>
   And then what? Confinity believes that there's going to be a
boom in demand for cashless transactions. ``It's not going to be
the e-commerce people do on their desktop,'' argues Confinity CEO
Peter Thiel. ``It's the e-commerce people do in the real world,
away from the desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone carrying a wad of PayPal cash on a PalmPilot could
``beam'' some money to another Palm user via the Palm's infrared
technology. For example, at the end of lunch, when it's time to
split the tab, the old ``but I only have a $50 bill'' stunt could
be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've received e-cash this way, you have a couple of
choices.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to Confinity's Web site and convert the e-cash back
into real money in the account of your choice (Confinity hopes to
make its profit from the ``float'' while money circulates), or you
can pass it on to someone else at the end of your next lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Tag, you're it.

MO BOILS OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 c.1999 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels had just concluded another
pratfall-filled loss Sunday, this one in especially embarrassing
fashion to the equally troubled Tigers. And Mo Vaughn responded by
going into turbo-clean mode in the Angels clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After Detroit routed the Angels 12-3 at Edison Field, a game
that included a sloppy six-run ninth inning, Vaughn started
slamming boxes, throwing out old clothes and tossing used
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just get it out _ get it all out,'' Vaughn said as he slumped
forward in his chair. ``When I clean things, it's like snapping for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   From two stalls down, Jim Edmonds interjected: ``Then just
imagine how dirty his house must be when he's going good.''
</P>
<P>
   No need for domestic help at the Vaughn compound. Not this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's debacle was another horrific rerun _ the Tigers scored
early, then the Angels' major-league-worst offense found itself in
a position in which it had to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels came up with three runs in the seventh, boosted by
Troy Glaus' two-run homer, but it wasn't enough. In Vaughn's view,
it hasn't been enough all season, and he accepted personal
responsibility for the team's limp attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is all over, I definitely take the blame for this
year's lack of offense,'' Vaughn said. ``I don't know if that's
right or that's wrong. That's just the way I am. I don't have any
excuses to give you and I won't make any.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, signed to a six-year, $80 million contract in the
offseason, has been slowed by a badly sprained ankle and a staph
infection. He was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and two groundouts
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His mates up and down the lineup have also fallen victim to
injuries, but Vaughn sees only the loss column and his own lack of
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like I can't wait for spring training to start,''
he said. ``I still love to play and I come to play because I love
this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll take responsibility and I'll definitely do something
about it in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates can't wait for the season to end, either. Two
different golf tournaments were on the clubhouse televisions before
the game. Emanating from the coaches' room was a conversation about
the advantages of graphite rather than steel shafts.
</P>
<P>
   No, the end can't come fast enough. Even recording mop-up outs
has become a challenge. The Angels had cut it to 6-3, but hopes for
a rally were quashed in a miserable ninth that included an error,
five hits, a hit batsman and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Angels reliever Mark Petkovsek was hammered for six runs (five
earned) without recording an out. Shortstop Jeff Huson didn't help
the cause, fielding a Brad Ausmus grounder and botching the force
play at second when he threw the ball over Trent Durrington's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible situation and I let it steamroll,''
Petkovsek said.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers center fielder Juan Encarnacion hit a three-run homer off
Angels starter Steve Sparks (5-10) in the first inning and added
RBI singles in the sixth and ninth. His five RBI were a career
high.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki (9-10) won his fourth consecutive start, striking out six
in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, who was traded by the Dodgers for right-hander
Robinson Checo and two minor-leaguers on April 16, has a lower ERA
than Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park and a higher victory total
than Ismael Valdes.

`SIXTH SENSE' PREVAILS, BUT YOU KNEW THAT

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Horror remained potent at the nation's multiplexes
as the third weekend of ``The Sixth Sense'' easily led with an
impressive $24.1 million at 2,688 theaters amid a moderate weekend
overall at the box office, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense,'' focused on an 8-year-old boy beset by supernatural
forces, continued to obliterate forecasts by losing only 6 percent
from the previous weekend. The Disney release has now taken in an
astounding $107.7 million in 17 days during a period when
moviegoing traditionally falls off sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense,'' now the 13th 1999 release and 195th of all time to
pass $100 million domestically, was so powerful that it outgrossed
the combined total of the three new releases _ ``Mickey Blue Eyes''
in third with $10.4 million at 2,573 theaters, ``Universal Soldier:
The Return'' in seventh with $4.7 million at 1,639 screens and
``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' in 10th with $3.3 million at 1,710 sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great bookend to the summer,'' declared Disney
distribution chief Chuck Viane, who predicted ``Sixth Sense'' will
hit the $200 million mark. ``It has the greatest legs of any movie
since `Titanic.' We have a lot of people going to see it a second
time to figure out what they missed the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said ``Sixth Sense'' has benefited from strong word-of-mouth among
moviegoers. ``It's become the film to see twice, almost like eating
potato chips,'' he added. ``Disney was very smart to recognize this
was going to be a hit and move it into the summer from the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell noted ``Sixth Sense'' had
managed to attract audiences from every demographic. ``When you add
in those incremental pieces, that's when you have a hit film,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Disney added 293 theaters to ``Sixth Sense'' this weekend and
that helped prop up an otherwise lukewarm weekend with overall
business at $103 million, up 9 percent from the same weekend last
year but a far cry from topping $150 million on consecutive
weekends in late July and early August. With the opening of school
on the minds of younger moviegoers, adult-oriented films took the
next four slots led by the second weekend of Universal's
``Bowfinger'' with $10.7 million at 2,717 theaters as the comedy
dropped 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's opening of romantic comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes,''
starring Hugh Grant and Jeanne Tripplehorn, followed with $10.4
million as it performed at the low end of expectations. ``Mickey''
faced direct competition from Paramount's fourth weekend of
``Runaway Bride'' with $9.4 million at 3,240 theaters as the Julia
Roberts' vehicle has nearly matched the $114 million total of
``Notting Hill,'' which paired Grant and Roberts earlier this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   MGM's third weekend of ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' continued to
post respectable grosses in fifth with $7 million at 2,427
theaters. ``There's a lot of competition for the date-crowd
audience right now,'' Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan's sixth weekend of low-budget sensation ``The Blair
Witch Project'' finished a close sixth with $6.9 million at 2,538
theaters, dropping 52 percent as the excitement over the offbeat
project began to fade. Still, ``Blair'' has become the most
profitable movie in memory with overall gross now past $120
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's opening of ``Universal Soldier: The Return,'' with
Jean-Claude Van Damme, fell short of expectations with $4.7 million
and will finish nowhere near the $36 million total domestic gross
from the 1992 original. But the project _ costing a reported $20
million _ should take in enough overseas to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fifth weekend of ``Inspector Gadget'' came in eighth
with $4.3 million at 2,144 theaters, edging Warner's fourth weekend
of ``Deep Blue Sea'' with $4.28 million at 2,246 sites. Both
finished far ahead of ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' with a disappointing
$3.3 million as the high-school comedy-thriller debuted well under
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted that the poor opening for ``Tingle,'' starring
Katie Holmes of the ``Dawson's Creek'' TV series, underscores the
difficulty in marketing to the teen audience. ``They want either
light comedies like `American Pie' and `She's All That' or horror
films rather than an edgy comedy like this,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``Mystery Men'' finished 11th with
$2.6 million at 1,954 theaters, followed by Warner's third weekend
of ``The Iron Giant'' with $2.4 million at 1,943 sites and
Universal's seventh weekend of ``American Pie'' with $2 million at
1,118 locations to go past $94 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The summer season remains 20 percent above last year's
record-setting pace. ``It is amazing how strong the box office was
this weekend without any major contribution from the opening
films,'' Rockwell said. ``It shows people will continue to go if
they believe there are quality films for them to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted ``Sixth Sense'' will lead again next weekend
with its closest challenge coming from Disney's opening of medieval
epic ``The 13th Warrior,'' starring Antonio Banderas. Also opening
will be Miramax's action project ``In Too Deep,'' Universal's
``Dudley Do-Right,'' Warner's family drama ``A Dog of Flanders,''
New Line's thriller ``The Astronaut's Wife'' and USA Films' ``The
Muse,'' a comedy with Albert Brooks and Sharon Stone.

RANGERS KNOCK OFF RED SOX AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This morning's box score will show that the
bottom third of the Texas Rangers' lineup produced a meager two
hits and one run batted in during their 11 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear the three provided no significant contribution
during Sunday night's 6-0 victory against the Boston Red Sox at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   What the box score fails to reveal, though, is that there was no
glove lost among the three.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Lee Stevens, shortstop Royce Clayton and center
fielder Tom Goodwin nurtured right-hander Aaron Sele through his
second shutout this season with their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton handled seven chances cleanly and delivered perhaps the
game's two most pivotal plays from his defensive position. Stevens
started a 3-6-3 double play, made two 3-1 putouts and another three
unassisted putouts appear routine. Goodwin recovered from a poor
jump on a seventh-inning fly ball to snuff Boston's final
legitimate scoring opportunity on the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more indicative of what I was expecting out of spring
training,'' manager Johnny Oates said of the Rangers' flawless
defensive execution. ``We're playing really well defensively right
now. We're also getting good pitching and hitting, and we're
playing really well as a result. I think it all goes hand in
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele (14-7) scattered eight hits and issued two walks during his
125-pitch effort and allowed at least one Red Sox runner aboard
every inning except for his 1-2-3 eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was trying to do was throw strikes,'' Sele said. ``Pudge
did a great job back there calling the game. Royce made a couple of
nice defensive plays, and Lee made several great plays at first
base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox mounted their best threat with consecutive
fifth-inning singles by catcher Jason Varitek and center fielder
Darren Lewis. That brought right fielder Trot Nixon to the plate
with two aboard and none out, but Sele used his curveball to induce
a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore fielded it cleanly and started a
rally-killing 4-6-3 double play that Clayton completed with a
strong-armed throw to Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really impressed with the way he pitched tonight,''
Oates said of Sele. ``He spread (the hits) out, but the key for him
was the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lineup supported Sele with six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro drove in two runs and hit his
seventh home run in as many games with his sixth-inning,
bases-empty blast off Boston's Tim Wakefield (4-9). Rusty Greer
collected two hits to improve his batting average to .296 and drove
in another two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The performances by Palmeiro and Greer appear more sexy, but the
Rangers won Sunday night's game with defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to be that time of year,'' Clayton said,
``where you just have to be solid all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin joined the act during the seventh inning after Lewis and
Nixon reached with two outs, and Boston second baseman Jose
Offerman sent a 1-0 pitch to the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a ball I didn't think he hit as well as he did,''
Goodwin said. `` I kind of got a late jump on it, and the ball just
kept carrying. I was like, `Oh, I hope I catch it.' I made the easy
play look hard while they made the hard plays look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would ever know from the box score. nn

if they drew up a ``wish list'' after Saturday night's 34-14 loss
at New England.
</P>
<P>
   With two preseason games remaining at Texas Stadium, including
Sunday night against the two-time defending Super Bowl champion
Denver Broncos, Gailey said, ``We have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In three exhibitions, the Cowboys have been outscored 64-34,
outrushed by nearly 70 yards per game and outgained by more than
100 net yards per game. About the only statistical category that
the Cowboys lead week in and week out against their preseason
opponents is the number of inactive players, which hit 19 against
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, here are 10 wishes that the Cowboys might need to
be granted before they open the regular season Sept. 12 at
Washington, and preferably sooner rather than later:
</P>
<P>
   1. Stabilize the offensive line; fix right guard. It's broken.
</P>
<P>
   Converted offensive tackle Solomon Page, a rookie, has started
all three games at right guard in place of the injured Everett
McIver (knee surgery), who will practice with the team today for
the first time since November. Tony Hutson (knee sprain) will make
this his second practice since the first week of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to get a combination of those two guys \RMcIver
and Hutson\S playing for a half against Denver,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   2. Resolve cornerback issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bad became worse when starting left cornerback Kevin Mathis was
beaten twice on deep passes from Drew Bledsoe to Terry Glenn
Saturday night. This has become a position of attrition for the
Cowboys, who are without a timetable on Deion Sanders (April toe
surgery), and remain in the dark on Kevin Smith (bulging disc), who
hasn't been in camp for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Monday, we should have a better feel \Ras to whether or
not Smith can be ready\S for the first part of the season,'' said
Gailey, who awaits a medical report today on Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility exists that the Cowboys will bring in a veteran
cornerback, depending on Smith's prognosis, but not likely before
the NFL roster cutdowns to 60 on Aug. 31 or to 53 on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   3. Put quarterback Troy Aikman in a position to win.
</P>
<P>
   Playing one quarter in each of the Cowboys' three games, Aikman
has completed 62.2 percent of his passes (23 of 37) for 222 yards,
one TD, two interceptions and no sacks. The first two games _
losses to Cleveland and Oakland _ Aikman and the first team moved
the ball but didn't score. Against New England, they finally scored
but struggled (2-for-5) on third down.
</P>
<P>
   4. Beef up the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys defense has four sacks in three games, including
none against the Patriots. The first team is looking for its first
sack of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you can judge a pass rush against Bledsoe,''
Gailey said. ``The ball is out in a real hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first-team defense also was sackless against
Cleveland's Ty Detmer and Oakland's Rich Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   5. Launch Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Idled since Aug. 4 with a slightly separated shoulder, wide
receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail warmed up prior to Saturday
night's game but was held out for a third consecutive week by
Gailey, this time because of a slick field caused by an incessant
rain at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocket came up to me and thought he could play,'' Gailey said.
``But if he would have gotten in a freak fall and landed on that
shoulder, we'd be back to square one ... so I held him \Rout\S.''
</P>
<P>
   With James McKnight out for the season (torn knee ligament) and
Ismail looking for his first preseason game as a Cowboy, rookie
Wane McGarity (10.3 average on six catches) and Jeff Ogden (13.0 on
five) are battling for the No. 4 job. TCU rookie free agent Jason
Tucker (21.2 on five), with three catches for 79 yards and a TD
Saturday night, steps up to battle for the No. 5 job.
</P>
<P>
   6. Script a two-minute drill for the first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   The shotgun in passing situations seems to be growing on Aikman,
who never used it before last season. But now he needs the
two-minute drill, and he needs to run it with as many starters as
the casualty count will allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get Troy in there Saturday night for a two-minute
drive _ forced or unforced almost _ at the end of the first half,''
Gailey said. ``If we have the ball with four minutes left \Rbefore
halftime\S, we might just go to it right there.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Commitment at strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Quentin Coryatt has been sidelined most of camp with
a strained hamstring and Achilles' tendon. Darren Hambrick, who has
impressed Gailey with an improved attitude this year, has started
each of the Cowboys' three games.
</P>
<P>
   It is still Coryatt's job to lose. But since the former
first-round pick (second overall in '92) of the Indianapolis Colts
missed all last season with reconstructive shoulder surgery, and
since this is a new defense for him, Gailey has said, ``He
definitely needs reps in our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Either Coryatt gets sufficient practice/preseason to learn it,
or he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   8. Get the running game untracked.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith had his best game of the preseason and has 13
carries for 53 yards (4.1 average). But Chris Warren, with seven
preseason carries for 23 yards (3.3 average), missed the Patriots
game, consequently tabling any chance he had this week to work in
the same backfield with Smith or to develop as the team's
third-down back. Warren spent last week in Colorado, receiving
medical treatment for a groin injury that cut short his '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the preseason carries for the Cowboys have gone to a
pair of young free agents, Tarik Smith and Devis Manns, who have
combined for 136 yards on 34 carries (4.0). The Cowboys have yet to
score a rushing TD this preseason.
</P>
<P>
   9. Push the fast-forward button on defensive line progress.
</P>
<P>
   Said veteran tackle Chad Hennings: ``We finally really have the
talent that we had on the defensive line when I came to the Cowboys
in '92. We have some young kids who have speed, strength, the whole
package. It's just a matter of getting them developed.''
</P>
<P>
   10. Wish the preseason away.
</P>
<P>
   Or if that doesn't work, learn from mistakes. As Aikman said
after the game, ``Nobody is beating themselves over the head \Rat
being 0-3\S. This is preseason.'' nn

   GILEAD'S SUCCESS HAS BEEN A BALM FOR BIOTECH INVESTORS &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As far as Wall Street is concerned, biotech
resembles a Third World country, with a few rich, elite companies
and hundreds of small, ill-funded ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 months, Gilead Sciences has risen to the apex of
the triangle. Shares in the Foster City (Calif.) company, which
have skyrocketed 250 percent in the past year, gained $2.50 Friday
(August 20) to close at $81.63. With nearly 38 million shares
outstanding, Gilead enjoys a market capitalization of $3.44
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting into that realm of market cap and liquidity makes it a
stock the mutual and pension funds can buy,'' said analyst Tom
Dietz, with Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And buy they have. Institutions now own more than 80 percent of
Gilead's shares, giving it the sort of stable ownership envied by
the majority of biotech firms, whose stock is mostly held by small
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead isn't profitable yet and doesn't expect to make money for
another year. Even so, Wall Street is betting that by the end of
1999, Gilead will win Food and Drug Administration approval to sell
two new drugs _ a flu remedy and a treatment for people with
drug-resistant forms of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   At Gilead headquarters, where a large chunk of the 350-person
staff is focused on the FDA-approval process, Chief Financial
Officer Mark Perry reflected on the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the hundreds of publicly traded biotech companies, only 10
or 12 have broken through and become profitable,'' he said. ``We
think we have the legs to make it all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The first critical hurdles come this fall, when the FDA must
give its final yea or nay to Gilead's two drug candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Treanor, an infectious disease expert at the University
of Rochester in New York, was a lead researcher on the clinical
trials that Gilead will present in favor of its anti-flu drug,
Tamiflu.
</P>
<P>
   Treanor said the experimental data show that people given a
single Tamiflu pill each day for five days had shorter, less
violent flu symptoms. Gilead hopes the FDA will approve the drug by
the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead bases that hope partly on the fact that the FDA recently
OKd a competing anti-flu drug, called Relenza, indicating the
agency is favorably disposed toward new flu treatments. The
disease, a mere annoyance to the young and healthy, kills 20,000 to
40,000 Americans each year, most of them elderly or with weakened
immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Should Tamiflu win approval, it will be marketed by the Swiss
drug firm, Roche, and probably will sell for $50 to $75 per
treatment. Gilead will collect a royalty of 15 to 20 percent on
Tamiflu sales.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead will undergo even more intense FDA scrutiny of its second
drug candidate, Adefovir dipivoxil, an AIDS treatment. The first
hint of FDA sentiment will come November 1, when a scientific
advisory panel reviews the outcome of 10,000 AIDS patients who were
given experimental doses of Adefovir over the past six years. The
panel will advise the full FDA on whether or not to approve the
drug. An FDA decision is expected before year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Jaffe, Gilead's vice president for drug development,
outlined the company's pitch. Adefovir seems to interrupt the
normal reproductive process of the AIDS virus. Several drugs
already on the market perform similar tasks, but Gilead will argue
that Adefovir is most effective in treating people who have begun
to develop resistance to commonly prescribed AIDS drugs, like AZT
or 3TC.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA advisory panel will have to weigh Adefovir's claimed
benefits against its apparent drawback: Long-term dosing seems to
interfere with the kidney's ability to clean the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Hardy, a Los Angeles physician who participated in the
clinical trials of Adefovir, said the kidney problem was minor for
most patients. He would like to see Adefovir approved.
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA agrees, patients could expect an annual treatment to
cost between $2,500 and $3,800. Most important to investors is the
fact that Gilead will market Adefovir itself and therefore keep all
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are impressed by the creative way in which Gilead
built an international sales force to market Adefovir without
having to license the drug to a partner, as it did with Tamiflu.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals in March in a
stock swap valued at $550 million. NeXstar, which is based in
Colorado, had already built a European sales force to market an
anti-fungal drug called AmBisome. NeXstar gave Gilead a European
sales force, plus $100 million in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The merger between the two companies closed only a couple of
weeks ago. NeXstar has about 480 people, to Gilead's 350. Dietz,
the San Francisco analyst, said Gilead will tell investors on
September 8 how it plans to ``rationalize'' the staffs and research
programs at the two firms. Wall Street will be looking for
aggressive cost controls.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the factors affecting Gilead's future are unknowable,
like whether the FDA will OK Tamiflu and Adefovir. But Wall Street
is confident enough in the company's management to overlook these
unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that has had the right mix of panache and
disciplined science,'' said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Franklin
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The panache was supplied by Michael Riordan, who founded the
company in 1987 and named it for the ``balm of Gilead,'' a plant
referred to in the Bible as having miraculous healing properties.
Riordan, who took the company public in 1992 at $15 a share, ``had
a bit of the showman in him,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Riordan bowed out of the firm in the mid-1990s when Gilead's
original research focus _ it was founded on the ``antisense'' fad,
using bits of good DNA to correct defects caused by bad DNA _
proved as elusive as the Biblical balm.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Riordan had recruited and groomed his successor,
John Martin, who became chief executive in 1996. In the 1970s and
'80s, Martin earned a reputation as one of the world's foremost
antiviral experts. His ascension gave Gilead the scientific focus
that has brought the company to the threshold of profitability,
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late for small investors to get into Gilead? Consider
this. An FDA disappointment on Tamiflu or Adefovir _ or, God
forbid, both! _ could deflate the stock with the rude sound of a
whoopee cushion.
</P>
<P>
   But institutional investors are betting that Gilead has built
something rare in the biotech world _ a company capable of
discovering, developing and marketing a succession of products.
Gilead already has enrolled 198 patients in a Phase II study of
Tenofovir, an ``improved'' version of adefovir that could be more
potent against AIDS, with fewer side effects. Investors are waiting
for Gilead to release data on the Tenofovir tests, which could come
as early as September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what we're seeing in the stock price is that people
are beginning to realize the breadth and depth of the portfolio at
Gilead,'' said company CFO Perry.

FROM BAD TO WORSE  
 `CAMP CATASTROPHE' TAKES TOLL ON CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - With all that has gone wrong for the Cardinals in
the past three weeks, no one was shocked to see a small cast Sunday
on the left hand of starting left tackle Anthony Clement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this team is like a dark comedy,'' offensive
lineman Matt Joyce said. ``Just when you think it can't get worse,
it gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement suffered a small fracture of the ulnar styloid bone near
his wrist in Friday night's 27-17 preseason victory over Tennessee.
He likely will wear a soft cast for about a month but will play
with the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is the latest misfortune to strike the team since
``Camp Catastrophe'' opened July 30. In the past three weeks, three
players were injured in a car accident, three players remain
holdouts, the offensive line has been decimated by injuries and
starting quarterback Jake Plummer suffered a thumb injury to his
throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gone so bad that one team official suggested the
coaches lock Plummer in a room and not let him out until the day
before Sept. 12 season opener in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill has seen worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1940s, a player sneezed in the hotel lobby and was out
for a week with a bad back,'' Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a recap of the camp's calamities: &QL; 
Ominous beginning &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The night before camp opened, the team's top receiver of a year
ago, Frank Sanders, walked out of the cafeteria at the DuBois
Center on Northern Arizona University's campus and stepped in a
pothole. He suffered an injured left ankle that caused him to miss
the first two workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the eve of camp, the team placed defensive tackle Eric
Swann, their highest-paid defensive lineman, and starting tight end
Johnny McWilliams on the physically unable to perform list. Swann
still hasn't recovered from off-season knee surgery and has been
unable to pass a physical examination to practice. McWilliams was
bothered by a nagging ankle injury but later was cleared to play.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of practice didn't go much better. Veteran tight
end Chris Gedney was released a few weeks after he had his colon
removed. Gedney could have been placed on the non-football
injury/illness list, and although he wouldn't have been paid, he
still would have felt a part of the team. Instead, the Cardinals
came off cruel and heartless, a public relations disaster that was
the hot topic on talk radio in the Valley for several days. &QL; 
Contract hassles &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals began training camp with four holdouts _
first-round draft picks David Boston and L.J. Shelton and veterans
Mark Smith and Rob Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, only Boston has signed.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight holdouts in the NFL, and three are with the
Cardinals. So at least they lead in the league in one category.
</P>
<P>
   The Shelton holdout has turned into the theater of the absurd.
His agent, Lamont Smith, has threatened to release a tape that he
claims will show the team hasn't negotiated in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith either doesn't have a tape or has lost his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference in Denver nine days ago, Smith claimed
the Cardinals had offered only $2.6 million for a signing bonus,
well below market value.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't ask for the $3.6 million the Cardinals could
offer Shelton, Smith said he didn't want to give the impression he
was signing off on a five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The team isn't any closer to signing Mark Smith, a third-year
defensive tackle, to a long-term deal than it was three months ago.
Smith was unhappy with the $325,000 one-year tender offer he
received last spring and also has rejected a one-year deal for
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With each week, Mark Smith seems to have more leverage. Swann
still isn't practicing and the team can't stop the run,
particularly up the middle. The Cardinals gave up 4.6 yards per
carry in an embarrassing 38-7 loss at Denver in the preseason
opener and allowed 4.2 yards per carry Friday night against
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is expected to sign within the next week, but he has
missed three weeks of camp and won't have a lot of time to get in
shape. &QL; 
Bruised and battered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When second-year tight end Terry Hardy (hamstring) joined
McWilliams on the sideline the second day of camp, it was a bad
sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, only two tight ends were healthy, a frequent
occurrence early.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, only seven or eight offensive linemen practiced,
forcing Tobin to alter his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Starting left guard Chris Dishman injured his elbow the first
week of camp when he got tangled up with defensive lineman Brad
Ottis. Dishman wound up having surgery 10 days ago and likely will
be out until the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Early in camp, Ernest Dye (knee), James Dexter (ankle) and Allen
DeGraffenreid (shoulder) were slowed by injuries. Joyce missed a
couple of days of workouts when he had his knee checked out, but
the X-rays proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   The line was nearly depleted after Dye and starting right guard
Lester Holmes were injured in last week's car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Then in Friday night's victory over Tennessee, Jerome Daniels,
who started in Holmes' spot, suffered a dislocated elbow, an injury
that will put him out of action for four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The serious injuries weren't limited to the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year linebacker Zack Walz hasn't practiced or played
since suffering a neck stinger in an Aug. 7 scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas Williams has been held out of the
first two preseason games because of recurring neck pain. &QL; 
Silver lining? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players know last Monday's car crash could have had a
much worse ending. That's why they mobbed the four passers-by, Paul
Wells, Gary Shira and Kendra and Troy Jacobs, who were honored
before Friday night's game for coming to the aid of Dye, Holmes and
defensive end Carl Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Had they not helped, Dye might have bled to death. His right
arm, which nearly was severed, wouldn't have had a chance to remain
viable.
</P>
<P>
   Dye likely won't play football again. Holmes is healing but
isn't expected to be ready for the Sept. 12 opener in Philadelphia.
Simpson hopes to return to practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was the only of the three at Sun Devil Stadium last
Friday night when Plummer suffered a hyperextended right thumb, a
freakish injury that occurred when Titans defensive lineman Mike
Jones grabbed the quarterback's right thumb and twisted it.
</P>
<P>
   With the way the Cardinals' luck has gone, it's surprising no
one stepped on Plummer's injured hand on the bottom of the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's hand is only bruised. Cardinals players hope that's a
sign the worst is behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think good things are ahead of us,'' Simpson said Sunday.
``Sometimes you have to go through this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much it hurts. &QL;

HOLDOUT IN WORKS FOR `NIK'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Statistically, Nikolai Khabibulin ranks among the top
five goalies in the NHL. Financially, it's doubtful he'll crack the
top 10 _ if and when he ever agrees to a new contract with the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life for Khabibulin, the team's most prominent unsigned
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith dropped a bombshell by saying he was
fed up with the high salary demands of another restricted free
agent, No. 2 center Robert Reichel, and will actively seek to trade
him.
</P>
<P>
   The situation regarding Khabibulin, for the moment, is not as
hard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given `Nik' and his agent (Jay Grossman) three different
offers with three different terms, but his agent has not
responded,'' Smith said. ``Obviously, we expect him to pretty soon
so we can get this guy signed.''
</P>
<P>
   But with veterans scheduled to report to training camp in less
than three weeks and no word yet from the 25-year-old Russian or
his New York-based agent, Grossman, the Coyotes may have to brace
for a holdout.
</P>
<P>
   After four consecutive seasons in which his numbers have
steadily improved, Khabibulin may want up to $4 million per season
_ a salary at least three other agents agree seems to be the going
rate for a goalie of his caliber.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who claim they lost nearly $10 million last season,
will argue they aren't in position to pay that amount. Keith
Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick each make $4 million a year, and in the
season after, Tkachuk will make $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the franchise allotted so much payroll to three
players, it felt forced to trade one away. Teemu Selanne went to
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, along with his 50-plus goals a season.
The two key players received in return _ Oleg Tverdovsky and Chad
Kilger _ have since been dealt.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hopes the Coyotes will sign Khabibulin before
training camp opens Sept. 3. But if significant progress isn't made
shortly, Khabibulin could be headed for a long holdout, leaving
fellow Russian Mikhail Shtalenkov as the only experienced goalie on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for a team on its fourth head coach in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Khabibulin be a holdout? I don't know,'' Smith said. ``If
he doesn't have a contract, he won't be in training camp. That's
something we may have to prepare for. If he's not there, I think
more than anything it's going to hurt his ability to get off to a
good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have a responsibility to this organization to make sure
we're in a good position to go places, and I have been fully
prepared to make Nik one of the top-paid goalies in the league _
for a Group II (free agent).''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the sticking point. The majority of the NHL's
highest-paid goalies entering this season received their huge
salaries after becoming unrestricted free agents at age 31, or they
were re-signed by their own clubs shortly before reaching
unrestricted status.
</P>
<P>
   Smith contends, and many agents agree, that restricted free
agents don't always carry the same financial leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theo Fleury goes from making $3.5 million to $7 million (by
leaving Colorado to sign as an unrestricted free agent with the
Rangers), but does that mean he's three times as good a player
overnight? Of course not,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of restricted guys have signed lucrative deals,
too,'' countered Grossman, Khabibulin's agent.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk is one example. Five years ago, he signed an offer sheet
from the Chicago Blackhawks as a restricted free agent that was
worth $6 million the first year alone. The Winnipeg Jets matched
it, and last season the Coyotes restructured the deal and agreed to
give Tkachuk, still a restricted free agent, an extra year worth a
whopping $8.3 million after this upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin's 32 wins last season tied for fourth-best in the NHL
with Colorado's Patrick Roy and Boston's Byron Dafoe. His 2.13
goals-against average ranked fifth among starters. His .923 save
percentage tied for fourth with Carolina's Arturs Irbe. Only
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek (10) and Dafoe (nine) had more shutouts
than his franchise-record eight.
</P>
<P>
   In his first four full seasons, Khabibulin has averaged 30 wins
a year. Since 1996-97, the Coyotes' first season in the Valley,
only three goalies _ Hasek, Curtis Joseph and New Jersey's Martin
Brodeur _ have faced more shots. Only Hasek and Brodeur have more
shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   On the pay scale, however, Khabibulin's $1.25 million salary
last season was lower than half the league's starting goalies. Even
if he gets a raise of $1 million, at least 13 goalies are scheduled
to earn more than $2.25 million in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman has declined to publicly discuss the negotiations.
Smith has made offers for two, three and four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made legitimate offers and I expect Nik to get
signed,'' Smith said. ``(Grossman) hasn't responded, but I don't
think it's a big deal yet. We'll just wait. I'm not worried about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked this week why he hasn't contacted Smith, Grossman said
virtually the same things he has said all summer:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to negotiate through the media. There's nothing
really to address at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the possibility of a holdout?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something we're ready to comment on,'' Grossman
said. ``It's a little premature at this point.'' &QL;

guy who goes out and gives it his best every day and remains on an
even keel. They will look back on this season and say that he was
the glue that helped them stick together during the National League
West pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old left fielder was at his best Sunday, hitting a
pair of home runs and driving in four runs to spark Arizona to a
7-5 victory against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's first-inning home run was followed in rapid
succession by shots from Matt Williams and Erubiel Durazo, giving
the Diamondbacks three consecutive home runs for the first time in
club history. His second homer gave them a season total of 163,
another team record.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Arizona to 20 games above .500 for the first
time in its history, 72-52. By winning their second in a row and
11th in their past 14, the Diamondbacks also were able to maintain
their 7{-game lead over San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks conclude a four-game series against the Pirates
tonight, then move on to Miami to begin a three-game series against
the Marlins on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had his 50th multihit game of the season (he was second
in the league in that category entering the game) while hitting his
21st and 22nd homers, putting him within one of his career high set
last season with Detroit. He also increased his career-high RBI
total to 84.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, Williams and Durazo hit consecutive homers off
right-hander Jason Schmidt (10-9) and gave the Diamondbacks a 5-0
lead in the first inning. It was the fifth time in club history
that three homers were hit in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona got another run in the fifth when Steve Finley tripled
and scored on a balk by Schmidt, and scored its last run in the
ninth on a leadoff homer by Gonzalez off right-hander Jose Silva.
</P>
<P>
   All the homers were to left field, which included opposite-field
shots by Gonzalez and Durazo. Williams' homer was his 30th of the
season, the sixth time he has reached that level in his career, to
go with 110 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball carried good out to left today,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   He is pleased with his season but insists he is just a piece of
the veteran Diamondbacks puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got balance in our lineup,'' he said. ``We've got four
guys with the potential to drive in 100 (himself, Williams, Jay
Bell and Steve Finley) and four with the potential to score 100
(himself, Williams, Bell and Tony Womack). That's good, especially
when you're in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feed off each other. If one guy doesn't do it, the
next guy will. We keep pushing each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The cushion generated by the big first inning wasn't comfortable
for long, as the Pirates rallied for four runs in the third off
left-hander Omar Daal. But Daal didn't give up a run during the
remainder of his seven-inning outing and got credit for the victory
(13-6) before turning the eighth and ninth innings over to
right-handers Gregg Olson and Matt Mantei. Mantei picked up his
11th save for Arizona and 21st overall by striking out the side.
</P>
<P>
   Daal walked Schmidt, the leadoff man in the third, then gave up
three hits, including a bloop double to center field by Kevin
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Daal kicked some of the dirt from the mound area
onto the artificial turf, creating a small brown cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make good pitches, and they still get base hits,'' he
said. ``Walking the pitcher is not good. It seems that every time
that happens, they come around to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of innings, I was a little tight. I didn't
have much control of my slider. But I knew I had to keep the score
the way it was. I said, `My offense has given me some runs, and I
can't lose this game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who had given up no runs in his previous six relief
appearances, surrendered a home run to Young, his third of the
series, on the first pitch in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei, who had not pitched since Wednesday night, came in to
strike out pinch-hitters Al Martin and Brant Brown, walk Adrian
Brown and strike out veteran Dale Sveum to end the game. &QL;

<P>
   If television ads for a beer in barrel-size cans provide a
glimpse at the Down Under perspective, Australia likes its offbeat
characters. The bigger, the better.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gary Hall Jr. qualifies. He's not exactly Crocodile Dundee Jr.,
but he is the kind of personality that captures attention in a
country with a wry, rollicking sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Hall, an Olympic gold and silver medalist from
Phoenix Swim Club, appears to be a welcome relief from Denver
Broncos receiver
 &UR; Shannon Sharpe, who redefined the Ugly American concept a couple of
weeks ago with insults that reverberated from Sydney to Perth
before an NFL preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe would make a pretty good target for the boomerang that
serves as a remote control on those beer ads.
</P>
<P>
   With Hall, the news reports about his arrival for this week's
Pan Pacific Championships make it sound as if the Aussies would
like to join him in a good laugh, mate.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of samples:
</P>
<P>
   According to the Australian Sports News Service: ``Hall, with
his cowlicked bed-head, cargo pants and love of influential '60s
rock band The Grateful Dead, doesn't seem like the sort of guy
who'd get worked up about things.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the`` Sydney Morning Heral''d: ``This is a bloke
who once suggested that swimmers cover themselves in body paint
similar to wrestlers and race in events on which spectators could
bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The bet in some corners this week is that Hall will break the
world record in the 50-meter freestyle, which he won at the U.S.
nationals in a dramatic comeback since his suspension for a
positive marijuana test and diabetes diagnosis. Hall swam his best
time five days after a bout with the flu and while wearing a baggy
suit that, next to all the microsize Speedos, looked like a pair of
cut-offs.
</P>
<P>
   The only unfortunate aspect about this week's 50 is the absence
of South African sprinter  &UR; Roland  &UR; Schoeman, a University of
Arizona sophomore who recorded the year's fastest time in a
different heat at the same meet that Hall went his best. South
African officials banned him from Australia because he didn't
compete in their national championships after a dispute about
money. &QL; 
Arizona gold &QL; 
Arizona struck gold for the second time in the Pan Pacs early
Sunday, the opening day of competition at the Olympic pool in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after 17-year-old  &UR; Klete Keller of Phoenix
Swim Club and Arcadia High won the 5-kilometer swim in Melbourne,
former University of Arizona sprinter  &UR; Liesl Kolbisen of Tucson
swam a leg for the U.S. women's 400-meter freestyle relay, which
beat Australia for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Another former UA swimmer,  &UR; Chad Carvin, finished fourth in the
men's 400 freestyle, nearly eight seconds behind the world
record-shattering performance by Aussie  &UR; Ian Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona swimmer to watch today:  &UR; Misty Hyman, of the Valley's
Desert Fox Club and Stanford University. She advanced through the
semifinals and qualified fourth for today's final in the 100-meter
butterfly. &QL; 
Briefly . .  &QL; 
Movie star  &UR; Geena Davis is out, but three archers with Arizona
links were still in the hunt this weekend in the U.S. Olympic
trials at Bloomfield, N.J. Former Arizona State archers and Olympic
gold medalists  &UR; Justin Huisch (1996) and  &UR; Jay Barrs (1988) were
among the men's final 16 late Saturday. For the women, the final 16
included &UR; Michelle Ragsdale of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yewki  &UR; Tomita of Tucson will compete this week at national
championships in Sacramento for one of five spots on the U.S. men's
gymnastics team at the World Championships, which are scheduled for
China this year. Tomita, America's best on the pommel horse, is
considered a medal possibility at the 2000 Olympics. &QL;

MEETING SET WITH AGENT FOR MOORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Negotiations between the Cardinals and unsigned
wide receiver Rob Moore are expected to heat up today when contract
negotiator Rod Graves goes to Los Angeles to meet with Moore's
agent, Gary Wichard.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have had several informal discussions with Moore's
representative, but they have spent most of training camp
concentrating on getting their rookies signed.
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft pick L.J. Shelton, the offensive tackle from
Eastern Michigan picked 21st overall, and third-year defensive
tackle Mark Smith also are unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Cardinals and Moore's representatives have not
done a lot of negotiating, there has been friendly dialogue between
the two sides. In fact, Moore picked up his playbook last month, a
few days before the team reported for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said he has had several
discussions with Moore, the team's designated franchise player,
during camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to him periodically,'' Trestman said. ``Rob knows
this is an important contract for him, but he wants to be here.
He's
</P>
<P>
   excited about trying to get in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who will be 31 next month, was unable to reach agreement
with the Cardinals on a contract in February, prompting the team to
place the franchise tag on him.
</P>
<P>
   As the franchise player, the Cardinals can match any offer for
Moore and have to pay him at least $3.5 million for this season.
The team wants to sign him to a multiyear deal, which means it
would get the franchise tag back to use on another player next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Moore reportedly would like a four-year package worth about $22
million. The Cardinals seem more interested in a three-year
contract worth about $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Moore's representatives said the team offered $4.5
million a year but only a $2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a 10-year pro, was the team's second-leading receiver a
year ago with 67 catches for 982 yards and six scores. He was the
club's top receiver in the playoffs with 11 receptions for 132
yards. &QL;

<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ With winds reaching 125 mph and a tidal
surge expected to reach 12 feet, Hurricane Bret rumbled ashore
early Sunday evening along the south Texas coast, hours after tens
of thousands of anxious residents evacuated inland along clogged
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the storm moved steadily, if somewhat
unpredictably, first steering directly at this heavily populated
coastal refinery city and then turning westward and hitting land in
rural and sparsely populated Kenedy County. The western edge of the
eye of the storm slowly touched land before 7 p.m. local time and
began pounding the county with heavy bands of rain and high winds.
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of rain fell in many areas along the coast, and
the authorities feared that the slow-mov- ing storm could cause
widespread flooding on Monday. By 10 p.m. the fastest winds had
dropped to 115 mph as the storm, which had moved only a few miles
inland, slow- ly diminished.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reported injuries, but officials, who remained in
shel- ters, said it was too early to assess real damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very thankful,'' said Mark Lenz, a meteorologist. ``The
eye crossed the coastline in one county along the Texas coast that
was the least populated.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, gale-force winds had begun buffeting the
long string of barrier islands that form the fragile outer wall for
much of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're being whipped,'' said Lt. Robert
Rodriguez, as he and several other police officers rode out the
storm in the evacuated resort town of South Padre Island north of
Brownsville, Texas. ``We're getting all the wind swirls, the
bands.''
</P>
<P>
   There were sev- eral unconfirmed reports of torna- does Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the landfall, Gov. George W. Bush asked federal
officials to declare seven coastal counties major disaster areas in
order to qualify for emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   The storm began to weaken as it reached land and was downgraded
to a Category 3 by 7 p.m. Early fears of the potential for
tremendous property damage and loss of life diminished as the
hurricane veered away from Corpus Christi and moved across the flat
countryside of Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
   But James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, cautioned in a briefing at 6 p.m that the hurricane still
presented a very serious threat to south Texas. He warned of the
possibility of severe flooding from heavy rainfall that was
expected to continue throughout Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about the Rio Grande area and the
potential of flooding in that area,'' Witt said. ``It is a very
dangerous storm.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m. the fastest winds had dropped to 115 mph as the land
continued to diminish the strength of the storm. There were no
reported injuries, but officials, who remained in shelters, said it
was too early to assess real damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bret is the first hurricane of the 1999 season and the first
major hurricane to threaten south Texas since Hurricane Allen
caused $55 million in damage in 1980. Last year, the area suffered
heavy flooding from two storms that drifted eastward from the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With many coastal areas susceptible to flooding, federal, state
and local officials began imploring residents to evacuate toward
San Antonio on Saturday afternoon. City officials in Corpus Christi
declared a state of disaster and declared a general but voluntary
evacuation until late in the afternoon, when remaining residents
were advised to find refuge in the city.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials evacuated 3,200 inmates to jails and
prisons further inland, while thousands of tourists vacationing in
the resort hotels of South Padre Island also fled the storm. The
U.S. Coast Guard closed the Corpus Christi ship channel, one of the
busiest ports in the nation, and answered several search and rescue
calls from boats struggling through the rough, surging waters of
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Schweikhard Moss, a spokeswoman for the Texas Division of
Emergency Management, expressed concern that residents might fail
to heed evacuation warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have a generation of Texans, either native to the
area or who have moved into the area, who have never experienced a
storm threat of this kind,'' Ms. Moss said. She added, ``Texas, to
this point, has been very, very fortunate, and obviously, it looks
like that luck has run out.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the mouth of the Rio Grande as far as 287 miles up the
Texas coastline to Galveston, residents heeded warnings and left in
droves. Motorists lumbered beneath black morning skies along
Interstate 37 out of Corpus Christi, pouring north and west toward
San Antonio and Austin. Electronic road signs along I-37 directed
the traffic to shelters in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Others fled along country roads through Nueces County, where
flat yellow and green fields seemed eerily still as clouds
approached from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get ugly,'' said Valerie Saenz, 25, as she
stopped at a convenience store in Corpus Christi for food en route
to San Antonio. ``I just packed up all my clothes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Tony Sterling, 34, a Corpus Christi resident, left early Sunday
morning for San Antonio with his family. His wife, Susan, is
expecting their second child in nine days. ``She's nervous,''
Sterling said. He also said some of his neighbors had scoffed at
the evacuation order. ``I think they're crazy, plumb crazy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of severe flooding prompted Corpus Christi officials
to evacuate 15,000 from Padre Island, near Corpus Christi, and the
local police closed the causeway connecting that barrier island to
the mainland. ``We expect heavy flooding in that area, and we don't
want those people trapped by rising water,'' said Chief Pete
Alvarez of the Corpus Christi police .
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baughman, director of operations for FEMA, said Sunday
that rescue and response teams were clustered at a staging area at
Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, awaiting the end of the storm.
Baughman said officials were gathering generators, bottled water,
ice, blankets and cots to distribute to storm victims. Witt said
that the American Red Cross had opened 14 shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had initially tracked toward the northern coast of
Mexico, then shifted northward toward Brownsville before finally
taking aim at Corpus Christi. But late in the day, Bret shifted
course to the west, steering at rural Kenedy and Kleberg Counties,
raising hopes for less property damage and a diminished threat to
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't want anybody to get hit,'' said Juan
Ortiz, deputy emergency management director in Corpus Christi.
``But for us, it's a positive thing. It has been a very
unpredictable storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Rafael Cuellar Jr. of Kenedy County said his county had
not issued an evacuation order and that the county's 1,000
residents were seeking refuge in three emergency shelters. He said
that the large number of oak trees in the county had slowed past
hurricanes. His wife, Anita, had refused to leave. ``She doesn't
want to leave the little dogs,'' Sheriff Cuellar, 60, said of their
two pets. By 10 p.m., however, they were in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In Kleberg County, home of the King Ranch, perhaps the most
famous ranch in Texas, Marcos Perez, the chief sheriff's deputy,
said officers were canvassing the county, making checks on people
who had chosen to stay. Officers planned to check back after the
storm to make certain that those who remained were safe. In
Kingsville, the county seat, city officials ordered the 25,000
residents to evacuate or seek emergency shelter. At the King Ranch
itself, the ranch hands huddled in a central location and prepared
for storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just boarding everything up,'' said Wade Roberts, of the
King Ranch security staff.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Cameron County and Brownsville, County Judge
Gilberto Hinojosa said ``at least a couple of thousand people'' had
flocked to local shelters in a county of 360,000 people. On
Saturday, when weather officials had predicted that Brownsville
would take a direct hit, Hinojosa said county workers drove buses
to low-lying areas to evacuate residents, most of whom refused to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the impression there is a lot of complacency,'' he said.
``People didn't think it was going to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moss, the state emergency management official, noted that
this weekend marked the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Andrew.
The most violent recent storm to his Corpus Christi was Celia,
which lashed the coast on Aug. 3, 1970, killing 11 people, causing
tens of millions of dollars in damages and flooding much of the
city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Witt noted that two other storms are also forming that could
potentially threaten the East Coast of the United States. ``This
season has just really truly started.''

   ``SELECTED NON-FICTIONS'' &QL; 
By Jorge Luis Borges (Viking, $40) &QL; 
``The angels are two days and two nights older than we: The Lord
created them on the fourth day, and from their high balcony between
the recently invented sun and the first moon, they scanned the
infant earth, barely more than a few wheat fields and some orchards
beside the waters.'' With his essay ``A History of'' ``Angels,''
written in 1926, Borges rescues us from the tripe written on the
subject in recent years and leaves us to wonder whether Wim Wenders
read this before he made his haunting film about angels, ``Wings f
Desire.'' ``I always imagine them at nightfall,'' Borges writes,
``in the dusk of a slum or a vacant lot, in that long, quiet moment
when things are gradually left alone, with their backs to the
sunset, and when colors are like memories or premonitions of other
colors. We must not be too prodigal with our angels; they are the
last divinities we harbor, and they might fly away.'' This is the
third volume in Viking's centenary edition of Borges' work in
English, coming after ``Collected Fictions'' and ``Selected
Poems.'' Borges wrote thousands of pages of non-fiction _ essays,
book and film reviews, lectures, encyclopedia entries, historical
surveys and notes on politics and culture, and from them, editor
Eliot Weinberger chose 161 pieces. Most appear in English for the
first time. The rest were newly translated for this edition. Among
the films reviewed (albeit briefly _ as Weinberger notes, Borges
never wrote anything long) are ``King Kong'' and ``The Petrified
Forest.'' Among the books: William Faulkner's ``Absalom! Absalom!''
and Ellery Queen's ``The Door Between.'' It's a marvelous
collection, published to celebrate what would have been Borges'
100th birthday in late August. &QL;

HEARTWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By James Lee Burke &QL; 
(Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this novel is a bit busy _ to say that it's complex is to
give it too much credit _ but Burke is so much better than other
crime writers that he pulls it off anyway. From the first pages,
we're aware of his virtuosity, although that seems like an odd word
to apply to a man whose characters are world-weary moralists and
vicious schemers and whose setting in this new series (in wake of
his books about Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux) is a Texas hill town
called Deaf Smith. The hero is Billy Bob Holland, the former police
officer/Texas Ranger-turned-defense attorney, last seen in
``Cimarron Rose.'' In the early pages, Billy Bob suffers the return
to town of a rich man named Earl Deitrich, who long ago wooed and
married Peggy Jean Murphy, the local beauty who was Billy Bob's
high-school lover. Billy Bob is still hung up on Peggy Jean, and
she is still hung up on a boy who died in Vietnam _ both obsessions
that are difficult to believe as the book progresses. Their
attraction is further complicated because the cowboy Billy Bob
takes on as a client is accused of stealing $300,000 in bonds from
Peggy Jean's husband. More plot description would merely make you
dizzy _ suffice it to say that Burke makes all of his characters,
even the odd ones, as real as a Texas moon, and his setting becomes
a character in itself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING ON THE WIND: &QL; 
ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE &QL; 
WITH MIGRATORY BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Weidensaul &QL; 
(North Point, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thre are some shorebirds that fly non-stop from the southern tip
of South America to the coast of New Jersey _ a trip that takes 10
days, an astonishing 240 hours of uninterrupted flight. And there
are Arctic terns that each autumn fly across the Atlantic to
Europe, then south along Africa to recross the Atlantic toward
South America, finally wintering off of Antarctica. In spring,
writes the author, ``they reverse course, moving up southern Africa
and lancing back to Canada _ a figure eight inscribed on half the
globe, a track that returns them, often as not, to precisely the
same sheltered nook where they nested the summer before.'' Is there
anything more miraculous, more ethereal, more mysterious than the
epic migrations of birds? Weidensaul explores the process with
eloquence, meticulous research and considerable reverence _ and it
does not hurt that his subject is rife with fantastic facts. Did
you know that there are hummingbirds that cross the Gulf of Mexico
twice each year and tiny warblers that fly non-stop from New
England to South America? Did you know that albatrosses leaving the
nest might pass the next four years without touching land?
Weidensaul spent more than six years researching his book,
traveling 70,000 miles by plane, car, boat, horse and foot _ and
yet, he says, he covered fewer miles than a sandpiper would in its
short lifetime, propelled only by muscle and the instinct to trace
those invisible pathways in the sky. &QL;

   A companion volume to the History Channel's documentary
``Military Blunders,'' this is a survey of mistakes that had
terrible consequences. If the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's chauffeur
had asked directions in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, he would not
have taken the wrong turn that led to the archduke's assassination.
If the captain of the Lusitania had steered in a zig-zag pattern as
advised, he might have avoided the torpedo that sank the ship and
drew America into World War I. If naval commanders had not
underestimated the threat of air power, the British would not have
suffered the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse, two of their
finest ships. If German fliers attempting to destroy oil tanks on
the English coast had not lost their way and bombed the outskirts
of London instead, orders (on both sides) to avoid populated areas
might have stood, saving civilian lives during World War II. You
like war stories? Coffey has war stories, and they prove just how
slender the thread of fate can be. &QL;

   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ With winds reaching 125 mph and a tidal
surge expected to reach 12 feet, Hurricane Bret rumbled ashore
early Sunday evening along the south Texas coast, hours after tens
of thousands of anxious residents evacuated inland along clogged
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the storm moved steadily, if somewhat
unpredictably, first steering directly at this heavily populated
coastal refinery city and then turning westward and hitting land in
rural and sparsely populated Kenedy County. The western edge of the
eye of the storm slowly touched land before 7 p.m. local time and
began pounding the county with heavy bands of rain and high winds.
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of rain fell in many areas along the coast, and
the authorities feared that the slow-mov- ing storm could cause
widespread flooding on Monday. By midnight the fastest winds had
dropped to 105 mph as the storm, which had moved 25 miles inland,
slow- ly diminished.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reported injuries, but officials, who remained in
shel- ters, said it was too early to assess real damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very thankful,'' said Mark Lenz, a meteorologist. ``The
eye crossed the coastline in one county along the Texas coast that
was the least populated.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, gale-force winds had begun buffeting the
long string of barrier islands that form the fragile outer wall for
much of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're being whipped,'' said Lt. Robert
Rodriguez, as he and several other police officers rode out the
storm in the evacuated resort town of South Padre Island north of
Brownsville, Texas. ``We're getting all the wind swirls, the
bands.''
</P>
<P>
   There were sev- eral unconfirmed reports of torna- does Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the landfall, Gov. George W. Bush asked federal
officials to declare seven coastal counties major disaster areas in
order to qualify for emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   The storm began to weaken as it reached land and was downgraded
to a Category 2 by midnight. Early fears of the potential for
tremendous property damage and loss of life diminished as the
hurricane veered away from Corpus Christi and moved across the flat
countryside of Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
   But James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, cautioned in a briefing at 6 p.m that the hurricane still
presented a very serious threat to south Texas. He warned of the
possibility of severe flooding from heavy rainfall that was
expected to continue throughout Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about the Rio Grande area and the
potential of flooding in that area,'' Witt said. ``It is a very
dangerous storm.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m. the fastest winds had dropped to 115 mph as the land
continued to diminish the strength of the storm. There were no
reported injuries, but officials, who remained in shelters, said it
was too early to assess real damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bret is the first hurricane of the 1999 season and the first
major hurricane to threaten south Texas since Hurricane Allen
caused $55 million in damage in 1980. Last year, the area suffered
heavy flooding from two storms that drifted eastward from the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With many coastal areas susceptible to flooding, federal, state
and local officials began imploring residents to evacuate toward
San Antonio on Saturday afternoon. City officials in Corpus Christi
declared a state of disaster and declared a general but voluntary
evacuation until late in the afternoon, when remaining residents
were advised to find refuge in the city.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials evacuated 3,200 inmates to jails and
prisons further inland, while thousands of tourists vacationing in
the resort hotels of South Padre Island also fled the storm. The
U.S. Coast Guard closed the Corpus Christi ship channel, one of the
busiest ports in the nation, and answered several search and rescue
calls from boats struggling through the rough, surging waters of
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Schweikhard Moss, a spokeswoman for the Texas Division of
Emergency Management, expressed concern that residents might fail
to heed evacuation warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have a generation of Texans, either native to the
area or who have moved into the area, who have never experienced a
storm threat of this kind,'' Ms. Moss said. She added, ``Texas, to
this point, has been very, very fortunate, and obviously, it looks
like that luck has run out.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the mouth of the Rio Grande as far as 287 miles up the
Texas coastline to Galveston, residents heeded warnings and left in
droves. Motorists lumbered beneath black morning skies along
Interstate 37 out of Corpus Christi, pouring north and west toward
San Antonio and Austin. Electronic road signs along I-37 directed
the traffic to shelters in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Others fled along country roads through Nueces County, where
flat yellow and green fields seemed eerily still as clouds
approached from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get ugly,'' said Valerie Saenz, 25, as she
stopped at a convenience store in Corpus Christi for food en route
to San Antonio. ``I just packed up all my clothes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Tony Sterling, 34, a Corpus Christi resident, left early Sunday
morning for San Antonio with his family. His wife, Susan, is
expecting their second child in nine days. ``She's nervous,''
Sterling said. He also said some of his neighbors had scoffed at
the evacuation order. ``I think they're crazy, plumb crazy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of severe flooding prompted Corpus Christi officials
to evacuate 15,000 from Padre Island, near Corpus Christi, and the
local police closed the causeway connecting that barrier island to
the mainland. ``We expect heavy flooding in that area, and we don't
want those people trapped by rising water,'' said Chief Pete
Alvarez of the Corpus Christi police .
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baughman, director of operations for FEMA, said Sunday
that rescue and response teams were clustered at a staging area at
Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, awaiting the end of the storm.
Baughman said officials were gathering generators, bottled water,
ice, blankets and cots to distribute to storm victims. Witt said
that the American Red Cross had opened 14 shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had initially tracked toward the northern coast of
Mexico, then shifted northward toward Brownsville before finally
taking aim at Corpus Christi. But late in the day, Bret shifted
course to the west, steering at rural Kenedy and Kleberg Counties,
raising hopes for less property damage and a diminished threat to
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't want anybody to get hit,'' said Juan
Ortiz, deputy emergency management director in Corpus Christi.
``But for us, it's a positive thing. It has been a very
unpredictable storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Rafael Cuellar Jr. of Kenedy County said his county had
not issued an evacuation order and that the county's 1,000
residents were seeking refuge in three emergency shelters. He said
that the large number of oak trees in the county had slowed past
hurricanes. His wife, Anita, had refused to leave. ``She doesn't
want to leave the little dogs,'' Sheriff Cuellar, 60, said of their
two pets. By 10 p.m., however, they were in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In Kleberg County, home of the King Ranch, perhaps the most
famous ranch in Texas, Marcos Perez, the chief sheriff's deputy,
said officers were canvassing the county, making checks on people
who had chosen to stay. Officers planned to check back after the
storm to make certain that those who remained were safe. In
Kingsville, the county seat, city officials ordered the 25,000
residents to evacuate or seek emergency shelter. At the King Ranch
itself, the ranch hands huddled in a central location and prepared
for storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just boarding everything up,'' said Wade Roberts, of the
King Ranch security staff.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Cameron County and Brownsville, County Judge
Gilberto Hinojosa said ``at least a couple of thousand people'' had
flocked to local shelters in a county of 360,000 people. On
Saturday, when weather officials had predicted that Brownsville
would take a direct hit, Hinojosa said county workers drove buses
to low-lying areas to evacuate residents, most of whom refused to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the impression there is a lot of complacency,'' he said.
``People didn't think it was going to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moss, the state emergency management official, noted that
this weekend marked the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Andrew.
The most violent recent storm to his Corpus Christi was Celia,
which lashed the coast on Aug. 3, 1970, killing 11 people, causing
tens of millions of dollars in damages and flooding much of the
city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Witt noted that two other storms are also forming that could
potentially threaten the East Coast of the United States. ``This
season has just really truly started.''

MESA BLOWS SAVE, THEN PINELLA BLOWS STACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was one of those old-time Mariners meltdowns, the
kind that haunt the memories of Northwest fans. Ken Griffey Jr.
saves the day ... until the closer blows the save ... and the
manager gets ejected ... and another reliever walks in a run ... in
a nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   After Griffey's two-run homer gave the Mariners the lead in the
eighth inning Sunday, Jose Mesa allowed the tying run in the ninth
and the go-ahead runs on a Richie Sexson homer in the 10th. The 7-4
loss to the Cleveland Indians was the Mariners' third in a row in
this series and, to one player, the most bitter of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was the low point of the year for us, for a lot of
reasons,'' shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. ``We needed to stop the
bleeding and we didn't. We haven't executed all parts of our game,
and we've been very inconsistent. We're brilliant at times, and
we're (awful) at times. That's what you get _ inconsistent play,
and you're a few games under .500.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who were swept by one of the American League's
other elite teams, the New York Yankees, in a four-game series at
Safeco Field earlier this month, face the same outcome if they drop
tonight's finale with the Indians. Seattle is 11-22 against the
four teams leading the American League's playoff races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sucked,'' Rodriguez said. ``We've been terrible,
starting with me. It's been frustrating. It starts with me, it
starts with all my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suck. We can't beat teams like that the way we played
today. Jamie (Moyer) pitched an outstanding ballgame, and the
offense is dragging. We're just not getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who have beaten the Mariners in seven of nine
meetings this year, have three regulars injured and rested two
others Sunday night. When they needed a boost in the ninth, they
used stars Roberto Alomar and David Justice as pinch-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to beat good teams, everything almost has to go perfect
for us,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``We don't have the depth
these teams have.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 4-3 lead, Mesa walked Alomar and allowed a single to
Carlos Baerga, putting runners at the corners with no outs. A
sacrifice fly by Justice scored Alomar, giving Mesa his first blown
save since the Safeco Field opener and fourth on the year.
</P>
<P>
   It took 17 pitches for Mesa to make a Cleveland batter swing and
miss, and when Dave Roberts finally did _ flailing at a high,
outside fastball on a hit-and-run _ chaos followed.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson's throw easily beat Baerga to second base, and
Rodriguez raised his glove after seemingly applying the tag.
Replays showed Baerga, flopping like a fish around second, slid
wide of Rodriguez to avoid the tag, then slapped his hand on the
base as Rodriguez pleaded to umpire Bill Welke.
</P>
<P>
   Welke ruled Baerga safe, Rodriguez turned livid, and Piniella
stormed from the dugout, stumbling his first few steps out as
Indians manager Mike Hargrove laughed. If Piniella was bruised, it
didn't impede one of his most memorable tirades.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly earned his fourth ejection of the year _ all in the
last month _ and proceeded to kick the ground near Welke, appearing
to inadvertently kick the umpire in the shin. After pointing to the
spot Baerga slid, Piniella dropped to the ground, imitating Baerga
to prove his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule says you've got to be able to touch the bag with your
hand,'' Piniella said. ``He was a good six feet from the bag. ...
(Welke) said he could have (touched second), and he could have _ if
he was Wilt Chamberlain.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd hooted and ESPN split its screen to show the replay
and Piniella's live tantrum, two fans rushed the field, needing
seven guards to bring them down.
</P>
<P>
   A fine night had turned ugly for a sold-out crowd of 44,941, and
the decisive 10th inning hadn't even begun.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners went quietly off rookie winner David Riske, a Kent
native, in the ninth, then lost in the 10th when Sexson drove a
pitch into the right-field seats. The home run punctuated an inning
that featured four walks, two by Mesa and two (one intentional) by
Steve Sinclair. The last walk, to Justice, gave Cleveland its final
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were trailing 3-2 when Griffey connected off
reliever Paul Assenmacher with one out in the eighth. The blast
gave Griffey sole possession of the American League home run lead
with 38.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not a game in which Griffey, or any of the Mariners
hitters, played the hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you come back, it doesn't matter if it's in the first
inning or the ninth inning, it's still the same,'' Griffey said.
``It's a little more dramatic if it's the ninth inning, but you
still have the same feeling.''

THE EMPERORS' NEW WOES _ MILLIONAIRE'S DREAM SITS LOST IN TEXAS  &HT;     BY MICHAEL TAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATY, Texas _ Out on rural Franz Road, past the CCN Concrete
Materials yard and the Williamsburg Parish housing tract and the
Texaco Food-Mart, Ira P.H. Poon's dream is difficult to spot.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was the original intention. But it's impossible to
know, since Poon, who spent $20 million on what must be one of the
world's least-known theme parks, isn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   As you get closer, there's a handful of flagpoles with streamers
and, a few inches off the ground, a tiny sign that whispers
Forbidden Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Down the driveway, the parking lot could handle 300 cars. At 10
a.m., when Forbidden Gardens opens for guided tours _ $10 a ticket
for adults, $5 for children _ only two autos sit ticking under the
101-degree south Texas swelter. By noon, there is one car.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the summer heat that keeps people away, or the huge
steel roof that looks like the world's largest carport. But
underneath the roof is a 40,000-square-foot, extravagantly precise,
1/20th-scale rendition of the Forbidden City in Beijing, home of Pu
Yi, the last Chinese emperor. Go rent the 1987 Oscar-winning film
``The Last Emperor,'' and imagine the scenery in miniature to get a
feel for the place.
</P>
<P>
   Set on some 80 acres in the bedroom community of Katy, 30 miles
west of Houston, Forbidden Gardens is an outdoor museum whose other
main exhibit, also small-scale, focuses on China's first emperor,
Qin Shi Huang. Poon had all the thousands of miniature buildings,
statues and figurines made in China and installed by Chinese
artisans who were flown in from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   No billboards announce this place along nearby Interstate 10;
there is no hype on radio and television, no travel agent tie-ins.
Disney World it is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 21/2 years, and I went part-time this
January,'' says Connie Williams, the Gardens' director of
marketing, a bit forlornly. ``There's not that much to do. My
agenda is to go full blast, but they're not ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden Gardens, where the tour guides and the marketing
director and just about everybody else use the term ``low-key'' to
describe their outpost, is the brainchild and lifelong dream of
Poon, an educator and real-estate developer who divides his time
between Hong Kong and Seattle. At least, that is how his staff
describes him. Poon doesn't talk to the press.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to Maria College, a school he apparently owns in
Hong Kong, is met with a referral to another phone number for Poon.
Calls to Poon are not returned. His Forbidden Gardens employees see
him only once or twice a year, when he flies in to take stock of
his pet project and does not talk about himself or his affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the one-acre carport, walking around the Forbidden City
exhibit feels a little like walking around the world's most
expensive and elaborate dollhouse _ doll mansion, maybe. Visitors
can stroll on walkways bordering the various buildings and more
than 900 rooms in the Forbidden City compound, under the watchful
eyes of the hundreds of figurines, each about eight inches high.
</P>
<P>
   When the real Forbidden City was being used as the emperor's
residence, some 5,000 eunuchs, concubines and guards were in
attendance each day. At night, only the 3,000 guards were allowed
to go home, outside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wall of the real Forbidden City was 35 feet high,'' says
tour guide Jerry Yeh, ``and it went another 20 feet underground. No
way for the eunuchs and concubines to dig out of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Poon's compound also contains a replica of the tomb of Qin Shi
Huang, complete with a football-field-size pit containing about
6,000 half-scale, but eerily lifelike terra-cotta soldiers who
guard the first emperor's resting place.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the pit, huge by comparison, is a
more-than-life-size statue of the emperor himself.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the concrete walls are pieces of terra-cotta, meant to
replicate the bones of actual tomb workers who were killed to keep
them from blabbing about their secret construction project. The
emperor, like his 20th century patron, Mr. Poon, was not a
publicity hound.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a version of the emperor's actual final resting
place near the city of Xian in China. The tomb was built
approximately 2,200 years ago by 700,000 workers who toiled for 36
years. The emperor died at 49, after an 11-year reign. He was on a
tour of his conquered provinces when he took ill from a concoction
of mercury that was supposed to prolong his life but had the
opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was discovered in 1974, the tomb has become a
world-famous tourist site that draws 2 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the attendance in Katy on a summer morning recently
consisted of one reporter and a group of 16 kids from a local
school. The children seemed pretty impressed, particularly with the
room full of old spears and swords.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Loving, 10, looked around, a bit in awe, and wondered,
``If the statues could talk, what would they say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd talk about the emperor and how he acted,'' said
9-year-old Colton Roulston.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Poon, the educator, should have been there. His
second-in-command, D.C. Chan, says via e-mail that Poon ``began his
career as an English teacher in Hong Kong'' and prides himself on
having built a museum to share with ``people who do not have the
chance to see those real wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan says Poon decided to build Forbidden Gardens in south Texas
because ``the weather in Houston is better than Seattle.'' Better
is a relative term, of course, and while Houston doesn't get the
cold rain of Seattle, it gets broiling hot and fiercely humid,
something that brought some unexpected problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past year, we've noticed that the weather has taken a
toll on the buildings,'' says Lisa Gipson, the accounts manager, as
a woman with feather dusters batted at some courtyard railings. ``I
don't think they knew the weather in Texas was harsh. So it's an
ongoing process of maintenance. As soon as you think you're done,
you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The maintenance crew, in fact, may be the people most aware of
Forbidden Gardens. Over at Katy's City Hall, Missy Bunch, the
assistant city secretary, says, ``We know they're out there, but we
haven't heard a lot of people in town talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Texaco Food-Mart, the owner, Ann, said, ``I think $10 is
too high to get in there. ... You pay $10, but you don't know what
it is. If it's Disneyland, you know what's in there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Williamsburg Parish housing development, across the
fields from Poon's project, most residents said they had never been
to Forbidden Gardens and weren't very interested.
</P>
<P>
   And over in Houston, with its Chinese American community of more
than 100,000 people, only a few had even heard of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there,'' said travel agent Thomas Luan. ``It's
interesting, but most people don't know it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and added, ``They need a travel agent to promote it.''

STATE REPUBLICANS IN TURMOIL AS DONATIONS, SUPPORT DRY UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 and ROBERT B. GUNNISON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California Republican Party is in such political and
financial disarray that some leading Republicans say the GOP's
chances for success are threatened in critical elections next year,
from president down to the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The party that propelled Ronald Reagan to two terms as governor
and then to the White House is broke. It also is plagued by staff
defections, ideological struggles and worried party professionals
who fear for their political future.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil comes as the party _ headed by Silicon Valley
software executive John McGraw _ prepares for its statewide
convention Sept. 24-26 in Anaheim, an event expected to draw as
many as 1,200 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   While major presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Dole and Steve
Forbes will address the key GOP gathering in the nation's most
populous state, front-runner George W. Bush has declined, citing
scheduling conflicts, McGraw said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush will not be the only absentee: The California Congress
of Republicans, a moderate GOP group, has announced that it will
hold an ``alternate'' convention in an Anaheim hotel across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that he (McGraw) has tightened the hold on the
party, to where it's a dictatorship,'' said Bob Larkin, a member of
the GOP executive committee and a McGraw critic.
</P>
<P>
   Many major contributors, insiders said, have closed their
checkbooks because they have been antagonized or offended by
McGraw's policies or by the chairman himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of fruit cakes'' is the way one longtime GOP hand
described the current party administration.
</P>
<P>
   With seven months before the crucial March 7 presidential
primary, such warfare in a state that serves as a lucrative source
of money for political candidates nationwide portends troubles that
could damage GOP candidates, from the presidential to the
legislative levels.
</P>
<P>
   At stake next year in the state are 80 Assembly districts, 20
state Senate districts and 52 congressional seats. In addition,
Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein is seeking re-election in
what is certain to be a high-profile race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend virtually all day, every day, worrying about how I'm
going to elect Republicans,'' said McGraw, in an interview last
week. ``The plan I've laid out for the party, and articulated to
the donors, is a very simple, back-to-basics policy. The first
first and foremost goal is registering voters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larkin, a member of California Congress of Republicans, said
moderates, women and minorities have been virtually shut out of
party leadership by McGraw, who has stated that abortion, even more
than taxes, should be the ``number one issue'' for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives, like 1998 U.S. Senate candidate Darrell
Issa, are siding with the moderates _ and withholding donations _
because of McGraw's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were opportunities for the party to prove that, in the
absence of leadership by a governor or a senator, they could be
inclusive ... they have failed to do that,'' said Issa, a
millionaire businessman who has been a generous party contributor
and a member of the state GOP's executive board. He said big donors
are begging off, citing what he calls ``concerns with our money
being spent wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP's political director, Debbie Rohrbach, resigned
recently, telling Associated Press that ``problems in the
organization need to be addressed.'' Mary Khayat, the GOP finance
director, quit in June and two other finance department employees
have also resigned in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw got off to a rocky start earlier this year by supporting
efforts to end California's winner-take-all presidential primary.
The effort ultimately failed, but the episode strained relations
with backers of Bush, who anticipated that the winner-take-all
format would help the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, insiders said, plans fell through for Bush to appear
at major fund-raising events to help the California party,
worsening the financial picture.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush's more moderate stance on issues has rankled
conservatives who overwhelmingly dominate the California GOP party
structure _ and hold especially fast to a strong anti-abortion
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McGraw) took on the Bush campaign,`' said Larkin. ``That's
why the money has stopped coming in. When you (alienate) the guy
who can save the party, the best you can get is an angry president
who doesn't need the California Republican Party. The worst you can
get is a Democratic president.''
</P>
<P>
   Records at the Secretary of State's office show the state GOP
with cash on hand of $131,000 and outstanding debts of $310,000.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Democratic party records show $1.8 million cash on
hand, and debts of only $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw argues that the state GOP is not in such bad shape, and
that he assumed leadership as the state GOP was coming off the
worst loss in California history after the last election _ when
Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren lost to Democrat
Gray Davis in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to raise money, and I'm out there doing it every
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw said he has heard the charges of an exclusionary GOP _
but he insists that he has never closed his door to any Republican.
``I have never excluded anyone from this party. Everyone's
welcome,'' he said. ``At our upcoming convention, we are not taking
up the platform ... we're doing a back-to-basics convention,
focusing on training our folks to register, to make sure we get out
the vote. ... And we've registered 40,000 new voters so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP leaders insist that McGraw has done a formidable job in
a trying year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any concern at all,'' said Gerry Snyder,
a member of the state executive board, and one of the
highest-ranking women in the California GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Republican leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach has a
special stake in the party's future as he tries to increase the
number of GOP lawmakers in the elections next year. Democrats
control both the Senate and Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every organization has some growing pains and the state party
is working through these issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheila Carroll, a longtime Republican Party worker in the
Central Valley, said she's fed up. She told party leaders ``to take
my name off the (fund-raising) list until they have more moderate
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats are all but salivating at such troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason (California Republicans) should be in
debt,'' said Democratic party chairman Art Torres. ``It's the
largest state in the union, and in the same breath, George Bush has
raised $37 million ... they've always been the richest party, and
they've had the ability to raise money. Something's wrong with
their organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas Bavarro, a Central Valley GOP leader who challenged
McGraw for the party leadership earlier this year, said critics and
Democrats aren't giving McGraw a fair assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGraw realizes, after the last convention, that we need to
bring the party together,'' he said. That's why when the GOP meets
next month in Anaheim, ``you won't hear the (issues) I call GAG _
gays, abortion and guns,'' Bavarro said. ``We're not going to crash
the plane. We're going to land it, and everyone will go home
safe.''

 A MAYOR SEEN BUT NOT HEARD  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Remember when Willie Brown stood out in a crowd?
</P>
<P>
   At the opera or symphony, at political gatherings, at the city's
fine restaurants and major social events, the mayor always arrived
with trumpets blaring, figuratively, and took over the room with
his commanding presence, savoir faire and joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Jolsongate scandal has hit town, and Heeere's
Willie has become ``Where's Waldo?''
</P>
<P>
   An FBI investigation hangs over the head of the city, and from
the glibbest mayor in the history of mayors: Still no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jolsongate? Al Jolson was a singer in the '20s who performed in
blackface, painting his face in the minstrel-show tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The current FBI investigation appears to be zeroing in on a
local white-owned-and-controlled construction company that,
according to an Examiner story, painted itself in blackface in
order to win millions of dollars in ``minority'' contracts on city
projects.
</P>
<P>
   If this stuff turns out to be true, it means that in the city
that prides itself on its diversity and progressive treatment of
minorities, minorities are being progressively screwed by rich
white guys, with the aid of at least one key black guy.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly stuff, and you'd think the mayor would be interested. Among
the characters involved in the FBI probe are two ex-cons with
histories of violence and/or cheating who have flourished under the
Brown administration.
</P>
<P>
   Brown takes credit for the booming local economy and all the
good projects and programs under way, but doesn't that blame-credit
sword slash both ways?
</P>
<P>
   But you can understand why the mayor doesn't have time to speak
to the people of the city on this matter. He's busy running for
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   IF ONLY San Francisco's high society had been hired to guard the
United States' nuclear weapons secrets, the ones that have steadily
leaked out to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to keeping a secret, nobody beats our very own
Upper Crust. For several years, Gordon Getty's double life has been
common knowledge among our social elite, but not a word of it
leaked out to the city's lower social strata.
</P>
<P>
   It was the San Jose Mercury News that yanked Getty out of the
closet as a two-family man, with a mistress and three daughters in
L.A. to supplement his wife-and-four-sons family here.
</P>
<P>
   By weird coincidence, notes George Markell, the story ran in The
Chronicle on Saturday, and that same day's New York Times crossword
had this clue for a 19-letter space: ```Jerry Springer' topic?''
</P>
<P>
   The solution: ``I've got a secret family.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Gordon and his families will be appearing on
``Springer,'' although his mistress might turn up on the new Regis
Philbin quiz show, ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Gordon never laid a moral indignation trip on buddy
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The southern branch of Gordon's family is trying to claim his
name and some of his fortune, but maybe Getty can pick up some
extra cash doing a Doublemint gum commercial.
</P>
<P>
   NO WONDER San Francisco has become the new mecca of country
western music.
</P>
<P>
   Country songs are all about cheatin' and lyin', and who does it
better than we folk by the bay?
</P>
<P>
   Even the local football teams get into the act. The 49ers, of
course, are suffering through their own little Harper Valley
PTA-type scandal /crisis, the good-timin' owner having been forced
out by his cold-hearted sister.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Raiders have a new ad campaign. One billboard shows a
dad and son, their eyes covered with bars like those associated,
I'm told, with old porn pics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never miss a game,'' the kid is saying, ``but Mom thinks
we're at the playground.''
</P>
<P>
   So Dad is teaching Junior to lie to Mom, and they're sneaking
off to an activity that Mom apparently would deem unsavory.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder how they explain to Mom that they spent the rent money on
some of the NFL's most expensive tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somehow the ballgame trips will help Junior's education,
which is being undermined by the millions of dollars in Oakland tax
money sucked off to subsidize the Raiders and their stadium
improvements. How about some black eyebands for the pols who cut
that deal?
</P>
<P>
   LISTENING TO Thursday night's 49ers-Seahawks game on KGO, Jim
Tubridy heard a commercial for PG&AMP;E _ ``Giving you the power you
need, when you need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're a major international airport. Earlier that same
day, SFO experienced a three-hour power outage when a high-voltage
underground cable exploded during some construction work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blew the manhole cover more than 100 feet,'' an airport
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   And that gives me a great idea for adding drama to the 49ers'
pregame coin-flip ceremony.
</P>

VISION THERAPY MAY HELP LEARNING PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a pair of glasses 
 By JENNIFER BAKER 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights

<TEXT>
<P>
   The office of optometrist Michael Phillips boasts a spacious
eyewear showroom, a finishing lab, a receptionist's office and
several exam rooms _ all up-to-date and professional.
</P>
<P>
   But on most weekdays, the St. Petersburg, Fla., clinic may look
more like an after-school program. A child twists on a trampoline
in a pre-set pattern and then moves on to dribbling a playground
ball a specified number of times with each hand. Another calls out
numbers while traversing a wooden balance beam that stretches
across the back wall. Shelves are jumbled with games, toys,
instruments and homemade apparatuses.
</P>
<P>
   The young patients are receiving vision therapy, a training
program designed to improve visual function. While most of them
have 20/20 vision, or vision that has been corrected to 20/20, they
have trouble with skills such as reading and writing, copying from
the blackboard and eye-hand coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Vision therapy, offered by specially trained optometrists like
Phillips, is aimed at improving near-to-far focusing, tracking,
scanning and using both eyes together. Children who have difficulty
with these vision skills often underperform in school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in practice for 25 years, and when these kids come
back and are doctors and attorneys, you see the potential that was
almost wasted,'' Phillips said. ''It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   This type of therapy is not new. As far back as 100 years ago,
similar exercises were used to treat lazy eye and crossed eyes. In
the 1930s, the approach expanded to include treatment of focusing,
eye movement and perceptual problems. The College of Optometrists
and Vision Development, based in St. Louis, began certifying vision
therapists in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   As many as one in four children have visual perception problems,
according to the college. Still, vision therapy is not widely
available, with only 600 board certified vision therapists in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical doctors remain skeptical that the treatment is
useful, saying that vision therapy is scientifically unproven.
Michael Redmond, a board member of the American Academy of
Ophthalmology, calls vision therapy a ''wild conglomeration'' of
practices short on scientific proof.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy claims to address a wide range of learning
processing problems that Redmond claims originate in the brain, not
the eye. After long and costly therapy, the learning problems would
still exist, he says. Evidence of improvement, he maintains,
derives from the one-on-one attention children receive during
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But optometrist Sharon Berger, a board certified vision
therapist in Atlanta, says she has no doubt that vision therapy
works for most patients. ''Yes, we are dealing with the brain,''she
says. ''We're changing the way people visually process information.
We are allowing them to process it more efficiently and faster. The
improvements are ongoing, long after the therapy is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Vision is more than just sight, say vision therapists. It is
also deriving meaning from what is seen, through perception and
integration. Problems in these areas may overlap with learning
disabilities such as dyslexia and attention deficit disorder.
Improvement in eye functioning may alleviate some symptoms,
therapists say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most children are referred to me by their schools between the
ages of 5 and 10,'' says Berger, who has been practicing with her
husband, Dr. William Moscow, for almost 20 years at the Roswell Eye
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Berger begins with a vision screening to make sure there are no
health or pathology problems. Then the child undergoes an initial
assessment and battery of tests that lasts a few hours and costs
about $225. Most children who are diagnosed with vision problems
receive therapy twice a week for six months, although some
treatment can range from three months to more than a year.
Insurance picks up about 80 percent of the cost for patients whose
medical plan includes vision therapy coverage.
</P>
<P>
   If a child needs the therapy, early intervention can make all
the difference, Berger says : ''I've seen lives change, parents cry
because of the changes their children have made. It's the most
rewarding thing we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several parents report startling improvements in their
child's academic performance after vision therapy. Eight-year-old
Ricky Perry has had vision therapy for about six months at
Phillips' St. Petersburg clinic. His spelling and reading are much
improved, and his aunt, Mignonette Hayden, says Ricky likes school
now for the first time. Amanda Francavilla, 9, saw her reading jump
two grade levels since beginning therapy in St. Petersburg last
September. She now reads two to three books each week, up from a
single chapter a week last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Geimer, 12, was a slow reader in kindergarten and first
grade. Eye screening did not indicate a vision problem. But an
evaluation pointed to a problem with his eye muscles working
together. After a year of vision therapy, said his mother, Diane
Geimer, the change was miraculous. Within the year, he was reading
at grade level; now in the sixth grade, he reads well above grade
level. Along with academic improvements, Geimer saw her son gain
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Vision therapists use techniques such as specially designed
computer programs, balance boards, walking rails, mini-trampolines,
chalk boards, parquetry blocks, stereoscopes, colored lenses and 3D
pictures to improve the visual system. ''The visual system has to
develop. Just as we learn to walk and talk, we learn how to see,''
Berger says.
</P>
<P>
   Not all vision therapy takes place in an optometrist's office.
Berger will often suggest informal activities for kids to do at
home, such as mom or dad sitting on one side of the child while
talking or eating, to pull a weak eye over to that side more often;
crafts, such as puzzles, coloring and Play-Doh, and more outdoor
time _ running, jumping and playing ball or Simon Says.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much of vision has to do with movement, where we exist in
space, giving us that orientation,'' she says. ''When a child has
trouble tracking, we have to work with the whole body. When vision
therapy is successful, everything gets better _ from doing homework
to swinging a baseball bat.''

TWINS FESTIVAL MORE SIDESHOW THAN CELEBRATION
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of two sets of twins
 By LAURA TAXEL 
 c.1999 Laura Taxel 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since my twin sons were born 13 years ago, my husband and I have
regularly been asked if we're taking them to the Twins Days
Festival, held each August in Twinsburg, Ohio. It is the nation's
largest public celebration of embryonic activity. Each year, since
1976, thousands of people from around the world with the amazing
distinction of having been born at the same time as one of their
siblings converge on the town, along with their families, friends,
and hordes of gawkers to honor this extraordinary confluence of
biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays of course, thanks to the wonders of techno-fertility,
multiple births are just as likely to denote the outlay of big
bucks and the availability of a petri dish as they are a burst of
spontaneous ovarian excitement. But on Twins Days in Twinsburg, a
town founded by twin brothers, every look-alike is a VIP, and even
non-identical twins are welcome though they are encouraged to get
in the spirit of things by dressing alike.
</P>
<P>
   We avoided going for years. I didn't quite see the value in
hauling the kids out on a hot a summer day to remind them they
looked alike, a fact they admitted, but found relatively
uninteresting. They also were well aware that they were not the
only twins in the world _ there were five sets in their elementary
school, which makes me wonder if there's something in the water in
our town. Twin-ness, for them, was not an identity, and for us it
was a job not a pastime.
</P>
<P>
   But when the call came for my husband to photograph the event
for the New York Times, our good sense failed us, and we decided to
make it a family outing.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the novelty of twins and even triplets has paled in
comparison to the incidence of quads, quints, or sextuplets. It
takes at least five babies to get you a discount at K-mart, I
learned early on, or a van donation. The most attention being the
mother of twins has ever generated for me is a few sympathetic
words along the line of, ''I don't know how you do it,'' from
mothers who had their babies one at a time. I have always found the
remark irritating _ not only was the statement self-evident, but
what other choice did I have?
</P>
<P>
   I did not know I was pregnant with twins until the first baby
was delivered and the other guy was found. We have had plenty of
time to adjust, and we're pretty much used to it now. I admit it
was a shock initially, and there were a lot of little details to
work out. We had to prepare so many bottles to get through the
night that we called it the baby buffet, and corralling the two of
them once they became mobile was known as boy wrangling. Getting
them from the bath to bed was referred to as the baby rodeo. Get
the picture?
</P>
<P>
   But as they got older and we got smarter, it all became
relatively ordinary...they were our kids, not our twins, and it
seemed obvious that the best way to raise them was to treat them as
two distinctive individuals.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude stands in sharp contrast to the operating
philosophy behind the Twinsburg gala. It is, for all who are part
of a matched set, a time to gather and acknowledge that they belong
to a very special group; PCS, People Conceived Simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   There's a parade of twins, and contests for the most identical
twins _ an event that prompts many to go all out wardrobe-wise,
youngest set of multiples, and oldest. Promoters like to invoke the
fun-for-all carnival atmosphere, but I'd say sideshow is more
accurate. Might be why the National Enquirer shows up with some
regularity. I wish John Waters would focus on the Twin Talent Show
_ he's the only filmmaker I know of who could do it justice.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is a great shopping opportunity. Vendors peddle
useful items rarely found elsewhere: bumper stickers, baseball
hats, T-shirts, and tote-bags, all proclaiming the bearers'
particular affiliation with multiplicity. I myself would have
preferred two-for-one discounts on shoes and college tuition. There
were midway games galore, which of course ended up being twice as
expensive for our family and twice as profitable for the carnies
who ran them. The summer fest ambiance was reinforced by hawkers
offering a variety of food items that melt, stick, and smear, a
special delight, as I recall, for those of us who had to clean two
faces, four hands, and twenty fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The media shows up in droves to document the event, so posing is
a major activity for the multiples in attendance. The Twins Days
Festival Committee is well aware of how rare and compelling are
these images of individuals who share numerous physical
characteristics as well as taste in clothing. So they reserve the
right to charge freelance photographers and other commercial
enterprises a hefty licensing fee. Groups of two or three sets of
unrelated twins seemed especially popular, as were collections of
twin couples: identical brothers who hook up with identical
sisters. Seeing such foursomes standing together, I kept wondering
if they could mix-n-match with impunity, but that's probably just
me.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee urges multiples to register and pay a fee. This
entitles them to the privilege of being counted as an attendee,
thus assuring them a place in the annals of marketing history no
less significant than the number of McBurgers sold. They also
charge an admission fee and offer official souvenirs for sale. As
the mother of twins, I assumed I had a stake in the profits created
by the participation of families like ours, but after making
inquires, it turned out I was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   The seminal moment for us was when our boys came face to face
with two elderly gentlemen dressed in tails and top hats. They
stared long and hard at these guys who truly were mirror images of
one another, then shrugged and walked away. When we were out of
earshot one said, ''This is really weird,'' and the other added,
''Can we go home now?''

<P>
   &UR; UNRAVELLING &LR;  By Elizabeth Graver. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
Aimee Slater is a nave New Hampshire farm girl who leaves home for
a factory job in the 1840s, becomes impregnated by a mechanic and
is exiled by her mother, which forces her to build a new life as an
outcast and struggle to overcome her bitterness. In 1997 in The New
York Times Book Review, Benjamin DeMott called this a ``grave,
winter-wise and absorbing first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TITAN: THE LIFE OF JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, SR. &LR;  By Ron Chernow.
Vintage, $16. The archcapitalist John D. Rockefeller Sr.
(1839-1937) is portrayed as a complex figure whose lifelong
devotion to making money was balanced by a deep religious
conviction and devotion to his family. Rockefeller's Marxist
analysis of the U.S. economy put him and his fledgling company,
Standard Oil, in ruthless pursuit of monopoly on an unparalleled
scale before he was 30. This evenhanded account, selected as one of
the best books of 1998 by the editors of The New York Times Book
Review, ``is a triumph of the art of biography,'' Jack Beatty
wrote. ``Unflaggingly interesting,'' it brings its subject to life
``through sustained narrative portraiture of the large-scale,
19th-century kind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUMMER AT GAGLOW &LR;  By Esther Freud. Ecco, $15. Shifting back and
forth between contemporary London and Germany during and after
World War I, this novel explores the fracturing of a Jewish family
and how their notion of ``home'' is altered by their connection to
their former summer estate. The result is ``a near-seamless meshing
of family feeling, history and imagination,'' Deborah Mason wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLIMB: TRAGIC AMBITIONS ON EVEREST &LR;  By Anatoli Boukreev and
G. Weston DeWalt. St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95. This haunting
account of the 1996 storm that killed eight climbers from several
groups focuses on the role played by the driven Russian guide for
one of the teams, who saved three lives (and who died in an
avalanche the following year). In 1997 the reviewer Michael Parfit,
called the book ``raw but powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I MAY BE SOME TIME: ICE AND THE ENGLISH IMAGINATION &LR; , by
Francis Spufford (Picador USA, $15), is a history of Arctic and
Antarctic exploration centering on the exploits of great British
adventurers like Robert Falcon Scott and James Cook. ``With his
book, just as with the endeavors of the polar pioneers, the journey
might be worth it for its own sake,'' Robert R. Harris wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY &LR;  By Samantha Gillison. Owl/Holt, $13.
In this first novel, an American researcher takes his wife and
young daughter to a remote village in Papua New Guinea, where their
fragile family unit is tested after the girl joins the local
culture, escaping more and more often into the rain forest. The
result is an ``exceptional story,'' Elizabeth Gaffney wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SPANISH INQUISITION: A HISTORICAL REVISION &LR;  By Henry Kamen.
Yale University, $15.95. The author argues that the popular image
of the Inquisition as a barbaric, all-powerful scourge is a
19th-century myth, and that the tribunal was actually weak and its
methods more humane than those of most secular courts. Last year
the reviewer Richard L. Kagan called this ``the best general book''
on the subject ``both for its range and its depth of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; PHILIP OF SPAIN &LR;  ($17.95),
Kamen's biography of Philip II, who reigned during the Inquisition
in the 16th century and who is often portrayed as an intolerant
religious zealot. In presenting the monarch instead as a cultured
Renaissance prince, this nuanced portrait is ``a fine
achievement,'' Hugh Thomas wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAN WITHOUT A FACE: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF COMMUNISM'S GREATEST
SPYMASTER &LR;  By Markus Wolf with Anne McElvoy. Public Affairs, $14.
The former chief of East German intelligence tells how he spent
more than 30 years planting moles, running agents, orchestrating
betrayals and living the secret life. He ``comes across as a clever
and cultivated man'' who nonetheless ``chose to follow a dark
star,'' David Wise wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IDENTITY &LR;  By Milan Kundera. Harper Perennial, $13. The hero of
this dreamlike novel sends his girlfriend anonymous love letters to
pick up her spirits, with disastrous results. ``Kundera lucidly
discloses the psychological obsessions of the two lovers and how
these obsessions lead to repeated miscommunications,'' Robert
Grudin wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; LAUGHABLE LOVES &LR;  ($13), a
collection of the author's tales steeped in anger and fascination
with the communists running the show in Prague in the '60s. In 1974
the reviewer Paul Theroux called Kundera ``a magnificent
short-story writer'' whose ``best humor always seems to be rooted
in authority situations.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNTERS &LR;  By James Salter. Vintage International, $13. The
author's first novel, originally published in 1956, is about a
fighter pilot's harrowing tour of duty in the Korean War and the
jealousies and competition among his fellow squadron members.
Praising the book, George Barrett urged readers to ``curl up for a
flight ... so `clear you can see tomorrow.'''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

   Deep in Space, a Cosmic Puzzle
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers think they understand much about how the universe
began, why stars shine and galaxies take majestic shape, and where
planets orbit other stars. But one tiny point of faint light deep
in the northern sky in the constellation Serpens has astronomers
mystified.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know if they are seeing some odd variation of a
familiar object or the first evidence of something entirely
unsuspected, perhaps a challenge to cherished theories.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it was detected three years ago, the mystery object
has confounded astronomers because they cannot decipher the
language of its light. Usually, they are able in minutes or hours
to determine an object's composition, distance and nature by
breaking down and analyzing its light spectrum. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a spectrum anything like this, and I take
spectra for a living,'' said Dr. S. George Djorgovski, an
astronomer at the California Institute of Technology whose team at
Palomar Observatory detected the mystery object.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated photographs reveal only a steady light, neither flaring
nor fading over time, which would appear to rule out a stellar
explosion, or supernova. Nor is it recognizable as a distant galaxy
or a quasar, sources of tremendous energy believed to be powered by
matter falling into massive black holes.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out to be a quasar, some scientists speculate, it is
almost certainly a rare kind beyond current understanding. Other
astronomers and some of the most powerful telescopes have been
called on to help solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   With bigger, more sensitive telescopes, astronomers may have to
get used to new mysteries like this one. As Djorgovski said, ``We
can't think we have discovered all the kinds of things there are
out there.''

   A Brownout Hits New England
</P>
<P>
   One word that Yankees dread more than ``drought'' is ``drab.''
And a menacing brown is enveloping New England roadsides, as
thirsty red oaks and sugar maples shed their shriveled leaves a
good two months before the invasion of tourists drawn to the
region's foliage show each fall.
</P>
<P>
   Foresters fear that by the time the leaf-peepers begin clogging
mountain roads next month, the only leaves left will be a muddy
mustard color, with the coveted scarlet, purple and fiery orange _
the spectacular death throes of a healthy leaf _ available only on
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not seeing a lot of outright death,'' said Glenn D.
Dreyer, director of the Connecticut College Arboretum. ``But I'm
seeing a lot of defoliating and browning out.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the peak leaf week, an annual obsession that
includes nightly updates from television weathercasters and Web-cam
views offered by state tourism departments, may become even more
desperate than usual. (Botanists patiently explain that the only
sure way to know a leaf has peaked is when it falls off.)
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, who could lose their crops, are annoyed by the leaf
panic, and hard-core hikers are bemused. But foliage-gawking has
become an $8 billion annual business in New England, with tour
packagers offering journeys by bus, boat and rail, with hot
chocolate included.
</P>
<P>
   So proprietors like Rolf Hammer, owner of the Homestead Inn in
New Milford, Conn., are scrambling to save the season. ``The
scenery isn't just trees,'' he points out. That may be little
consolation to the tourists who visit the same stand of trees each
year, or the ones who wait for rain so they can revel in the
contrast between the vivid leaves and the dark earth.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an upside. Wineries in New England say the dry,
sunny summer will produce smaller but more flavorful grapes. So
next season tasting may rival peeping as the region's leading
autumn attraction.

   Metropolitan Life Agrees to Settle Fraud Suits
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. agreed to settle lawsuits that
accused the company of using deceptive sale practices to cheat
policyholders out of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life, the nation's second-largest life insurer,
placed the value of the deal, which is subject to approval by a
federal judge, at $1.7 billion, though fees for the plaintiffs'
lawyers' and other costs will come from that sum. Some 7 million
customers who bought life insurance and annuities between 1982 and
1997 can seek to get cash or increases in their death benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits against Metropolitan Life, like similar ones
against other life insurers, alleged that the company, competing
for consumers' money with banks paying high interest, persuaded
customers to trade in valuable existing policies for more costly
ones, a practice called ``churning.''

   Corruption in Bosnia
</P>
<P>
   An American-led anti-fraud unit investigating corruption in
Bosnia reported that up to $1 billion has been stolen from
international aid projects or has disappeared from public funds or
been lost through Bosnian officials' failure to collect taxes. The
investigators documented the fraud in a report that names several
officials linked to governing parties that it says profited from
the corruption.
</P>
<P>
   At least $20 million of the total was in foreign aid; the vast
majority was stolen from Bosnian public funds or lost through
uncollected taxes. The missing money was to have been spent to
repair roads, buildings and schools, as well as to provide
municipal services in Bosnian towns.
</P>
<P>
   Bias Seen in Spy Case
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese atomic spy scandal, for months a shadowy maze of
complex allegations, has been roiled anew by charges of racial
bias.
</P>
<P>
   A key investigator in the case asserted that Wen Ho Lee, a
Taiwan-born scientist at the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico
who became the top suspect, had been unfairly singled out four
years ago for federal investigation because of his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Caucasians'' with equivalent access to secrets and
trips to China were not investigated, said Robert S. Vrooman, the
former head of counterintelligence at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials denied the charge. ``Race was never
a factor,'' said Notra Trulock, who began the federal probe in
1995.

   Russian Coalition Gets a Lift
</P>
<P>
   A new center-left coalition in Russia gained momentum when
Yevgeny Primakov, the popular former prime minister who was fired
three months ago by President Boris Yeltsin, decided to join the
alliance in advance of parliamentary elections in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Fatherland-All Russia coalition, led by the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov, appears poised to take a commanding lead in the
coming campaign. It remains unclear whether Luzhkov or Primakov, a
Soviet-era survivor and former spymaster, will emerge as the
alliance's leading candidate in the presidential election in 2000,
when Yeltsin is scheduled to step down.

   Starr to Leave Soon
</P>
<P>
   After five years of investigation, independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has decided to call it quits. His associates said he would
step aside to resume his private law practice as early as October.
Starr plans to stay to put the last touches on a final report on
his inquiries _ a document that could embarrass Hillary Rodham
Clinton as she moves closer to entering the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will depart with his reputation for scholarly probity
damaged by attacks from Clinton's supporters _ even as Starr
uncovered an Oval Office sex scandal that led to Clinton's
impeachment in the House and his subsequent trial and acquittal in
the Senate.

   A Lutheran-Episcopalian Link
</P>
<P>
   Another merger? Big deal. Banks and media companies routinely
gobble one another for breakfast. But this one's different: The
nation's largest Lutheran group voted to link up with the Episcopal
Church. It's not a merger exactly, for each will keep its rituals.
But the plan, involving nearly 8 million American Protestants,
bears a striking resemblance to deals out in the cold corporate
world, for it involves, basically, economies of scale. When
congregations are small and poor, they could, say, pool resources
or share a pastor.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where it diverges from the corporate model: It will
not, presumably, involve layoffs among the faithful.

   Pursuers of Diana Cleared
</P>
<P>
   The Paris prosecutor's office concluded that nine celebrity
photographers and a photo-agency motorcycle driver arrested after
the crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, her escort and
their French driver two years ago bore no criminal responsibility
for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' report said the accident appeared to have been
caused by the driver of the Mercedes S280 limousine, who was
inebriated and traveling at an excessive speed. The two
investigating magistrates who carried out the probe have the last
word on whether to bring charges and are expected to rule by Aug.
31, the second anniversary of Diana's death.

   China Sets Production Limits
</P>
<P>
   After years of fearing the social consequences of runaway
inflation, China's leaders now face the opposite problem:
deflation. Prices have fallen for 22 months in a row, leaving
factories with stacks of unbought goods. Yet the state-run nature
of operations means many local officials are still eager to open
even more factories.
</P>
<P>
   In a drastic move to stop them, China's leaders ordered a
nationwide ban on any new production of several consumer goods, as
well as on all new luxury hotels, apartment and office buildings
and department stores. The unanswered question is how well the ban
will be enforced.

   School Drug Test Challenge
</P>
<P>
   High-school students in Tecumseh, Okla. _ as well as in school
districts in North Carolina, Idaho and Wyoming, among other states
_ have been subject to drug testing if they wish to participate in
extracurricular activities like the debate team, the drama club,
even the Future Farmers of America. Otherwise, they risk being
dropped from the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Though the testing of high-school athletes has gone largely
unchallenged after the Supreme Court upheld an Oregon program in
1995, the American Civil Liberties Union believes the Tecumseh
policy goes too far. The group has filed suit against the district
in federal court in Oklahoma City.

   A New Bacteria Threat
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people in Minnesota and North Dakota have become
sick _ and four children have died _ over the past two years from a
drug-resistant bacteria that for more than 30 years has been
confined to hospitals and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fatalities were the first reported in the United States from
the germ, a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, and federal officials
don't know if the bug has spread. But the deaths suggest the public
is now at risk.

   Huge Japanese Bank Merger
</P>
<P>
   Three giant Japanese banks _ Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank _ announced their intention to merge.
Combined, they would have $1.3 trillion in assets and become the
world's No. 1 banking powerhouse. But if Japanese banking history
is any indication, bigger does not mean better. Large or small,
Japanese banks are not highly profitable, especially when compared
with American rivals.

<P>
   BUSH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Months after the Republican
establishment placed its bets for the party's presidential
nomination with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a reappraisal is
under way, fueled by a restless press corps, as well as by Bush's
opponents, freshly determined after his first-place finish in a
straw poll in Iowa a week ago to slow his seemingly effortless
march to the White House. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL-LAW-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here is a courtroom scene that
lawyers in the fledgling field of animal law say will unfold
sometime soon. A great ape will appear in the courtroom. A lawsuit
will have been filed in the animal's name. The ape will then
testify in sign language or using a voice synthesizer to support
the claim that, contrary to centuries of law, it has legal rights,
including a fundamental right to liberty. Fiction? Perhaps. But a
growing group of lawyers and legal academics say they are plotting
strategies to bring such a suit, perhaps within a decade. By
William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-ROW-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 566 people have been
executed. In that same period, 82 convicts awaiting execution have
been exonerated _ a ratio of one freed for every seven put to
death. About half of them were exonerated in the 1990s, six so far
this year. By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIR-SAFETY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Right after ``What does it
cost?'' the second question that almost every traveler planning a
trip on a foreign airline asks is: ``Is it safe?'' The average
ticket buyer can't get an answer, and even if the Federal Aviation
Administration knows, it is barred by treaty from saying. But
that's all about to change. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   WITCHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ For at least one person who has seen
``The Blair Witch Project,'' the surprise hit movie of the summer
did not so much terrify as infuriate. One long slur against
witches, said Selena Fox, a witch, or Wicca, as male and female
American witches prefer to call themselves. By Anthony Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY-REVIEW (Undated) _ There will be a recession. That is
inevitable _ if not this year, then next year or maybe the year
after. The question is, how severe will it be? The answer is that
despite all the fanfare about these prosperous times, the
eight-year expansion walks on precarious legs, and when it
collapses, getting the U.S. economy back on its feet could be
surprisingly hard and painful. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-WORDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ By the time dictionary editors
accept a word as new, it's probably old to you.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MILOSEVIC-REVIEW (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Last September, when
Bob Dole, the former presidential candidate, and John Shattuck, an
American human rights official, came here to press Slobodan
Milosevic to relent in Kosovo, the Yugoslav president put on quite
a performance. He rejected charges of Serb abuses of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, and then, acting offended, had an aide shut
the doors leading to a dining room already set for lunch. Just
before Dole and Shattuck left, unfed, Milosevic leaned forward and
said emphatically, in his good English, ``You know, I enjoy being
president.'' By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-GREECE-REVIEW (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Greece is often
described as Turkey's principal rival, and it has spent much of the
last quarter century blocking Turkish initiatives and ambitions.
But a remarkable outpouring from Greece after last week's
earthquake in Turkey, not just of aid but also of sentiment, shows
that a deeply felt sense of shared history and shared fate still
binds many Greeks and Turks. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-SYNDROME-REVIEW (United Nations) _ A new malady is
stalking the presidential palaces and bunkers of the world. Call it
the Pinochet Syndrome. By Barbara Crossette.

a performance. He rejected charges of Serb abuses of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, and then, acting offended, had an aide shut

ANOTHER HIT COULD GIVE WITCHES A BAD NAME

<P>
   For at least one person who has seen ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' the surprise hit movie of the summer did not so much
terrify as infuriate. One long slur against witches, said Selena
Fox, a witch, or Wicca, as male and female American witches prefer
to call themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the film had been called `The Blair Cherokee Project,'''
said Ms. Fox, who is part Cherokee, ``people would recognize the
negative stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many American Wiccas there are, so how many
have been offended by the fictional story of three student
filmmakers' harrowing encounter with a witch in the Maryland woods
is unclear. Ms. Fox, who helped found one of the oldest Wiccan
nature preserves in the United States, the Circle Sanctuary in Mt.
Horeb, Wis., feels ``certain'' there are at least 250,000 Wiccans
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their numbers, witches aren't the only people
interested in the occult.
</P>
<P>
   At the movies, ``The Blair Witch Project'' has grossed more than
$100 million _ and since it cost less than half the price of a
Mercedes-Benz to make, it may well become the most profitable film
ever. In the ultimate homage, both ``The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno'' and ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' parodied the film and
one of its signature handheld-camera night scenes, complete with
flashlight and close-ups of nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   But the occult craze does not stop there. ``The Sixth Sense,''
about a psychologist counseling a boy who ``sees'' dead people, has
replaced ``Blair Witch'' as No. 1 at the box office. On television,
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' and ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch''
reign in teen prime time.
</P>
<P>
   At national bookstore chains and on the Internet, titles about
alchemy, miracles, psychics, tarot, reincarnation and out-of-body
travel fly off the physical and virtual bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   And most telling, people who call themselves witches get
interviewed by reporters even on days other than Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Why? A growing number of scholars trace the phenomenon to
feminism, which has made women-led religions like Wicca more open
to public interest and acceptance, and to environmentalism, which
has made regard for Mother Earth a secular, and for some, a sacred
tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, why are a growing number of scholars studying followers
of the occult? Robert S. Ellwood, who wrote ``Religious and
Spiritual Groups in Modern America'' (Prentice-Hall, 1986), a
textbook on alternative religions, said simply, ``Pagans aren't
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   From colonial days, Americans have been fascinated with the
occult, seeing in it both good, evil and the merely utilitarian.
Even at the height of the Salem witch trials in the 1690s, said J.
Gordon Melton, who wrote ``The Encyclopedia of American Religions''
(Gale Research, 1998), few New Englanders thought it odd that the
colonial governor of Connecticut had an alchemy laboratory in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   By the more rational 20th century, however, witches had become
both earthbound and unaccountably sexier, like Veronica Lake in ``I
Married a Witch'' and her later incarnation as Elizabeth Montgomery
on TV's ``Bewitched.'' The picture darkened in the late 1960s, with
films like ``Rosemary's Baby,'' which depicted a young woman
betrayed by a witches' conspiracy. Such films seemed to mirror a
politically chaotic age, especially for the biggest ``minority''
group, women.
</P>
<P>
   Modern feminism, a product of the early 1970s, promised to
empower women, said John K. Simmons, author of the coming ``Beliefs
and Believers,'' which will discuss women-led religions. Before the
women ministers and rabbis of today, the Wiccan movement bestowed
priesthood on both women and men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And environmentalism, another product of the 1970s, Simmons
said, dovetailed naturally with the occult's emphasis on unseen
forces in the universe that must be brought into harmonious
balance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a seeming paradox, many people in the Wiccan movement are
computer professionals, according to Ellwood, a retired religion
professor at the University of Southern California. ``But in a
world increasingly dominated by science and technology,'' he said,
``they want one corner left that is closer to nature and the
nonrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the occult cannot seem to shake its guilt by association
with the ultimate nonrational, the devil. ``I don't worship Satan,
who I don't think exists, but I do pray to the goddess of
creation,'' said Margot Adler, a New York correspondent for
National Public Radio and a Wiccan practitioner. ``Wicca is not
anti-Christian or pro-Christian, it's pre-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   As for magic and spells, said Ms. Adler, whose 1979 book,
``Drawing Down the Moon (Penguin U.S.A.), helped popularize
earth-based religions, ``It's not uggah-buggah, it's attempting to
experience a larger physical reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People say `witch' and think `Rosemary's Baby,''' she said.
``But where does that come from? Who writes the history books? The
victors. And paganism lost.''

WHO YOU GONNA CALL AFTER THE NEXT BUST?

<P>
   There will be a recession. That is inevitable _ if not this
year, then next year or maybe the year after. The question is, how
severe will it be? The answer is that despite all the fanfare about
these prosperous times, the eight-year expansion walks on
precarious legs, and when it collapses, getting the U.S. economy
back on its feet could be surprisingly hard and painful.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are that the next recession will come sooner rather
than later, and it will be different from other recessions since
World War II. The response will be different, too. Many of the
politicians, executives, financiers and prominent economists who
have bet so heavily on the virtues of a market economy unhindered
by government will probably look this time to government for extra
help in mitigating the damage. Not just in cutting interest rates,
but in stepped-up public spending as well as tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to change the rhetoric,'' said Robert Pollin, an
economist at the University of Massachusetts. ``We can still say
that markets play an important role, but they can't cure
themselves. We will have to acknowledge that we need government for
that. It's the stabilizer. And that acknowledgement will open up a
broader debate about what government should do.''
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of this expansion are potentially destructive.
They are chiefly consumer spending and business investment, both of
which are based on debt. Unlike the Reagan-era expansion, which was
driven by government borrowing, the current expansion is fueled by
private-sector debt. Rising stock prices and, more recently, rising
home prices, have encouraged the borrowing. Bubbles have developed
in stock prices and real estate. And when they burst, particularly
in the stock market, much of the collateral for the borrowing will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no time in the post-World War II period in which the
welfare of the American economy, and for that matter the rest of
the world, has hinged so much on the well-being of the American
stock market,'' said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the borrowing has paid for imports, which have given
Americans a great variety of inexpensive goods and services. But
the imports have also created a huge trade deficit that threatens
to weaken the dollar, complicating future efforts to repair a
damaged economy. The June trade deficit, for example, which was
announced on Thursday, was a record $24.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been running the economy on private credit rather than
government debt on a very large and unusual scale,'' said Wynne
Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute who tracks the
debt numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When hard times come, households and companies will almost
certainly pull back on spending, investing and borrowing _ a
nightmare for an economy that has become increasingly dependent on
such voluntary activity. Government _ mainly federal, but also
state and local _ will suddenly be expected to take up the slack.
As Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist, put it, ``In the
event of a recession, people turn to government en masse.''
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, the government carries an unusual handicap, as
if it were starting a one-mile race from 100 yards behind the
starting line. It is deficit spending that stimulates an economy,
whether it comes from the private or public sectors. Right now the
private sector carries the load. In the next recession, today's
cherished budget surpluses must be turned into deficits. The public
sector, in effect, must replace at least some of the private
sector's deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposed tax cuts currently being sold as a
reward for the shrinking government role in a highly successful
market system must be resold to the public in an entirely opposite
manner. They would become the government's way of prodding
Americans to spend more and thus help revive the economy. That was
the justification for tax cuts in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   More government spending on housing, public works, education and
income subsidies also seems likely to accompany the next recession,
given the unusual nature of the current expansion and the downturn
it is likely to produce.
</P>
<P>
   This stepped-up government spending would be a departure from
the solution applied to recessions over the last 20 years. These
earlier cycles have been variations on a different theme: The
demand for goods and services outstrips the supply. Prices rise.
The Federal Reserve, concerned about inflation, raises interest
rates to cool the demand. If demand cools too much, unsold
merchandise piles up and, as companies cut back production, a
recession develops. The solution: the Fed cuts interest rates to
revive demand. The Fed, in this way, has played the main government
role in regulating the economy since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1990s are different. Supply is no longer a problem. The
output of goods and services in this country and abroad outstrips
demand. The economy has been booming since 1995, but inflation is
not a problem with so much supply. The labor force is fully
employed, and in theory at least, labor shortages should be pushing
up wages and prices. But neither is happening noticeably. The
danger is not that demand will outstrip supply, but that demand
will collapse if the stock market does.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve can probably revive demand by lowering
rates, as it has in the past. But here is where the trade deficit
complicates the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners have been big lenders to America, partly financing
the trade deficit. The percentage of Treasury securities and
corporate securities held by foreigners, for example, has almost
doubled since 1992. When the next recession comes and the dollar
inevitably weakens, the Fed's first instinct will be to lower
rates. But it will also have to contend with the possibility that
the much-needed foreign investors will seek out higher returns
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The way to revive the economy is to lower rates, but the way to
keep foreign lenders on board is to raise rates, or not lower them.
``We could get locked into a situation where we can't lower
rates,'' said Lance Taylor, director of the Center for Economic
Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the door may reopen to the sort of government intervention
that was commonplace until the 1980s, and that John Maynard Keynes,
the British economist, first spelled out in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nixon who said we are all Keynesians,'' Blinder said.
``It is true now, although many people shun the label.''

the justification for tax cuts in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   More government spending on housing, public works, education and
income subsidies also seems likely to accompany the next recession,
given the unusual nature of the current expansion and the downturn
it is likely to produce.
</P>
<P>
   This stepped-up government spending would be a departure from
the solution applied to recessions over the last 20 years. These
earlier cycles have been variations on a different theme: The
demand for goods and services outstrips the supply. Prices rise.
The Federal Reserve, concerned about inflation, raises interest
rates to cool the demand. If demand cools too much, unsold
merchandise piles up and, as companies cut back production, a
recession develops. The solution: the Fed cuts interest rates to
revive demand. The Fed, in this way, has played the main government
role in regulating the economy since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1990s are different. Supply is no longer a problem. The
output of goods and services in this country and abroad outstrips
demand. The economy has been booming since 1995, but inflation is
not a problem with so much supply. The labor force is fully
employed, and in theory at least, labor shortages should be pushing
up wages and prices. But neither is happening noticeably. The
danger is not that demand will outstrip supply, but that demand
will collapse if the stock market does.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve can probably revive demand by lowering
rates, as it has in the past. But here is where the trade deficit
complicates the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners have been big lenders to America, partly financing
the trade deficit. The percentage of Treasury securities and
corporate securities held by foreigners, for example, has almost
doubled since 1992. When the next recession comes and the dollar
inevitably weakens, the Fed's first instinct will be to lower
rates. But it will also have to contend with the possibility that
the much-needed foreign investors will seek out higher returns
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The way to revive the economy is to lower rates, but the way to
keep foreign lenders on board is to raise rates, or not lower them.
``We could get locked into a situation where we can't lower
rates,'' said Lance Taylor, director of the Center for Economic
Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the door may reopen to the sort of government intervention
that was commonplace until the 1980s, and that John Maynard Keynes,
the British economist, first spelled out in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nixon who said we are all Keynesians,'' Blinder said.
``It is true now, although many people shun the label.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Soon after last week's devastating earthquake
in Turkey, telephones at the Turkish Embassy in Athens, Greece,
began ringing. Lines were jammed as ordinary Greeks, many of them
upset and overwrought, called to express sympathy for quake victims
and to ask what they could do to help.
</P>
<P>
   Many lined up to donate blood. Others contributed to a fund
drive organized by the Greek Red Cross or dropped donations at
depots set up by the mayor of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Greek aid did not come only from individuals and private groups.
Within 12 hours of the quake, the government sent three planeloads
of relief supplies to Turkey, and it continued to send rescue
workers, doctors, field kitchens, medical supplies and firefighting
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to warmly thank those who shared our deep sorrow
and offered to provide assistance,'' the Turkish Embassy responded
in a statement. In both tone and substance, the statement marked an
extraordinary departure from the strident rhetoric that Greece and
Turkey often use when addressing each other in public.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is often described as Turkey's principal rival, and it
has spent much of the last quarter century blocking Turkish
initiatives and ambitions. But last week's remarkable outpouring,
not just of aid but also of sentiment, shows that a deeply felt
sense of shared history and shared fate still binds many Greeks and
Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catastrophe from the earthquake drained us emotionally,''
a Greek government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas, told reporters in
Athens. ``In these situations there is no room for any ulterior
motives. You try to help someone in need, someone who is facing a
difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece might have been expected to respond to the earthquake as
did Armenia, another country traditionally unfriendly to Turkey.
There was no special sympathy there, and while President Robert
Kocharian said he was ready to dispatch a planeload of supplies, he
said he would do so only if Turkey asked for Armenian help.
</P>
<P>
   While relations between Turkey and Armenia are all but frozen,
however, a palpable thaw is bringing Greeks and Turks closer
together. Tuesday's earthquake came at a very interesting moment in
Greek-Turkish relations. The heartfelt reaction of many Greeks
reflected a growing desire in both countries to end the bitterness
and hostility that divides two neighbors who have much to gain from
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been taught to hate the Turks for years,'' the
columnist Anna Stergiou wrote in one Athens newspaper. ``But their
unbelievable pain gives us no joy. We were moved, we cried as if
the age-old hatred disappeared at the sight of dead babies.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second catastrophe that added momentum to efforts
to bring Greece and Turkey together. The war in Kosovo was the
first. As it raged, Greek and Turkish diplomats worked together on
refugee problems and other matters, and seemed to emerge with a
renewed sense that if they join hands, they can have a decisive
effect in shaping events in this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally there is a simple emotional reason for helping
earthquake victims, but what has happened in the last few days also
has a political importance,'' said Alexis Alexandris, a Greek
diplomat who has written extensively on Greek-Turkish relations.
``In our ministry, and also among our Turkish counterparts, there
is a growing desire to break out of this vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an optimism, no doubt,'' Alexandris continued. ``It's
still very guarded and limited, but it's better than confrontation.
What we've seen this week is symptomatic of a more general trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece and Turkey remain highly suspicious of each other. Turkey
was outraged by Greek support for the fugitive Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who was captured in February while under the
protection of Greek diplomats in Kenya (he has since been tried in
a Turkish court and sentenced to death). Greece worries that Turkey
plots to grab some of its Aegean islands. But at least for the
moment, those disputes have faded into the background.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may be the character of the countries'
foreign ministers. Ismail Cem of Turkey is a thoughtful former
journalist who disdains rabble-rousing statements. George
Papandreou of Greece, equally earnest and soft-spoken, could hardly
be more different from his predecessor, Theodore Pangalos, who
publicly described Turks as thieves and rapists and who was forced
to resign following the controversy over Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Today the two ministers meet almost routinely whenever they find
themselves at the same summits or conferences, a quiet but
remarkable change in relations.
</P>
<P>
   Greeks and Turks lived closely together for centuries during the
Ottoman period. Many Greeks have roots in Turkey, and many Turks
trace their ancestry to Greece and the Balkans. The two peoples are
also emotionally and psychologically similar, a fact that may have
set off last week's outpouring of Greek sympathy and aid for
Turkish earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish to understate the obstacles that still
divide Greece and Turkey, including their long bitter conflict over
the island of Cyprus. Nor is it reasonable to expect a sudden
breakthrough in relations between the two countries, which were at
the brink of war over a barren rock in the Aegean as recently as
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the style of their discourse has changed, and last week's
surge of Greek aid for Turkish earthquake victims suggests that the
people as well as their leaders may finally be ready for serious
efforts to overcome the destructive hostility that has divided them
for decades.

BOYS AND BODY IMAGE There is a kind of timelessness to a teenager's
battle with body image, but in most accounts the teenager is female
and the issue is anorexia or bulimia. Yet as any psychologist
knows, and as any sufficiently evolved adult male could tell you,
boys have body-image problems too. In fact, the cultural messages
about an ideal male body, if not new, have grown more aggressive,
more widespread and more explicit in recent years. By Stephen S.

THE PSYCHE OF THE BULLIED Antrim, N.H., is a long way away from
Littleton, Colorado, as well as Conyers, Ga., where a 15-year-old
boy shot six classmates at his high school in May. But what it
shares with those other places, and with countless others across
the United States, is a brutally enforced teenage social structure.
Most boys live through it, suffer, survive. But the journey may be

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Illegal immigrants burden school districts
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 25, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The torrent of boat people planning the trip to South
Florida's shores now keeps an anxious ear to the weather reports;
it is the time of year when hurricanes are prowling the Atlantic
and Caribbean. It should be presumed that the heavy flow of the
past few months will reduce to less than a trickle until season's
end in December, when it will pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there will be those who will attempt the journey _ often
engineered by professional smugglers _ and if there's something
more perilous than chancing the Straits of Florida in a small
vessel in decent weather, it's trying it while a hurricane or
tropical storm is bearing down.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rise of Fidel Castro, Florida has been haven for
hundreds of thousands of Cubans and Haitians fleeing awful
existences. Relatively few among them were verifiably enemies of
their states, at least not in a political-activist sense. Most came
for a job, a meal, a roof over their heads and an education for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   In near-border cities all along the southern tier of the U.S.,
Caribbean and Mexican illegal immigrants have impacted most on the
school systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, seeking relief from its overcrowded classrooms, the
Anaheim, Calif., School Board approved a resolution to bill the
originating countries of illegal immigrants for the immigrants'
education. The plan is to have the U.S. government pay the school
district, then reclaim the expenditure from the foreign government.
Can you imagine the Mexican government, or Castro, pulling out
checkbooks for this? The resolution has as much chance of advancing
as did Hillary Clinton's health blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, what that school board did in its frustration was
to reach out, haphazardly, for help. It was a message that illegal
immigration deluges are cutting deeply into the pockets of public
education. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates
that of the 3.9 million immigrants in the U.S., 2 million live in
California.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida cannot measure up to those numbers, it
nevertheless has been greatly impacted. Miami has become a Hispanic
city, the schools are teaching bilingually, the classrooms being
stuffed with immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles filed suit in federal court
for the state to be reimbursed approximately $1.5 billion, which,
the suit claims, was the sum of state and local funds spent on
health care and schooling for illegal immigrants. The suit failed
at every step up the line; in 1996 the U.S. Supreme Court refused
to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, what we have are two problems that need to be
dealt with. The first is the basic issue of illegal immigrants _
now termed in a political curtsy as ``undocumented aliens.'' Shall
America ever regain its borders? Is there a statute of limitations
on that Statue of Liberty inscription asking for ``your tired
masses''?
</P>
<P>
   That issue lands at the doorstep of the president of the United
States, who, on advice or whim, seemingly can change immigration
policy overnight. It began with Lyndon Johnson's Cuban Immigration
Act in 1965, and has fluctuated back and forth _ depending on what
squeaking wheel was the loudest _ through six presidents.
</P>
<P>
   I read an interesting story the other day in a 1945 issue of The
New York Times in which Greece, besieged by fleeing Jewish illegal
immigrants, subtracted their numbers from the approved quota of
Jews into Greece.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, we allow 20,000 Cubans a year to legally enter
the U.S. That's not a bad amount. But what would be the case if we
began subtracting from that quota, the numbers who came in
illegally? Answer: Castro couldn't care less, the Miami exile
community would go apoplectic and the non-Cubans in the community
would hold a party.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the borders are closed. In reality, the welcome mat
is out. Just touch U.S. territory _ swim ashore, hop the Rio
Grande, sneak over the fence _ and your kid can be in public school
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the second problem arises: funding education
for districts heavily impacted by immigrants; not only illegal
immigrants but by processed immigrants as well. I did not see the
Congress or the president, flush with all that excess money, make
any move to relieve the Anaheim school district voluntarily, or the
Miami district.
</P>
<P>
   The financial impact of immigrants on a school system can be
huge. When the federal government sets the policy by which the
immigrants are accepted into the U.S., it needs to carry its share
of financial responsibility.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Leave Bush's past private life alone
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, OK, we've got it: If George W. Bush hadn't used cocaine as a
young man he would say so, but he won't say so, so he did. Does
this matter?
</P>
<P>
   The reasons recited for it mattering are not meritless.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is running as the un-Clinton, a guy who will bring dignity,
morality and good posture back to the presidency, in the service of
which, and himself bringing his private life into play, he crows
about his marital fidelity. His dodge on cocaine _ and his weaselly
words _ make Bush seem more Clinton-like than not.
</P>
<P>
   (Bush thus joins the lengthening line of glass-house Republican
moralists throwing stones. The most delicious: fallen House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who apparently was slippin' around while trying to
impeach Bill Clinton for slippin' around. And Newt, unlike Clinton,
may even have Gone All the Way. The GOP is turning into an army
marching on clay feet.)
</P>
<P>
   Too, Bush has been hell on criminals, dopers especially, to the
point of demagoguery. There is at best a certain awkwardness in
firing up a wrathful law-and-order politics only after your own
statute of limitations has run out.
</P>
<P>
   No one would expect Bush to volunteer to do five-to-10 just for
makeup, but one of Bush's assets for the GOP has been his ability
to attract minority voters. It will not be lost on
African-Americans that, personifying a persistent pattern, here's
another rich white boy getting a bye on power coke while their kids
are imprisoned for half of forever for using crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even given all that, the case for caring about Bush's or
any other candidate's distant drug use is made up as much of
excuses for the prurience as of reasons for the information.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with dogging candidates' every old moral misstep
threatens to reduce the draw for political leadership to a
righteous little huddle of prigs who don't have a clue about how
the rest of us live.
</P>
<P>
   These moral shakedowns are said to be in the service of
determining a candidate's character, but ``character'' deserves a
broader assay than adding up Sunday school demerits.
</P>
<P>
   Is President Clinton's character, for the purposes of
governance, defined just by l'affaire Monica or does his rare
political willingness to stand up to the National Rifle Association
count into the balance?
</P>
<P>
   No, we don't want to turn politics over to those awful hedonists
against whom _ o, irony _ Gingrich has been warning us. But voters
have far more poise about private conduct than do the journalistic
inquisitors torturing politicians titularly on the electorate's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Most shrugged off admissions by Al Gore and _ here he is again!
_ Gingrich that they'd smoked a little Mexican laughing tobacco way
back when. Clinton's sexual incontinence struck most, on unpleasant
balance, as preferable to his tormentors' righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   Something like half of us have done dope. Few went to the
nuptial couch virgins. We need to be more wise about, than wise to,
each other.

   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush is appealingly self-confident.
Or is he arrogant? He is engaging and fun loving. Or is he
immature? He is, refreshingly, an ordinary guy who has not plotted
his whole life to end up in the White House. Or is he too cavalier
about the office? He is decisive and sees the big picture. Or is he
shallow, impulsive and impatient, not willing to sweat the
nitty-gritty of policy?
</P>
<P>
   Months after the Republican establishment placed its bets for
the party's presidential nomination with the governor of Texas, a
reappraisal is under way, fueled by a restless press corps, as well
as by Bush's opponents, freshly determined after his first-place
finish in a straw poll in Iowa a week ago to slow his seemingly
effortless march to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The reassessment was inevitable. Bush catapulted to prominence
so fast (``godlike status,'' in the words of an opposing, and
perhaps envious, strategist) that few people in political circles,
let alone voters, have had a chance to get to know him. But after
the straw poll, Bush is no longer viewed as simply the front-runner
for the Republican nomination. He is viewed as a person who could
be the next president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Bush's personal qualities _ to say nothing of
the press fracas last week over whether he had used illegal drugs
in the past _ are not born merely out of gossip or base curiosity
about what the candidate is like deep down or how he behaved as a
young man. A fundamental challenge of presidential candidates _ one
facing Bush now _ is to convince the public that they have the
temperament and maturity to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   No one's personality can fairly be described in black and white.
Reality is always more shaded. Yes, Bush is self-confident. And
yes, he is probably a touch smug. But the angling has already begun
over who can first define Bush's character for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush comes across as if he's just amused at the whole process,
laughing out loud at it,'' said Brian Kennedy, the chief strategist
for Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, who quit the
race last week. ``He has yet to present a presidential persona.''
(Alexander did have such a persona, but that did not seem to be
enough.)
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a former executive director of the Republican Governors
Association, recalled, ``I first observed it at meetings when other
governors would sit in their chairs and listen to the discussions
about policy. He just had no interest in doing that. He would get
up and slap people on the back, joke around and stay for as little
time as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush, 53, conducts himself in ways that are appealing to
some and off-putting to others. He is forever mugging for the
cameras, winking at reporters from the lectern and entertaining
people with his impression of Dr. Evil, the campy villain from
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' In his spontaneity, he
sometimes borders on the inappropriate, as when he bounded up to a
graying reporter, smiling, and blurted, ``It's the reporter from
the AARP!''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Bush seems as bemused as anyone that only five years
ago he had never been elected to anything and now he is the man to
beat. But clearly, he seems certain that he will win. During a
visit to California last month, he described it as ``my first trip
as president of the United States.'' He corrected himself, saying,
``Soon to be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be an air of overconfidence in Bush, which may be a
reflection of his early dominance in the race. While his opponents
toiled in Iowa for weeks or months, if not years, before the straw
poll, Bush went on vacation. Unlike his opponents, Bush has not had
to beg for donations _ the checks pour in.
</P>
<P>
   On issues, Bush has given his detractors reason for pause. He
has defended his lack of preparedness in foreign policy experience
by saying he would turn to the best experts for help. His advisers
say he is a quick study who is diligent about learning the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents are ardently trying to fill in the blanks in
the most negative way possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swagger has to be reduced to a stride, and the air of
arrogance diminished to an air of confidence,'' said William Dal
Col, the campaign manager for Steve Forbes, who finished second in
the Iowa straw poll. ``And if they're unable to do that, it could
have a fatal effect on his candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   (Forbes, who has never been elected to anything, is trying so
hard to appear presidential that he has filmed commercials in an
Oval Office-like setting.)
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Quayle accused Bush of having many of the faults that
she says were unfairly attributed to her husband, former Vice
President Dan Quayle. She told The Arizona Republic recently that
her husband's rival was ``the party frat-boy type.'' She also said
Bush was ``the guy that never accomplished anything, everything he
got Daddy took care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the
Democratic Party, said that if Bush is the nominee, he would look
weak and unprepared compared with Vice President Al Gore or former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take this presidency very seriously,'' Romer said.
``There's a flippancy that shows in his demeanor. Maybe it's part
of having the Bush name. Maybe he feels anointed and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions about Bush's disposition intensified after an
article in the new magazine Talk. The writer Tucker Carlson quoted
the governor using curse words, boasting that ``I'm not interested
in process,'' and making fun of Karla Faye Tucker, a double
murderer who was executed in Texas last year. Mimicking the woman
when she was asked on television what she would say to Bush if she
could appeal to him for clemency, Carlson wrote, Bush ``whimpers,
his lips pursed in mock desperation: `Please don't kill me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his comments were misinterpreted. ``I didn't do the
interview for Talk,'' he said, portraying Carlson as ``somebody
coming to get a flavor of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Bauer, a favorite among religious conservatives, who is
also seeking the Republican nomination, said the governor's
comments in the magazine were ``inappropriate, disgusting and
profoundly disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The article prompted George F. Will, the conservative columnist,
to write that Bush was operating in ``an atmosphere of adolescence,
a lack of gravitas _ a carelessness, even a recklessness, perhaps
born of things having gone a bit too easily so far.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last week reporters were consumed with questioning Bush about
rumors that have lingered for years that he used illegal drugs as a
young man, and his careful responses only seemed to escalate the
issue. The Washington Post even called the question Bush's first
crisis. But how relevant will it seem in five months, when voting
in the primaries begins? No evidence has been presented to support
the rumors. Nor have they dissuaded Texans from electing him
governor twice.
</P>
<P>
   This year, his rivals haven't made it an issue. If anything, how
Bush handles the questions now _ like Clinton and his admission
during the 1992 campaign that he tried marijuana in college _ may
impress voters more than what he did or may have done in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton, dismissed some of the
scathing judgments of Bush as alarmist, yet inescapable. ``If he
didn't have any of these slight angularities,'' he said, ``then the
question would be: Is he bland and soapy?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what his detractors do not seem to like about Bush is
what makes him likable to others.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bill Clinton or Al Gore, for example, Bush has not
plotted his life to make it to the Oval Office, a fact that makes
him more down-to-earth and less desperate. He is not embarrassed to
say when he does not know something. And while his father, former
President Bush, may have appeared more presidential, he was forever
denounced for not knowing how to connect.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Bush is trying to come off as less the frat
boy and more the commander in chief. During an interview recently,
he referred to his best friend and finance chairman, Donald Evans,
as Donny. Then he quickly instructed a reporter to revise it to a
more grown-up sounding Don.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say he also intends to roll out a series of
policy speeches in the fall _ just as Bill Clinton did, when he was
trying to get people to take him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the criticism, Evans, the governor's close friend,
said, is that ``we're the front-runner, we're winning, we're
leading, so people are trying to concoct anything they can. It's a
total misrepresentation of the friend I've known for 25 years and
my wife's known for 50 years. They don't understand the heart and
soul and mind of this guy like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   But often the governor cannot help himself. At an event in
Texas, he was horsing around with someone for a photograph and
pointed to the man next to him and said, ``He's the ugly one!''
Then, spotting a reporter looking on, he quickly explained that
they were old buddies who always teased each other.
</P>
<P>
   The governor can take solace in the fact that in 1960 Richard M.
Nixon questioned whether John F. Kennedy was mature enough, and
steeped enough in the issues, to be president. But that future
president happily seized on his youthfulness as an asset. He was
only 43.

A BACK-DOOR VIEW OF AIRLINE SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right after ``What does it cost?'' the question
that almost every traveler planning a trip on a foreign airline
asks is ``Is it safe?'' The average ticket buyer can't get an
answer, and even if the Federal Aviation Administration knows, it
is barred by treaty from saying.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all about to change. An agreement between the
airlines and the Pentagon will take advantage of the industry's
growing use of code-sharing _ agreements enabling carriers to sell
tickets on one another's flights. The airlines will report to the
Defense Department on the operations of their code-share partners.
The result will make commercial interests, not governments, the
driving force behind safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Code-sharing has given airlines a larger stake in one another's
safety. When a Swissair MD-11 crashed off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
Sept. 2 last year, killing all 229 people aboard, Delta found that
it, not Swissair, was responsible for about two dozen passengers,
because it had sold them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April a Korean Air Lines cargo plane crashed in China,
killing five. It was KAL's sixth accident in 48 months, and Delta,
its U.S. code-share partner, ended the 4-year-old relationship. The
Defense Department reacted by putting KAL on its ``non-use'' list a
few days later, and halting the purchase of tickets from that
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Defense Department, which buys 200,000 tickets
yearly on foreign airlines, took the process a giant step forward.
It has been looking for ways to judge the safety of all carriers
since 1985, when a chartered plane, an Arrow DC-8 carrying 248
members of the 101st Airborne Division, crashed at Gander Airport
in Newfoundland, and Congress ordered the department to review its
charter operators.
</P>
<P>
   This month it signed an agreement with the six U.S. airlines
that maintain extensive foreign code shares: The airlines promised
to review their foreign partners using a single set of standards
and report back.
</P>
<P>
   When carried out, the compilation, experts say, will be the
first in-depth, systematic evaluation of the performance of foreign
airlines available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The six U.S. airlines _ American, Continental, Delta, Northwest,
Trans World and United _ have 160 code-share agreements among them,
representing the great majority of the world's airlines. Some have
already conducted evaluations, though not uniformly or rigorously;
now they will all apply the same yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The set of standards is a book 3 or 4 inches thick,'' said
Mary Lou McHugh, assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for
transportation policy, and uniformly applying those standards,
derived from FAA rules, ``has impact for travelers worldwide.'' The
six carriers will review crew training, cockpit procedures,
maintenance systems, procedures for calculating a plane's weight
and fuel requirements, among dozens of other areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Transportation Department, which oversees the
FAA, will decide in the next few weeks whether to order the U.S.
carriers to do rigorous audits on the foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, American supervision of those carriers that fly to
the United States is minimal. After another KAL plane, a Boeing
747, crashed on approach to Guam in August 1997, FAA inspectors
testified at an investigative hearing that they do not check
foreign planes except for occasional visits to those visiting U.S.
airports to see if pilots have their licenses with them and if the
airplanes have U.S.-required gear like aisle lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Department rule could require the six U.S. carriers to turn
over their audit results, which would make them government property
and subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system will result in a kind of extraterritoriality
for U.S. flight safety rules, extending the FAA's reach to carriers
over which it has little or no control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the International Air Transport Association, David O'Connor,
the trade group's regional director for the United States, said
that the idea of code-share partners auditing one another was long
established, but that public release of such information was not.
O'Connor's group was trying to establish an audit system that
airlines would have to apply to join his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers worldwide will reap the benefits. When the Defense
Department places a foreign carrier in ``non-use,'' it notifies the
State Department, which includes the information in its Consular
Information Sheets. Travelers can get them on the Web at
http://travel.state.gov/travel_warnings.html or by automated fax,
at (202) 647-3000 or by telephone at (202) 647-5225. They can also
get it directly from the Pentagon at (703) 697-2788.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. airlines say they are confident of their ability to
advise and evaluate. Clayton Foushee, vice president of flight
operations at Northwest Airlines, compared his company's
inspections of its code-share partners to large-scale ``white
glove'' inspections that the FAA occasionally conducts on U.S.
carriers. Northwest is a partner with KLM, Alitalia and Air China,
which is a mainland Chinese carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we can do as one commercial entity to another
commercial entity,'' said Capt. Edmond Soliday, vice president for
safety at United. Advice from a fellow airline can be as useful as
a government regulation, he said, because ``You can't punish your
way into safety.'' His airline code-shares with Lufthansa, SAS,
Thai, Varig, Air New Zealand and All Nippon Airways.
</P>
<P>
   But safety improvements, Soliday said, will continue only as
long as the foreign airline wants them to. ``I can audit till I
turn blue, and I can't guarantee there will be no crashes,'' he
said.

impress voters more than what he did or may have done in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton, dismissed some of the
scathing judgments of Bush as alarmist, yet inescapable. ``If he
didn't have any of these slight angularities,'' he said, ``then the
question would be: Is he bland and soapy?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what his detractors do not seem to like about Bush is
what makes him likable to others.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bill Clinton or Al Gore, for example, Bush has not
plotted his life to make it to the Oval Office, a fact that makes
him more down-to-earth and less desperate. He is not embarrassed to
say when he does not know something. And while his father, former
President Bush, may have appeared more presidential, he was forever
denounced for not knowing how to connect.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Bush is trying to come off as less the frat
boy and more the commander in chief. During an interview recently,
he referred to his best friend and finance chairman, Donald Evans,
as Donny. Then he quickly instructed a reporter to revise it to a
more grown-up sounding Don.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say he also intends to roll out a series of
policy speeches in the fall _ just as Bill Clinton did, when he was
trying to get people to take him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the criticism, Evans, the governor's close friend,
said, is that ``we're the front-runner, we're winning, we're
leading, so people are trying to concoct anything they can. It's a
total misrepresentation of the friend I've known for 25 years and
my wife's known for 50 years. They don't understand the heart and
soul and mind of this guy like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   But often the governor cannot help himself. At an event in
Texas, he was horsing around with someone for a photograph and
pointed to the man next to him and said, ``He's the ugly one!''
Then, spotting a reporter looking on, he quickly explained that
they were old buddies who always teased each other.
</P>
<P>
   The governor can take solace in the fact that in 1960 Richard M.
Nixon questioned whether John F. Kennedy was mature enough, and
steeped enough in the issues, to be president. But that future
president happily seized on his youthfulness as an asset. He was
only 43.

A BACK-DOOR VIEW OF AIRLINE SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right after ``What does it cost?'' the question
that almost every traveler planning a trip on a foreign airline
asks is ``Is it safe?'' The average ticket buyer can't get an
answer, and even if the Federal Aviation Administration knows, it
is barred by treaty from saying.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all about to change. An agreement between the
airlines and the Pentagon will take advantage of the industry's
growing use of code-sharing _ agreements enabling carriers to sell
tickets on one another's flights. The airlines will report to the
Defense Department on the operations of their code-share partners.
The result will make commercial interests, not governments, the
driving force behind safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Code-sharing has given airlines a larger stake in one another's
safety. When a Swissair MD-11 crashed off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
Sept. 2 last year, killing all 229 people aboard, Delta found that
it, not Swissair, was responsible for about two dozen passengers,
because it had sold them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April a Korean Air Lines cargo plane crashed in China,
killing five. It was KAL's sixth accident in 48 months, and Delta,
its U.S. code-share partner, ended the 4-year-old relationship. The
Defense Department reacted by putting KAL on its ``non-use'' list a
few days later, and halting the purchase of tickets from that
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Defense Department, which buys 200,000 tickets
yearly on foreign airlines, took the process a giant step forward.
It has been looking for ways to judge the safety of all carriers
since 1985, when a chartered plane, an Arrow DC-8 carrying 248
members of the 101st Airborne Division, crashed at Gander Airport
in Newfoundland, and Congress ordered the department to review its
charter operators.
</P>
<P>
   This month it signed an agreement with the six U.S. airlines
that maintain extensive foreign code shares: The airlines promised
to review their foreign partners using a single set of standards
and report back.
</P>
<P>
   When carried out, the compilation, experts say, will be the
first in-depth, systematic evaluation of the performance of foreign
airlines available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The six U.S. airlines _ American, Continental, Delta, Northwest,
Trans World and United _ have 160 code-share agreements among them,
representing the great majority of the world's airlines. Some have
already conducted evaluations, though not uniformly or rigorously;
now they will all apply the same yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The set of standards is a book 3 or 4 inches thick,'' said
Mary Lou McHugh, assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for
transportation policy, and uniformly applying those standards,
derived from FAA rules, ``has impact for travelers worldwide.'' The
six carriers will review crew training, cockpit procedures,
maintenance systems, procedures for calculating a plane's weight
and fuel requirements, among dozens of other areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Transportation Department, which oversees the
FAA, will decide in the next few weeks whether to order the U.S.
carriers to do rigorous audits on the foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, American supervision of those carriers that fly to
the United States is minimal. After another KAL plane, a Boeing
747, crashed on approach to Guam in August 1997, FAA inspectors
testified at an investigative hearing that they do not check
foreign planes except for occasional visits to those visiting U.S.
airports to see if pilots have their licenses with them and if the
airplanes have U.S.-required gear like aisle lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Department rule could require the six U.S. carriers to turn
over their audit results, which would make them government property
and subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system will result in a kind of extraterritoriality
for U.S. flight safety rules, extending the FAA's reach to carriers
over which it has little or no control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the International Air Transport Association, David O'Connor,
the trade group's regional director for the United States, said
that the idea of code-share partners auditing one another was long
established, but that public release of such information was not.
O'Connor's group was trying to establish an audit system that
airlines would have to apply to join his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers worldwide will reap the benefits. When the Defense
Department places a foreign carrier in ``non-use,'' it notifies the
State Department, which includes the information in its Consular
Information Sheets. Travelers can get them on the Web at
http://travel.state.gov/travel_warnings.html or by automated fax,
at (202) 647-3000 or by telephone at (202) 647-5225. They can also
get it directly from the Pentagon at (703) 697-2788.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. airlines say they are confident of their ability to
advise and evaluate. Clayton Foushee, vice president of flight
operations at Northwest Airlines, compared his company's
inspections of its code-share partners to large-scale ``white
glove'' inspections that the FAA occasionally conducts on U.S.
carriers. Northwest is a partner with KLM, Alitalia and Air China,
which is a mainland Chinese carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we can do as one commercial entity to another
commercial entity,'' said Capt. Edmond Soliday, vice president for
safety at United. Advice from a fellow airline can be as useful as
a government regulation, he said, because ``You can't punish your
way into safety.'' His airline code-shares with Lufthansa, SAS,
Thai, Varig, Air New Zealand and All Nippon Airways.
</P>
<P>
   But safety improvements, Soliday said, will continue only as
long as the foreign airline wants them to. ``I can audit till I
turn blue, and I can't guarantee there will be no crashes,'' he
said.

<P>
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in
1976, 566 people have been executed. In that same period, 82
convicts awaiting execution have been exonerated _ a ratio of one
freed for every seven put to death.
</P>
<P>
   About half of them were exonerated in the 1990s, six so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases convictions were overturned when newly available
testimony or physical evidence, including DNA testing, cast doubt
on the guilt of the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment is on the books in 38 states, but 36 of them
impose a deadline on evidence presented after conviction.
Virginia's statute of limitations is only 21 days. In 1994 DNA
testing arrived too late to free Earl Washington Jr., whose
sentence was subsequently commuted to life in prison. David
Botkins, the spokesman for Virginia's attorney general, Mark
Earley, says, ``The inmates who have been granted clemency and had
their death sentences commuted show the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, one of the two states without a statute of
limitations (the other is New York), one inmate has been exonerated
for every inmate executed over the last 12 years. Earlier this
month Illinois passed the Capital Crimes Litigation Act, which
increases state funding for defense lawyers, prosecutors and
court-appointed counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In general, executions have been delayed by appeals. About 11
years elapse between conviction and execution, according to the
Justice Department. Last week a conference organized by the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals met outside Atlanta to discuss how to
expedite capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong people have landed on death row for a number of
reasons. Some lawyers are ineffective, or outright incompetent.
Others meet with their clients only hours before going to court.
Prosecutorial missteps, from jury selection to misconduct, have
also been factors. Judges, too, make mistakes, incorrectly ruling
on cases or improperly defining guilt or innocence. When judicial
errors occur, an inmate can be granted a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many death row cases attract the attention of lawyers who
volunteer their time to dig up evidence and witnesses. Barry
Scheck, a lawyer who is a DNA expert, helped found the Innocence
Project at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York
City, which has so far helped free several inmates. Students guided
by David Protess, a journalism professor at Northwestern
University, have also uncovered evidence leading to the exoneration
of death row inmates in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Since capital punishment was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1976, 566 convicts have been executed. Eighty-two awaiting
execution have been exonerated, about half of them during this
decade. What follows are capsule accounts of death row's living
alumni of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ERRORS IN COURT
</P>
<P>
   James Albert Robison
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1977
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The contract murder of Don Bolles, a newspaper reporter
who covered organized crime in Arizona. Prosecutors charged that
Robison and another man, John Harvey Adamson, were hired by Max
Dunlap, a land developer, who was also convicted. Adamson was given
a 20-year sentence in exchange for testifying against Robison. But
the state overturned the conviction in 1980 after finding that
defense lawyers had been improperly denied the right to
cross-examine Adamson. Robison was re-indicted for the Bolles
murder. In the 1993 trial, he was acquitted of murdering Bolles,
but later convicted of conspiring to kill Adamson. He is now in the
witness protection program in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Croy
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1979
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The shooting death of a policeman in California. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction because of improper
jury instructions made by the judge in his case. Croy was retried
and acquitted after arguing self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Carolyn Grayson in California in 1981. At
his original trial, Jones' defense lawyer failed to speak with
possible witnesses, obtain a police report or conduct a pretrial
investigation. The state Supreme Court said the Jones case merited
a new trial, and the prosecution dropped all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Miranda
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of Manuel Rodriguez Torres in Nevada
in 1981. Miranda, a Cuban, was offered a much milder sentence in
exchange for a guilty plea, but refused it, insisting on his
innocence and claiming that a man he knew had framed him. At trial
he was represented by a lawyer with less than one year of
experience. Overturning the conviction, the judge wrote that the
lack of pretrial preparation by trial counsel ... cannot be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman during a robbery in Indiana. A
companion, who claimed to be the getaway driver, testified against
Smith in exchange for the dropping of all charges against him. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction, citing ineffective
counsel. Later evidence contradicted the companion's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Johnston
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering his stepdaughter and her boyfriend in Ohio,
allegedly to keep them from blackmailing him with accusations of
incest. The court of appeals later ruled that statements by
Johnston used in the first trial could not be introduced at a
retrial because they were taken while he was under hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Federico Martinez Macias
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of a man during a burglary in Texas in 1983.
Macias' co-worker, who received immunity for testifying, said he
drove him to the crime scene the night of the murder; a prison
informant also said he heard Macias confess. In 1988, pro bono
lawyers revealed evidence of inadequate trial counsel: Two alibi
witnesses had never been called to testify, an eyewitness had not
been cross-examined and a 9-year-old girl's testimony proved to be
false.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Harris
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Jimmy Lee Turner, an auto mechanic in
Washington state. Harris' lawyer consulted with him less than two
hours and interviewed only three of 32 potential witnesses. After
two unsuccessful appeals, Harris' conviction was overturned in 1994
because of inadequate counsel. The prosecution declined to retry
Harris, instead saying that he was mentally ill and requesting that
he be committed to a state hospital. On the condition that he
pursue treatment, he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wilhoit
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1987
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing his estranged wife in her sleep in Oklahoma. An
expert testified that Wilhoit's teeth matched bite marks on the
body. The state appeals court later said that Wilhoit's counsel had
failed to challenge that testimony, and was ``suffering from
alcohol dependence and abuse and brain damage during his
representation of appellant.'' At trial in 1993, after 11 experts
testified that the bite marks did not match, Wilhoit was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lawson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing 8-year-old Terrence Jones during a family dispute
in Illinois. Although Lawson was found guilty, the defense lawyer
assigned to him was later found to have been an assistant
prosecutor at the time of his arrest. Another trial resulted in a
hung jury; finally, Lawson was acquitted in 1996 and set free.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Dexter
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering his wife in Missouri in 1991. Dexter's
conviction was overturned in 1998 because his defense had failed to
investigate any of the evidence, much of which pointed to a botched
robbery. Blood left at the scene did not match Dexter's.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Cousin
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of MuAlfred Michael Gerardi during an armed
robbery in Louisiana. Cousin, who was 16, said he was at a
basketball game, and his coach testified that he was at the game.
But his court-appointed lawyer advised him to plead guilty to four
unrelated counts of armed robbery to gain the jury's sympathy.
Cousin was convicted of first-degree murder and the four robberies.
The state Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction because of
improper evidence, but he is still imprisoned for the other
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEMS WITH TESTIMONY
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Brandley
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1981
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in a Texas high
school. Hair left at the crime scene implicated a white man, not
Brandley, the only black custodian at the school. One of the two
chief witnesses recanted his statements in a 1986 appeal hearing,
saying the prosecution and the police had pressured him into
implicating Brandley; the other witness confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Aldape Guerra
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing a police officer in Houston. After the state
appeals were exhausted, the case went to a U.S. district judge, who
decided that the police and prosecutors had railroaded Guerra, a
Mexican, onto death row.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Porter
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: A double murder in Chicago witnessed by several people.
His lawyer lost several appeals, but two days before his execution
date last fall, Porter was granted a stay because of his limited
mental capacity. When a journalism professor at Northwestern
University, David Protess, assigned his students to investigate the
case, several witnesses recanted and another man confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Muneer Deeb
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Planning a 1982 triple murder in Texas carried out by
three gunmen, who were later convicted. Deeb's conviction was
reversed in 1991 because testimony had been improperly admitted
from an inmate who said he heard Deeb confess while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Charles Cruz
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1981
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Ordering the contract killing of two people in Arizona.
Although physical evidence was scant, Cruz was convicted mainly on
the testimony of a participant in the killings who was granted
immunity for his testimony. At the last trial, the jury foreman
said, We all came to the conclusion that the state's main witness
was an unreliable witness, a proven liar.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of a jail warden, Virdeen Willis Jr., outside
a Chicago tavern. Smith, whose criminal record already included two
convictions for murder in 1964 and 1969, was convicted with the
testimony of one eyewitness, who was later found to be closely tied
to another suspect in the case. The state Supreme Court vacated
Smith's conviction and barred prosecutors from trying him again.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McMillian
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing an 18-year-old woman, Ronda Morrison, during a
robbery in Alabama. He was arrested with another man, Ralph Myers,
who agreed to testify against him in exchange for leniency.
McMillian was placed in a death row cell before his trial even
began. The judge overruled the jury's recommendation of life in
prison and sentenced McMillian to die. An investigation by a lawyer
revealed suppression of exculpatory information and perjury by all
of the prosecution's witnesses, who later recanted their testimony.

   Joseph Burrows
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of William Dulan, an 88-year-old man, in
Illinois. Although no physical evidence implicated Burrows, two
witnesses testified against him. One later recanted to a newspaper,
claiming coercion by prosecutors and the police. The other witness
confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gauger
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of his parents in Illinois. At his arrest
Gauger was interrogated for more than 16 hours without a lawyer.
Asked to describe how he might have committed the murders, Gauger
complied; his answer was construed as a confession. The same judge
who sentenced him to death later overturned the conviction, finding
little evidence to arrest Gauger in the first place. Last year, a
gang member, on trial for several unrelated crimes, confessed to
murdering Gauger's parents, with an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS OF EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1980
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a 6-year-old girl in Georgia. The
prosecution presented an 8-year-old eyewitness and hair and semen
samples. A volunteer group of lawyers later uncovered large amounts
of suppressed evidence, including FBI tests showing that the
samples belonged to a white man. (Nelson is black.)
</P>
<P>
   John C. Skelton
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing a former employee, Joe Neal, in Texas by rigging
his pickup truck with dynamite. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
said the prosecution had failed to link Skelton to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Lee Kyles
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Dolores Dye during a car theft in
Louisiana. The U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned Kyles'
conviction, ruled that the prosecution had withheld material
evidence regarding a paid informant who said Kyles, an
acquaintance, was the murderer. The informant had previously been
suspected of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Adolph Munson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The kidnapping and murder of a store clerk in Oklahoma
while Munson was on work release after serving time for a 1964
murder. After nine years of appeals and an investigative report by
the American Bar Association, the state's highest criminal appeals
court overturned his conviction, finding that Oklahoma prosecutors
had suppressed evidence that supported Munson's innocence,
including the testimony of eyewitnesses who claimed the murderer
was white. (Munson is black.) He was acquitted in retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Jay C. Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1986
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1979 murder of a teacher and her two children in
Pennsylvania; the prosecution charged that Smith, a principal,
acted with the victim's fiance, who was later sentenced to three
life terms. In 1989, the conviction was reversed because of hearsay
evidence and because the prosecution was found to have suppressed
evidence that strongly implicated the fiance as the lone murderer.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court wrote that the prosecution had
violated all principles of justice and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley P. Scott
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman friend in 1978 in Florida. The document
stating his whereabouts at the time of the crime had been
misplaced; the police claimed to have an eyewitness who placed
Scott at the crime scene. The Florida Supreme Court later ruled the
evidence to be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Butler
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing her 9-month-old son, Walter, in Mississippi.
Butler said the baby stopped breathing and she tried to resuscitate
him before taking him to a hospital. She was later acquitted when a
neighbor, who did not testify at the original trial, substantiated
her story. Tests on the child's exhumed body pointed to kidney
disease as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Golden
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Drowning his wife in Florida. Though the death was
initially ruled accidental, Golden was later tried and found
guilty. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court said the state failed
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs. Golden's death
resulted from the criminal agency of another person rather than by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Padgett
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of his estranged wife in Alabama. His
conviction was based almost entirely on blood samples left at the
scene, which were tested for DNA. It was later discovered that the
FBI crime lab had determined that the blood was not Padgett's, but
Alabama prosecutors had suppressed that fact. Padgett was acquitted
at a retrial.

   Alejandro Hernandez
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1983 rape and murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico
in Illinois. The men, who knew one another, were jointly tried,
convicted and sentenced to death. They won a new trial after the
state Supreme Court ruled that they should have been tried
separately. After the second trial they were convicted again, with
Hernandez getting 80 years. DNA tests in 1994 implicated a
convicted sex offender, Brian Dugan, who, during a plea bargain,
confessed to six murders, including Jeanine Nicarico's.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Bloodsworth
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1984 rape and murder of 9-year-old girl in Maryland.
Bloodsworth resembled the composite sketch of the suspect; police
said he gave information about the crime. The first conviction was
reversed because the prosecution withheld psychiatric evidence, but
he was convicted again in 1986, all the while pleading his
innocence. ``If I'm dead, that's it,'' he told the judge at that
time. ``You can't bring me back.'' In 1993 DNA from the scene was
found not to match Bloodsworth's.

<P>

<P>
   Dennis Williams
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1979
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1978 abduction, torture and murder of a couple in a
suburb of Chicago. The case against them and two others relied
heavily on eyewitness testimony by one witness, Paula Gray, who
changed her testimony several times, at one point admitting that
she had implicated all four men in exchange for leniency in a
different case against her. DNA samples failed to match the four
men but implicated another man who later confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Williamson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Raping, strangling and mutilating a 21-year-old waitress,
Debra Sue Carter, in Oklahoma in 1982. The conviction was based
largely on strands of hair left at the crime scene and the
testimony of a witness, Glenn Gore. In 1997, DNA samples from semen
found at the crime scene were tested and found to match Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lee Miller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and asphyxiation of two women, Anne Laura
Fowler, 83, and Zelma Cutler, 92, in Oklahoma in 1988. A judge
dismissed the case after 10 years, saying the evidence was
insufficient. DNA in a semen sample did not match Miller's DNA, but
did match that of an already-convicted rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Charges dropped: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1985 rape and murder of Debra Smith in Illinois.
Jones signed a confession that stated that Ms. Smith had agreed to
have sex with him for $10, then attacked him with a knife when he
refused to pay her and was killed in the struggle. In the first
trial, it was shown that Ms. Smith had no history of prostitution;
Jones later said the police had beaten him. But it was not until
1997 that DNA tests used on the semen sample recovered at the crime
scene proved that Jones was the wrong man. The charges against him,
however, weren't dropped until May 1999 after prosecutors decided
against a new trial. He remains in jail on unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hayes
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a co-worker in Florida. Hayes was
convicted largely from DNA evidence that was taken from hair found
in the victim's hands. In 1995, the Florida Supreme Court
overturned Hayes' conviction when it was revealed that the hair was
from a white man; Hayes is black.

<P>
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in
1976, 566 people have been executed. In that same period, 82
convicts awaiting execution have been exonerated _ a ratio of one
freed for every seven put to death.
</P>
<P>
   About half of them were exonerated in the 1990s, six so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases convictions were overturned when newly available
testimony or physical evidence, including DNA testing, cast doubt
on the guilt of the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment is on the books in 38 states, but 36 of them
impose a deadline on evidence presented after conviction.
Virginia's statute of limitations is only 21 days. In 1994 DNA
testing arrived too late to free Earl Washington Jr., whose
sentence was subsequently commuted to life in prison. David
Botkins, the spokesman for Virginia's attorney general, Mark
Earley, says, ``The inmates who have been granted clemency and had
their death sentences commuted show the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, one of the two states without a statute of
limitations (the other is New York), one inmate has been exonerated
for every inmate executed over the last 12 years. Earlier this
month Illinois passed the Capital Crimes Litigation Act, which
increases state funding for defense lawyers, prosecutors and
court-appointed counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In general, executions have been delayed by appeals. About 11
years elapse between conviction and execution, according to the
Justice Department. Last week a conference organized by the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals met outside Atlanta to discuss how to
expedite capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong people have landed on death row for a number of
reasons. Some lawyers are ineffective, or outright incompetent.
Others meet with their clients only hours before going to court.
Prosecutorial missteps, from jury selection to misconduct, have
also been factors. Judges, too, make mistakes, incorrectly ruling
on cases or improperly defining guilt or innocence. When judicial
errors occur, an inmate can be granted a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many death row cases attract the attention of lawyers who
volunteer their time to dig up evidence and witnesses. Barry
Scheck, a lawyer who is a DNA expert, helped found the Innocence
Project at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York
City, which has so far helped free several inmates. Students guided
by David Protess, a journalism professor at Northwestern
University, have also uncovered evidence leading to the exoneration
of death row inmates in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Since capital punishment was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1976, 566 convicts have been executed. Eighty-two awaiting
execution have been exonerated, about half of them during this
decade. What follows are capsule accounts of death row's living
alumni of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ERRORS IN COURT
</P>
<P>
   James Albert Robison
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1977
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The contract murder of Don Bolles, a newspaper reporter
who covered organized crime in Arizona. Prosecutors charged that
Robison and another man, John Harvey Adamson, were hired by Max
Dunlap, a land developer, who was also convicted. Adamson was given
a 20-year sentence in exchange for testifying against Robison. But
the state overturned the conviction in 1980 after finding that
defense lawyers had been improperly denied the right to
cross-examine Adamson. Robison was re-indicted for the Bolles
murder. In the 1993 trial, he was acquitted of murdering Bolles,
but later convicted of conspiring to kill Adamson. He is now in the
witness protection program in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Croy
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1979
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The shooting death of a policeman in California. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction because of improper
jury instructions made by the judge in his case. Croy was retried
and acquitted after arguing self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Carolyn Grayson in California in 1981. At
his original trial, Jones' defense lawyer failed to speak with
possible witnesses, obtain a police report or conduct a pretrial
investigation. The state Supreme Court said the Jones case merited
a new trial, and the prosecution dropped all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Miranda
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of Manuel Rodriguez Torres in Nevada
in 1981. Miranda, a Cuban, was offered a much milder sentence in
exchange for a guilty plea, but refused it, insisting on his
innocence and claiming that a man he knew had framed him. At trial
he was represented by a lawyer with less than one year of
experience. Overturning the conviction, the judge wrote that the
lack of pretrial preparation by trial counsel ... cannot be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman during a robbery in Indiana. A
companion, who claimed to be the getaway driver, testified against
Smith in exchange for the dropping of all charges against him. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction, citing ineffective
counsel. Later evidence contradicted the companion's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Johnston
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering his stepdaughter and her boyfriend in Ohio,
allegedly to keep them from blackmailing him with accusations of
incest. The court of appeals later ruled that statements by
Johnston used in the first trial could not be introduced at a
retrial because they were taken while he was under hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
BC-R-DEATH-ROW-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: under hypnosis. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Federico Martinez Macias
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of a man during a burglary in Texas in 1983.
Macias' co-worker, who received immunity for testifying, said he
drove him to the crime scene the night of the murder; a prison
informant also said he heard Macias confess. In 1988, pro bono
lawyers revealed evidence of inadequate trial counsel: Two alibi
witnesses had never been called to testify, an eyewitness had not
been cross-examined and a 9-year-old girl's testimony proved to be
false.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Harris
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Jimmy Lee Turner, an auto mechanic in
Washington state. Harris' lawyer consulted with him less than two
hours and interviewed only three of 32 potential witnesses. After
two unsuccessful appeals, Harris' conviction was overturned in 1994
because of inadequate counsel. The prosecution declined to retry
Harris, instead saying that he was mentally ill and requesting that
he be committed to a state hospital. On the condition that he
pursue treatment, he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wilhoit
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1987
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing his estranged wife in her sleep in Oklahoma. An
expert testified that Wilhoit's teeth matched bite marks on the
body. The state appeals court later said that Wilhoit's counsel had
failed to challenge that testimony, and was ``suffering from
alcohol dependence and abuse and brain damage during his
representation of appellant.'' At trial in 1993, after 11 experts
testified that the bite marks did not match, Wilhoit was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lawson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing 8-year-old Terrence Jones during a family dispute
in Illinois. Although Lawson was found guilty, the defense lawyer
assigned to him was later found to have been an assistant
prosecutor at the time of his arrest. Another trial resulted in a
hung jury; finally, Lawson was acquitted in 1996 and set free.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Dexter
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering his wife in Missouri in 1991. Dexter's
conviction was overturned in 1998 because his defense had failed to
investigate any of the evidence, much of which pointed to a botched
robbery. Blood left at the scene did not match Dexter's.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Cousin
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of MuAlfred Michael Gerardi during an armed
robbery in Louisiana. Cousin, who was 16, said he was at a
basketball game, and his coach testified that he was at the game.
But his court-appointed lawyer advised him to plead guilty to four
unrelated counts of armed robbery to gain the jury's sympathy.
Cousin was convicted of first-degree murder and the four robberies.
The state Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction because of
improper evidence, but he is still imprisoned for the other
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEMS WITH TESTIMONY
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Brandley
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1981
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in a Texas high
school. Hair left at the crime scene implicated a white man, not
Brandley, the only black custodian at the school. One of the two
chief witnesses recanted his statements in a 1986 appeal hearing,
saying the prosecution and the police had pressured him into
implicating Brandley; the other witness confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Aldape Guerra
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing a police officer in Houston. After the state
appeals were exhausted, the case went to a U.S. district judge, who
decided that the police and prosecutors had railroaded Guerra, a
Mexican, onto death row.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Porter
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: A double murder in Chicago witnessed by several people.
His lawyer lost several appeals, but two days before his execution
date last fall, Porter was granted a stay because of his limited
mental capacity. When a journalism professor at Northwestern
University, David Protess, assigned his students to investigate the
case, several witnesses recanted and another man confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Muneer Deeb
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Planning a 1982 triple murder in Texas carried out by
three gunmen, who were later convicted. Deeb's conviction was
reversed in 1991 because testimony had been improperly admitted
from an inmate who said he heard Deeb confess while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Charles Cruz
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1981
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Ordering the contract killing of two people in Arizona.
Although physical evidence was scant, Cruz was convicted mainly on
the testimony of a participant in the killings who was granted
immunity for his testimony. At the last trial, the jury foreman
said, We all came to the conclusion that the state's main witness
was an unreliable witness, a proven liar.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of a jail warden, Virdeen Willis Jr., outside
a Chicago tavern. Smith, whose criminal record already included two
convictions for murder in 1964 and 1969, was convicted with the
testimony of one eyewitness, who was later found to be closely tied
to another suspect in the case. The state Supreme Court vacated
Smith's conviction and barred prosecutors from trying him again.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McMillian
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing an 18-year-old woman, Ronda Morrison, during a
robbery in Alabama. He was arrested with another man, Ralph Myers,
who agreed to testify against him in exchange for leniency.
McMillian was placed in a death row cell before his trial even
began. The judge overruled the jury's recommendation of life in
prison and sentenced McMillian to die. An investigation by a lawyer
revealed suppression of exculpatory information and perjury by all
of the prosecution's witnesses, who later recanted their testimony.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Joseph Burrows
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of William Dulan, an 88-year-old man, in
Illinois. Although no physical evidence implicated Burrows, two
witnesses testified against him. One later recanted to a newspaper,
claiming coercion by prosecutors and the police. The other witness
confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gauger
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of his parents in Illinois. At his arrest
Gauger was interrogated for more than 16 hours without a lawyer.
Asked to describe how he might have committed the murders, Gauger
complied; his answer was construed as a confession. The same judge
who sentenced him to death later overturned the conviction, finding
little evidence to arrest Gauger in the first place. Last year, a
gang member, on trial for several unrelated crimes, confessed to
murdering Gauger's parents, with an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS OF EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1980
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a 6-year-old girl in Georgia. The
prosecution presented an 8-year-old eyewitness and hair and semen
samples. A volunteer group of lawyers later uncovered large amounts
of suppressed evidence, including FBI tests showing that the
samples belonged to a white man. (Nelson is black.)
</P>
<P>
   John C. Skelton
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing a former employee, Joe Neal, in Texas by rigging
his pickup truck with dynamite. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
said the prosecution had failed to link Skelton to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Lee Kyles
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Dolores Dye during a car theft in
Louisiana. The U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned Kyles'
conviction, ruled that the prosecution had withheld material
evidence regarding a paid informant who said Kyles, an
acquaintance, was the murderer. The informant had previously been
suspected of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Adolph Munson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The kidnapping and murder of a store clerk in Oklahoma
while Munson was on work release after serving time for a 1964
murder. After nine years of appeals and an investigative report by
the American Bar Association, the state's highest criminal appeals
court overturned his conviction, finding that Oklahoma prosecutors
had suppressed evidence that supported Munson's innocence,
including the testimony of eyewitnesses who claimed the murderer
was white. (Munson is black.) He was acquitted in retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Jay C. Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1986
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1979 murder of a teacher and her two children in
Pennsylvania; the prosecution charged that Smith, a principal,
acted with the victim's fiance, who was later sentenced to three
life terms. In 1989, the conviction was reversed because of hearsay
evidence and because the prosecution was found to have suppressed
evidence that strongly implicated the fiance as the lone murderer.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court wrote that the prosecution had
violated all principles of justice and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley P. Scott
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman friend in 1978 in Florida. The document
stating his whereabouts at the time of the crime had been
misplaced; the police claimed to have an eyewitness who placed
Scott at the crime scene. The Florida Supreme Court later ruled the
evidence to be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Butler
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing her 9-month-old son, Walter, in Mississippi.
Butler said the baby stopped breathing and she tried to resuscitate
him before taking him to a hospital. She was later acquitted when a
neighbor, who did not testify at the original trial, substantiated
her story. Tests on the child's exhumed body pointed to kidney
disease as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Golden
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Drowning his wife in Florida. Though the death was
initially ruled accidental, Golden was later tried and found
guilty. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court said the state failed
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs. Golden's death
resulted from the criminal agency of another person rather than by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Padgett
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of his estranged wife in Alabama. His
conviction was based almost entirely on blood samples left at the
scene, which were tested for DNA. It was later discovered that the
FBI crime lab had determined that the blood was not Padgett's, but
Alabama prosecutors had suppressed that fact. Padgett was acquitted
at a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   WRONG DNA
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Cruz
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Hernandez
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1983 rape and murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico
in Illinois. The men, who knew one another, were jointly tried,
convicted and sentenced to death. They won a new trial after the
state Supreme Court ruled that they should have been tried
separately. After the second trial they were convicted again, with
Hernandez getting 80 years. DNA tests in 1994 implicated a
convicted sex offender, Brian Dugan, who, during a plea bargain,
confessed to six murders, including Jeanine Nicarico's.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Bloodsworth
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1984 rape and murder of 9-year-old girl in Maryland.
Bloodsworth resembled the composite sketch of the suspect; police
said he gave information about the crime. The first conviction was
reversed because the prosecution withheld psychiatric evidence, but
he was convicted again in 1986, all the while pleading his
innocence. ``If I'm dead, that's it,'' he told the judge at that
time. ``You can't bring me back.'' In 1993 DNA from the scene was
found not to match Bloodsworth's.
</P>
<P>
   Verneal Jimerson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Williams
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1979
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1978 abduction, torture and murder of a couple in a
suburb of Chicago. The case against them and two others relied
heavily on eyewitness testimony by one witness, Paula Gray, who
changed her testimony several times, at one point admitting that
she had implicated all four men in exchange for leniency in a
different case against her. DNA samples failed to match the four
men but implicated another man who later confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Williamson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Raping, strangling and mutilating a 21-year-old waitress,
Debra Sue Carter, in Oklahoma in 1982. The conviction was based
largely on strands of hair left at the crime scene and the
testimony of a witness, Glenn Gore. In 1997, DNA samples from semen
found at the crime scene were tested and found to match Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lee Miller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and asphyxiation of two women, Anne Laura
Fowler, 83, and Zelma Cutler, 92, in Oklahoma in 1988. A judge
dismissed the case after 10 years, saying the evidence was
insufficient. DNA in a semen sample did not match Miller's DNA, but
did match that of an already-convicted rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Charges dropped: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1985 rape and murder of Debra Smith in Illinois.
Jones signed a confession that stated that Ms. Smith had agreed to
have sex with him for $10, then attacked him with a knife when he
refused to pay her and was killed in the struggle. In the first
trial, it was shown that Ms. Smith had no history of prostitution;
Jones later said the police had beaten him. But it was not until
1997 that DNA tests used on the semen sample recovered at the crime
scene proved that Jones was the wrong man. The charges against him,
however, weren't dropped until May 1999 after prosecutors decided
against a new trial. He remains in jail on unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hayes
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a co-worker in Florida. Hayes was
convicted largely from DNA evidence that was taken from hair found
in the victim's hands. In 1995, the Florida Supreme Court
overturned Hayes' conviction when it was revealed that the hair was
from a white man; Hayes is black.

   Here is a courtroom scene that lawyers in the fledgling field of
animal law say will unfold sometime soon.
</P>

   A great ape will appear in the courtroom. A lawsuit, perhaps
protesting the ape's life behind bars, will have been filed in the
animal's name. The ape will then testify using sign language or a
voice synthesizer to support the claim that, contrary to centuries
of law, it has legal rights, including a fundamental right to
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction? An animal activist's dream?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But a growing group of lawyers and legal academics say
they are plotting strategies to bring such a suit, perhaps within a
decade. Such a trial, they say, is the inevitable culmination of
challenges they are starting to make to the principle that animals
are property without legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very important case,'' said William A.
Reppy Jr., a Duke University law professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never happened before. An animal has never conversed
with a judge,'' added Reppy, who has joined in a briefing about a
potential great ape case.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a new Monkey Trial may never amount to more than a
flight of legal imagination. But the plans reveal the strategy of
an increasingly credible group of animal-rights lawyers who say the
United States will be hearing much more from them in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to make it intellectually uncomfortable for the
legal system to continue to declare that animals lack legal rights
because they are property. That simple legal proposition is the
foundation for many common human activities, including the eating
of meat, the ownership of pets, all forms of animal exhibition,
hunting and animal experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the lawyers want to challenge the status quo by
asking the courts to look closely at great apes _ large and
intelligent creatures like gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans
that resemble humans genetically. Some of these apes have been
trained to communicate with humans. The mere presence of such an
animal in court, the lawyers believe, would raise tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   Would mere property _ a stick of furniture, say _ be able to say
anything at all in court?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to find a fact pattern in which the public can
identify with the moral position,'' said David S. Favre, a law
professor at Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University.
Favre is a participant in one planning group for such cases, the
Great Ape Legal Project, which is part of the Animal Legal Defense
Fund, a national organization.
</P>
<P>
   The moral position advanced by some animal-rights lawyers is
that the legal system has drawn the line in the wrong place between
humans, whom they see as animals with rights, and animals without
rights.
</P>
<P>
   They say great apes, who most closely resemble humans, pose the
question most clearly of whether the law has drawn the line in the
wrong place. But if the line were drawn somewhere else _ if apes
had some rights, for example _ where would the new line be drawn?
Dogs? Cows? Chickens? Lobsters?
</P>
<P>
   For these lawyers, the beauty of a great ape case is that it
would open the courthouse door without forcing them to answer such
questions about the likes of lobsters and chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Tischler, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense
Fund, said it was too early in the evolution of animal law to know
where a new line ought to be drawn. ``Where do I stop?'' she asked.
``My perspective is: I'd like to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. An increasing number of lawyers say they are
full- or part-time animal law specialists interested in testing the
boundaries of established legal principles. There are conferences,
legal books and bar committees on animal law. About a dozen law
schools now teach animal law, including Harvard, Georgetown, the
University of Vermont and the University of California at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of lawyers, from pet lovers to budding entrepreneurs,
say they are drawn to animal law. Their adversaries say the lawyers
should not be underestimated and have substantial financial backing
from animal welfare organizations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They have decided the courts are available to them and they
are very good at it,'' said William P. Horn, a Washington lawyer
and a former Reagan administration Interior Department official,
who often represents hunting groups.
</P>
<P>
   Modest cases, some animal-rights lawyers say, could set the
stage for ambitious suits like a great ape case. Some legal
scholars, for example, are considering whether the legal system can
justify common but arguably cruel farming practices, like the close
confinement of animals raised for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you decide some farm practices are cruel and animals
should not be treated cruelly,'' said David J. Wolfson, a New York
lawyer, ``you have to ask: What are animals' nature? And how should
we treat them?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at the prestigious
law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy, has a sideline interest
in animal law. He has just published a law review article on the
legal issues presented by common farming practices.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Wolfson said raising questions about the
treatment of farm animals could be part of a continuum leading
toward a great ape suit.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, lawyers considering a great ape case say they
are evaluating very practical legal questions, like whether an ape
could be sworn in as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the law generally requires proof that a
witness knows the difference between right and wrong. There is not
yet proof that a court would be likely to accept that apes
understand what humans mean by those concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Wise, a Boston lawyer who will teach a course in
animal law at Harvard this spring, said one issue is what legal
mechanism could be used to file a great ape suit, since the law
requires that suits be filed by people with the authority to bring
suit.
</P>
<P>
   One solution Wise proposes is the use of slavery-era statutes
that enabled slaves _ legally nonpersons at the time _ to bring
suits. The statutes were passed to authorize suits by slaves who
said they were held improperly _ because they were white, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also the problem all would-be legal
reformers face: finding the right plaintiff for a landmark case.
Some lawyers say it is possible that no communicating ape would be
mistreated enough to warrant a suit. Some say another case, perhaps
involving a different animal entirely, could present itself first
as a confounding moral challenge to the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is concern about what a communicating primate might
say in court. ``I know they don't talk much better than a
4-year-old,'' Reppy of Duke said. Last month an orangutan who had
been taught to use a voice synthesizer in Atlanta said this:
``Please buy me a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance, a great ape might not make an eloquent plea
for freedom. But its lawyers would hope that any words uttered from
an animal to a judge would be powerful simply because they were
uttered.

DICTATORS FACE THE PINOCHET SYNDROME

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A new malady is stalking the presidential
palaces and bunkers of the world. Call it the Pinochet syndrome.
Last week, it surfaced in Austria and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian case involved Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, regarded as
the No. 2 man in Iraq after Saddam Hussein. A Vienna city
councilman, Peter Pilz, discovered that Ibrahim, who is accused of
directing the mass murder of Kurds in 1988 and torturing and
killing other Iraqi citizens, was in a Vienna hospital for
treatment. Following the precedent set by a Spanish judge who was
able to have Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile arrested while he was
in London last year for medical care, Pilz filed a criminal
complaint with Austrian authorities on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours later, Ibrahim made a hasty exit, and
Austria, to the consternation of human rights groups, let him go.
So did Jordan, since Ibrahim had to pass through Amman on his way
back to Iraq. From now on, however, Ibrahim may have to settle for
hospitals in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, a leading newspaper said the Pinochet
syndrome also haunts President Suharto, who was forced from office
last year after three decades of autocratic rule. Suharto, who is
under investigation by the new Indonesian government, has been
living at his home in relative peace. But he is 78 years old and
seriously ill, having suffered both a stroke and intestinal
bleeding in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Like other strongmen who tolerate inferior health care for
everyone but themselves, Suharto had been expected to seek medical
treatment in Germany, as he has done in the past. Not likely,
people close to his family told The Jakarta Post. A host of people
would be waiting with warrants.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, says Reed Brody, advocacy director for
Human Rights Watch, former dictators will have almost nowhere to
go, in sickness or in health. Some might even feel less secure
about where they are now, with human rights lawyers showing a new,
post-Pinochet interest in pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch has compiled a list of ex-tyrants who have
fled their battered countries for what they thought were safer
addresses. Idi Amin of Uganda is still in Saudi Arabia; Jean-Claude
Duvalier of Haiti is in France, and one of his successors, Raul
Cedras, is in Panama; Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner is in Brazil;
and Hissan Habre of Chad is in Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of the Pinochet syndrome, says Human Rights Watch,
``shows how far we have come from the days when despots could
terrorize their own populations, secure in the knowledge that at
worst they would face a tranquil exile.''

NEW MONKEY TRIAL MAY REDEFINE A JURY OF ONE'S PEERS

   Here is a courtroom scene that lawyers in the fledgling field of
animal law say will unfold sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   A great ape will appear in the courtroom. A lawsuit, perhaps
protesting the ape's life behind bars, will have been filed in the
animal's name. The ape will then testify using sign language or a

</P>
<P>
   Since Arianna Huffington floated the idea of a Warren Beatty
presidential campaign last week, the actor's ambitions have been
the summer's most delectable political story. The jokes abound:
what Warren would do on the Oval Office carpet, whom President
Beatty would hire as his intern, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Beatty has stayed virtually silent, but his
friends are encouraging speculation: ``Warren has been consulting
with Democratic and Reform Party activists,'' they say. ``Warren is
taking this very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Wife Annette Bening, they report, is enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   The right thinks Beatty is a ridiculous, preening glory hound
who would preach limousine-liberal ideas. The left thinks he can
illuminate a grand populist vision with pure charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides mistakenly assume that because Beatty is an actor,
he, like Ronald Reagan, could flatter, seduce and inspire voters.
He charmed Natalie Wood, Madonna, Faye Dunaway, Julie Christie,
Isabelle Adjani, Diane Keaton, et al. Surely he could charm a few
million disaffected Democrats. (And even if the only people who
vote for Beatty are women who slept with him, he could make a
strong showing in the California primary.)
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty has always been, in the words of film critic David
Thomson, ``a very uneasy actor.'' Beatty is too cool and distant to
be great on screen. He has made his mark on Hollywood more as a
producer and director, and it is this that explains his political
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The media snicker at the actor-politician, who presumes to speak
on the day's great issues. But consider Beatty as a self-made
businessman. Beatty sympathizers such as Huffington rightly ask why
Steve Forbes, who inherited his millions, is a serious candidate,
while Beatty is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has shown a ruthless, brilliant talent for manipulating
the politics of his industry. In Hollywood, where no one gets his
way all the time, Warren Beatty has got his way forever.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' Peter Biskind chronicles how
Beatty parlayed the heartthrob status he'd won from 1961's
``Splendor in the Grass'' into a controlling position as a
producer. He almost single-handedly brought ``Bonnie and Clyde'' to
the screen in 1967 and made his fortune off it by negotiating a
contract for 40 percent of the gross.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, he bullied screenwriters and directors into making
``Shampoo'' and ``Heaven Can Wait'' his way. In 1981, during the
height of the Cold War, he persuaded Gulf &AMP; Western to pony up $25
million for ``Reds,'' a movie sympathetic to communism.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, he got Columbia to spend the
then-preposterous figure of $40 million on ``Ishtar.'' It flopped,
but Beatty walked away unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he compelled Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox to
put up $35 million for ``Bulworth'' and to give him absolute
creative control over the film, even though 1) it was a political
movie and hence a lousy investment, and 2) it propounded ideas
Murdoch detests.
</P>
<P>
   There are endless stories about how Beatty charmed or threatened
or kneecapped this director or that executive into doing what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty brought those same skills to his second career as an
activist. Ron Brownstein, who chronicled Beatty's politicking in
``The Power and the Glitter,'' notes that Beatty may be the only
star in Hollywood history who preferred to participate in politics
from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty doesn't need the ego gratification of public politics. He
has been famous his entire adult life. In 1972, Beatty gave
speeches on George McGovern's behalf, but he disliked the
high-profile role. He was an awkward, embarrassed speaker. ``He
understood why the public is skeptical of a guy who makes $10
million a year talking about the class struggle,'' Brownstein says.
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty excels at the backroom nitty-gritty. In 1972, he
aided McGovern most by organizing fund-raisers, even persuading
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel to reunite for a McGovern benefit. (If
that isn't great politics, nothing is.)
</P>
<P>
   When he advised Gary Hart in 1984 and 1988, Beatty remained in
the shadows, planning media and campaign strategies. ``Political
pros in that campaign thought he was a positive force,'' Brownstein
says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the few public statements Beatty has made about his potential
campaign, the most revealing is this: ``There has to be someone
better (than me).'' This is not modesty--Beatty has no modesty. It
is his cool and honest pragmatism. He recognizes that he'd be a
better operator than candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's supposed to be a liberal icon, Beatty lacks the
crystallizing vision of a Reagan. His politics are a muddle. It's
not happenstance that he is backed by such an odd assortment of
people, ranging from Republican populist Huffington to earnest
liberal Bill Moyers. Beatty is not cynical: He desperately believes
the political system is broken and needs fixing. He just seems
unable to explain how it's broken and how it should be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Beatty repeatedly chokes when asked for specific
political ideas. He seems vaguely to believe that there is too much
money in politics, corporations are too powerful, welfare reform
was wrong, and race is a big problem. He says he wants to conjure
up the spirit of Robert F. Kennedy and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth,'' the closest thing to a Beatty political platform,
is a mess as political science--an incoherent, condescending slop
about the evils of lobbyists and the innate decency of black folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' is fabulous on day-to-day campaign tactics. This is
Beatty's curse: His political principles tell him to deplore
gamesmanship, but gamesmanship may be what he understands best.
Similarly, Beatty spends a lot of time savaging Washington
corruption, yet he cultivates friendships with folks such as Henry
Kissinger, Larry King, and John McLaughlin, Washington incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is meticulous, even anal. As an actor, he is famous for
demanding take after take till he's sure it's right.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars can control their images. Beatty can forbid
interviews, decline to answer questions, and refuse to appear in
public. He didn't speak to reporters from the late '70s till the
early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians must answer questions, take abuse, and keep
smiling. The first thing candidate Beatty would have to learn, says
Huffington, is ``to get comfortable with ridicule.'' It's not clear
that Beatty is willing to do that.
</P>
<P>
   He's too cautious. After all, he twice declined opportunities to
run for office in the '70s, when he was a much more credible
candidate than he is now. According to Brownstein, Beatty led the
polls in the 1974 race to succeed Reagan as California governor but
refused to run. And in 1976 Beatty resisted pleas to make a late
primary challenge to Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's flirtation with the presidential campaign may be a
canny political tactic. He doesn't really want to run, but perhaps
he can use the threat of a candidacy to make himself a
behind-the-scenes player, the guy who delivers the left to Al Gore
or Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, Beatty turned down the opportunity to play
John F. Kennedy in a movie, then became a producer. This year,
Beatty may turn down the opportunity to play Robert F. Kennedy in a
campaign, then become a power broker.

</P>
<P>
   Since Arianna Huffington floated the idea of a Warren Beatty
presidential campaign earlier this month, the actor's ambitions
have been the summer's most delectable political story. The jokes
abound: what Warren would do on the Oval Office carpet, whom
President Beatty would hire as his intern, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Beatty has stayed virtually silent, but his
friends are encouraging speculation: ``Warren has been consulting
with Democratic and Reform Party activists,'' they say. ``Warren is
taking this very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Wife Annette Bening, they report, is enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   The right thinks Beatty is a ridiculous, preening glory hound
who would preach limousine-liberal ideas. The left thinks he can
illuminate a grand populist vision with pure charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides mistakenly assume that because Beatty is an actor,
he, like Ronald Reagan, could flatter, seduce and inspire voters.
He charmed Natalie Wood, Madonna, Faye Dunaway, Julie Christie,
Isabelle Adjani, Diane Keaton, et al. Surely he could charm a few
million disaffected Democrats. (And even if the only people who
vote for Beatty are women who slept with him, he could make a
strong showing in the California primary.)
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty has always been, in the words of film critic David
Thomson, ``a very uneasy actor.'' Beatty is too cool and distant to
be great on screen. He has made his mark on Hollywood more as a
producer and director, and it is this that explains his political
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The media snicker at the actor-politician, who presumes to speak
on the day's great issues. But consider Beatty as a self-made
businessman. Beatty sympathizers such as Huffington rightly ask why
Steve Forbes, who inherited his millions, is a serious candidate,
while Beatty is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has shown a ruthless, brilliant talent for manipulating
the politics of his industry. In Hollywood, where no one gets his
way all the time, Warren Beatty has got his way forever.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' Peter Biskind chronicles how
Beatty parlayed the heartthrob status he'd won from 1961's
``Splendor in the Grass'' into a controlling position as a
producer. He almost single-handedly brought ``Bonnie and Clyde'' to
the screen in 1967 and made his fortune off it by negotiating a
contract for 40 percent of the gross.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, he bullied screenwriters and directors into making
``Shampoo'' and ``Heaven Can Wait'' his way. In 1981, during the
height of the Cold War, he persuaded Gulf &AMP; Western to pony up $25
million for ``Reds,'' a movie sympathetic to communism.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, he got Columbia to spend the
then-preposterous figure of $40 million on ``Ishtar.'' It flopped,
but Beatty walked away unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he compelled Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox to
put up $35 million for ``Bulworth'' and to give him absolute
creative control over the film, even though 1) it was a political
movie and hence a lousy investment, and 2) it propounded ideas
Murdoch detests.
</P>
<P>
   There are endless stories about how Beatty charmed or threatened
or kneecapped this director or that executive into doing what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty brought those same skills to his second career as an
activist. Ron Brownstein, who chronicled Beatty's politicking in
``The Power and the Glitter,'' notes that Beatty may be the only
star in Hollywood history who preferred to participate in politics
from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty doesn't need the ego gratification of public politics. He
has been famous his entire adult life. In 1972, Beatty gave
speeches on George McGovern's behalf, but he disliked the
high-profile role. He was an awkward, embarrassed speaker. ``He
understood why the public is skeptical of a guy who makes $10
million a year talking about the class struggle,'' Brownstein says.
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty excels at the backroom nitty-gritty. In 1972, he
aided McGovern most by organizing fund-raisers, even persuading
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel to reunite for a McGovern benefit. (If
that isn't great politics, nothing is.)
</P>
<P>
   When he advised Gary Hart in 1984 and 1988, Beatty remained in
the shadows, planning media and campaign strategies. ``Political
pros in that campaign thought he was a positive force,'' Brownstein
says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the few public statements Beatty has made about his potential
campaign, the most revealing is this: ``There has to be someone
better (than me).'' This is not modesty--Beatty has no modesty. It
is his cool and honest pragmatism. He recognizes that he'd be a
better operator than candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's supposed to be a liberal icon, Beatty lacks the
crystallizing vision of a Reagan. His politics are a muddle. It's
not happenstance that he is backed by such an odd assortment of
people, ranging from Republican populist Huffington to earnest
liberal Bill Moyers. Beatty is not cynical: He desperately believes
the political system is broken and needs fixing. He just seems
unable to explain how it's broken and how it should be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Beatty repeatedly chokes when asked for specific
political ideas. He seems vaguely to believe that there is too much
money in politics, corporations are too powerful, welfare reform
was wrong, and race is a big problem. He says he wants to conjure
up the spirit of Robert F. Kennedy and 1968.

FISHING IN PUERTO RICO'S TROUBLED WATERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JUAN GONZALEZ 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bullet casings litter the sun-baked beach and the dirt trails
leading into mangled underbrush. Bomb craters dot the landscape,
and the fins of unexploded missiles and shells, some 4 feet high,
shoot up from the soil in a tangled web of metal.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Vieques Island, outpost of American colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Santiago was born and reared on this once-lush island,
which is located off the northeast coast of Puerto Rico. She has
been mayor to the 9,400 inhabitants of Vieques for the past 16
years. But even Santiago had never laid eyes on the easternmost
portion of the 20-mile-long island, called Cayo Yayi, until the
morning of Aug. 13, when she traveled there by fishing boat with a
visiting delegation headed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Cayo Yayi has been off-limits to local residents since the U.S.
Navy took possession of three quarters of Vieques in the early
1940s and turned it into the Western Hemisphere's most important
military target range.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, combat planes and helicopters have bombed and
strafed this end of Vieques with ruthless regularity. Artillery
shells from Navy ships have pulverized its hills, and the Marines
have conducted periodic war games and amphibious landings on its
beaches. Our government even loans Vieques out to the navies of
NATO and Latin America so they can lob their bombs at it. This
multinational assault goes on as often as 200 days of every year.
On rare occasions, it has even included depleted uranium shells and
napalm.
</P>
<P>
   The guys at the Pentagon have rarely given much thought to the
residents of Vieques, all of them U.S. citizens, who must live on a
target range only twice the size of Manhattan. This tiny piece of
real estate, the admirals say, is essential to our national
defense. Throughout all those decades, American journalists who run
around the world reporting human rights abuses have been
scandalously silent about Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and San Juan's new archbishop, Roberto Gonzalez, tried
to pierce that silence with their sudden visit last week. They
hoped to draw outside attention to this flagrant abuse of our own
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what it's like trying to teach with jet fighters
and helicopters buzzing over us all the time, and bombs exploding
in the distance?'' asked Javier Torres, an industrial arts teacher
who joined hundreds of schoolchildren and Vieques residents in
welcoming Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago remembers a particular incident on the night of Oct.,
24, 1993. ``We all heard these loud explosions,'' she told me.
``Every house in the town shook.'' Santiago immediately telephoned
the commander at nearby Roosevelt Roads Naval Base. No one could
tell her what happened. The next day she discovered that a pilot on
a bombing run had missed his target by several miles and dropped
five bombs just outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in 1997, some National Guard troops mistakenly
strafed a school bus and a police car with machine gun bullets.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in either accident, but the people of Vieques
always knew a disaster was bound to happen. It finally did, on
April 19. That's when two Navy pilots practicing for Yugoslavian
war missed their target and hit an observation post with a couple
of 500-pound bombs.
</P>
<P>
   David Sanes Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican security guard, was killed
and four others were wounded. The constant bombing has brought
other woes. The fishing industry in Vieques is a shambles. Some 73
percent of its people live in poverty. The island's pristine
beaches and its spectacular coral reefs have been contaminated, and
its residents suffer from a cancer rate 27 percent higher than the
rest of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Following Sanes' death, Puerto Ricans unleashed 50 years of
pent-up anger at the Navy. First, a group of local fishermen
occupied the hill where he was killed, renamed it Mount David in
his honor, and refused to leave. The fishermen were followed by
pro-Puerto Rican independence activists and union leaders who
occupied others sites. Before long, there were four separate
protest camps on Navy land.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations have forced the Pentagon to suspend further war
games. In the process, every major political and religious leader
in Puerto Rico _ even prostatehood governor Pedro Rossello _ has
called for the Navy to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar prompted President Clinton to appoint a commission,
which will recommend later this month what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans are convinced that white Americans would never
tolerate this kind of callous bombing on their own land. Should the
White House not respond to Puerto Rico's cry, Jackson promised he
will lead massive protests in cities around the country. Along with
Rick Dovalina, president of the League of United Latin American
Citizens, he threatened to turn Vieques into a campaign issues for
the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colonialism is a sin anywhere,'' Jackson told the cheering
fishermen. In the Philippines and in Panama, the people reached a
point where they said, the Navy must leave. Now they are saying it
in Puerto Rico. It is undemocratic of us not to listen.''

NOVEL PROVIDES AMMUNITION FOR HATE 
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by
arrangement with New York Times Syndicate/Special features. For
purchase information see end of text. 
 By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    Several years ago, when Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law
Center initiated a letter-writing campaign to dissuade bookstore
chains and distributors from stocking William Pierce's novel ``The
Turner Diaries,'' much of America thought the KlanWatch founder was
overreacting to the violence of a handful of white supremacists.
 &HT;    Now, with increasing numbers of white males targeting and
gunning down members of minority groups, Dees' failed book-banning
campaign _ although still unreasonable to most Americans, myself
included, on First Amendment grounds _ is not as unpalatable as it
once was.
 &HT;    The reason is that ``The Turner Diaries'' serves as a bible for
killers such as Tim McVeigh and Ben Smith and L.A. day camp
shooting suspect Buford Furrow.
 &HT;    Published in 1978 and set in the 1990s, the novel depicts
Armageddon between select whites and everyone else _ blacks, Jews,
government officials, journalists, cops, military personnel.
 &HT;    At this time, called the ``Day of the Rope,'' tens of thousands
of blacks and Jews are exterminated. This also is when the
``Organization'' eradicates liberalism, feminism and the other isms
of compassion.
 &HT;    Amazingly, very few people besides scholars, terrorism experts
and, of course, white extremists have read ``The Turner Diaries.''
Even more shocking, at least to me, is that so few journalists have
read it.
 &HT;    The following edited excerpts from the novel should give readers
a glimpse of what our home-grown terrorists are reading for
inspiration:
 &HT;    ``Liberalism is an essentially feminine, submissive world view.
Perhaps a better adjective than feminine is infantile. It is the
world view of men who do not have the moral toughness, the
spiritual strength to stand up and do single combat with life, who
cannot adjust to the reality that the world is not a huge,
pink-and-blue, padded nursery in which the lions lie down with the
lambs and everyone lives happily ever after.''
 &HT;    ``One day we will have a truly American press in this country,
but a lot of editors' throats will have to be cut first.''
 &HT;    ```Women's lib' was a form of mass psychosis which broke out
during the last three decades of the Old Era. Women affected by it
denied their femininity and insisted that they were `people,' not
`women.'''
 &HT;    ``There is no way a society based on Aryan values and an Aryan
outlook can evolve peacefully from a society which has succumbed to
Jewish spiritual corruption.''
 &HT;    ``The (Uncle) `Toms' will eventually get their more militant and
resentful brethren back into line, but meanwhile Izzy and Sambo are
really at one another's throats, tooth and nail, and it is a joy to
behold.''
 &HT;    ``The hanging of a few of the worst race-criminals in every
neighborhood in America will help enormously in straightening out
the majority of the population and reorienting their thinking. In
fact, it will not only help, but it is absolutely necessary. The
people require a strong psychological shock to break old habits of
thought.''
 &HT;    ``Talk of `innocents' has no meaning. We must look at our
situation collectively, in a race-wide sense. We must understand
that our race is like a cancer patient undergoing drastic surgery
in order to save his life. There is no sense in asking whether the
tissue being cut out is `innocent' or not. That is no more
reasonable than trying to distinguish the `good' Jews from the bad
ones _ or, as some of our thicker-skulled `good ol' boys' still
insist on trying, separating the `good niggers' from the rest of
their race.''
 &HT;    ``We'll go to the uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the
last of Satan's spawn.''
 &HT;    After the Organization conquers the world with nuclear weapons,
the ``Great One'' hands down a final edict: ``It (is) no longer
sufficient to be merely white; in order to eat one (has) to be
judged the bearer of especially valuable genes.''
 &HT;    After the Oklahoma City bombing, Pierce, aka Andrew Macdonald,
who holds a doctorate in physics and is a former professor in
Oregon, quipped that ``someone may have read` The Turner
Diaries.'''
 &HT;    An understatement, for sure. As head of the Neo-Nazi National
Alliance, the biggest and most active of such groups nationwide,
Pierce invites at least 100 members who possess what he calls
``leadership potential'' to a private workshop each year at the
Hillboro, W.Va., headquarters. There, the future stalwarts, who
mistake paranoia for patriotism, are trained in the civilized art
of hatred.
 &HT;    The main training manual? ``The Turner Diaries.'' Besides these
100 crazies who are required to read the book each year, many
others, such as McVeigh, Smith and Furrow, discover it in their own
way and re-enact its graphic mayhem.

 ATTENTION EDITORS: This is the second of three excerpts from the
book ``Money Talks'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc.) by Juliette Fairley.
Fairley, a personal finance writer, has interviewed prominent black
leaders in such areas as banking, financial planning and
investment. In this excerpt, Rozlyn Anderson, managing director at
the Chase Manhattan Bank, discusses the importance of estate
planning. One more excerpt from this book will be transmitted next
week.

   Rozlyn Anderson is managing director at the Chase Manhattan

Harvard Law School. She currently resides in Montclair, N.J., with
her husband and two children.

<P>
   People often start a discussion about estate planning and
realize they need to better organize their overall finances. That's
when Rozlyn Anderson steps in.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, managing director at the Chase Manhattan Bank, is
amazed by the fact that the vast majority of people haven't taken
one of the most basic steps in estate planning _ creating a will.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of a will, state laws will determine how one's
assets are passed along. If you have minor children, it's important
to have a will to express who should be the guardian in the event
neither parent survives,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   According to Anderson, in most states in the United States the
legislature has determined that a certain percentage of assets will
go to the spouse and a certain percentage will go to children. From
a tax standpoint, this can be inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has assets in excess of $600,000, it's possible it
will generate a tax if all the assets do not go to the spouse. In
many cases, people prefer the spouse to get the entire amount of
assets. The important thing is to focus on what are the desires. I
would not like to see people be automatically subject to statutes
without contemplating the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to writing a will, it's important to have a notion of what
assets you have, what the ownership of those assets is, what rights
you have to pension assets, and the income tax and estate tax
effects of holding onto the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says people do a lot of inefficient planning by failing
to look carefully at the ownership of the asset, and by failing to
look at beneficiary designations where assets could be controlled
by a designation outside the will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to understand what titling means, whether one should
hold assets in one's own name or jointly between spouses. That's
extremely important, but it depends on the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families with more than $1.2 million in assets have to be
careful to have at least $625,000 in each spouse's name, because
federal law gives a $625,000 tax exemption in 1998 to each person.
If all assets are in one spouse's name and the other spouse dies
first, then you've lost the ability to take advantage of that
spouse's exemption. So, ownership is extremely important.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson points out that although many couples think it's
romantic to hold assets jointly, it isn't always the best practice
from the standpoint of taxes and estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to drawing up a will is setting up a living
trust, which acts as a will substitute.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to a living trust is that it doesn't have to pass
through probate court, which can be onerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a certain degree of confidentiality whereas once
wills are filed in probate, they can be accessed by the public.
Trust documents will eventually become public, but it will take a
long time. Some people say there's less cost in administering an
estate with a trust. Also, if there might be a will contest in the
family, it might be advisable to use a trust, although trusts can
be contested as well,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says that land ownership affects many African-Americans
who have inherited land from their ancestors. Whether to sell or
hold the land depends on certain factors. Anderson says you should
make the determination based on your needs and goals with respect
to your other assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a symbolic standpoint, land is what African-American
families were promised after Reconstruction, and some families
still have that land legacy. In my case, members of my family
earned money and were able to purchase part of the original
plantation lands in Virginia. This land is something we will always
want to hold in our family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are emotional reasons to hold onto certain assets that
are not necessarily the best financial reasons. African-Americans
need proper advice on the ownership and disposition of the lands
and perhaps even development of the land,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says that people should decide what their life's goals
are very early.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is going to retire or perhaps cease one career and
shift to another or start a business, those goals need to be
figured out, and then you have to plan for them. We've devised some
proprietary software for clients where we will help them look over
their life span and life events and determine how much they should
be investing, what kind of return they need to seek in order to
accomplish their goals within a given time period that they've set
for themselves,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting with goals first is extremely important, followed by
looking at one's overall asset picture and seeing how various
assets can be leveraged to achieve the goals. Make sure the goals
are realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about those who have faithfully saved and acquired some
wealth _ namely property?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson recommends putting property into partnership
structures. ``Then to pass on shares in partnerships, particularly
limited partnership shares, is one way of taking advantage of
discounts, which can be anywhere from 30 percent to 50 percent. If
you just give somebody a piece of land outright, there's no
discount. But, if you first put that land into a partnership (there
are no tax consequences for contributing it to the partnership),
and then you give your child a limited partnership interest in the
partnership, you will be able to get a discount for making that
gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``By passing on that property, you are getting it out of your
estate and you're getting the appreciation in that property out of
your estate,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   -0-
 &UR; FINANCIAL ADVICE: BE MINDFUL OF TAX LAWS AND FORM OF OWNERSHIP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pitfalls of estate planning include inattention to tax laws
and inattention to form of ownership, Anderson says. In both cases,
you can lose money to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example is life insurance ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take, for example, owning a $500,000 insurance policy in your
own name. When you die, the amount is included in estate tax
purposes, which bumps up the size of the estate by $500,000.
Essentially, Uncle Sam is getting about $250,000 of the $500,000.
The way to avoid that is to put it in a life-insurance trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before acquiring the policy, have the trust set up and then
the trustee of the trust makes the application. The trust becomes
the owner and the beneficiary. It's a wonderful benefit because you
avoid bumping up the size of the estate,'' she says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The July 4 weekend was marred with the news of several gunshot
victims and two deaths: Ricky Byrdsong and Won-Joon Yoon.
</P>
<P>
   Both were the victims of a senseless shooting spree by Benjamin
``August'' Smith _ an avowed white supremacist and disciple of the
World Church of the Creator. There were numerous other injuries
inflicted upon victims of multiple ages, races, religions,
occupations and economic class. Smith's rampage was an ``equal
opportunity'' expression of racial hatred and rage.
</P>
<P>
   Now that deaths and injuries have been inflicted and racial and
religious hatred has been uncovered as the main motivation for the
violence, people want to talk. Sadly, in the face of crisis, there
always emerges a glimmer of understanding that our collective
responsibility begins with engagement in dialogue. These kinds of
conversations are too often postmortem discussions that produce
reactionary political measures that we quickly regret adopting. We
should resist going in that direction now.
</P>
<P>
   For Korean-Americans and African-Americans, this incident
reminds us again of how inextricably tied together we are for
better, for worse. People still ask how relations are between our
communities, as though a simple explanation or answer might be
readily produced.
</P>
<P>
   Korean-Americans and African-Americans alike can recall that the
media made a big deal about ``tensions'' and ``conflicts'' among us
just a few years ago. Indeed, some early, misinformed analyses of
the 1992 Riots suggested that Black/Korean conflicts were the main
cause of the four-day implosion. This was a convenient way to
sidestep more difficult issues: high unemployment, low confidence
in the police, lack of investment in the inner city and rapidly
shifting demographics in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is no funding for school-based curriculum to teach
kids about what racial and religious intolerance has produced
historically. There are plenty of programs that have been developed
by organizations and school district curriculum development teams,
but the problem has been a lack of funds to implement these
programs. No one is raising the fact that politicians keep saying
they want to do something, and yet, not a single legislative action
has been taken to specifically target implementation.
</P>
<P>
   We are passing legislation to criminalize hate crimes, but the
funds to investigate and prosecute these offenses need to be
increased. Training of law enforcement personnel should be enhanced
and consideration should be given to partnerships with
community-based organizations, which are probably the most likely
places where new immigrants will turn for help if confronted with
hate violence.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection between race and economic status is also a
reality that must be considered in the dialogue that people are
calling for today. There has been no leadership to examine so many
questions.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, how and why does redlining continue to plague
low-income areas? And once again, who do you find there? In Los
Angeles, African-Americans and Korean-Americans continue to meet
one another in places where the economic desperation takes its toll
on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   It is sadly classic: a foreign-born, Ph.D. student of Korean
descent, a native-born African-American who succeeded despite
generations of racial bigotry, brought together in sacrilegious
death. No matter what skin color, language, cultural roots,
immigration status, age or socioeconomic status _ they were lives
lost that remind us that there is much work still left to do for
both communities, inextricably tied together by our common
humanity.

 &HT;    Scooter dream better than reality
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Long before Brando and his ``wild ones''
roared across movie screens, scratching, belching, and terrorizing
small towns, kids growing up in Miami in the late '40s had an
outlaw bunch known as ``The Springs Guys.'' They were too cool for
words.
</P>
<P>
   School mornings, minutes before the last bell, these dashing
young men on wheels would whiz down Flagler Street, whip around the
corner, and single-file their way into the Miami High parking lot.
Kickstands were carelessly heeled into the sand as the drivers,
crooked grins in place, smoothed their crew cuts and checked for
audience appreciation. Girl hearts could be heard cracking wide
open all the way to Florida City.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, The Springs Guys weren't really a bunch _ just Dickie
Stamer, Jim Whitford, and Robert Filer. They didn't look much like
outlaws - no chains or boots - just jeans and penny loafers and as
for the roar - well, they didn't. They putt-putted. That's what
Cushman scooters did.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Girlish fantasy took over when The Springs Guys made
the scene. We drooled from a distance and tried to imagine
ourselves zipping around town with total abandon on one of those
daredevil machines, arms tightly wrapped around Dickie, Jimmy, or
Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it never happened. Nobody ever offered to scooter my
books and me home from school, and even if one of them had, I was
sworn to say no. My
</P>
<P>
   father had laid down the law about his daughter riding around on
the back of one of those ``darn-fool'' contraptions. My social life
was as big a flop as my
</P>
<P>
   curls in the Florida humidity.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't help when Peggy snagged herself a guy with a
scooter. One day she was catching the bus with the rest of us and
the next - there she was riding sidesaddle on the back of
Clifford's Cushman, books in her lap and one arm around his waist.
My friends and I stood dejected on the sidelines; the sight was
just too romantic for words. But one day the enchantment died.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford wheeled into the parking lot with his lady love in tow,
but instead of her usual carefree pageboy blowing in the wind,
Peggy's hair was in curlers.
</P>
<P>
   Horrors! We were shocked, but secretly delighted to see the
object of our envy looking like Ma Kettle. The romance kind of fell
apart from there. One morning
</P>
<P>
   a few days later, Peggy slumped into the downstairs girls' rest
room looking like she'd been dragged through a knothole backwards.
Her best blue skirt was
</P>
<P>
   torn and her saddle oxfords had skid marks. Seems Clifford lost
her in a tight turn. He swore it was an accident. End of romance.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, a different cute guy on a Cushman developed
big eyes for my friend Jeanne. Every afternoon after school Tommy
would putt up her
</P>
<P>
   driveway and hang around being cool and saying dumb stuff.
Jeanne didn't particularly like the attention - she already had a
boyfriend - so she shoved me in his
</P>
<P>
   direction. Tommy was less than thrilled but I guess he figured
since he'd already bought the gas he might as well take somebody
for a ride. He asked me.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing full well that lightning was going to strike me dead on
the spot, I accepted. Tommy helped me onto the back of the scooter,
warned me to keep my
</P>
<P>
   leg clear of the exhaust pipe, and putted into the sunset.
Halfway around the block I slid off and wrecked one elbow and a
loafer.
</P>
<P>
   Gentleman that he was, Tommy came back for me. Two houses down,
I fell off again and ripped my dress. Tommy turned around,
valiantly retrieved the
</P>
<P>
   heap in the road that was me, and aimed the Cushman for Jeanne's
drive. That's when I burned my leg on the exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   About dinnertime I came limping home, practicing one big lie
after another in an attempt to explain why I looked like I had just
gone three rounds with King
</P>
<P>
   Kong. Mother said nothing. Daddy asked about school. I kept my
mouth shut and wondered if everybody had gone blind since
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   So much for life in the fast lane.

 &HT;    ``INTERACTIVE'' SHOPPING IS COMING, AND SO ARE PRIVACY CONCERNS
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

   WASHINGTON _ In recent years, millions of Americans have begun
using the Internet to buy books, music and computer software. But
for snug blue jeans or comfortable hiking books, most consumers
still head to the store to find the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   Now as we move into the next century, retailers are trying to
blur the distinction between shopping on the Internet and
schlepping through the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week (EDS: August 17), Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. pushed far into
this new retail frontier when it opened an interactive flagship
store in San Francisco. The four-story complex has a digital nerve
center that uses more than 40 miles of cable and hundreds of
speakers to provide customers with a wired way to wrap themselves
in denim.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pulling on pants to see which fit best, customers can
step into a private booth where instruments scan their bodies in
three dimensions to determine sizes. That body-based information is
stored in the company's digital warehouse, along with the
customer's fingerprints and other personal data. For example, at
listening stations around the store, the computer system picks up
information about a particular customer's tastes by noting what CDs
he or she switches on.
</P>
<P>
   That trove of electronic data will be used to help create
personalized direct mail campaigns. The body data also will make it
easier for customers to skip the trip to the fitting room and
instead buy their next pair of jeans through the Levi web site.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other retailers are looking for ways to blend
traditional shopping with Internet cruising. Recreational Equipment
Inc., or REI, has been a leader in putting Internet kiosks in its
outdoor-goods stores. The kiosks allow shoppers to go to a web site
(www.rei.com) to obtain detailed information on each item the
company sells. Borders Books, Sears, Gap and others are also adding
in-store Internet connections, both to provide information and
extract it from shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say some of the biggest technological changes
may be coming at the grocery store. Early in the next century,
shoppers may find themselves being met at the grocery store door by
an electronic greeter that will check fingerprints to identify
customers. As customers move through the aisles, the voices of
electronic ``clerks'' will come out of speakers to remind them of
sale items, explain new products and suggest purchases. At the meat
counter, the electronic ``butcher'' will offer advice on preparing
meats and Internet kiosks will spit out recipes. By the time the
consumers get home, the store will have sent them coupons via
e-mail for new products.
</P>
<P>
   With good clerks now so hard to find, most consumers probably
will appreciate the service improvements that could come from the
integration of the Internet and other new technologies into retail
stores.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy experts say consumers may not be so thrilled when
they realize ``interactive'' shopping allows retailers to collect
detailed information about alcohol purchases, underwear preferences
and medication requirements. Those who worry about privacy recall
with fear how eager White House special prosecutor Kenneth Starr
was to examine computerized records of book purchases made by
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ari (CQ) Schwartz, a policy analyst with the Center for
Democracy and Technology, said his non-profit organization is
pushing for laws that would make it impossible for the government
to seize retail information without a warrant and to give consumers
more control over their personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the organization doesn't even attempt to keep
retailers from developing new ways to extract data from consumers,
a mission that would be hopeless in the 21st century. His solution
is to fight fire with fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need technological solutions to make sure personal
information is encrypted'' and that tough privacy laws are
enforced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's inevitable that the clothing retailers will
know exactly how big your thighs are. The battle will be over
whether they can post that information on a Web site for everyone
else see.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Illegal immigrants burden school districts
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 25, 1999.)
 &HT;    (Eds: Adds dropped word ``illegal'' in 6th graf.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The torrent of boat people planning the trip to South
Florida's shores now keeps an anxious ear to the weather reports;
it is the time of year when hurricanes are prowling the Atlantic
and Caribbean. It should be presumed that the heavy flow of the
past few months will reduce to less than a trickle until season's
end in December, when it will pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there will be those who will attempt the journey _ often
engineered by professional smugglers _ and if there's something
more perilous than chancing the Straits of Florida in a small
vessel in decent weather, it's trying it while a hurricane or
tropical storm is bearing down.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rise of Fidel Castro, Florida has been haven for
hundreds of thousands of Cubans and Haitians fleeing awful
existences. Relatively few among them were verifiably enemies of
their states, at least not in a political-activist sense. Most came
for a job, a meal, a roof over their heads and an education for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   In near-border cities all along the southern tier of the U.S.,
Caribbean and Mexican illegal immigrants have impacted most on the
school systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, seeking relief from its overcrowded classrooms, the
Anaheim, Calif., School Board approved a resolution to bill the
originating countries of illegal immigrants for the immigrants'
education. The plan is to have the U.S. government pay the school
district, then reclaim the expenditure from the foreign government.
Can you imagine the Mexican government, or Castro, pulling out
checkbooks for this? The resolution has as much chance of advancing
as did Hillary Clinton's health blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, what that school board did in its frustration was
to reach out, haphazardly, for help. It was a message that illegal
immigration deluges are cutting deeply into the pockets of public
education. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates
that of the 3.9 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., 2 million
live in California.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida cannot measure up to those numbers, it
nevertheless has been greatly impacted. Miami has become a Hispanic
city, the schools are teaching bilingually, the classrooms being
stuffed with immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles filed suit in federal court
for the state to be reimbursed approximately $1.5 billion, which,
the suit claims, was the sum of state and local funds spent on
health care and schooling for illegal immigrants. The suit failed
at every step up the line; in 1996 the U.S. Supreme Court refused
to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, what we have are two problems that need to be
dealt with. The first is the basic issue of illegal immigrants _
now termed in a political curtsy as ``undocumented aliens.'' Shall
America ever regain its borders? Is there a statute of limitations
on that Statue of Liberty inscription asking for ``your tired
masses''?
</P>
<P>
   That issue lands at the doorstep of the president of the United
States, who, on advice or whim, seemingly can change immigration
policy overnight. It began with Lyndon Johnson's Cuban Immigration
Act in 1965, and has fluctuated back and forth _ depending on what
squeaking wheel was the loudest _ through six presidents.
</P>
<P>
   I read an interesting story the other day in a 1945 issue of The
New York Times in which Greece, besieged by fleeing Jewish illegal
immigrants, subtracted their numbers from the approved quota of
Jews into Greece.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, we allow 20,000 Cubans a year to legally enter
the U.S. That's not a bad amount. But what would be the case if we
began subtracting from that quota, the numbers who came in
illegally? Answer: Castro couldn't care less, the Miami exile
community would go apoplectic and the non-Cubans in the community
would hold a party.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the borders are closed. In reality, the welcome mat
is out. Just touch U.S. territory _ swim ashore, hop the Rio
Grande, sneak over the fence _ and your kid can be in public school
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the second problem arises: funding education
for districts heavily impacted by immigrants; not only illegal
immigrants but by processed immigrants as well. I did not see the
Congress or the president, flush with all that excess money, make
any move to relieve the Anaheim school district voluntarily, or the
Miami district.
</P>
<P>
   The financial impact of immigrants on a school system can be
huge. When the federal government sets the policy by which the
immigrants are accepted into the U.S., it needs to carry its share
of financial responsibility.

 &HT;    Lucky guy goes for a spin
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I exhaled and told myself how lucky I was.
The car had started again with only the slightest flick of the key.
</P>
<P>
   The car was parked in an inch of mud about 5 feet from the edge
of a pine forest, not far from a drainage ditch and about 15 yards
from the road.
</P>
<P>
   The road had turned. I had not. In a sudden, driving rain, the
car was frictionlessly suspended on the road's slick, watery
surface and was not responding either to brakes, the steering wheel
or my adamantly delivered suggestions. It was hydroplaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hydroplaning'' is one of those bland technical terms that
describes the physics of a situation without getting across its
essence. Its essence was that I was moving sideways at about 50
miles an hour before spinning like a tilt-a-whirl. The pine trees
smudged past the windshield while oncoming cars honked their horns
to alert me that driving sideways on a county road is a serious
breach of driver etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   I spun once, then twice, as the car left the road and slid
across the wet grass on the shoulder. It jumped the drainage ditch
with a thump that felt like a punch in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   There was a spray of mud and I found myself parked. Facing the
right way. No major damage except for torn-up tires.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky me. As a reporter, I had spent many bored hours
translating accident reports from police jargon to English. I wrote
about cars pulled out of drainage ditches in one-car accidents. I
transcribed official non-explanations like: ``the driver lost
control of the vehicle.'' I chatted with highway patrolmen in the
rain who helpfully pointed out tire marks and in flat voices
theorized about ``oversteering'' and shook their head at ``driver
error.'' I sometimes passed copies of these briefs to obit writers.
Very bad things can happen to a car doing the
tilt-a-whirl-maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   My case was also one of driver error. First: The driver let his
tires go bald, something that has been the case for most of my
adult life. Second: When the car started sliding, the driver
reacted quickly and decisively; which is to say I did everything
precisely wrong. You're not supposed to brake hard. You're not
supposed to keep turning the wheel when nothing happens. This is
basic high-school driver's ed.
</P>
<P>
   So, I felt lucky. I hadn't died. The car started again. I was
even able to limp to a nearby tire place.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who have a more exacting definition of luck.
They would see sitting in a car parked in the mud and listing at 15
degrees after spinning across a drainage ditch as something
UNlucky.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same way when lightning struck my house. I felt lucky
my house hadn't caught fire. Others have trouble connecting the
concept of luck with the idea of being hit by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when my wallet was lost or stolen _ I still don't
know which _ I felt lucky that the cards were accounted for, that
it held only three dollars and that a person carrying my driver's
license didn't shoot the president. Lucked out again.
</P>
<P>
   When you happen onto a situation rich in disastrous
possibilities and come out unscathed, I consider that luck. A lot
of people think of luck as avoiding all situations rich in
disastrous possibilities. That seems like a boring kind of luck. A
no-hits, no-runs, no-errors kind of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Others are very demanding and only see luck in situations when
good things fall from the sky. Lottery luck. Such connoisseurs of
luck tend to feel unlucky all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shallow men believe in luck,'' wrote Emerson in one of his
more frosty and New Englandy moments. ``Strong men believe in cause
and effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But that kind of thinking denies you the exhilaration
of the close call. A thrill that's so life-enriching, that we
sometimes talk ourselves into believing that many near-misses came
closer would seem immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been on that plane,'' we tell ourselves and are
grateful to be alive. I could have run into a tree. I was standing
there only an hour before. ...
</P>
<P>
   Lucky ducks, all of us.

 &HT;    A world tour can start anywhere
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is, after all, the World Wide Web _ not the neighborhood Web
or the American Web.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a fast and surprisingly satisfying way to tour the
world _ zapping at the click of a mouse from New Zealand to
Newfoundland. There are, of course, thousands of sites filled with
the kind of information you'd find by reading an atlas and
encyclopedia. But for a really interesting world tour via
cyberspace, try to visit some of the out-of-the-way places ... the
sort of places where the locals hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start, faithful to that theme, at a site you probably have
never visited. It's the official page of the Auckland, New Zealand,
city government at akcity.govt.nz/. Among other things, you'll
learn there's an Andy Warhol exhibit over at the Auckland Art
Gallery, the City Council takes the Year 2000 computer problem
seriously and has worked hard since 1997 to make sure there are no
serious problems, and that _ like every place else _ taxes keep
going up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe by now, you're getting the idea behind this world tour.
Instead of learning the population, chief industry and history of a
city or country, we'll use the Web today to learn what it is like
to live in a different country and get the feel of traveling in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   So let's spend a little time in a very beautiful place, the Cape
Verde islands, off the coast of Africa. Pop on over to users
</P>
<P>
   .erols.com/kauberdi/, and before you read a word click on the
link to see the photographs. Just spend a moment enjoying the view.
This is an archipelago that was populated by the Portuguese, slaves
from the Guinea Coast, Muslims and others beginning shortly after
its discovery by navigator Antonio da Nola in 1457. The language
there is Papiamentu, which is a form of Creole. There's a link
where you can learn enough of the language to sound silly. Bon bini
is welcome, kon ta bai is hello and bon dia is good morning.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go to out-of-the-way places geographically to
get an insider's view of a country. For instance, a visit to the
site at www.open.gov.uk/ in the United Kingdom can take you deep
into an inquiry about an event that happened Jan. 30, 1972, in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It started as a civil rights march and ended in the deaths of 13
people, with 13 more wounded. Click on the link on this page for
the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, and you will instantly be immersed in a
government inquiry into what went wrong that Sunday, when British
soldiers began firing into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, of course, are a good way to learn about the
day-to-day activities in a country or region. The Israeli newspaper
Haaretz is online at www3
</P>
<P>
   .haaretz.co.il/eng/htmls/11
</P>
<P>
   .htm. You will be given the choice of reading the paper in
Hebrew or English.
</P>
<P>
   The real interest here is in the small stories, not the big ones
about the region that you'd see in this newspaper. Part of the
daily fare here is about bombs that were defused, bombs that
weren't defused and terrorist activities. There is even a column
that treats ways to travel the world, using the Net.

 &HT;    Four at WestPoint dispose of shares
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four insiders at home furnishings maker WestPoint Stevens last
month sold a total 68,011 Class A shares, raising more than $2.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two insiders at Carmike Cinemas, whose shares are
trading at about half of what they were selling for a year earlier,
boosted their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   At WestPoint Stevens, William F. Crumley, executive vice
president of manufacturing, sold 9,519 shares July 27 at between
$30.50 and $30.63 each, totaling $291,414. He now holds 107,960
shares directly and indirectly, worth $2,881,183 at Friday's price
of $26.68 3/4 on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. McCall, director, exercised an option for 20,000
shares July 23-27 at $9.50 each, totaling $190,000. The former
chairman of McKesson HBOC then sold 22,500 shares at $32.50 each,
totaling $731,250. He now holds 113,762 shares directly and
indirectly, worth $3,036,023.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan M. Schuessler, chief financial officer, sold 28,000
shares July 26-27 at between $30.66 and $30.71 each, totaling
$859,130. He now holds 186,646 shares directly and indirectly,
worth $4,981,115.
</P>
<P>
   Dale C. Williams, executive vice president of international
sales and marketing, sold 7,992 shares July 27 at between $30.63
and $30.69 each, totaling $245,005. Williams now holds 43,987
shares, worth $1,173,903.
</P>
<P>
   At Carmike Cinemas, John W. Jordan II, director, indirectly
bought 57,200 Class A shares July 2-8 at $15.50 each, totaling
$886,600. He now holds 448,205 shares indirectly, worth $6,078,780
at Friday's price of $13.56 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
David W. Zalaznick, director, bought 50,000 Class A shares July
22-23 at between $13.44 and $13.50 each, totaling $673,942. He now
holds 276,790 shares, worth $3,753,964.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission requires insiders
(officers, directors, persons with policy-making roles) to report
their transactions within 10 days after the month in which they
took place. Beneficial owners, or those owning 10 percent or more
of any publicly held company, also must report.

 &HT;    PLAY IT AGAIN
 &HT;    Or, maybe, for the first time. A computer called TiVo acts like
a brainy VCR _ even fetching programs it thinks you might like to
watch.
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Call him TiVo, the television genie. By whatever name,
he makes all of us, the couch potatoes and the no-time-for-TV
crowd, take a brand-new look at the medium and its entertainment
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Calling itself ``the new face of television,'' TiVo Personal
Television Service is a marriage of computers and video. It's a
combination of hardware and software that allows alert viewers to
take charge of TV watching. TiVo may be the first of a new
generation of devices that will change the way you watch
television.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, TiVo is like a VCR. But recording is only a tiny part
of its game. TiVo does the sampling and channel surfing for you.
With a little help from you, it ``studies'' and analyzes your
viewing habits. Then it looks weeks ahead to spot shows and movies
it thinks you will like. It can record and file away up to 14 hours
or more of shows you just ``must'' watch, as soon as you clear some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, however, TiVo lets you watch television in a way
now known only to the handful of households with
</P>
<P>
   digital television, such as TV by satellite, BellSouth's
wireless cable or the promising but seldom seen upgraded service
from MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you have digital TV, TiVo offers a few wrinkles that
cutting edge, early adopter households will find valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some samples.
</P>
<P>
   You're watching the Braves in a tight game. The bases are loaded
and Chipper Jones steps to the plate. At that
</P>
<P>
   very moment the phone rings, and it could be the boss who
promised to call and chat about that raise.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. You hit the pause button and settle, unworried, into
the conversation with the boss. When finished, after a minute or
two or even 30 minutes, you hit the pause button again and
televised play resumes _ right where you left it.
</P>
<P>
   You're richer for it.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo feeds the live program signal onto a hard drive, not a
tape, and the viewer's signal comes off the hard drive with a delay
of a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when you resume watching Chipper bat, you have the
option of staying with the delayed program _ all the way to the end
of the game _ or you can fast-forward and see other highlights you
missed. Or you can hit a catch-up button and instantly go ahead to
the live program.
</P>
<P>
   Because you are watching a stored signal, you can do all sorts
of fun things to the ballgame, or movie, or whatever you watch. You
can pause, you can do a replay, a replay in slow motion, or run the
show backward and watch it over again.
</P>
<P>
   At any moment during the show, you can hit a button and see
background information about the program, such as the cast of
characters, a description of the plot, the running time. (No more
wondering _ is that REALLY Errol Flynn as a young boy?) This
background information is especially helpful in browsing the
channels and getting a quick read on what you see.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at any point you can punch up a full program guide
superimposed lightly on the show being watched, so you can see
what's playing on other channels or what's coming up later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   For me, one of the most engaging features was the ease in
ordering TiVo to ``record'' programs in the future, without
reference to code numbers. You simply type ``ER'' or ``Law and
Order'' or ``Heat of the Night,'' and the machine automatically
pops up a list of the upcoming showings of the programs, including
new presentations, reruns or whatever. You order the taping or
command TiVo to record every showing of the program in the future.
And TiVo finds the program every day, or every week, even if it
changes time or channels.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo, with viewer input, compiles his ``to-do'' list, which can
be examined, modified or enlarged at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The system obviously allows the couch potato to settle even
deeper into the cushions. But much more importantly, it allows the
busy person to watch the few selected programs she cares about, and
it provides the flexibility to watch them at convenient times.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you forget to watch that edition of ``20/20'' and think
of it only when somebody mentions it around the water cooler, you
simply go home and find that TiVo is on the case and has already
recorded and preserved it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the household with the most sophisticated digital system
can also benefit from having TiVo the computer, the modern-day Hal,
keep an orderly schedule of upcoming viewing.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the way it does that.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo's remote control allows the viewer to vote a thumbs up or a
thumbs down on any program watched, and TiVo keeps a record,
forming a profile of what kinds of programs the viewer likes. As it
``learns,'' it takes the initiative to publish lists likely to be
watched with approval, and it even voluntarily records some of them
so that the viewer can watch at a convenient time later.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of TiVo is hot and getting hotter. First of all, it is
not the only ``personal TV service.'' A competitor called ReplayTV
is coming on strong. Both have received sizable investments from
various businesses in both the television and computer fields.
TiVo, which has plans to go public, has been a source of investment
by America Online, CBS, Walt Disney, Comcast and Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the prices. You can get the ReplayTV Model 2001, with
10 hours of storage, for $699; the Model 2003, with 14 hours of
storage, for $899; and the Model 2004, with 28 hours of storage,
for $1,499. Orders can be placed from the Web site at
www.replaytv.com/home/index
</P>
<P>
   .shtml. Unlike TiVo, there's no monthly charge.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, TiVo has been valuable already. Thanks to TiVo, I
was introduced to ``The Sopranos,'' the quirky and engaging HBO
series with the fine writing and the absolutely perfect acting. And
I have discovered ``ER'' again.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo keeps an accurate record of what's coming up by dialing up
every night, after the household has retired, and accessing by
toll-free phone call the system's main databases, which are updated
continuously with new program information and program changes.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore TiVo, in a quiet way, is the household's authority on
programming, ready to share it at any time or ready to prepare a
menu of things that are popular.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when you turn on the TV in the morning, TiVo presents a
menu of things it recommends, things it has recorded and filed to
be seen on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   It IS a genie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating service and an interesting piece of hardware.
But the inventor, Jim Barton, makes no bones about what's closest
to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly willing to license the hardware to anybody who
can help us get this system out there,'' he said in an interview.
``What interests me most is the service, something we can
cultivate, refine and expand over the years and make increasingly
valuable to the viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   TiVo does raise some issues for traditional TV broadcasters. For
instance, the machine allows the viewer watching recorded material
to bypass commercials with startling efficiency. People who sell
expensive advertising time on networks and cable have no reason to
be pleased with that, and there has been grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   But others see the attractiveness of the new system possibly
building TV audiences in general, clearly a boon for an industry
that has been in a funk for years as it tries to compete with other
forms of entertainment and information.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the industry seems willing to partner with TiVo.
Philips, DirecTV and TiVo are in partnership to develop a new
satellite TV system with TiVo and DirecTV programming in one box.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts predict many new television sets may be built
with the TiVo system already installed. TiVo is still in the
process of organizing retail distribution networks for sales of the
system, but it can be purchased directly from the Internet at
www.tivo.com.
</P>
<P>
   The machine with capacity to store 14 hours of programming sells
for $499, and another with 30 hours of capacity sells for $999. The
service that keeps updating the television program via toll-free
number costs $9.95 per month or $99 a year. Or you can pay $199
once, with no more payments unless you purchase another TiVo
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   For some experts, TiVo presents the first real system for
television a la carte, allowing each viewer to spoon up the
preferred TV diet for the day, each day.
</P>
<P>
   The smartest operators in television are at work, figuring how
TiVo and similar systems will be sure to put them on that menu.

 &HT;    Marketers want to know all about you
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There he was, the Beastie Boys' rapper Mike D., dressed in the
rocker/rapper/slacker uniform of T-shirt and jeans, slumped before
a microphone in a meeting room at the Marriott Marquis in New York
City, talking about leveraging databases to increase marketing
opportunities on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Rock stars aren't talking about the Web as a medium for artistic
expression, but as a medium for purchasing this outpouring of
artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is struggling with a variety of money-
and Web-related issues, thanks to the explosion in digital music
download technology. It is desperately searching for ways to bring
loyal fans to the Web with credit cards in hand to purchase music,
concert tickets and other items.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a little surreal to hear the Beastie Boys and other
music stars talk about how to get their fans to buy things from
them on the Web. It's hard to imagine Bob Dylan or Diana Ross
talking about database marketing and optimizing retail
opportunities, but the music business is in a serious turnaround
because of the Web. Stars have become brands as well as artists,
and they want to turn the people who love them offline into a
marketing bonanza online. Even Tom Petty offers digital downloads
on Amazon.com in hopes of selling CDs both on and off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds cold and calculated, because musicians are supposed to
be above this sort of thing, but personal information is rapidly
becoming the Web's gold standard. Everyone from Amazon.com to The
New York Times knows that information is the Internet's most
valuable currency.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, the Web guru who oversees online operations
for New York Times Co., has been talking about the value of
databases for years. Anyone who wants to read the Times online has
to register first.
</P>
<P>
   It's not complicated and only takes a few minutes. The Times
doesn't sell the information. It uses it to show advertisers the
market it offers and to develop new products.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother isn't watching yet, but he would definitely like to
be. Most Web sites realized a long time ago that no one is willing
to pay money to look at Web sites. They are forced to rely on
advertising dollars and electronic commerce to keep the money
coming in and their sites up on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If all this ``data mining'' _ as they call it in the direct
marketing industry _ works, you'll be getting information you
actually want, about CDs you might buy or vacations you might take.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium still struggling to figure out ways to make money,
gathering personal information seems like the ideal way to charm
both users and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Web sites are totally and completely dependent
on you, the surfer. A researcher for Arbitron, the prominent media
measurement service, says she always lies on online applications.
``There's no reason why anyone on the Web needs to know a single
thing about me,'' she says. This from a woman who gathers data for
a living but won't tell Amazon what books she likes.
</P>
<P>
   In return for providing a Web site with information your spouse,
best friend and mother might not know, you will get frequent notes
from the places at which you have registered.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is one visit to Amazon.com to see exactly how this
works. Should you decide to buy a second book from Amazon, you'll
be greeted with a cheery personalized ``Welcome Back!'' followed by
a link to a list of recommended titles based on your last purchase.
If the books aren't to your liking, you can tell Amazon what sort
of books you do like, so you can receive recommendations better
suited to your interests.
</P>
<P>
   Give your e-mail address to Salon, the online magazine, and
you'll get a weekly roundup of new articles and essays. The New
York Times on the Web will let you know when it has a special
section, Delta Air Lines will send you a list of cheap flights out
of town this weekend, and Lands' End will offer you a weekly
overstocks newsletter of clearance items.
</P>
<P>
   However, the interesting thing about this is that rappers, rock
stars and media giants can yak all they want to about the value of
databases, but if you don't give them the information, they won't
have any. They are dependent upon your willingness to provide
information about yourself to Web sites you frequent. They need to
know as much information as you are willing to give, from where you
live to how old your kids are. You, the Web surfer, hold all the
cards in this online marketing game.
</P>
<P>
   It's your choice to dispense or withhold personal information.
If filling out online forms makes you nervous, don't do it. It will
just force Web marketers and folks like the Beastie Boys to think
of other ways to get your attention and your money.

 &HT;    TECHMEDIA COLUMNNew games for 2000, home networking
 &HT;    among the hot topics for late summer
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these fading days of summer, time remains to squeeze in a few
more new computer games. You can find some likely choices in the
August issue of PC Gamer. The issue features new reviews, plus a
look at the 10 best games scheduled for release next year. New
titles include ``Freelancer,'' ``Throne of Darkness,'' ``Alone in
the Dark 4'' and ``Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Maximum PC examines home networking. It
shows how to set up a home network through a variety of ways,
including Universal Serial Bus or wireless technology. The same
issue also includes a look at the new wireless PalmPilot, model
VII. Maximum PC calls this model ``the wireless walkie-talkie to
the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel and the Civil War Trust have jointly
produced a new computer CD called The Civil War Experience. It is
an interactive guide to the war that killed more Americans than all
other wars combined. There are photographs, video and sound clips
of historians and famous battle sites. You'll also find lots of
battle maps. The Civil War Experience is available only for PCs
with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some new barbecue recipes for these final days of
summer? Check out the company site of Weber Grills. Of course, it
is in the company's best interest to promote outdoor cooking. It
does a pretty good job of it, with hundreds of recipes, according
to Yahoo Internet Life. You'll find it at www.weberbbq.com.

 &HT;    If the game is monopoly, Intel's an opponent to fear
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you worry that Microsoft dominates the technology
world so completely that other software companies don't have a
chance, let me give you something more important to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Microsoft. It's a big company. It does have the lion's
share of the operating system market for PCs. But there are
legitimate challengers. There's Unix and its variations coming on
strong enough, and with enough real-world advantages over Windows
to make Microsoft look over its shoulder. Apple _ like a high-tech
Frankenstein _ has arisen from the near dead thanks to that trendy
and multicolored iMac machine.
</P>
<P>
   Worry about Mr. Chips instead. Worry about Intel.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the world and half the Justice Department watch
the Microsoft antitrust action with fear and loathing, something
important is happening in the chip market.
</P>
<P>
   To tell my story, I have to back up a little bit. For several
years, the consumer PC world has been changing from a market where
the sale is closed based on features and power to one where price
closes the sale. Some people will always look for the most powerful
brand-name computer they can find, and price, basically, is no
object. But you don't have to look past the computer newspaper ads
to understand that price is king now.
</P>
<P>
   As that became obvious, manufacturers began to look for ways to
sell a computer at a price beneath the competition. That created a
marketplace for microprocessor chips _ the chips that furnish the
brainpower for PCs _ that cost less than those from Intel.
Companies such as Cyrix and AMD jumped into the market. Nowadays,
to cut to the chase scene, AMD stands alone a legitimate threat to
Intel. It's a real threat. AMD claims to have 51 percent of the
market for PCs that sell for under $1,000. That still leaves Intel
in the driver's seat on more-expensive machines for home and
business.
</P>
<P>
   If the world rocked along like that, with AMD content to hold
its share of the under-$1,000 market and Intel fat and happy with
the power machines, this sort of a divide could continue forever.
</P>
<P>
   But AMD has done a brave _ and perhaps financially necessary _
thing. It has created a chip that challenges high-end Intel chips.
This new AMD chip _ once code-named the K7 and now called the
Athlon _ is available in both 600-megahertz and 650-megahertz
models. When tested against the Intel Pentium III chip, it does
very well. In fact, in most tests, it beats the Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel may be big and slow to react, but it is also powerful. It
knows what AMD did to it in the low-price market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is capable _ if it chooses _ of undercutting the Athlon on
price, even if it means losing money. AMD can't afford to get in a
high-stakes poker game with Intel. If money were poker chips, Intel
sits in front of a high-as-the-moon stack of blue chips, and AMD
has just one blue chip. That chip is Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a cruel marketplace. The best technology does not
always win.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a battle that AMD must win. AMD executives
acknowledge that the success of Athlon is crucial to the company.
If AMD does lose, and if losing does break the company, Intel
stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I prefer the Intel chip for reasons no more
sophisticated than those a bass fisherman might have for selecting
a blue crankbait. I hope this is one time that you don't bank on my
personal preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Without legitimate competition, prices generally rise.
Innovation slows. Competition drives chip companies just as it does
lemonade stands and football players.
</P>
<P>
   I don't fancy a future when the only brand of lemonade comes
from Intel.

 &HT;    TRobots beyond science fiction
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, when science fiction novels _ not video games _ were
an obsession with most boys and some girls, the robot was king.
</P>
<P>
   The robots of science fiction were wonderful (and sometimes
awful) creatures that could think for themselves and that seemed
like mechanical versions of a real person. For a time, it seemed
almost certain that _ as technology moved to the stage where such
things were possible _ robot housekeepers and waiters would be
common by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the wind shifted and robots _ that kind of robot _ fell
out of favor. Sure there were robots, but these were the
computerized cutting and welding arms used in automobile
manufacturing, designed to do one specialized task. There also were
toy robots _ even expensive ones _ that could wander around in an
amusing way but served no real purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for all of you who grew up and dreamed of someday having a
robot of your own, there is hope from an unlikely source: Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. Sony built a $2,500 robotic dog. It looked
like a dog, had some ability to learn and could even be taken for a
walk on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   Sony was shocked when it sold 2,000 of those creatures in the
United States and also thousands in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sony thinks there is a future for real robots _ for
household helpers and for industrial robots to be used in mines.
The importance of this news isn't that some company thinks it can
turn a buck selling robots. The importance is that this is Sony ...
these are folks who make a living selling popular technology, not
weird one-offs that are too expensive and too specialized.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the real shocker. The quote from Toshi Doi, president of
Sony Digital Creatures Laboratory (from an interview with Reuters),
speaks for itself:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future the total industry of automated robots will
exceed the total amount of the person computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If Doi is right, then there is definitely a robot in your
future.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting is fundamental
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember TV's ``Dating Game''?
</P>
<P>
   Sure you do. The potential date would sit on a stool and ask
three potential suitors really dumb questions. They, in turn, would
give really stupid answers. Eventually, she would pick one of the
three. It probably was as sensible a way of finding a date as
getting fixed up by your Aunt Milly. And, instead of making poor
choices a private matter, it let the world watch.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fun to you?
</P>
<P>
   Now you can try it. Not only is Sony big into robots these days,
it also plans to help your love life.
</P>
<P>
   The new sensation is called ``The Dating Game Online.'' During
its premiere week on the Web in July, it attracted some 75,000
players. You can see what it's all about for yourself, or even join
in, at www
</P>
<P>
   .station.sony.com/datinggame.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Sony Online Entertainment, it gives players a chance
to test their humor and charm _ should they have any _ with others
in a multiplayer environment. Since things like this have a natural
potential to get out of hand, the online version has a feature not
found on the TV show.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``jerk button.'' Contestants can tag and eject
players who get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Probably many single folks have wished for a real-life version
of that button.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the rules. All players must be at least 18 years old.
Sony encourages players not to share personal information or e-mail
addresses. To play, you have to register. If you're a jerk, well,
you get buttoned up fast.
</P>
<P>
   A secure feeling
</P>
<P>
   Almost every survey about technology and the Internet these days
mentions the public's growing fear that privacy can be invaded
based on the information kept in their computer and also available
over their Internet account.
</P>
<P>
   There's a growing trend toward high-tech security measures _
instead of a password. Some of these gadgets would do James Bond
proud.
</P>
<P>
   It's a field called biometrics. Some of these devices use your
fingerprints, and others use unique characteristics such as voice
or even the inner architecture of your eye to make sure that it's
really you.
</P>
<P>
   One such program is called Saflink SAF/nt 2.0. It costs $149 and
is aimed at networks of computers that rely on security. But odds
are that you'll be seeing more of these products aimed at the home
user. Unlike a conventional password, this is real security that is
almost impossible to violate since it relies on a unique
characteristic of the user.

 &HT;    Windows `Solitaire' never lost in shuffle
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us now, with a nod to James Agee, praise famous programs.
</P>
<P>
   I submit to you the proposition that within the bowels of
Windows, under the Accessories button, there lies the very heart of
computing, a small gem of programming, a glass through which all
other such endeavors may be viewed and judged.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, my friends, I speak of ``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   See how readily it leaps to the screen. ``Solitaire'' never
fails to come when called; no rough edges, no obscure error
messages, no lockups.
</P>
<P>
   Observe the brilliant colors, the sharp graphics, set against
the green background. I can sit back until my arms can't reach the
keyboard and still tell the queen of diamonds from the queen of
hearts with no difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small thing, my friend. I have a ``Solitaire'' game
for Macintosh, that presumed paragon of graphics computing, on
which I can scarcely discern one card from another with my face
right up to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Note how cunningly a card snaps into place when it reaches its
destination, how a double-click will send an ace and its subsequent
suite members zooming into place. A small thing, perhaps, but can
you remember how messy it was with real cards?
</P>
<P>
   A woman who didn't get it once marveled at the time her friends
spent playing computer ``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you miss shuffling? Isn't handling the cards the point
of the whole thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh dear me, no. What good is fancy shuffling and riverboat
dealing in ``Solitaire''? By its very name, the player is alone _
there is no one to impress. A new deck of cards is stiff and
resistant. After going through a couple of dozen games, the
stiffness is gone, soon to be replaced by limp and creased cards,
especially if you're the kind who peeks. Dirty cards, too. You'll
never turn over a dirty card in Windows ``Solitaire.'' Mind the
mouse and the keyboard, though.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen decks to choose from, including one with a
sunlit beach that does funny things when you aren't watching. You
don't often see the backs, but such riches are not to be sneered
at.
</P>
<P>
   You want competition? Standard scoring and Vegas scoring. Turn
one card, turn three. Personally, I never heard of turning one
card. It has a nasty, subversive sort of sound to it. I wouldn't
trust anyone who turns one card.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we come to my only quibble about Windows ``Solitaire.''
You have to send all the cards to the upper field before you get a
proper winner's payoff, with the cards bouncing gracefully all over
the screen. I had a ``Solitaire'' program once that would recognize
instantly when all the cards were played for a win. A penguin would
march out, as I recall, and wave a banner at you. That was nice.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Windows ``Solitaire'' may, in the end, be
Microsoft's finest achievement. What else would maintain our sanity
as we listen to some geek's idea of soothing music while waiting on
terminal hold for tech support?
</P>
<P>
   How else pass the time between the completion of a project and
lunch? How many world-bending decisions may have been made over an
evening of Windows ``Solitaire''? How many insomniacs lulled off to
dreamland by the steady march of jack to queen to king?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Word is wonderful and Excel is excellent, to be sure.
But ``Solitaire'' is ``Solitaire.''

 &HT;    A world tour can start anywhere
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is, after all, the World Wide Web _ not the neighborhood Web
or the American Web.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a fast and surprisingly satisfying way to tour the
world _ zapping at the click of a mouse from New Zealand to
Newfoundland. There are, of course, thousands of sites filled with
the kind of information you'd find by reading an atlas and
encyclopedia. But for a really interesting world tour via
cyberspace, try to visit some of the out-of-the-way places ... the
sort of places where the locals hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start, faithful to that theme, at a site you probably have
never visited. It's the official page of the Auckland, New Zealand,
city government at akcity.govt.nz/. Among other things, you'll
learn there's an Andy Warhol exhibit over at the Auckland Art
Gallery, the City Council takes the Year 2000 computer problem
seriously and has worked hard since 1997 to make sure there are no
serious problems, and that _ like every place else _ taxes keep
going up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe by now, you're getting the idea behind this world tour.
Instead of learning the population, chief industry and history of a
city or country, we'll use the Web today to learn what it is like
to live in a different country and get the feel of traveling in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   So let's spend a little time in a very beautiful place, the Cape
Verde islands, off the coast of Africa. Pop on over to users
</P>
<P>
   .erols.com/kauberdi/, and before you read a word click on the
link to see the photographs. Just spend a moment enjoying the view.
This is an archipelago that was populated by the Portuguese, slaves
from the Guinea Coast, Muslims and others beginning shortly after
its discovery by navigator Antonio da Nola in 1457. The language
there is Papiamentu, which is a form of Creole. There's a link
where you can learn enough of the language to sound silly. Bon bini
is welcome, kon ta bai is hello and bon dia is good morning.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go to out-of-the-way places geographically to
get an insider's view of a country. For instance, a visit to the
site at www.open.gov.uk/ in the United Kingdom can take you deep
into an inquiry about an event that happened Jan. 30, 1972, in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It started as a civil rights march and ended in the deaths of 13
people, with 13 more wounded. Click on the link on this page for
the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, and you will instantly be immersed in a
government inquiry into what went wrong that Sunday, when British
soldiers began firing into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, of course, are a good way to learn about the
day-to-day activities in a country or region. The Israeli newspaper
Haaretz is online at www3
</P>
<P>
   .haaretz.co.il/eng/htmls/11
</P>
<P>
   .htm. You will be given the choice of reading the paper in
Hebrew or English.
</P>
<P>
   The real interest here is in the small stories, not the big ones
about the region that you'd see in this newspaper. Part of the
daily fare here is about bombs that were defused, bombs that
weren't defused and terrorist activities. There is even a column
that treats ways to travel the world, using the Net.

 &HT;    PLAY IT AGAIN
 &HT;    Or, maybe, for the first time. A computer called TiVo acts like
a brainy VCR _ even fetching programs it thinks you might like to
watch.
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Call him TiVo, the television genie. By whatever name,
he makes all of us, the couch potatoes and the no-time-for-TV
crowd, take a brand-new look at the medium and its entertainment
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Calling itself ``the new face of television,'' TiVo Personal
Television Service is a marriage of computers and video. It's a
combination of hardware and software that allows alert viewers to
take charge of TV watching. TiVo may be the first of a new
generation of devices that will change the way you watch
television.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, TiVo is like a VCR. But recording is only a tiny part
of its game. TiVo does the sampling and channel surfing for you.
With a little help from you, it ``studies'' and analyzes your
viewing habits. Then it looks weeks ahead to spot shows and movies
it thinks you will like. It can record and file away up to 14 hours
or more of shows you just ``must'' watch, as soon as you clear some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, however, TiVo lets you watch television in a way
now known only to the handful of households with
</P>
<P>
   digital television, such as TV by satellite, BellSouth's
wireless cable or the promising but seldom seen upgraded service
from MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you have digital TV, TiVo offers a few wrinkles that
cutting edge, early adopter households will find valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some samples.
</P>
<P>
   You're watching the Braves in a tight game. The bases are loaded
and Chipper Jones steps to the plate. At that
</P>
<P>
   very moment the phone rings, and it could be the boss who
promised to call and chat about that raise.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. You hit the pause button and settle, unworried, into
the conversation with the boss. When finished, after a minute or
two or even 30 minutes, you hit the pause button again and
televised play resumes _ right where you left it.
</P>
<P>
   You're richer for it.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo feeds the live program signal onto a hard drive, not a
tape, and the viewer's signal comes off the hard drive with a delay
of a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when you resume watching Chipper bat, you have the
option of staying with the delayed program _ all the way to the end
of the game _ or you can fast-forward and see other highlights you
missed. Or you can hit a catch-up button and instantly go ahead to
the live program.
</P>
<P>
   Because you are watching a stored signal, you can do all sorts
of fun things to the ballgame, or movie, or whatever you watch. You
can pause, you can do a replay, a replay in slow motion, or run the
show backward and watch it over again.
</P>
<P>
   At any moment during the show, you can hit a button and see
background information about the program, such as the cast of
characters, a description of the plot, the running time. (No more
wondering _ is that REALLY Errol Flynn as a young boy?) This
background information is especially helpful in browsing the
channels and getting a quick read on what you see.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at any point you can punch up a full program guide
superimposed lightly on the show being watched, so you can see
what's playing on other channels or what's coming up later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   For me, one of the most engaging features was the ease in
ordering TiVo to ``record'' programs in the future, without
reference to code numbers. You simply type ``ER'' or ``Law and
Order'' or ``Heat of the Night,'' and the machine automatically
pops up a list of the upcoming showings of the programs, including
new presentations, reruns or whatever. You order the taping or
command TiVo to record every showing of the program in the future.
And TiVo finds the program every day, or every week, even if it
changes time or channels.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo, with viewer input, compiles his ``to-do'' list, which can
be examined, modified or enlarged at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The system obviously allows the couch potato to settle even
deeper into the cushions. But much more importantly, it allows the
busy person to watch the few selected programs she cares about, and
it provides the flexibility to watch them at convenient times.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you forget to watch that edition of ``20/20'' and think
of it only when somebody mentions it around the water cooler, you
simply go home and find that TiVo is on the case and has already
recorded and preserved it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the household with the most sophisticated digital system
can also benefit from having TiVo the computer, the modern-day Hal,
keep an orderly schedule of upcoming viewing.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the way it does that.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo's remote control allows the viewer to vote a thumbs up or a
thumbs down on any program watched, and TiVo keeps a record,
forming a profile of what kinds of programs the viewer likes. As it
``learns,'' it takes the initiative to publish lists likely to be
watched with approval, and it even voluntarily records some of them
so that the viewer can watch at a convenient time later.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of TiVo is hot and getting hotter. First of all, it is
not the only ``personal TV service.'' A competitor called ReplayTV
is coming on strong. Both have received sizable investments from
various businesses in both the television and computer fields.
TiVo, which has plans to go public, has been a source of investment
by America Online, CBS, Walt Disney, Comcast and Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the prices. You can get the ReplayTV Model 2001, with
10 hours of storage, for $699; the Model 2003, with 14 hours of
storage, for $899; and the Model 2004, with 28 hours of storage,
for $1,499. Orders can be placed from the Web site at
www.replaytv.com/home/index
</P>
<P>
   .shtml. Unlike TiVo, there's no monthly charge.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, TiVo has been valuable already. Thanks to TiVo, I
was introduced to ``The Sopranos,'' the quirky and engaging HBO
series with the fine writing and the absolutely perfect acting. And
I have discovered ``ER'' again.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo keeps an accurate record of what's coming up by dialing up
every night, after the household has retired, and accessing by
toll-free phone call the system's main databases, which are updated
continuously with new program information and program changes.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore TiVo, in a quiet way, is the household's authority on
programming, ready to share it at any time or ready to prepare a
menu of things that are popular.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when you turn on the TV in the morning, TiVo presents a
menu of things it recommends, things it has recorded and filed to
be seen on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   It IS a genie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating service and an interesting piece of hardware.
But the inventor, Jim Barton, makes no bones about what's closest
to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly willing to license the hardware to anybody who
can help us get this system out there,'' he said in an interview.
``What interests me most is the service, something we can
cultivate, refine and expand over the years and make increasingly
valuable to the viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   TiVo does raise some issues for traditional TV broadcasters. For
instance, the machine allows the viewer watching recorded material
to bypass commercials with startling efficiency. People who sell
expensive advertising time on networks and cable have no reason to
be pleased with that, and there has been grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   But others see the attractiveness of the new system possibly
building TV audiences in general, clearly a boon for an industry
that has been in a funk for years as it tries to compete with other
forms of entertainment and information.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the industry seems willing to partner with TiVo.
Philips, DirecTV and TiVo are in partnership to develop a new
satellite TV system with TiVo and DirecTV programming in one box.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts predict many new television sets may be built
with the TiVo system already installed. TiVo is still in the
process of organizing retail distribution networks for sales of the
system, but it can be purchased directly from the Internet at
www.tivo.com.
</P>
<P>
   The machine with capacity to store 14 hours of programming sells
for $499, and another with 30 hours of capacity sells for $999. The
service that keeps updating the television program via toll-free
number costs $9.95 per month or $99 a year. Or you can pay $199
once, with no more payments unless you purchase another TiVo
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   For some experts, TiVo presents the first real system for
television a la carte, allowing each viewer to spoon up the
preferred TV diet for the day, each day.
</P>
<P>
   The smartest operators in television are at work, figuring how
TiVo and similar systems will be sure to put them on that menu.

 &HT;    Marketers want to know all about you
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There he was, the Beastie Boys' rapper Mike D., dressed in the
rocker/rapper/slacker uniform of T-shirt and jeans, slumped before
a microphone in a meeting room at the Marriott Marquis in New York
City, talking about leveraging databases to increase marketing
opportunities on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Rock stars aren't talking about the Web as a medium for artistic
expression, but as a medium for purchasing this outpouring of
artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is struggling with a variety of money-
and Web-related issues, thanks to the explosion in digital music
download technology. It is desperately searching for ways to bring
loyal fans to the Web with credit cards in hand to purchase music,
concert tickets and other items.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a little surreal to hear the Beastie Boys and other
music stars talk about how to get their fans to buy things from
them on the Web. It's hard to imagine Bob Dylan or Diana Ross
talking about database marketing and optimizing retail
opportunities, but the music business is in a serious turnaround
because of the Web. Stars have become brands as well as artists,
and they want to turn the people who love them offline into a
marketing bonanza online. Even Tom Petty offers digital downloads
on Amazon.com in hopes of selling CDs both on and off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds cold and calculated, because musicians are supposed to
be above this sort of thing, but personal information is rapidly
becoming the Web's gold standard. Everyone from Amazon.com to The
New York Times knows that information is the Internet's most
valuable currency.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, the Web guru who oversees online operations
for New York Times Co., has been talking about the value of
databases for years. Anyone who wants to read the Times online has
to register first.
</P>
<P>
   It's not complicated and only takes a few minutes. The Times
doesn't sell the information. It uses it to show advertisers the
market it offers and to develop new products.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother isn't watching yet, but he would definitely like to
be. Most Web sites realized a long time ago that no one is willing
to pay money to look at Web sites. They are forced to rely on
advertising dollars and electronic commerce to keep the money
coming in and their sites up on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If all this ``data mining'' _ as they call it in the direct
marketing industry _ works, you'll be getting information you
actually want, about CDs you might buy or vacations you might take.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium still struggling to figure out ways to make money,
gathering personal information seems like the ideal way to charm
both users and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Web sites are totally and completely dependent
on you, the surfer. A researcher for Arbitron, the prominent media
measurement service, says she always lies on online applications.
``There's no reason why anyone on the Web needs to know a single
thing about me,'' she says. This from a woman who gathers data for
a living but won't tell Amazon what books she likes.
</P>
<P>
   In return for providing a Web site with information your spouse,
best friend and mother might not know, you will get frequent notes
from the places at which you have registered.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is one visit to Amazon.com to see exactly how this
works. Should you decide to buy a second book from Amazon, you'll
be greeted with a cheery personalized ``Welcome Back!'' followed by
a link to a list of recommended titles based on your last purchase.
If the books aren't to your liking, you can tell Amazon what sort
of books you do like, so you can receive recommendations better
suited to your interests.
</P>
<P>
   Give your e-mail address to Salon, the online magazine, and
you'll get a weekly roundup of new articles and essays. The New
York Times on the Web will let you know when it has a special
section, Delta Air Lines will send you a list of cheap flights out
of town this weekend, and Lands' End will offer you a weekly
overstocks newsletter of clearance items.
</P>
<P>
   However, the interesting thing about this is that rappers, rock
stars and media giants can yak all they want to about the value of
databases, but if you don't give them the information, they won't
have any. They are dependent upon your willingness to provide
information about yourself to Web sites you frequent. They need to
know as much information as you are willing to give, from where you
live to how old your kids are. You, the Web surfer, hold all the
cards in this online marketing game.
</P>
<P>
   It's your choice to dispense or withhold personal information.
If filling out online forms makes you nervous, don't do it. It will
just force Web marketers and folks like the Beastie Boys to think
of other ways to get your attention and your money.

 &HT;    TECHMEDIA COLUMNNew games for 2000, home networking
 &HT;    among the hot topics for late summer
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these fading days of summer, time remains to squeeze in a few
more new computer games. You can find some likely choices in the
August issue of PC Gamer. The issue features new reviews, plus a
look at the 10 best games scheduled for release next year. New
titles include ``Freelancer,'' ``Throne of Darkness,'' ``Alone in
the Dark 4'' and ``Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Maximum PC examines home networking. It
shows how to set up a home network through a variety of ways,
including Universal Serial Bus or wireless technology. The same
issue also includes a look at the new wireless PalmPilot, model
VII. Maximum PC calls this model ``the wireless walkie-talkie to
the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel and the Civil War Trust have jointly
produced a new computer CD called The Civil War Experience. It is
an interactive guide to the war that killed more Americans than all
other wars combined. There are photographs, video and sound clips
of historians and famous battle sites. You'll also find lots of
battle maps. The Civil War Experience is available only for PCs
with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some new barbecue recipes for these final days of
summer? Check out the company site of Weber Grills. Of course, it
is in the company's best interest to promote outdoor cooking. It
does a pretty good job of it, with hundreds of recipes, according
to Yahoo Internet Life. You'll find it at www.weberbbq.com.

 &HT;    COLUMN: If the game is monopoly, Intel's an opponent to fear
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you worry that Microsoft dominates the technology world so
completely that other software companies don't have a chance, let
me give you something more important to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Microsoft. It's a big company. It does have the lion's
share of the operating system market for PCs. But there are
legitimate challengers. There's Unix and its variations coming on
strong enough, and with enough real-world advantages over Windows
to make Microsoft look over its shoulder. Apple _ like a high-tech
Frankenstein _ has arisen from the near dead thanks to that trendy
and multicolored iMac machine.
</P>
<P>
   Worry about Mr. Chips instead. Worry about Intel.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the world and half the Justice Department watch
the Microsoft antitrust action with fear and loathing, something
important is happening in the chip market.
</P>
<P>
   To tell my story, I have to back up a little bit. For several
years, the consumer PC world has been changing from a market where
the sale is closed based on features and power to one where price
closes the sale. Some people will always look for the most powerful
brand-name computer they can find, and price, basically, is no
object. But you don't have to look past the computer newspaper ads
to understand that price is king now.
</P>
<P>
   As that became obvious, manufacturers began to look for ways to
sell a computer at a price beneath the competition. That created a
marketplace for microprocessor chips _ the chips that furnish the
brainpower for PCs _ that cost less than those from Intel.
Companies such as Cyrix and AMD jumped into the market. Nowadays,
to cut to the chase scene, AMD stands alone a legitimate threat to
Intel. It's a real threat. AMD claims to have 51 percent of the
market for PCs that sell for under $1,000. That still leaves Intel
in the driver's seat on more-expensive machines for home and
business.
</P>
<P>
   If the world rocked along like that, with AMD content to hold
its share of the under-$1,000 market and Intel fat and happy with
the power machines, this sort of a divide could continue forever.
</P>
<P>
   But AMD has done a brave _ and perhaps financially necessary _
thing. It has created a chip that challenges high-end Intel chips.
This new AMD chip _ once code-named the K7 and now called the
Athlon _ is available in both 600-megahertz and 650-megahertz
models. When tested against the Intel Pentium III chip, it does
very well. In fact, in most tests, it beats the Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel may be big and slow to react, but it is also powerful. It
knows what AMD did to it in the low-price market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is capable _ if it chooses _ of undercutting the Athlon on
price, even if it means losing money. AMD can't afford to get in a
high-stakes poker game with Intel. If money were poker chips, Intel
sits in front of a high-as-the-moon stack of blue chips, and AMD
has just one blue chip. That chip is Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a cruel marketplace. The best technology does not
always win.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a battle that AMD must win. AMD executives
acknowledge that the success of Athlon is crucial to the company.
If AMD does lose, and if losing does break the company, Intel
stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I prefer the Intel chip for reasons no more
sophisticated than those a bass fisherman might have for selecting
a blue crankbait. I hope this is one time that you don't bank on my
personal preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Without legitimate competition, prices generally rise.
Innovation slows. Competition drives chip companies just as it does
lemonade stands and football players.
</P>
<P>
   I don't fancy a future when the only brand of lemonade comes
from Intel.

market for PCs that sell for under $1,000. That still leaves Intel
in the driver's seat on more-expensive machines for home and
business.
</P>
<P>
   If the world rocked along like that, with AMD content to hold
its share of the under-$1,000 market and Intel fat and happy with
the power machines, this sort of a divide could continue forever.
</P>
<P>
   But AMD has done a brave _ and perhaps financially necessary _
thing. It has created a chip that challenges high-end Intel chips.
This new AMD chip _ once code-named the K7 and now called the
Athlon _ is available in both 600-megahertz and 650-megahertz
models. When tested against the Intel Pentium III chip, it does
very well. In fact, in most tests, it beats the Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel may be big and slow to react, but it is also powerful. It
knows what AMD did to it in the low-price market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is capable _ if it chooses _ of undercutting the Athlon on
price, even if it means losing money. AMD can't afford to get in a
high-stakes poker game with Intel. If money were poker chips, Intel
sits in front of a high-as-the-moon stack of blue chips, and AMD
has just one blue chip. That chip is Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a cruel marketplace. The best technology does not
always win.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a battle that AMD must win. AMD executives
acknowledge that the success of Athlon is crucial to the company.
If AMD does lose, and if losing does break the company, Intel
stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I prefer the Intel chip for reasons no more
sophisticated than those a bass fisherman might have for selecting
a blue crankbait. I hope this is one time that you don't bank on my
personal preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Without legitimate competition, prices generally rise.
Innovation slows. Competition drives chip companies just as it does
lemonade stands and football players.
</P>
<P>
   I don't fancy a future when the only brand of lemonade comes
from Intel.

 &HT;    TRobots beyond science fiction
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, when science fiction novels _ not video games _ were
an obsession with most boys and some girls, the robot was king.
</P>
<P>
   The robots of science fiction were wonderful (and sometimes
awful) creatures that could think for themselves and that seemed
like mechanical versions of a real person. For a time, it seemed
almost certain that _ as technology moved to the stage where such
things were possible _ robot housekeepers and waiters would be
common by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the wind shifted and robots _ that kind of robot _ fell
out of favor. Sure there were robots, but these were the
computerized cutting and welding arms used in automobile
manufacturing, designed to do one specialized task. There also were
toy robots _ even expensive ones _ that could wander around in an
amusing way but served no real purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for all of you who grew up and dreamed of someday having a
robot of your own, there is hope from an unlikely source: Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. Sony built a $2,500 robotic dog. It looked
like a dog, had some ability to learn and could even be taken for a
walk on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   Sony was shocked when it sold 2,000 of those creatures in the
United States and also thousands in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sony thinks there is a future for real robots _ for
household helpers and for industrial robots to be used in mines.
The importance of this news isn't that some company thinks it can
turn a buck selling robots. The importance is that this is Sony ...
these are folks who make a living selling popular technology, not
weird one-offs that are too expensive and too specialized.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the real shocker. The quote from Toshi Doi, president of
Sony Digital Creatures Laboratory (from an interview with Reuters),
speaks for itself:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future the total industry of automated robots will
exceed the total amount of the person computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If Doi is right, then there is definitely a robot in your
future.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting is fundamental
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember TV's ``Dating Game''?
</P>
<P>
   Sure you do. The potential date would sit on a stool and ask
three potential suitors really dumb questions. They, in turn, would
give really stupid answers. Eventually, she would pick one of the
three. It probably was as sensible a way of finding a date as
getting fixed up by your Aunt Milly. And, instead of making poor
choices a private matter, it let the world watch.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fun to you?
</P>
<P>
   Now you can try it. Not only is Sony big into robots these days,
it also plans to help your love life.
</P>
<P>
   The new sensation is called ``The Dating Game Online.'' During
its premiere week on the Web in July, it attracted some 75,000
players. You can see what it's all about for yourself, or even join
in, at www
</P>
<P>
   .station.sony.com/datinggame.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Sony Online Entertainment, it gives players a chance
to test their humor and charm _ should they have any _ with others
in a multiplayer environment. Since things like this have a natural
potential to get out of hand, the online version has a feature not
found on the TV show.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``jerk button.'' Contetants can tag and eject
players who get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Probably many single folks have wished for a real-life version
of that button.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the rules. All players must be at least 18 years old.
Sony encourages players not to share personal information or e-mail
addresses. To play, you have to register. If you're a jerk, well,
you get buttoned up fast.
</P>
<P>
   A secure feeling
</P>
<P>
   Almost every survey about technology and the Internet these days
mentions the public's growing fear that privacy can be invaded
based on the information kept in their computer and also available
over their Internet account.
</P>
<P>
   There's a growing trend toward high-tech security measures _
instead of a password. Some of these gadgets would do James Bond
proud.
</P>
<P>
   It's a field called biometrics. Some of these devices use your
fingerprints, and others use unique characteristics such as voice
or even the inner architecture of your eye to make sure that it's
really you.
</P>
<P>
   One such program is called Saflink SAF/nt 2.0. It costs $149 and
is aimed at networks of computers that rely on security. But odds
are that you'll be seeing more of these products aimed at the home
user. Unlike a conventional password, this is real security that is
almost impossible to violate since it relies on a unique
characteristic of the user.

 &HT;    Windows `Solitaire' never lost in shuffle
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us now, with a nod to James Agee, praise famous programs.
</P>
<P>
   I submit to you the proposition that within the bowels of
Windows, under the Accessories button, there lies the very heart of
computing, a small gem of programming, a glass through which all
other such endeavors may be viewed and judged.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, my friends, I speak of ``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   See how readily it leaps to the screen. ``Solitaire'' never
fails to come when called; no rough edges, no obscure error
messages, no lockups.
</P>
<P>
   Observe the brilliant colors, the sharp graphics, set against
the green background. I can sit back until my arms can't reach the
keyboard and still tell the queen of diamonds from the queen of
hearts with no difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small thing, my friend. I have a ``Solitaire'' game
for Macintosh, that presumed paragon of graphics computing, on
which I can scarcely discern one card from another with my face
right up to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Note how cunningly a card snaps into place when it reaches its
destination, how a double-click will send an ace and its subsequent
suite members zooming into place. A small thing, perhaps, but can
you remember how messy it was with real cards?
</P>
<P>
   A woman who didn't get it once marveled at the time her friends
spent playing computer ``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you miss shuffling? Isn't handling the cards the point
of the whole thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh dear me, no. What good is fancy shuffling and riverboat
dealing in ``Solitaire''? By its very name, the player is alone _
there is no one to impress. A new deck of cards is stiff and
resistant. After going through a couple of dozen games, the
stiffness is gone, soon to be replaced by limp and creased cards,
especially if you're the kind who peeks. Dirty cards, too. You'll
never turn over a dirty card in Windows ``Solitaire.'' Mind the
mouse and the keyboard, though.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen decks to choose from, including one with a
sunlit beach that does funny things when you aren't watching. You
don't often see the backs, but such riches are not to be sneered
at.
</P>
<P>
   You want competition? Standard scoring and Vegas scoring. Turn
one card, turn three. Personally, I never heard of turning one
card. It has a nasty, subversive sort of sound to it. I wouldn't
trust anyone who turns one card.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we come to my only quibble about Windows ``Solitaire.''
You have to send all the cards to the upper field before you get a
proper winner's payoff, with the cards bouncing gracefully all over
the screen. I had a ``Solitaire'' program once that would recognize
instantly when all the cards were played for a win. A penguin would
march out, as I recall, and wave a banner at you. That was nice.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Windows ``Solitaire'' may, in the end, be
Microsoft's finest achievement. What else would maintain our sanity
as we listen to some geek's idea of soothing music while waiting on
terminal hold for tech support?
</P>
<P>
   How else pass the time between the completion of a project and
lunch? How many world-bending decisions may have been made over an
evening of Windows ``Solitaire''? How many insomniacs lulled off to
dreamland by the steady march of jack to queen to king?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Word is wonderful and Excel is excellent, to be sure.
But ``Solitaire'' is ``Solitaire.''

 &HT;    Sneak peek at shoe shelves
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Homma Rafi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, when your parents were your age, having more
than a few pairs of shoes was a bit of a luxury. But times have
changed. Some kids today have closets full of shoes _ especially
sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoes come out all the time and you need to buy new (sneakers)
to keep up with new styles,'' says Demetris White, 11, of Walden
Middle School in Atlanta. ``I own 10 pairs of sneakers, and every
pair helps me look beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Demetris and other kids in the metro area, some of
the hottest sneakers for back to school are Nike's new Jordan XIV
Low ($50-$90) and the Nike Air Max Plus ($60-$85).
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Terrel, 13, of Turner Middle School in Douglas County,
recently bought his 13th pair of sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your sneakers should match your clothes so you can look
good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nike puts out multiple versions of the Jordans in different
color combinations. The current Jordan is light blue and white. The
Air Max Plus is army green and red.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok has reintroduced its ``pump'' shoes from the early 1990s.
The new Reebok Pump Furious ($50-$60) has an orange pump on top of
the tongue to pump air into the sneaker to improve fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pump is so cool and looks really good on the sneaker,''
says Michael Jamison, 10, of Walnut Grove Elementary in Gwinnett
County.
</P>
<P>
   OK, shoes are cool, but is buying four pairs all at one time
necessary? Some kids say ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' says Eric Reid, 10, of Austin Road Middle School
in Henry County. He owns 14 pairs of sneakers. He likes to pair
high-top and mid-top sneakers with jeans and slacks, and chooses
which to wear based on the color of his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   However, style isn't the issue for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoes should be cute but comfortable,'' said Melissa Davis, 8,
of Davis Academy in Fulton County. She likes the Reebok Crazy Daisy
($38), a sneaker with inserts to change the color of the flower
pattern along the side of the shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Homma Rafi is a senior at Cross Keys High in DeKalb County in
metro Atlanta.

 &HT;    Kosovar kids are excited about being in America and attending
school
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Besarta Selimi and her 12-year-old sister,
Fatbardha, become fourth- and fifth-graders at Stone Mountain
Elementary today. It's the first time either have been students in
a real school.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls are among about 25 Albanian refugee families from
Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo brought to Stone Mountain this
summer by the International Rescue Committee. Some of the families
came directly from refugee camps in Eastern Europe, while others
made stops at U.S. Army posts like Fort Dix, N.J., before arriving
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians had to leave their homes in Eastern Europe
because they were being attacked by the Serb Army. The Kosovar
Albanians, who are Muslim, wanted to be free from the Serb
government. The Serbians, who are Christian, refused to grant them
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Kosovar refugees, Besarta and Fatbardha didn't attend
public schools in their hometown of Ferizaj.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they've been schooled in the homes of other Kosovar
Albanians all of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like school, and are looking forward very much to starting
in Stone Mountain,'' said Fatbardha with the help of 18-year-old
translator and fellow refugee, Lulzim Shala. ``School here is very
good, and we're excited to go to school with people from other
cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Selimis and their new friend, 14-year-old refugee Fixhrie
Buqaj have spent the summer attending an IRC summer camp for
Kosovar children at Stone Mountain's First Baptist Church. There,
children ages 3 to 15 played soccer, participated in new activities
and learned basic English words.
</P>
<P>
   The children are quickly picking up English, but most still
speak mainly Albanian. To overcome the language barrier, IRC
counselors and the kids had to find innovative ways to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Senior camp counselor Whitney Lacefield said discipline was a
tough subject because the kids didn't know enough English to
understand what was going on. To help keep the kids safe in all of
their activities, the counselors and volunteers adopted the rules
of the refugees' favorite game _ soccer. A yellow card was a
warning, and a red card translated into a three- to five-minute
``time out.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in school the refugees will have to learn other ways to
communicate with their American teachers and classmates. The DeKalb
County school system offers help through its International School.
Students can brush up on their English, learn what an American
school is like and understand what is expected of them as students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can stay in the International School for as long as they
need, but it's not usually a long-term thing,'' said county
spokesman Spencer Ragsdale, who estimated most return to their own
classrooms within a few weeks. ``Kids really teach each other.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the children seem to be adjusting well to life
in the United States, said Lacefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is good here,'' said Fixhrie. ``I like American
people. They're very nice, and American culture is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But added, Besarta, ``I don't have old friends here like I had
in Kosovo.''acticing English.

 &HT;    Earthquake devastates parts of Turkey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Days after an earthquake struck last week, many people in Turkey
were still sleeping outside, fearing that another quake would cause
their houses to fall on them.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake caused widespread destruction, killing thousands
of Turks. The final toll won't be known for many days, because lots
of people are still trapped in rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers from many countries, including the United States,
are trying desperately to reach anybody who might still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Among those killed were a man from Marietta and four of his
grandchildren. They were on vacation in the resort town of Yalova
when the five-story building where they were staying collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons make a comeback
</P>
<P>
   Peregrine falcons, which were once nearly extinct, are off the
government's list of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, there were only 39 breeding pairs in the continental
United States. Today there are more than 1,650.
</P>
<P>
   The falcons made their comeback because the government in 1972
banned DDT, a chemical used to kill bugs, but one that also
decimated populations of several bird species.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leading, but questions linger
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, governor of Texas and son of former President
George Bush, seems well on his way to becoming the Republican
candidate in next year's 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   He's raised more money than other Republican candidates, and he
won an unofficial election in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But he's got a problem, too. Reporters have been asking whether
he ever used cocaine, and Bush won't say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, are looking for a
house to move into when the president leaves office in 2001.
They've looked at expensive homes in New York. Mrs. Clinton is
considering running for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Can you spare a penny?
</P>
<P>
   There's a shortage of pennies right now, and that's causing
problems in stores. Without pennies they have trouble giving exact
change.
</P>
<P>
   People who save pennies in drawers and jars at home are causing
the shortage. When the economy is as good as it is now _ it's easy
for most workers to find jobs _ people tend to stow their spare
change and forget about it. If times were tougher, people would
spend those coins.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint is making more pennies to meet the demand.

 &HT;    Death rate is high among male peers
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just attended my 40th high school reunion class of 1959
(about 250 people). Classmates are now about 57 years old. Of those
250, 23 (9 percent) have died. Of the 23 who died, 20 (87 percent)
were males. Is the number of males who have died unusually high?
All the men in our class have sworn to take better care of
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frank C.
</P>
<P>
   A:The mortality rate for this age group is on par for the
population as a whole, says Robert Hummer of the University of
Texas Population Research Center. About 9 percent of a birth
``cohort'' dies by age 55 and 13 percent by age 60. Your group is a
small sample and, having graduated from high school, is expected to
be a healthier group. (Adults with less education tend to die
younger, says the National Center for Health Statistics.)
</P>
<P>
   Hummer notes your class' male mortality rate is higher than
average. Typical fatality figures would be 16 males to 7 females,
not 20 to 3.
</P>
<P>
   Keep me posted on the next reunion stats and, Frank, be careful
out there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the state of Texas recognize ``transfer on death
registration'' for mutual fund and investment stock accounts? If I
transfer my accounts to my children, and my husband and I die while
the children are minors, will the executrix of my will (my sister)
be able to access those accounts to raise my children?
</P>
<P>
   _ Diane S
</P>
<P>
   A:''Yes, Texas does recognize transfer on death registration,''
says PaineWebber's Jan Pickle This is a recent change. But is it a
good idea for transferring money to minor children?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Patricia T. Barnes, an attorney certified in estate
planning and probate law, because ``to use the funds, the guardian
must be appointed by the court after incurring attorney's fees and
bonding costs.'' In addition, the guardian can use the money only
for things approved by the judge, which requires more attorney's
fees. I think you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where probating a will is a simple matter, there is
little if any advantage to transfer on death. Neither is there an
estate tax advantage for it, adds Barnes Best advice? Forget
transfer on death and have a will prepared covering all your
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since my wife died, I have been sorting our worldly
belongings into keep and dispose categories. This difficult task is
compounded by my desire to recycle everything. Does anyone want
rags, or is it into the landfill again?
</P>
<P>
   _ Dave Dobbs

 &HT;    Death rate is high among male peers
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just attended my 40th high school reunion class of 1959
(about 250 people). Classmates are now about 57 years old. Of those
250, 23 (9 percent) have died. Of the 23 who died, 20 (87 percent)
were males. Is the number of males who have died unusually high?
All the men in our class have sworn to take better care of
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frank C.
</P>
<P>
   A:The mortality rate for this age group is on par for the
population as a whole, says Robert Hummer of the University of
Texas Population Research Center. About 9 percent of a birth
``cohort'' dies by age 55 and 13 percent by age 60. Your group is a
small sample and, having graduated from high school, is expected to
be a healthier group. (Adults with less education tend to die
younger, says the National Center for Health Statistics.)
</P>
<P>
   Hummer notes your class' male mortality rate is higher than
average. Typical fatality figures would be 16 males to 7 females,
not 20 to 3.
</P>
<P>
   Keep me posted on the next reunion stats and, Frank, be careful
out there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the state of Texas recognize ``transfer on death
registration'' for mutual fund and investment stock accounts? If I
transfer my accounts to my children, and my husband and I die while
the children are minors, will the executrix of my will (my sister)
be able to access those accounts to raise my children?
</P>
<P>
   _ Diane S
</P>
<P>
   A:''Yes, Texas does recognize transfer on death registration,''
says PaineWebber's Jan Pickle This is a recent change. But is it a
good idea for transferring money to minor children?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Patricia T. Barnes, an attorney certified in estate
planning and probate law, because ``to use the funds, the guardian
must be appointed by the court after incurring attorney's fees and
bonding costs.'' In addition, the guardian can use the money only
for things approved by the judge, which requires more attorney's
fees. I think you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where probating a will is a simple matter, there is
little if any advantage to transfer on death. Neither is there an
estate tax advantage for it, adds Barnes Best advice? Forget
transfer on death and have a will prepared covering all your
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since my wife died, I have been sorting our worldly
belongings into keep and dispose categories. This difficult task is
compounded by my desire to recycle everything. Does anyone want
rags, or is it into the landfill again?

 &HT;    ABC's shoddy treatment of ``Once and Again''
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What can you say about a network that takes one of the most
promising new series of the season and schedules it in such a
suicidal manner that even viewers who fall in love with it won't be
able to find it after the first few weeks?
</P>
<P>
   ABC's bizarre plan for ``Once and Again,'' the romantic
comedy-drama from the creators of ``thirtysomething,'' isn't the
only lame-brain scheduling move, but it's one of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks are hemorrhaging viewers like crazy, and
yet stupid scheduling tricks continue. You'd think they'd try to
make it easier, not harder, for people to find the few good shows
that are on the air. But noooooo. ...
</P>
<P>
   Remember last fall, when Fox shifted the wildly popular ``King
of the Hill'' from Sunday, where it was happily paired with ``The
Simpsons,'' to Tuesdays? The animated sitcom nose-dived in the
ratings, falling from a healthy Top 20 perch to somewhere near the
bottom of the ratings in a few weeks. Instead of establishing a hit
on Tuesday nights, the network wound up with a little-watched gem.
</P>
<P>
   At least Fox recognized its blunder. When the new season begins
in September, Hank and the gang will return to Sundays. But the
momentum that ``King of the Hill'' had established during its first
season may be hard to rekindle. Stupid scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's strategy with ``Once and Again'' is considerably more
puzzling. The show, starring Sela Ward and Billy Campbell as
divorced parents starting over in a new romance, has been the buzz
of critics since the tapes were sent out in June. Well-written,
brilliantly acted and warm-hearted, the show is a real bright spot
in an otherwise dull season.
</P>
<P>
   So what does ABC do with its sterling series? The show will
debut in September in the time slot usually occupied by ``NYPD
Blue'' _ Tuesdays at 9 p.m. _ until ``NYPD Blue'' is ready to
return in late October. That's about six weeks. Then ``Once and
Again'' will go off the air until ``Monday Night Football'' departs
in January, leaving a 9 p.m. opening for the new series on Monday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rather unorthodox way to launch a show,'' conceded ABC
entertainment President Jamie Tarses in Los Angeles recently.
``We're profoundly aware there's great risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Great risk that millions of people will fall in love
with ``Once and Again'' and then lose interest during its
three-month layoff. Why not risk a new show that isn't generating
as much buzz, like ``Wasteland,'' the umpteenth take on
twentysomethings trying to find themselves? Or an existing show
with an established audience that might be more likely to remember
it after a three-month absence?
</P>
<P>
   NBC has pulled a stupid scheduling trick, too. Against the
strenuous objections of the show's producer, the network has put
the ``Law &AMP; Order'' spinoff in an 8 p.m. time slot, where it
definitely should not be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' focuses on sex crimes
cases, usually murders with a sexual twist. In the pilot, a man who
committed multiple rapes is murdered by his victims and has his
penis cut off. This is appropriate material for 8 p.m.?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing NBC for a later slot,'' producer Dick Wolf told
critics in Pasadena, Calif., recently. ``Feel free to help me. This
is not designed to be an 8 o'clock show. It's not appropriate for
that hour. It's a very adult drama.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like NBC doesn't have an easy way out of this quagmire.
``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' is scheduled to air Mondays,
followed by an episode of ``Dateline NBC'' at 9 p.m. So, switch the
two shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes a damn bit of difference what time
`Dateline' airs,'' Wolf snarled angrily. ``It's on five times a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sassa, president of NBC West Coast, said he thought ``Law
&AMP; Order'' will be fine in the earlier time period and will ``carry
an appropriate content rating.'' Big help.
</P>
<P>
   Single and childless adults may be available for an extremely
adult drama at 8 p.m., but people with kids will not want to sit
down to watch this show while the youngsters are wafting through
the room. It's hard to imagine that fans of ``Law &AMP; Order'' will
flock to this spinoff at such an early hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bad scheduling can kill a show before it gets started and drive
viewers away after it's on the air. Last year's annoying habit of
throwing series into reruns after four or five new episodes rankled
more than a few people, especially with shows like ``NYPD Blue''
and ``ER'' that have continuing storylines.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody (hey, I'll be the one!) should tell these network
nitwits to take advantage of good programming when they've got it,
not hammer a stake through its heart.

 &HT;    Wheelchair merchants sued for no handicapped parking
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ A Lake Worth business that has been selling
and repairing wheelchairs for nearly 20 years is scheduled to offer
a brand new service to its customers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapped parking.
</P>
<P>
   For Action Mobility's owners, Dave and Donna Batelaan, the
addition of handicapped parking is a bit of an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought it was a joke,'' Donna Batelaan said,
recalling the federal lawsuit that was delivered to the store last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Batelaan and her husband _ both of whom use wheelchairs _ were
surprised to find their business accused of discriminating against
the handicapped because of an absence of handicapped parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everybody who comes here is handicapped,'' Donna
Batelaan said.
</P>
<P>
   The way she looks at it, the whole lot is handicapped parking.
And when it comes to being sensitive to the access needs of the
handicapped, the Batelaans are local experts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's their business. Action Mobility sells, fixes and
designs mobility devices that make life easier for disabled people.
And Dave Batelaan, a former IBM engineer, is a consultant for other
businesses seeking to comply with the Americans with Disabilities
Act _ the act the store is accused of violating.
</P>
<P>
   Action Mobility appears to be about the most disabled-friendly
place you could imagine. The door opens automatically. There are no
steps to navigate, and the counters are at a height for wheelchair
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this building was designed so that I could get around
it,'' Donna Batelaan said. ``And four of our 17 employees are
handicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Jean Pavlak, 67, of Jupiter, drove to the store with
her daughter to look for a lightweight wheelchair, she was upset to
find no reserved handicapped parking spaces in the store's small
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want them to give the rights to handicapped people that
they deserve,'' Pavlak said.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlak said she has been in a wheelchair for the past five
years, following a fall. And since then, she has come to appreciate
the hardships disabled people face in public. Action Mobility is
the second local business she has sued over access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want the next person to be humiliated or
embarrassed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlak never spoke to the Batelaans, and had no idea that they
are disabled too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just waited there 20 minutes, and when nobody waited on me,
I left,'' Pavlak said.
</P>
<P>
   She went home and contacted her son's lawyer friend, Anthony
Brady, who filed a federal discrimination suit against the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's right is right,'' Donna Batelaan said. ``We'll
certainly comply.''
</P>
<P>
   But a face-to-face request, rather than a federal lawsuit, would
have been all that was needed to address the overlooked issue, said
Joe Fields, the store owners' attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were never given the chance to fix the problem on their
own,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the handicapped spots are installed this weekend, Fields
plans to send photos of them to Pavlak's lawyer to show the store's
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Will it make life easier for disabled customers?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to mean anything,'' said Barbara Scoville, one
of the store's handicapped employees. ``Just about everybody who
comes in here is handicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   It may end up that the person most affected by the lawsuit will
be the lawyer who filed it.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled people who file discrimination cases like this one
aren't entitled to receive money when they prevail in court. But
their lawyers are.
</P>
<P>
   That means Brady can get the store to pay for his attorney fees
and costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing that this happened in a store that makes
money off the handicapped,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he didn't anticipate his fees would be too high for
filing the two-page lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe just a couple thousand,'' he said.

 &HT;    Floridians face tax bite to restore Everglades
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Should we restore the Everglades?
</P>
<P>
   Should we expand South Florida's water supply at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   OK: How about paying a 43 percent rate hike in your water taxes
to pay for it all?
</P>
<P>
   South Florida taxpayers will probably have to unless Gov. Jeb
Bush and the legislature come up with some big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   A federal-state plan being considered by Congress would spend
$7.8 billion on history's grandest environmental restoration _
aimed at re-creating some semblance of natural flow in the
Everglades while providing water to farms and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Half that money, roughly $200 million a year, would come from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The other half would have to come from someone in Florida. And
without any major help from Tallahassee, the money would come
mostly from the taxpayers of South and Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Those taxpayers would shoulder nearly 60 percent of Florida's
burden under one financing scheme devised by the South Florida
Water Management District.
</P>
<P>
   The great bulk of that money would go to the district, the
federal government's partner in the project. But the district would
first have to raise its property tax rate to the maximum allowed
under the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If you own a $125,000 home with a $25,000 homestead exemption,
you would pay $100 a year _ $30.30 more than you do now.
</P>
<P>
   And you'd keep on paying, through taxes and fees to your city
and county governments.
</P>
<P>
   You might also have to pay fees that don't even exist now,
district consultants have suggested. Example: The district could
slap a charge on your local utility for pumping water out of the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   None of those numbers accounts for inflation, rising property
values or the interest on money that the district has to borrow for
the project. In March, district economists said they could face a
$2.5 billion deficit by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The district isn't proposing any tax increase, said Government
Affairs and Communications Director Mike Slayton, who called the
financial outline just a starting point for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of an infinite number of alternatives,'' Slayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But another alternative _ major help from Tallahassee _ has yet
to win a commitment from legislators or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the legislature spurned environmental groups' pleas
for a guaranteed $100 million a year in Everglades money from the
state's land-preservation program. Bush and lawmakers said last
week they're still studying how to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Everglades coordinator Allison DeFoor wouldn't even say
what sources the governor is considering. But he said Bush will
probably decide by January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in the world supports the (restoration),''
DeFoor said. ``All this talk about financing is way premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers oppose any new taxes _ either for the district or
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxes on the people of South Florida should be the last
alternative,'' said Charles Bronson, R-Indian Harbour Beach,
chairman of the state Senate's Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said he's exploring whether the state could draw
$100 million a year from excess money it already collects from
taxing land sales. Another idea: Getting cities and counties to pay
for parts of the project that would help them.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one local government is saying: Don't look at us.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Jupiter Town Council formally objected to paying any
``special'' tax toward the restoration without proof that the town
would gain. The council said Jupiter, which filters salt-laden
water from deep wells, doesn't need the Everglades as a water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Worsening the money quandary is uncertainty about a huge extra
cost: An additional $172 million a year to operate the restoration
project's mammoth network of reservoirs, filter marshes, storage
wells, pumps and floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers want to split the operating costs 50-50 with the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But the Army's brass in the Pentagon
has proposed making Florida pay the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   As big as the restoration's price tag seems, Florida Audubon
Society lobbyist Charles Lee argued that it's a small cost for
ensuring the Everglades' survival and water for 12 million people.
Compare it to the billions that routinely go to highway projects,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that the state's decision-makers are
talking now about how to raise the money, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly have this item on the administration's agenda as a
must-do item,'' Lee said. ``I think they're committed all the way
up to Jeb to do this.''

issues raised by the coming of 2000. (Geewax, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED WEDNESDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Long before Brando and his
``wild ones'' roared across movie screens, scratching, belching,
and terrorizing small towns, kids growing up in Miami in the late
'40s had an outlaw bunch known as ``The Springs Guys.'' They were
too cool for words. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I exhaled and told myself
how lucky I was. The car had started again with only the slightest
flick of the key. The car was parked in an inch of mud about 5 feet
from the edge of a pine forest, not far from a drainage ditch and
about 15 yards from the road. The road had turned. I had not. In a
sudden, driving rain, the car was frictionlessly suspended on the
road's slick, watery surface and was not responding either to
brakes, the steering wheel or my adamantly delivered suggestions.
It was hydroplaning. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal) MOVED

   COXNET PTECH 0821 HIGH-SPEED PROBLEMS _ High speeds and 24-hour
connectivity comes with a price: Users of so-called ``broadband''
services such as cable and digital subscriber lines are more
vulnerable to attacks from hackers than users who connect with
traditional dial-up modems. (Gallaga, Austin American Statesman)
Art includes 3-column color photo of a family using the Internet.

   TECHNOBUDDY _ Take the steps to get the hack out of your hard
drive. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1
column color sig of columnist.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ There are several ways to know when you've hit the
Internet big time. The first is when Yahoo! creates a category of
collected stories and links. Then comes online shopping. The third
element is fan pages and parodies. This summer's cult horror film
sensation ``The Blair Witch Project'' has all three, in quantity.
(Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   GADGETS _ When it comes to figuring out ways to keep things
together, nobody takes a back seat to 3M, the Scotch tape people.
Among their newest wrinkles are removable adhesive pads for hanging
things on the wall and pop-up tape strips. (Cummings, Dayton Daily
News) Art includes 18-pica color photo of sticky pads.

   TECH FILE _ The debate over instant messaging may stifle
progress. (Gallaga, Austin American Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   INTERACTIVE-TV _ Television programmers aren't the only people
trying to create interactive systems these days. Even the VCR is
changing. A new VCR-like device from Phillips not only performs as
a digital VCR, it monitors your viewing habits and suggests other
programs that you might want to watch, based on those habits.
(Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH ILLUSTRATION.
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ Popular column about personal computing written for
the average user. This week: If you worry about a large company
dominating the technology market, chances are you probably worry
about Microsoft. You should worry about Intel, ``Mr. Chips,'
instead. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ Software reviews. This week: Let us now, with a nod
to James Agee, praise famous programs. I submit to you the
proposition that within the bowels of Windows, under the
Accessories button, there lies the very heart of computing, a small
gem of programming, a glass through which all other such endeavors
may be viewed and judged. Oh, yes, my friends, I speak of
Solitaire. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ What's new on the Web. This week: There he was, the
Beastie Boys' rapper Mike D. dressed in the rocker/rapper/slacker
uniform of T-shirt and jeans, slumped before a microphone in a
meeting room at the Marriott Marquis hotel in New York City,
talking about leveraging databases to increase sales and marketing
opportunities on the Web. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ What's new on the Web. This week: It is, after all,
the World Wide Web _ not the neighborhood Web, or the American Web.
And it's still a fast and surprisingly satisfying way to tour the
world _ zapping at the click of a mouse from New Zealand to
Newfoundland. There are, of course, thousands of sites filled with
the kind of information you'd find by reading an atlas and
encyclopedia. But for a really interesting world tour via
cyberspace, try to visit some of the out-of-the-way places ... the
sort of places where the locals hang out. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ What the tech magazines are writing about. This
week: In these fading days of summer there's still time yet to
squeeze in playing a few more new computer games. You can find some
likely choices in the August issue of PC Gamer. The issue features
a list of a host of new reviews. And there's a look at the 10 best
games scheduled for release next year. The new games include
Freelancer, Throne of Darkness, Alone in the Dark 4 and Planet of
the Apes. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ This column, which features news about Apple and
its products, is not available this week. (Haddad , Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Tech briefs on new products and developments. This
week: Years ago, when science fiction novels _ not video games _
were an obsession with most boys and some girls, the robot was
king. The robots of science fiction were wonderful (and sometimes
awful) creatures that could think for themselves and that seemed
like mechanical versions of a real person. For a time, it seemed
almost certain that _ as technology moved to the stage where such
things were possible _ robot housekeepers and waiters would be
common by the end of the century. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   POWERUSER-COLUMN _ The advanced computer users column is not
available this week. (Yandel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   HITECH-CDSHOWER _ Thanks to the Sharper Image, now when you sing
in the shower you can have high fidelity accompaniment. The Sharper
Image, a San Francisco-based retailer specializing in innovative
gifts, is offering the CD Shower Companion, which the company
claims is the first and only water-resistant stereo CD player made
for use in the shower. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 10. WITH

that takes one of the most promising new series of the season and

Such is the case with ABC and ``Once and Again.'' (Holloway, Austin

FOR IOWA STATE COACH, THE TIME TO WIN IS NOW
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Progress in the Dan McCarney Era at Iowa State has been measured
in intangibles, not victories. With just nine victories in four
seasons, the intangibles had better be fairly, well ... tangible.
</P>
<P>
   McCarney said that he has rescued a destitute program that had a
winless season before he arrived. New facilities, bigger, faster
players, a stable coaching staff, and a more competitive team are
all positive signs, McCarney said.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows Iowa State fans are eager for all that to translate
into victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our chances when people outside think you're going to
be 2-9 or 1-10,'' said McCarney, whose .205 winning percentage is
the worst of any Iowa State coach this century. ``That's what I've
seen written and heard said. That's great. We don't lack for any
motivation going into the season, believe me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more genuine excitement behind our enthusiasm this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first four seasons, the highlights have been few. Running
back Troy Davis had consecutive 2,000-yard rushing seasons. Last
year's team beat cross-state rival Iowa for the first time in 15
years, a triumph that also ended a 31-game winless streak in road
games. And the '98 Cyclones closed the season with a victory for
the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about everything you want to talk about, but
nothing matters more than winning,'' said senior running back
Darren Davis, Troy's brother, who needs 2,004 yards rushing to pass
his sibling as the school's career rushing leader and is trying to
become the first Cyclone to rush for 1,000 yards in three
consecutive seasons. ``I just want to win some games this year.
It's time for us to step up. We can't say we're young anymore. This
has to be the year.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarney's five-year contract expires after this season, but he
was given a two-year extension last fall. That provides a modicum
of job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to measure progress for us,'' Iowa State athletic
director Gene Smith said. ``We're a developmental program. We play
in one of the toughest leagues in the country. I think everyone
would agree that Dan has done everything the right way ... creating
the right culture, the right environment for our kids. At some
point, we have to have a winning season and I think this could be
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to be competitive with all of the schools on
our schedule. Being competitive and winning are two different
things. I think we have more opportunity this fall than we've ever
had in Dan's tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State opens with three winnable nonconference games _
Division I-AA Indiana State, cross-state rival Iowa and at
Nevada-Las Vegas. If the Cyclones start 3-0 (the last time they
opened with three victories was 1981), their next six games will be
against Big 12 teams that went to bowls last season _ Kansas State,
Nebraska, Missouri, Colorado, Texas, and Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people told me I was committing professional suicide
taking this job,'' said McCarney, who has won four conference games
during his Ames tenure. ``They said I'd never win at Iowa State,
especially because we were getting ready to go into the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about our depth this season, about the players
listed as backups. In the past we virtually put guys out there we
knew couldn't play winning football in the Big 12. But they were
the best we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely tough to build a program in the Big 12 North.
We were a unanimous choice to finish last in the North and that's
life. Until we get more competitive and start beating those teams,
that's the way it's going to be. We've got to do something about
that.'' nn

`BRUSH' LEAGUER COMING INTO HIS OWN WITH CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The player with the most family members to please at
Safeco Field Sunday doesn't wear a Mariner uniform and never really
paid much attention to baseball in Seattle, even though he's a
Washington native.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland first baseman/outfielder Richie Sexson, who grew up in
Brush Prairie (pop. 2,650) near Vancouver, Wash., treated 36 people
to the game _ part of a growing entourage for the 24-year-old who
was the Indian's 24th round selection in the 1993 June draft.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't send them home disappointed. Sexson hit his 24th homer
of the season, a two-run shot to right field in the 10th inning off
of a Jose Mesa fastball to break a 4-4 tie in Cleveland's 7-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run was nice, but it's always great to do it at home
in front of your family,'' Sexson said.
</P>
<P>
   After six years in the minors, the 6-foot-7, dyed-blond Sexson
got his break last year when All-Star first baseman Jim Thome broke
his hand. Since then, he's become a fan favorite in Cleveland and a
superstar in Brush Prairie, where he still spends part of his
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson is part of a growing list of major leaguers with ties to
the Vancouver area, including San Diego pitcher Randy Myers and M's
left fielder Brian Hunter. Also, Ty Howington, an 18-year-old
left-handed pitcher from Brush Prairie, was selected 14th overall
by Cincinnati in the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   Those four players have helped put Vancouver on the baseball
map, and Sexson is proud of his roots. In fact, his old Senior Babe
Ruth team, Ryder Construction/3 Kings, recently won the state
championship for the third time in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better, for raining as much as it does,'' Sexson
said of the quality of baseball in southwest Washington. ``We can't
play baseball year round like a lot of other kids. But baseball is
actually pretty big where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Thome's injury last season, Sexson bounced back and forth
between Cleveland and Class AAA Buffalo. When he finally got his
chance to start in August and September, he responded by finishing
the season with 11 home runs, 35 RBIs and a .310 batting average in
174 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Thome was ahead of him at first base in the
Cleveland organization, Sexson spent his past two seasons in the
minors learning to play the outfield, where he's starting to feel
comfortable. He also added 20 pounds of mostly muscle in the weight
room to boost his lanky frame to 230 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can play both corners in the outfield, but his best
position is first base,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said.
``And, he's got lots of power.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's hitting .258 in 103 games, with 24 homers and 83
RBsI. But he's batting .304 in his last 28 games and . has been a
thorn for Seattle pitchers, going 5-for-11 with two homers and
seven RBIs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is getting to play for a great team,'' he
said of the chance he's had with the Indians, who own the best
record in baseball and already have the American League Central
Division all but wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson's success hasn't changed the way he's treated around
Brush Prairie, although he's in demand for appearances at his
aunt's fourth-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people there treat me the same,'' he said. ``They realize
where I came from and they know me just the same way. It's not like
I get bothered or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who the 36 tickets were going to, Sexson ticked off a list
of his immediate family: ``Aunts and uncles. Grandmother and
grandfather. Mom and Dad. Brother and wife. And a bunch of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to do well anywhere I go, but obviously to do well here
makes them proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Away from baseball, Sexson has taken up the guitar as a way to
relax. Lately he's been a regular in a band with former Mariner
Mark Langston, who's currently on the disabled list for the Indians
and also plays guitar, and Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel, who
plays drums. On Saturday night, Sexson, Langston and Vizquel even
toted their instruments to Rocksport, a West Seattle club, to
perform in front of a small audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play classic rock, AC-DC, some disco tunes,'' he said.
``Neither of us plays lead guitar. It's just a sound, the chords
you hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sexson family, of course, was well represented at Rocksport.
His parents, he noted, seemed more surprised by his performance on
stage than on the baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing guitar for about two and a half years now,
but I don't really think they knew I took it so seriously,'' he
chuckled.

   VOLES: So you probably heard the big news last week about the
prairie vole, a hamster-sized rodent not usually in the headlines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, according to scientists at Emory University in
Atlanta, that all it takes to transform an aloof, skirt-chasing
laboratory mouse into a more sensitive, caring mate is the addition
of a single gene. From a prairie vole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prairie voles, you see, are famous for being faithful. Not only
that, they're cuddlers _ ``sociable,'' in scientific parlance _ and
males and females share child-rearing duties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, with a little help from the prairie vole, scientists have
built a better mouse, but there's still work to be done. Inserting
the vasopressin receptor gene _ vasopressin is a hormone produced
in most mammals' brains, including humans _ made Mickey and the
guys more likely to increase their ``social contact'' with females.
But the gene didn't make the mice monogamous. By Tim Engle. 25

&HT;        PENNSYLVANIA'S DICKINSON REINVENTS U.S. PATENT OFFICE FOR
INVENTORS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 24, -- Who would have thought that a portable
home soccer net dreamed up by a couple of independent inventors
could excite the newly appointed commissioner of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office?
</P>
<P>
   But former Pennsylvania patent attorney Q. Todd Dickinson has a
soft spot for inventions by the little guy.
</P>
<P>
   He says he gets stopped on the street by inventors who want to
tell him about their newest household or sports equipment product.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love most is hearing inventors talk about their
creations,'' said Dickinson, 46, who practiced law in Philadelphia.
``The home soccer practice net that was portable. It was the
greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   It is exactly that kind of enthusiasm for the non-corporate
inventor that is helping Dickinson quietly reinvent the image of
the U.S. patent and trademark office.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Bruce A. Lehman, who offended the
independent inventors by once referring to them as ``weekend
hobbyists,'' Dickinson says he is intrigued most by inventions like
a cardboard shield that protects railings from paint.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson is trying to make friendlier the agency that sets
patent law policy and issues patents and trademarks to inventors or
corporations responsible for anything from household products to
major corporate technological developments. The PTO will issue its
six millionth patent this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said he appreciates the bigger innovations and says he
is thrilled with medical developments he has seen in his lifetime
like ``AIDS cocktail'' drugs and new surgery techniques.
</P>
<P>
   His office is a showcase for his love of inventions complex and
simple. On his desk, there is a new kind of computer chip -- and a
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With Dickinson at the helm, the PTO created a new division for
independent inventors called the Office of Independent Inventor
Programs that is run by the agency's Technology Group to help small
businesses and inventors.
</P>
<P>
   His two words of advice for independent inventors: be
persistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventors can sometimes underestimate the amount of work
needed once the product is created,'' Dickinson said. ``That's just
part of it. You need to also have a solid business plan. Work
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He has made the Philadelphia intellectual property community
proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a better time for small businesses and
inventors to get patents,'' said Jeffrey Spangler, a spokesman for
the Philadelphia Intellectual Property Association. ``It's good for
inventors and it reflects well on the Philadelphia patent
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Spangler said Dickinson's nomination represents the clout of the
city's patent law community.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton officially nominated Dickinson to be Assistant
Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in
July, but he worked as acting deputy commissioner since January.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said his experiences in Philadelphia as a patent
attorney have prepared him for the new job. He was an attorney with
the Philadelphia law firm of Dechert, Price and Rhoads. From 1990
to 1995, he was chief counsel for intellectual property at Sun
Company Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-year legal career, he has represented major
corporations, small businesses, and inventors.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson earned a B.S. in chemistry from Allegheny College in
1974 and a J.D. from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual property law experts say Dickinson's tenure comes
at a critical time for the agency. He will oversee growth within
the agency and shepherd through an increasing number of patent and
trademark applications.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, patent applications increased 25 percent
and trademark filings are up 16 percent. Last year there were
256,666 patents.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the increase to a booming economy and a time of
technological advancements in computers and the biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson will oversee the PTO's hiring of nearly 1,300 new
patent examiners this year, bringing the total number of examiners
to 3,300.
</P>
<P>
   He said there have been more and more patents for search methods
and Internet auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so exciting to be on the cutting edge of technology and
to see all of the Internet developments,'' Dickinson said. ``We are
really starting to see a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a recent trend of ``sensory'' patents and
trademarks for sights and sounds, he said. For example, for the
last five years, Harley-Davidson has been trying to trademark the
sound that its motorcycles make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harley-Davidson. That's been very controversial,'' he said and
laughed. ``But products and innovations are now the way things move
on a screen, or sound, or smell. It's a new world of patents.''
</P>

PAINFUL REMINDERS OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although nagging questions about funerals and
illegal drugs _ a not-unheard-of combination _ haven't buried Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential aspirations, they certainly have
ripped some of the magic from his high-flying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken advocate of ``personal responsibility'' is being
painfully reminded what it means to be personally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be responsible for answering or continuing to dodge
the queries about whether he used illegal drugs during his ``young
and irresponsible'' years _ and for any subsequent political
fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also would bear responsibility if he or any member of his
staff tried to interfere with a state investigation of a
Houston-based funeral services company _ the second controversy
that has lately shadowed his political trail.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral allegations, which Bush denies, may be more a
reflection, however, of the governmental and political system under
which Texas' elected leaders have long operated.
</P>
<P>
   The system, ripe for abuse, allows special interests to legally
purchase access to governmental officials with large political
contributions. It also gives regulated industries the opportunity
to exercise considerable influence over their state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral allegations stem from an investigation by the Texas
Funeral Service Commission of Service Corporation International
Inc., the country's largest funeral home operator.
</P>
<P>
   Eliza May, the commission's former executive director and a
former official of the Texas Democratic Party, said her
investigation of SCI's embalming practices, which resulted in a
recommended $445,000 fine against the company, led to her firing by
the commission earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   SCI says the agency misinterpreted the state's embalming law and
is appealing the fine. May sued the state and SCI, alleging
interference with her former job.
</P>
<P>
   May says she was fired nine months after she was called into the
office of Joe Allbaugh, the governor's executive assistant, and
asked to explain two SCI inspections. She said SCI chairman Robert
Waltrip and an SCI attorney also were present. Allbaugh now manages
Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip is a longtime friend of the Bush family, and his
company's political action committee has contributed $45,000 to
Bush since the governor's first campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After a Newsweek magazine report, Bush said that he had a brief,
passing conversation with Waltrip and an SCI lobbyist in Allbaugh's
office in 1998, the same day the two SCI representatives had come
to deliver a letter protesting the investigation. But he has denied
trying to influence the investigation and is fighting May's
subpoena to testify in her suit.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if May's complaints are valid. But whether it's the
Funeral Service Commission or some other agency in the cross hairs,
Texas' campaign finance system _ which doesn't limit the size of
special-interest donations to most state officials _ encourages
public skepticism of government.
</P>
<P>
   That skepticism would probably be even greater if more Texans
realized that most state agencies charged with investigating
consumer complaints about everything from accountants to barbers to
doctors are governed by part-time boards with a majority (usually
about two-thirds) of their members from the regulated profession.
</P>
<P>
   Board members are appointed by the governor, but the ratio of
industry to public (or consumer) representatives is dictated by
laws influenced by lobbyists representing the affected industries.
Not too many years ago, many of these boards were composed entirely
of industry representatives, inviting anti-consumer abuses by
appointees eager to protect their business interests.
</P>
<P>
   For technical expertise, professions and industries have to be
represented on regulatory boards. But balance also requires
consumer representation, and, thanks to recent reforms, one-third
of most agency boards is now reserved for public members.
</P>
<P>
   That ratio seems to be mostly working, but there have been
problems. The Funeral Service Commission, for one, has sparked
controversy before.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Legislature gave the nine-member
commission a majority of five public members. Then, this year, some
lawmakers wanted to abolish the agency and transfer its
responsibilities over consumer complaints to the Texas Department
of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, instead, overhauled the agency again. Effective
Sept. 1, it will have a six-member board. Four members, including
the chair, will have to be public members.
</P>

CONTROVERSIAL LAW BLOCKS MEXICAN TEEN-AGER'S VISIT TO U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photos available on NYT database) 
 
By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was supposed to be Graciela Meza's dream trip to
the United States. A chance to visit her sister before returning to
Mexico to begin college.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bewildered 18-year-old Mexican citizen was
interrogated for hours after arriving at Bush Intercontinental
Airport in Houston, thrown in a jail cell overnight and deported
back to Mexico City the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meza told airport immigration authorities that she planned to
help care for her infant niece in Houston during the second leg of
a visit in June. Officials said that caring for a baby in the
family amounted to work, something not allowed under the terms of
Meza's tourist visa.
</P>
<P>
   Meza was labeled an illegal immigrant and deported without so
much as a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The shy teen-ager says she remains traumatized by the memory of
the rough treatment and the sleepless night in a cramped jail cell
with a stinky mattress and a shady cellmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that even drug dealers get treated as badly as
they treated me,'' Meza said in a telephone interview from her
family's home outside Mexico City. ``What did I do that made them
treat me like a criminal?''
</P>
<P>
   She said she still wonders how immigration officials could
believe she needed a work visa for a family visit in which she
planned to occasionally help change her niece's diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a cultural difference,'' Meza said. ``Here (in
Mexico), sisters always help with the baby, and nobody considers it
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service denies that Meza
was mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   An internal review of the June 6 incident shows that officials
acted ``professionally and courteously'' during the deportation
proceeding, said an INS letter sent to Meza's in-laws last month.
</P>
<P>
   Meza's attempt to enter the United States was denied because she
had planned to work as an au pair, or an unpaid child-care worker,
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also noted that Meza had said she planned to take
English classes and had no return ticket to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meza's brother-in-law, U.S. citizen William Gehle Jr., continues
to protest the immigration service's handling of the case. He wants
an apology, a reinstatement of Meza's tourist visa and a refund for
her airline ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS says it considers the matter closed after its
internal review.
</P>
<P>
   Meza's swift deportation came under the terms of a controversial
1996 immigration law giving INS inspectors unprecedented powers to
deport foreigners from airports and border checkpoints without a
hearing _ even when the visitors hold what appears to be a valid
visa. Deportations under the new program began in 1997. More than
30,000 foreigners were summarily deported last year under the
program known as ``expedited removal,'' according to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the new regulation to prevent illegal
immigrants from slipping into the country by demanding a hearing
and then disappearing within the United States before their trial
date.
</P>
<P>
   But immigrant-rights activists and foreigners complain that the
new regulation gives far too much power to the INS officers
stationed at airports and border checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Those deported usually have no right to appeal. Even the INS
acknowledges that the decision can be somewhat arbitrary, based
partly on the instincts of the agent on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have inspectors at the ports of entry who are very
experienced,'' said Thu Nhi Barrus, an INS spokeswoman. ``This
experience is not all scientific. People who work in this field
have something like a (sixth) sense'' telling them when to allow
entry and when to ship the visitor back home.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have complained about the new powers of the INS border
officers, whom they have come to label ``cowboys'' because of their
perceived arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   But INS statistics show that 80 percent of those deported under
the new program are Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   Americans married to foreigners say they, too, have suffered
indirectly under the new program. The law has been used to
summarily deport the foreign wives and husbands of U.S. citizens.
Visits from the in-laws also have become more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Gehle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of these liberals who believes we should open up
the border and give a home to anyone who wants it,'' explains
Gehle, an international business consultant whose wife, Laura, is a
Mexican citizen with U.S. residency. ``But to prevent my
sister-in-law from coming for a visit is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   After the birth of their daughter early this year in Houston,
the Gehles began considering the possibility of visits from Laura
Gehle's family back in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided that Gehle's younger sister, Meza, could come
to Houston for an extended visit before beginning college. It would
be a chance for the teen to see the United States and would also
give the Gehles some help with the baby.
</P>
<P>
   The INS granted Meza a tourist visa after the Gehles signed a
letter promising that the teen-ager would be under their care and
supervision while in the United States. The Gehles promised the INS
that they would pay for all of Meza's expenses, including English
classes. They also signed an affidavit promising to pay for a
return plane ticket when the teen was ready to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Meza first came to Houston early this year. On the first leg of
the visit, she entered the country without a hitch, staying with
the Gehles for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   But then Laura Gehle and Meza decided to have the baby baptized
in Mexico. They decided to go back to their homeland for a one-week
visit in June.
</P>
<P>
   Meza's visa was still current, so the two thought they would
have no trouble going to Mexico for a week and then returning to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But when the sisters arrived June 6 at Bush Intercontinental,
they were separated at the immigration checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities took Meza into a room for an extended interview.
They opened her handbag, read her letters from friends and rifled
through her photos, Meza said. When they asked what she was
planning to do in the United States, Meza said she was visiting her
sister, helping care for her niece and taking some basic English
courses at a local church.
</P>
<P>
   At first, an immigration official told Meza she could only enter
the United States for one month. Meza accepted this limitation.
</P>
<P>
   But then an INS supervisor entered the room, announcing that
Meza would not be allowed into the country at all.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector ``kept insisting and insisting that I was coming
to the U.S. to work,'' Meza recalled. ``I tried to correct her. I
told her I was only going to help my sister with the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Meza, barely 18 at the time and accustomed to relying on family
for support, was not allowed to talk to her sister or
brother-in-law during the extended interview. Noncitizens do not
have a right to an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials repeatedly told Meza that she would not be
allowed into the United States, and they tried to persuade her to
sign a statement agreeing that she had attempted to enter the
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was written in English and translated verbally
into Spanish for Meza. After hours, Meza said, she relented and
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Meza had left her older sister in charge of the luggage and the
cash. With no change of clothes and no money, she was trucked off
to an INS detention center, where guards put her in a small cell
with a woman who was awaiting a criminal trial, Meza said.
</P>
<P>
   An old mattress was thrown on the floor, but Meza spent the
night sitting on the jail-cell bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the airport, the Gehles frantically tried to make
contact with Meza, hoping to at least give the teen-ager a change
of clothes and some money. Their efforts were to no avail. The INS
refused to allow contact and later instructed the Gehles to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the terrified Meza was allowed to make one phone
call. She called the Gehles and told them what flight she would be
on in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   An INS guard escorted Meza to the flight to Mexico City the next
morning. William Gehle waited at the gate, and the guard allowed
him to hand his sister-in-law some cash. The guard then escorted
Meza to her seat on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Gehle said that were it not for his extraordinary effort to make
contact, the INS would have shipped off a penniless 18-year-old to
fend for herself in the largest city in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The INS does not specifically dispute the Gehles' and Meza's
recollection of events, but it argues that the teen-ager's
treatment was routine. INS officials imply that people denied
admission routinely complain about their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret your perception that the inspection was
inappropriate and recognize that the process can seem formidable
and perhaps even intimidating. This is not uncommon when an
admission is denied and the inspection leads to a return instead of
the anticipated continuation of the trip,'' Kenneth J. Elwood,
Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner of the INS Enforcement
Division, wrote in a letter to the Gehles last month.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials say it could have been worse. Foreigners deported
from the United States normally cannot apply for another visa for
five years, Barrus said.
</P>
<P>
   But because Meza cooperated by signing the statement provided by
the INS, she is now eligible to apply for a new visa at any time.
</P>
<P>
   That's small consolation for the teen, now safely back home in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole experience was very traumatic,'' Meza said. ``It
changed what I think of your country. It took away any desire to go
back.''
</P>

SHAM SURGERY: POWER OF THE MIND MAY BE A POTENT PAINKILLER FOR
ARTHRITIC KNEES 

</HEADLINE>

By LEIGH HOPPER  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Orthopedic surgeon Bruce Moseley, a clinical associate
professor at Baylor College of Medicine, was skeptical about a
commonplace operation performed on the painful knees of older
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The patients suffered from osteoarthritis, a crippling,
irreversible condition in which the cartilage covering the bones
has worn away with age. It is the major cause of mobility loss
among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Arthroscopic surgery, in which doctors work through tiny
incisions using a ``scope'' to see, is effective in repairing torn
cartilage from injuries. It cannot replace the missing cartilage in
arthritic patients; doctors can only wash out the joint and scrape,
or debride, the rough spots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly everyone said their arthritic knee pain decreased
after surgery. The question was, why?
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual, groundbreaking study, Moseley and other Houston
researchers are comparing actual surgery to phony, or placebo,
surgery to see whether the operation really helps _ or if people
simply believe it relieves their pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they better because of the procedure or the placebo
effect?'' said Dr. Nelda Wray, an internist who runs a research
unit financed by Baylor College of Medicine and Veterans Affairs.
``(Moseley's) argument was, `we don't know why they hurt in the
first place, and whether this works.'''
</P>
<P>
   The placebo effect is a well-documented phenomenon in which
people experience an improvement in their condition in response to
a phony therapy, such as a sugar pill. Scientists have recently
begun looking at placebos in the context of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Moseley, who is best known as the team physician for
the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets, was
interested in comparing the benefits of rinsing and scraping the
knee joint vs. rinsing alone. He suspected that washing away debris
was what actually gave people relief.
</P>
<P>
   When Wray suggested that they also take a look at the placebo
effect, Moseley was taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `What do you mean placebo? This is surgery!'''
Moseley said. ``The more we learned about it, the more we realized
surgery may have the strongest placebo effect of any
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   A pilot study of 10 patients yielded intriguing results. Five of
the patients received placebo surgery, just three shallow nicks on
their skin so their knees would look like the other patients'.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after sham surgery, patients reported the same amount
of relief from pain and swelling as those who had the real
operation. Four of the five placebo patients said the surgery was
so worthwhile that they would recommend it to a friend. One patient
even requested the operation be repeated on the other knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from the (medical) literature on the placebo effect
that it is a significant effect, and the amount of the effect is
greater with the magnitude of the placebo,'' Wray said. ``If the
pill is bigger, you'll measure a bigger effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Wray suspects that people get better just from an encounter with
a surgeon. The white lab coat, the dramatic setting, the
declaration of ``I'm going to make you better'' have a powerful
effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the current study, the doctors are comparing 180 patients at
the Veterans Affairs Medical Center divided into three groups.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment gives patients a shot at a $2,000 to $5,000
procedure that the VA does not usually offer for arthritis because
of its questionable benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty are getting their knee joints scraped and rinsed, 60 are
getting the rinse only, and 60 are getting no surgery at all. All
of the patients are given a mild sedative and all awake 30 minutes
later, but only the ones getting a surgical procedure receive full
anesthesia. Patients will be tracked for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the doctors met resistance from hospital
administrators when they proposed the study.
</P>
<P>
   To answer concerns about informed consent, participants were
required to state, in their own handwriting, that they understood
there was a one-third chance they would get placebo surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A more difficult question was how doctors could justify giving
placebo patients a sedative, even if the risk of adverse reaction
was tiny. The answer came simply by looking at the question from
another angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger issue to our mind is the 400,000 people a year
getting the surgery without even knowing if it works,'' said Baruch
Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy
at Baylor, who helped design the study. Brody reasoned that the
risks posed by an unproven surgical procedure were far greater than
those from a sedative.
</P>
<P>
   The study will be finished next year, with results scheduled to
be published in October 2000. If researchers find out the surgery
is clearly beneficial, ``we should probably be doing it more than
we're doing now,'' Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
   But if sham surgery works as well as or better than real
surgery, will doctors recommend that everyone get the placebo
operation?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what we're going to propose,'' Moseley said.
``We'll have to say that as expensive as arthroscopy surgery (for
arthritis) is, we probably can redirect those resources in a better
way for treatment of arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Gilbert, a VA patient who lives near Cleveland, Texas,
signed up for the current study two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old water-well drill contractor recently completed
his follow-up visits and learned he had actual surgery _ and he's
convinced it worked.
</P>
<P>
   A hand grenade in the Korean War paralyzed his left knee, and
osteoarthritis in his right knee worsened over the years until he
could only walk a few steps.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after surgery, Gilbert was walking. Soon, he could
jump and run _ and he didn't care whether it was because of sham
surgery or the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter. It stopped the pain,'' he said. ``I didn't
wonder what it was.''

SLEEPING SICKNESS: DIVER HELPS PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON NARCOLEPSY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ky., Tenn.) 
 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston diver Tracy Bonner thought she was just tired, a little
drowsy maybe, because of her whirlwind schedule of classes,
studying, practicing and traveling to meets.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the University of Kentucky athlete explained away the
falling asleep in classes after early morning diving practices,
nodding off behind the wheel of her car or dropping off during a
telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would fall asleep at workouts for my diving,'' Bonner, 25,
said from Knoxville, Tenn., where she attends UK and trains.
``Things you take for granted that you wouldn't fall asleep during,
I would fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her that she had narcolepsy, a debilitating
neurological condition that causes excessive, daytime drowsiness
and a tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 200,000 Americans of all walks of life may suffer,
some silently and unknowingly, from this condition. The sleep
attacks can last a few minutes or more than a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner takes Dexedrine, a powerful stimulant, to keep awake and
alert. Last week, she received a one-year suspension from competing
from FINA, the international swimming and diving body, because it
is a banned substance. Her Olympic aspirations are in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Between Bonner's case and the recent discovery of the gene that
researchers in Texas and California believe causes narcolepsy, the
disorder has been in the news recently and is finally starting to
register on the nation's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know about narcolepsy,'' she said.
``Hopefully, this will open some people's eyes and they can go and
get checked out and they can get treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy changes lives. But not for the better.
</P>
<P>
   This is a condition that can ruin lives, say sleep disorder
specialists. It isolates, shames, impairs performance at school,
makes it hard to hold down a job and brings pain _ physical and
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Narcolepsy at Stanford University reports that
because sufferers' sleep at night is disrupted, they are usually
not as alert during the day. Because of this they are accident
prone, with about 10 times the rate of auto accidents as the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health reports that about 135,000
Americans suffer from narcolepsy. Some estimates put the number at
200,000, and it could be higher.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Max Hirshkowitz, director of the Sleep Research Center at
Baylor College of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center
on Houston, studies sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   The center took part in a study of a new drug, modafinil, for
the condition. Modafinil helps people stay awake without the
jolting side effects of amphetamines and other stimulants. The
brand name is Provigil.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshkowitz said narcolepsy isn't difficult to diagnose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But narcolepsy isn't taught much at medical schools,'' he
said. ``If (doctors) haven't been taught about narcolepsy, it
doesn't cross their minds. That's why it takes 10 to 12 years to
diagnose unless you have someone who stumbles across it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the symptoms of narcolepsy can be mistaken for a heart
condition, a thyroid disorder or even epilepsy, Hirshkowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the sleep attacks, some narcoleptics can suffer from
cataplexy, sudden episodes where they lose muscle function and
experience a weakness in the knees or total body collapse. This is
triggered by emotional responses such as laughter, anger or fear.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Crews, 65, of Houston questioned her sanity before a
doctor told her she had narcolepsy and cataplexy in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bonner, she takes Dexedrine. Like Bonner, she wishes she
wasn't dependent on the medication to live a normal life. Prolonged
use can lead to addiction and other negative health-related side
affects.
</P>
<P>
   Crews, who is able to drive and exercise with the help of the
medication, has weaned herself off higher dosages, but she still
needs one dose a day. She said she is angry that Bonner has been
banned for using the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand how she has to take the Dexedrine,'' said the
Houston retiree. ``It is a dangerous drug, but what is your
alternative? What kind of life do you have without it? You don't
have a life without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I was diagnosed, I felt like I was losing my mind,''
Crews said. ``Things were happening to me, and I would do strange
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Falling asleep on a bus was not a problem, she said. Falling
asleep on the assembly line for minutes at a time was, and she
didn't realize she nodded off until a co-worker told her.
</P>
<P>
   But the narcolepsy is not as frightening and embarrassing for
Crews as cataplexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're laughing, telling a joke or getting angry at someone
and it hits you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner said she used to have laughing fits when someone struck
her as funny and fall down.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ray Martin does not suffer from cataplexy but he has
narcolepsy. Until he was diagnosed, the condition caused him, as he
understates it, ``a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It most certainly caused me to feel humiliated, but one of the
worst problems in the world was it effected me economically because
I couldn't hold a job,'' said Martin. ``I would work hard, but I
would fall asleep and they would fire me.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-time director of the Progressive Amateur Boxing
Association, or PABA, said he was discharged from the Air Force as
``an unproductive airman'' because he dozed off.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military physician who examined him was aware of
narcolepsy, Martin said the doctor wrote that his nodding off was a
character problem and representative of a lack of ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Martin tried Dexedrine but switched to another narcolepsy
medication because he was boxing competitively at the time and
didn't want it to interfere with his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kept me awake, but I didn't like the sensation of taking
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin now takes Provigil and is a member of a Houston
narcolepsy support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous help to know there were other individuals
who had the same problem I had,'' he said. ``For so long, I was
isolated and felt I was the only one with this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner wants to start a support group in Knoxville when she has
more time. That will probably be after the Olympics. She and her
synchronized diving partner, Kathy Pesek, also of Houston, hope
FINA will reduce suspension to six months.
</P>
<P>
   They are the national champions in the 3-meter, and their
speciality will be an Olympic event for the first time next year in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner argues that even with Dexedrine, she is not at 100
percent alertness. And her sport, an event of precision and
mechanics, is not enhanced by stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be on Dexedrine,'' she said. ``I hate the fact
I have to take a medication every day just to function in normal
life situations. I hate having to rely on this substance to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   And switching to Provigil is not an option yet. She doesn't know
whether it will work for her or whether it will work enough. Her
hectic pre-Olympic training and competition schedule doesn't have
room for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are climbing up a ladder that's 10 to 15 feet up in
the air, you don't want to worry about falling asleep and falling
onto the concrete,'' Bonner said.
</P>

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Less than 72 hours after the Bruins established an NHL
precedent, rendering Dmitri Khristich a free agent rather than pay
him $2.8 million this year, the Red Wings Friday prevented Nicklas
Lidstrom from returning to play in Sweden, keeping him in Detroit
with a contract that will bring the star defenseman some $22
million over the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the Bruins figure they're exercising fiscal prudence,
working within reasonable budgetary bounds.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, owner Mike Ilitch keeps the money tap open wide, his
well-heeled Wings skating in lockstep to the bank with the Rangers.
The Blueshirts this summer committed $62.85 million to recruit five
free agents, hoping to revive a moribund, Wayne Gretzky-less lineup
that hasn't been to the playoffs since the spring of '97.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, as the weeks and months go by, the NHL becomes
increasingly polarized. There are the haves, the have-nots, and in
the Bruins' case, the will-nots.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, the tight-spending Bruins have their allies,
typically smaller-market clubs and, lately, even some bigger-market
clubs. Late last season, even the powerful, high-spending Canadiens
began to downsize their payroll, moving out the likes of Mark
Recchi and underperforming team captain Vincent Damphousse. The
large-market Colorado Avalanche opted not to throw money at Theo
Fleury, after acquiring him from Calgary for a playoff run last
spring, and also chose not to retain forward Valeri Kamensky or
defenseman Sylvain Lefebvre. All three will work on Broadway this
season, earning an average of $4.5 million-plus.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the free-spending Rangers and Red Wings are
hardly alone. The Flyers have Eric Lindros as their $8.5 million
centerpiece. The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim came to terms in the
offseason with their superstar, Paul Kariya, agreeing to pay the
former Maine Black Bear $30 million over the next three seasons.
Even the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins, on the hook to pay Jaromir
Jagr in excess of $10 million this season, continue to be
aggressive in their signings, recently retaining free agents Alexei
Kovalev and Martin Straka for more than $2 millon per year each. As
the dollars flowed inside the Igloo, former superstar Mario Lemieux
frantically continued his attempt to cobble together a deal to buy
the club.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the polarization, however, there may be detectable signs of
a market shift, the most overt of which is Boston's decision to
send Khristich packing. In the four-plus years that the current
Collective Bargaining Agreement has been in place, no team ever
acted like the Bruins Tuesday, setting Khristich free after
learning an arbitrator granted him an $850,000 raise over his
1998-99 salary.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a shift, it could be part of what NHL commissioner
Gary Bettman Saturday depicted as the ``pendulum'' of player
salaries. The CBA, signed in January 1995 after a 100-plus day
lockout, is still evolving, he said. He stressed the CBA is a
toolbox clubs can use to level off or pull back salaries, if they
determine that is necessary. Walkaway arbitration is one of the
tools.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Boston's move regarding Khristich could be
the harbinger of more walkaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see more,'' said Darcy Regier, general manager
of the small-market Buffalo Sabres. ``It took 4 1/2 years for the
first one, I think, because there was a general optimism that we,
as a league, somehow would be able to control costs. But it hasn't
been effective. In some cases, teams have incurred tremendous
losses. In Buffalo's situation, it's common knowledge that our
losses are mounting up and continue to accrue.''
</P>
<P>
   In Regier's estimation, the Bruins, by signing former Sabre Dave
Andreychuk over the summer, had a strategy in place when they cut
Khristich free. Boston president/general manager Harry Sinden
underscored that fact Tuesday when he said the move to get
Andreychuk was made, in part, anticipating what the club believed
might be an onerous arbitration award for Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell exactly what we'll see,'' said Regier.
``But I think for sure we'll see more of that kind of planning in
place. It's one thing to walk, but you've got to have a plan in
place, have alternatives if you decide not to keep a player for
whatever reason. I can tell you, with salaries where they are,
we're definitely planning more here.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based agent Mark Witkin, who represents Bruins Don
Sweeney and Hal Gill, among others, said last week he felt NHL
teams ``would like to see a couple of big public floggings'' when
it came to player salaries. The first of those hits could be
Khristich's, if no club comes forward and offers him a deal.
Khristich maintains the right to play in Boston next season for
$1.95 million _ the figure the Bruins offered in arbitration _ but
his agent, Larry Kelly, emphatically stated last week that the
Ukrainian winger won't play again in the Hub.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also heavily hinted at the possibility of collusion among
owners if he sees his client go without an offer. He chose his
words carefully, referring to the possibility of Khristich's being
cut free being ``orchestrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players'
Association, steered clear of a possible controversy over
collusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion on it is, the system will work,'' said Goodenow.
</P>
<P>
   Goodenow depicted Boston's decision to cut Khristich free as a
``pricing issue.'' The Bruins didn't want to pay what an arbitrator
set as Khristich's market value and now, exposed to the full
market, Khristich will find out what it will bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dmitri Khristich is a solid NHL contributor,'' said
Goodenow. ``Obviously, it didn't work out for Harry (Sinden) and
Pat (Burns). But that seems to be a pricing issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt there would be more walkaways in the future,
Goodenow said with a casual air, ``Time will determine that.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of players' agents contacted last week following the
Khristich decision said they detected a change in management's
attitude toward some unrestricted free agents in recent months.
While there have been some significant scores by some high-profile
players this summer (Fleury) and some lesser-profile players (Tim
Taylor), some previously highly compensated players, now getting
long in the tooth, have agreed to continue their careers at
substantial discounts.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... substantial discounts.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For instance, Andreychuk, who will be 36 next month, took more
than a 50 percent pay cut when he agreed to a one-year, $1.2
million deal to play in Boston. Former Bruins netminder Bill
Ranford, 32, made more than $3 million last year and recently
signed with the Oilers as a backup at $455,000. Making it easier
for Ranford: He still has $2 million coming his way after having
the final year of his contract bought out.
</P>
<P>
   With training camps ready to open in less than two weeks, some
better-known unrestricted free agents also are still looking for
work. Pat Verbeek made $3.2 million in Dallas last season, the last
year of a three-year $9.3 million free agent deal he signed with
the Stars. Right now, he's 35 and unemployed. It doesn't look like
the Sabres will bring back former Bruin Joe Juneau, who made $2.2
million last year, a deal he originally signed in Washington. Many
figured Ulf Samuelsson, dealt from New York to Detroit at the trade
deadline in March, would end up back on Broadway. Samuelsson, 35,
made $2 million last year, and at the moment remains out on the
range and not a Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking, `Are teams going to be more focused on their
payrolls?' '' said Steve Freyer, longtime agent for Boston captain
Ray Bourque, ``I'd say the resounding answer is yes. But do I think
we'll begin to see more walkaways? No, I don't. You're dealing with
an organization (Boston) that pays close attention to payroll, and
they've made a value judgment about one player. I think that's all
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fee, an agent along with former Bruins great Bobby Orr at
Woolf Associates, recently began representing Joe Murphy, who made
$3.8 million with the Sharks last year. Fee acknowledges Murphy
won't make nearly the same money in his next deal and says he
detects a significant slowdown in the signings of unrestricted free
agents overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years past, it seems there was an early and consistent
level of activity in these signings,'' said Fee. ``The reverse
might be true now. GMs are taking a more wait-and-see approach.
What changed? Probably some clubs weren't happy with what they got
_ they spent significant money and didn't get the expected
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams are showing more fiscal restraint, said Phoenix GM Bobby
Smith, with a much more critical eye in assessing older talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit the wall at 35,'' said Smith, once an accomplished
scorer in his days with Minnesota and Montreal. ``I remember I used
to get three or four scoring chances a game. I hit 35 and it was
one chance every four games.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver GM Brian Burke, who worked for the league office when
the current CBA was negotiated, said he was surprised it took 4 1/2
years for the first walkaway to be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, there was some conjecture that the Canadiens might
choose not to pay Recchi the $4.5 million he was granted in
arbitration or that St. Louis could opt to let Pierre Turgeon, who
won a $4.65 million award, walk. Recchi eventually was dealt to the
Flyers. The Blues kept Turgeon all season and recently signed him
for two years at about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Will more walkaways follow?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Burke said, emphatically. ``I have hope this
business can return to fiscal sanity for the first time in years. I
think what Boston did was terrific. It used to be that the GM was
in the foxhole all alone, fighting these battles for himself, and
in many cases team owners just said pay. Now, I see team ownership
looking at the bottom line. If you have to make a fearless decision
based on money, you can do it if you've got the owner's blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' said Nashville GM David Poile, referring to the
possibility of more walkaways, ``that question doesn't have an
answer. Next year at this time we'll see if there have been more of
these, and what the financial state of the league is as a whole.
Overall, I think what you're seeing is a reality. Each team is
looking at the bottom line, and in a lot of cases they're seeing
losses. It's a costly business. Just to keep the players you have _
never mind go after unrestricted players _ often means offering a
player at least the 10 percent qualifying raise. On a $2 million
salary, that's another $200,000. All of a sudden, your $25 million
payroll is $27.5 million. Where do you add the revenues to pay the
$2.5 million? It's not brain surgery to figure out this is a lot of
money. The bottom line is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodenow said it is still too early to draw conclusions from the
non-signings among the unrestricted free agents. Many, if not most,
could come to terms in the days before the season begins or even
later.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mid-1990s' onset of rocketing salaries, the NHL pay
scale was a vastly different world. Goodenow refers to it as the
time before the ``market being in place.'' Free agency didn't
exist, all but prohibiting player-induced movement. Typically,
players saw modest pay increases throughout their careers. Rarely
did they see their earnings get trimmed. They exited on their
highest paydays. The trend now could be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the market in place,'' acknowledged Goodenow, ``the
players fully understand they may have to adjust at the back end of
their careers. That doesn't come as a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Witkin sees a concerted effort on management's side to change
some of the salary dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did (Bob) Dylan say?'' he remarked. `` `You don't have to
be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing.' What, did
(GMs and owners) all get religion independently? I can't see the
wind, but I think the leaves are moving around.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It was full summer in southern Indiana. Bob Ervin was so hard at
work cobbling together his daughter's playhouse in the back yard
that he didn't notice anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the playhouse and felt fine _ for a week or so. Nine
days later he woke in a sweat. Unable to return to sleep, he got up
at 3 a.m. and turned on the light. The pain in his eyes was so
sharp it felt like a stabbing knife. He flipped the light off and
spent the rest of the night in a feverish sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he went to the family doctor. An examination
revealed a fever of 102. Except for some blood in his urine,
nothing was unusual. The doctor gave him Bactrim, an antibiotic
commonly used to treat urinary infections.
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, Ervin dutifully took the antibiotic, but
the fever never broke. By the end of the week he was tired and
weak; he came to the emergency room with a temperature of 103.5.
The emergency-room physician's examination failed to reveal any
sign of infection, and the chest X-ray was clear. Routine blood
cultures and chemistries were drawn and sent to me in the
hospital's pathology lab.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ervin was sweating so much he was at risk of
dehydration. The emergency-room physician decided to admit him with
the diagnosis ``fever of unknown origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Ervin was admitted, his family doctor visited and
combed his history for a hidden cause one more time. Ervin denied a
host of symptoms: coughing, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain on
urination, recent weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The only new details were vague complaints about discomfort
after eating.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor then reviewed the initial laboratory results. The
routine blood cultures for infections were all negative, but the
blood count didn't look normal. Blood counts tell whether three
types of cells _ white, red and platelets _ are in correct
proportion. Mr. Ervin had low levels of all three, a condition
called pancytopenia. And the levels of his liver enzymes _ which
increase in the case of infection or early liver damage _ were
high. He had anemia, weakness and fever.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to unite as many of the symptoms as possible in a single
diagnosis, the doctor concluded that Ervin's symptoms spelled acute
cholecystitis: an inflamed gallbladder.
</P>
<P>
   The gallbladder, roughly the size of a kiwi fruit, lies just
beneath the liver. Its job is to store bile produced by the liver
and secrete it whenever fat needs to be digested.
</P>
<P>
   When the gallbladder is acutely inflamed, it's usually because
stones _ clumps of fatty material or bile pigment _ have
accumulated inside it.
</P>
<P>
   A patient who has a gallbladder problem will often have fever,
elevated liver enzymes and some discomfort after eating. An
ultrasound of the abdomen revealed signs of gallstones.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Nevins, a surgeon, was called in for a consultation. She
felt that something didn't fit the diagnosis: the pancytopenia.
Problems in the gallbladder aren't associated with drops in blood
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been visiting anywhere?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Colorado. I was hiking last month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you bitten by any animals or bugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few ticks here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean `here and there'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in Indiana, some in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon left the room and came to see me.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks harboring a bacterium called Rickettsia rickettsii
transmit one of the most common tick-borne diseases, Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ervin's signs and symptoms seemed to fit that diagnosis: the
pancytopenia, the fever, the elevated liver enzymes and the tick
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have any spots?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I could see,'' Nevins said.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly scanned the description in the text and found that a
small percentage of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever do
not have spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we confirm it?'' Nevins asked.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the current pathology textbook to see what I could
find on diagnostic tests for the disease. She glanced into the text
I was reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about that one, the one in the next paragraph _
chaffeensis.''
</P>
<P>
   I skimmed the passage. Lone star ticks infected with the
bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis, transmit ehrlichiosis, which was
first diagnosed in humans in 1986. Its full name is human monocytic
ehrlichiosis because the bacterium thrives inside white blood cells
called monocytes.
</P>
<P>
   Since E. chaffeensis doesn't grow in any standard laboratory
media, blood cultures for the infection turn up negative. The
disease usually shows up in middle-aged men with recent tick bites,
and their symptoms are typically fever, pancytopenia, elevated
liver enzymes and photophobia, or extreme light sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard of ehrlichiosis, but I wasn't aware of cases in
southern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey, it looks like a perfect fit,'' I said. ``Tell him that
tetracycline will probably clear it up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   She headed out to talk with Ervin. Now it was my job to confirm
the diagnosis. First I called a medical microbiologist at Indiana
University. He'd never seen an ehrlichiosis case and suggested I
call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A few phone calls later, I learned of an antibody test that
could identify it. The problem, though, was that it couldn't tell
if the infection was current. I needed something better.
</P>
<P>
   I logged onto the National Library of Medicine's Web site. A
list of 20 articles on ehrlichiosis popped up. One described a new
method of testing for the pathogen's nucleic acid in the patient's
blood. The author was Stephen Dumler, a medical microbiologist at
Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   After a few phone calls, we found out what kind of blood sample
to prepare, drew Mr. Ervin's blood and sent it off to Dumler. Two
days later, he called to confirm that the test had detected the
presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis. We had nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the surgeon had started Mr. Ervin on a weeklong
course of antibiotics. His temperature returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year has passed since Ervin encountered that tick in
the woods of southern Indiana. It is now, once again, full summer
here, but this time we know the beast.

THE LATEST FAD FROM LA-LA LAND: A `DESIGNER VAGINA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ The clear plastic model of a vagina on
Dr. David Matlock's otherwise empty desk is flawless, both
anatomically and aesthetically. It is intended as the ideal. It's
what his female patients want.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the more accepted cosmetic surgeries such as breast
augmentations, eye lifts and tummy tucks, Matlock offers what his
publicist discreetly describes as an essential service for women
with a certain physical dysfunction. Advertisements for his Beverly
Hills medical practice, featuring an array of barely clad beauties,
put it more bluntly: ``Ladies. If you are self-conscious about
showing `The Full Monty' there is a solution. . . . You won't
believe how good sex can be!''
</P>
<P>
   That controversial _ and clinically unproven _ promise has
pulled women by the hundreds into Matlock's salmon-and-cream
surgical center, all of them eager, many of them desperate, for the
latest trend in self improvement: plastic surgery to enhance sexual
pleasure. Whether driven by vanity or medical necessity, they are
willing to pay thousands of dollars and to undergo resculpting,
tightening and trimming via Matlock's laser. Afterward, many speak
of the doctor in a tone approaching reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, because Dr. Matlock gave me back my life,'' said
Maria, 34, an image consultant and mother of two from Chicago whose
difficult childbirths left her with a misshapen vagina and other,
painful problems. ``They say sex doesn't matter. It does. In fact,
before sex was so uncomfortable it probably resulted in my divorce.
Now I'm functioning like a normal human being.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Matlock sounds like a man sure of what women want
and glad to give it to them. In some cases, he'll even restore
hymens in brides-to-be. But the gynecologist and board-certified
plastic surgeon sounds proudest of what he calls ``laser vaginal
rejuvenation,'' the one-hour procedure that has brought patients
from around the country to his marble office suite and landed him
on shockjock Howard Stern's radio show. He says he's performed more
than 1,000 of them in the last decade or so, almost half of them
since the ad began running 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   As even Matlock concedes, his is a modified version of an
operation to correct vaginal relaxation and related symptoms. One
cause can be prolapse, a collapse of the bladder or uterus into the
vaginal canal, when pelvic muscles and ligaments are damaged or
weakened. More often, it manifests itself in stress urinary
incontinence, that sometimes accompanies exercise, coughing or
sexual intercourse after childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Matlock readily explains his technique in precise clinical
terms. But it's not his choice of instrument, laser over scalpel to
reduce bleeding, that has gotten women's attention. It's his pitch,
centered around sex.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to be one of a few doctors willing to perform the
surgery to enhance sexual gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Most other doctors, he said, would try and convince a woman that
her ``symptoms'' are the normal side effects of aging and dissuade
her from having the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying, `Yes, I'll do it.' . . . This is involving the
quality of life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a feature of the surgery that some other doctors
dispute. While Matlock cites Masters and Johnson on the importance
of ``frictional forces,'' they say there is no proof that vaginal
tightening improves sex except in the most extreme cases and can,
in fact, cause unnecessary scarring and make intercourse painful.
Repairing a leaky bladder, as opposed to restoring it to its normal
position should also have no effect on the vagina, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Matlock's critics question hyping the cosmetic
angle, regardless whether a woman has an actual physical problem or
only a tendency to buy into the latest trend. His sex enhancement
surgery costs anywhere from $3,500 to $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry absolutely that this will be the next thing they'll
tell women is wrong with them,'' said Dr. Malcolm Lesavoy, a
professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University
of Californa/Los Angeles and chief of both specialties at
Harbor/UCLA Medical Center. ``If you have a problem and things
aren't working correctly, that's a different story. But do it for
yourself, not for your husband, not for your boyfriend, not because
your agent sent you in. . . . Don't be duped.''
</P>
<P>
   Matlock too says he wants women to focus on their own needs, not
anyone else's. He says anyone with a sexual dysfunction such as
anorgasmia, or the inability to achieve orgasm, is best treated
with therapy. He also says if more doctors were sensitive to
women's complaints, he wouldn't be inundated with inquiries from
potential patients. He wouldn't be getting requests for training
sessions from other doctors around the country. And don't get
Matlock started on the help that would be available if men had
similar dysfunctions. He ticks off the scores of devices available
to impotent men and all the medications. Few, after all, questioned
the necessity of Viagra, not even the insurance companies who often
refuse to pay for vaginal rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Matlock himself seems to turn few patients away. Instead, he
offers one anecdote about a divorcee whose husband left her for a
younger woman, another about a woman who made her husband pay
$1,000 every time they had sex after the surgery and still another
about women whose sexual partners have small penises.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is post-virginal, pre-childbearing condition, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In testimonial after testimonial, patients whose names and
numbers Matlock provided swear by his technique and say they don't
know what they would have done had they not found him. None says
she had the surgery purely for cosmetic reasons, although Matlock
says a fair number do.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica, a 30-year-old woman from Riverside, Calif., cites a
litany of medical problems she had before seeing Matlock, from
extensive cramping to heavy bleeding to eventual loss of bladder
control. She had no complaints about sex before, she says, but was
delighted at the unexpected improvement. She has since recommended
the procedure to several friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I didn't even know I had this problem until
afterward,'' said Jessica, who, like most of the other patients,
did not want her full name used. ``I was like, `Wow.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, a 25-year-old student from Orange County who
did not want her name used at all, had the same reaction after
having her labia remodeled in what Matlock has dubbed ``designer
laser vaginoplasty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just get graphic because that's what it's about,'' she
said. ``It's cleaner, it's more hygienic. . . . It's sculpted. It
looks nice. It's perfect. Honestly, I feel sexier.''
</P>
<P>
   Results like that have made designer vaginoplasty Matlock's
second most popular, one usually done for aesthetic reasons.
Sometimes women bring along copies of Playboy centerfolds and tell
him they want theirs to look like that. In turn, Matlock nips with
the laser and plumps with liposuctioned fat, restoring the area to
its youthful shape and sheen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say designer because the woman's the designer and the
doctor's her instrument,'' said Matlock, who is not the only doctor
who performs this procedure but is among those helping to
popularize it.
</P>
<P>
   As Matlock sees it, anything that increases a woman's confidence
stands to improve her sex life. His patients tell him as much, and
so does his booming business. Still, the emphasis remains on the
physical rather than the psychological.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the human sex response cycle _ expectation,
plateau, orgasm, resolution, it's very complex,'' Matlock said.
``All the senses are involved. The brain is involved. I will not
begin to think I can deal with all of that. What I say is that I
can deal with one part, and that's all I'm trying to do, and that
is enhanced sexual gratification.''

   The next day he went to the family doctor. An examination
revealed a fever of 102. Except for some blood in his urine,
nothing was unusual. The doctor gave him Bactrim, an antibiotic
commonly used to treat urinary infections.
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, Ervin dutifully took the antibiotic, but
the fever never broke. By the end of the week he was tired and
weak; he came to the emergency room with a temperature of 103.5.
The emergency-room physician's examination failed to reveal any
sign of infection, and the chest X-ray was clear. Routine blood
cultures and chemistries were drawn and sent to me in the
hospital's pathology lab.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ervin was sweating so much he was at risk of
dehydration. The emergency-room physician decided to admit him with
the diagnosis ``fever of unknown origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Ervin was admitted, his family doctor visited and
combed his history for a hidden cause one more time. Ervin denied a
host of symptoms: coughing, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain on
urination, recent weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The only new details were vague complaints about discomfort
after eating.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor then reviewed the initial laboratory results. The
routine blood cultures for infections were all negative, but the
blood count didn't look normal. Blood counts tell whether three
types of cells _ white, red and platelets _ are in correct
proportion. Mr. Ervin had low levels of all three, a condition
called pancytopenia. And the levels of his liver enzymes _ which
increase in the case of infection or early liver damage _ were
high. He had anemia, weakness and fever.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to unite as many of the symptoms as possible in a single
diagnosis, the doctor concluded that Ervin's symptoms spelled acute
cholecystitis: an inflamed gallbladder.
</P>
<P>
   The gallbladder, roughly the size of a kiwi fruit, lies just
beneath the liver. Its job is to store bile produced by the liver
and secrete it whenever fat needs to be digested.
</P>
<P>
   When the gallbladder is acutely inflamed, it's usually because
stones _ clumps of fatty material or bile pigment _ have
accumulated inside it.
</P>
<P>
   A patient who has a gallbladder problem will often have fever,
elevated liver enzymes and some discomfort after eating. An
ultrasound of the abdomen revealed signs of gallstones.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Nevins, a surgeon, was called in for a consultation. She
felt that something didn't fit the diagnosis: the pancytopenia.
Problems in the gallbladder aren't associated with drops in blood
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been visiting anywhere?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Colorado. I was hiking last month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you bitten by any animals or bugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few ticks here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean `here and there'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in Indiana, some in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon left the room and came to see me.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks harboring a bacterium called Rickettsia rickettsii
transmit one of the most common tick-borne diseases, Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ervin's signs and symptoms seemed to fit that diagnosis: the
pancytopenia, the fever, the elevated liver enzymes and the tick
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have any spots?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I could see,'' Nevins said.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly scanned the description in the text and found that a
small percentage of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever do
not have spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we confirm it?'' Nevins asked.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the current pathology textbook to see what I could
find on diagnostic tests for the disease. She glanced into the text
I was reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about that one, the one in the next paragraph _
chaffeensis.''
</P>
<P>
   I skimmed the passage. Lone star ticks infected with the
bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis, transmit ehrlichiosis, which was
first diagnosed in humans in 1986. Its full name is human monocytic
ehrlichiosis because the bacterium thrives inside white blood cells
called monocytes.
</P>
<P>
   Since E. chaffeensis doesn't grow in any standard laboratory
media, blood cultures for the infection turn up negative. The
disease usually shows up in middle-aged men with recent tick bites,
and their symptoms are typically fever, pancytopenia, elevated
liver enzymes and photophobia, or extreme light sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard of ehrlichiosis, but I wasn't aware of cases in
southern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey, it looks like a perfect fit,'' I said. ``Tell him that
tetracycline will probably clear it up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   She headed out to talk with Ervin. Now it was my job to confirm
the diagnosis. First I called a medical microbiologist at Indiana
University. He'd never seen an ehrlichiosis case and suggested I
call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A few phone calls later, I learned of an antibody test that
could identify it. The problem, though, was that it couldn't tell
if the infection was current. I needed something better.
</P>
<P>
   I logged onto the National Library of Medicine's Web site. A
list of 20 articles on ehrlichiosis popped up. One described a new
method of testing for the pathogen's nucleic acid in the patient's
blood. The author was Stephen Dumler, a medical microbiologist at
Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   After a few phone calls, we found out what kind of blood sample
to prepare, drew Mr. Ervin's blood and sent it off to Dumler. Two
days later, he called to confirm that the test had detected the
presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis. We had nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the surgeon had started Mr. Ervin on a weeklong
course of antibiotics. His temperature returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year has passed since Ervin encountered that tick in
the woods of southern Indiana. It is now, once again, full summer
here, but this time we know the beast.

<P>
   Singing came naturally to the opera mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne,
who made her public debut at a town picnic at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   Her granddaughter Daisy, now just 10 months old, appears to be
even more precocious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I picked her up the other day, I swear I heard her begin
to hum,'' Horne says. ``To test it out, I came in on harmony _ and
she held her pitch. My daughter heard us and nearly passed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after decades of operatic training, Horne is mystified
about what makes it possible for her _ let alone her granddaughter
_ to lift her voice in song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, something's going on down there,'' Horne says,
motioning to her chest. ``But I really don't give it a thought, not
while I'm singing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Horne raises the rafters with a powerhouse aria and Daisy
hums a faint melody, they are each relying on some unusual anatomic
aspects of the throat and mouth that allow humans to transform
lifegiving breath into dynamic sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of music begins with the vocal cords, two skin-covered
flaps of muscle that open and close across the passage to the lungs
and oscillate with a wave motion as air rushes out during
exhalation.
</P>
<P>
   The flaps first appeared some 300 million years ago in the sea
creatures that climbed out of the water onto land and breathed with
lungs rather than through gills.
</P>
<P>
   By quickly closing and opening, the two folds of muscle served
as natural valves, blocking everything but air from entering the
respiratory system and allowing the ejection of phlegm from the
lungs. Otherwise the creatures would have choked to death.
</P>
<P>
   In humans and most of the higher animals, closing off air-filled
lungs with this valve mechanism also stabilizes the body during
muscular exertion, including evacuation of the bowels.
</P>
<P>
   Vocal noisemaking came as something of an evolutionary
afterthought. Eventually, various animals equipped with lungs,
including humans, discovered they could sound warnings or attract
mates by blowing air out and vibrating the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect illustration of what is known as Darwinian
preadaptation,'' says Tecumseh Fitch, a biologist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   One set of human vocal cords looks much like another, except
that men's are slightly bigger than women's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably couldn't tell the difference between Pavarotti
and Mick Jagger by looking at the vocal cords alone,'' says Scott
Kessler, a Manhattan otolaryngologist. For that matter, human vocal
cords closely resemble those of other species.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody did a weird transplant where a singer got a dog's
vocal cords, they could probably do a good job of singing,'' Fitch
says.
</P>
<P>
   In making sound, the vocal cords operate like the open end of a
blown-up balloon, which buzzes rapidly if pulled tight so air can
escape more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Ingo Titze, a physicist at the University of Iowa and director
of the National Center for Voice and Speech, says that air rushing
out of the lungs creates a wave motion in the cords. They slam into
one another, only to blow open again, buffeted by the steady
airflow from the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vibration releases an energy that the human ear and the
brain interpret as sound,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   The sound box in which exhaled air becomes musical notes is the
larynx _ the tip of which forms the Adam's apple _ a cartilaginous
shell that contains and protects the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   In humans, the position of the larynx in the throat is
relatively low, allowing the tongue greater freedom to move and
thus shape sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In dogs, by contrast, the larynx is almost even with the mouth,
severely limiting their ability to control how the bark sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Humans can alter their vocal tone by raising and lowering the
larynx. In addition, trained singers relax and contract muscles
within the larynx in order to produce the resonant waver of
vibrato.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the human vocal instrument consists of the throat,
tongue, mouth, lips and, of course, the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pitch depends on the number of times per second the
vocal cords collide _ ranging from as few as 55 times per second
for a low A sung by a bass, to 1,047 times per second for a
soprano's high C _ the refinement and articulation of the musical
notes take place in the singer's throat and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a trombonist, who pushes the slide out or pushes
it in, making air take a longer or shorter route to get to the
bell, a singer must modulate the passage of breath with a series of
mostly unconscious physical movements. The range of sounds produced
is astounding considering the limited length of the air passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human throat is remarkably short _ just six or seven
inches from the larynx to the lips,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches come from the lips and tongue, which shape
vowels ranging from a mellow U to a sunny E.
</P>
<P>
   Like other instruments, vocal cords can be mistreated and
damaged. Some singers stretch their voices trying to hit high
ranges they weren't born to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Over time this can produce vocal nodes, calluslike knobs that
grow on the vocal cords and prevent them from closing completely
during their oscillation. This condition leads to a raspy, hoarse
voice, even in an 8-year-old songstress struggling to belt out
``Tomorrow'' in Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Blisters, calluses and even hemorrhages affect vocal cords, all
impeding a singer's sound. So the best singers learn to use their
whole bodies to safely summon a precisely controlled flow of air
and to modulate their larynx without straining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor once called me a laryngeal athlete,'' Horne says.
``And it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Singers _ like other athletes _ even find themselves resorting
to drugs to repair the damage brought on by physical stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these people, the show must go on,'' says Kessler,
who tends to some of the most famous throats in the world and
sometimes provides steroids to alleviate hoarseness or other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Singing may come naturally to all humans, but vocal artistry, of
course, is rare and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to that little thing we all call talent,''
Horne says. ``You can't get it, you can't buy it and you can't coax
it. As the song says, `You've either got it _ or you ain't.'''

 By DANIEL C. WEAVER  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It was full summer in southern Indiana. Bob Ervin was so hard at
work cobbling together his daughter's playhouse in the back yard
that he didn't notice anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the playhouse and felt fine _ for a week or so. Nine
days later he woke in a sweat. Unable to return to sleep, he got up
at 3 a.m. and turned on the light. The pain in his eyes was so
sharp it felt like a stabbing knife. He flipped the light off and
spent the rest of the night in a feverish sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he went to the family doctor. An examination
revealed a fever of 102. Except for some blood in his urine,
nothing was unusual. The doctor gave him Bactrim, an antibiotic
commonly used to treat urinary infections.
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, Ervin dutifully took the antibiotic, but
the fever never broke. By the end of the week he was tired and
weak; he came to the emergency room with a temperature of 103.5.
The emergency-room physician's examination failed to reveal any
sign of infection, and the chest X-ray was clear. Routine blood
cultures and chemistries were drawn and sent to me in the
hospital's pathology lab.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ervin was sweating so much he was at risk of
dehydration. The emergency-room physician decided to admit him with
the diagnosis ``fever of unknown origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Ervin was admitted, his family doctor visited and
combed his history for a hidden cause one more time. Ervin denied a
host of symptoms: coughing, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain on
urination, recent weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The only new details were vague complaints about discomfort
after eating.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor then reviewed the initial laboratory results. The
routine blood cultures for infections were all negative, but the
blood count didn't look normal. Blood counts tell whether three
types of cells _ white, red and platelets _ are in correct
proportion. Mr. Ervin had low levels of all three, a condition
called pancytopenia. And the levels of his liver enzymes _ which
increase in the case of infection or early liver damage _ were
high. He had anemia, weakness and fever.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to unite as many of the symptoms as possible in a single
diagnosis, the doctor concluded that Ervin's symptoms spelled acute
cholecystitis: an inflamed gallbladder.
</P>
<P>
   The gallbladder, roughly the size of a kiwi fruit, lies just
beneath the liver. Its job is to store bile produced by the liver
and secrete it whenever fat needs to be digested.
</P>
<P>
   When the gallbladder is acutely inflamed, it's usually because
stones _ clumps of fatty material or bile pigment _ have
accumulated inside it.
</P>
<P>
   A patient who has a gallbladder problem will often have fever,
elevated liver enzymes and some discomfort after eating. An
ultrasound of the abdomen revealed signs of gallstones.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Nevins, a surgeon, was called in for a consultation. She
felt that something didn't fit the diagnosis: the pancytopenia.
Problems in the gallbladder aren't associated with drops in blood
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been visiting anywhere?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Colorado. I was hiking last month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you bitten by any animals or bugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few ticks here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean `here and there'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in Indiana, some in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon left the room and came to see me.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks harboring a bacterium called Rickettsia rickettsii
transmit one of the most common tick-borne diseases, Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ervin's signs and symptoms seemed to fit that diagnosis: the
pancytopenia, the fever, the elevated liver enzymes and the tick
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have any spots?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I could see,'' Nevins said.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly scanned the description in the text and found that a
small percentage of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever do
not have spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we confirm it?'' Nevins asked.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the current pathology textbook to see what I could
find on diagnostic tests for the disease. She glanced into the text
I was reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about that one, the one in the next paragraph _
chaffeensis.''
</P>
<P>
   I skimmed the passage. Lone star ticks infected with the
bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis, transmit ehrlichiosis, which was
first diagnosed in humans in 1986. Its full name is human monocytic
ehrlichiosis because the bacterium thrives inside white blood cells
called monocytes.
</P>
<P>
   Since E. chaffeensis doesn't grow in any standard laboratory
media, blood cultures for the infection turn up negative. The
disease usually shows up in middle-aged men with recent tick bites,
and their symptoms are typically fever, pancytopenia, elevated
liver enzymes and photophobia, or extreme light sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard of ehrlichiosis, but I wasn't aware of cases in
southern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey, it looks like a perfect fit,'' I said. ``Tell him that
tetracycline will probably clear it up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   She headed out to talk with Ervin. Now it was my job to confirm
the diagnosis. First I called a medical microbiologist at Indiana
University. He'd never seen an ehrlichiosis case and suggested I
call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A few phone calls later, I learned of an antibody test that
could identify it. The problem, though, was that it couldn't tell
if the infection was current. I needed something better.
</P>
<P>
   I logged onto the National Library of Medicine's Web site. A
list of 20 articles on ehrlichiosis popped up. One described a new
method of testing for the pathogen's nucleic acid in the patient's
blood. The author was Stephen Dumler, a medical microbiologist at
Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   After a few phone calls, we found out what kind of blood sample
to prepare, drew Mr. Ervin's blood and sent it off to Dumler. Two
days later, he called to confirm that the test had detected the
presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis. We had nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the surgeon had started Mr. Ervin on a weeklong
course of antibiotics. His temperature returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year has passed since Ervin encountered that tick in
the woods of southern Indiana. It is now, once again, full summer
here, but this time we know the beast.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It was full summer in southern Indiana. Bob Ervin was so hard at
work cobbling together his daughter's playhouse in the back yard
that he didn't notice anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the playhouse and felt fine _ for a week or so. Nine
days later he woke in a sweat. Unable to return to sleep, he got up
at 3 a.m. and turned on the light. The pain in his eyes was so
sharp it felt like a stabbing knife. He flipped the light off and
spent the rest of the night in a feverish sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he went to the family doctor. An examination
revealed a fever of 102. Except for some blood in his urine,
nothing was unusual. The doctor gave him Bactrim, an antibiotic
commonly used to treat urinary infections.
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, Ervin dutifully took the antibiotic, but
the fever never broke. By the end of the week he was tired and
weak; he came to the emergency room with a temperature of 103.5.
The emergency-room physician's examination failed to reveal any
sign of infection, and the chest X-ray was clear. Routine blood
cultures and chemistries were drawn and sent to me in the
hospital's pathology lab.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ervin was sweating so much he was at risk of
dehydration. The emergency-room physician decided to admit him with
the diagnosis ``fever of unknown origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Ervin was admitted, his family doctor visited and
combed his history for a hidden cause one more time. Ervin denied a
host of symptoms: coughing, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain on
urination, recent weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The only new details were vague complaints about discomfort
after eating.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor then reviewed the initial laboratory results. The
routine blood cultures for infections were all negative, but the
blood count didn't look normal. Blood counts tell whether three
types of cells _ white, red and platelets _ are in correct
proportion. Mr. Ervin had low levels of all three, a condition
called pancytopenia. And the levels of his liver enzymes _ which
increase in the case of infection or early liver damage _ were
high. He had anemia, weakness and fever.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to unite as many of the symptoms as possible in a single
diagnosis, the doctor concluded that Ervin's symptoms spelled acute
cholecystitis: an inflamed gallbladder.
</P>
<P>
   The gallbladder, roughly the size of a kiwi fruit, lies just
beneath the liver. Its job is to store bile produced by the liver
and secrete it whenever fat needs to be digested.
</P>
<P>
   When the gallbladder is acutely inflamed, it's usually because
stones _ clumps of fatty material or bile pigment _ have
accumulated inside it.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Singing came naturally to the opera mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne,
who made her public debut at a town picnic at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   Her granddaughter Daisy, now just 10 months old, appears to be
even more precocious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I picked her up the other day, I swear I heard her begin
to hum,'' Horne says. ``To test it out, I came in on harmony _ and
she held her pitch. My daughter heard us and nearly passed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after decades of operatic training, Horne is mystified
about what makes it possible for her _ let alone her granddaughter
_ to lift her voice in song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, something's going on down there,'' Horne says,
motioning to her chest. ``But I really don't give it a thought, not
while I'm singing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Horne raises the rafters with a powerhouse aria and Daisy
hums a faint melody, they are each relying on some unusual anatomic
aspects of the throat and mouth that allow humans to transform
lifegiving breath into dynamic sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of music begins with the vocal cords, two skin-covered
flaps of muscle that open and close across the passage to the lungs
and oscillate with a wave motion as air rushes out during
exhalation.
</P>
<P>
   The flaps first appeared some 300 million years ago in the sea
creatures that climbed out of the water onto land and breathed with
lungs rather than through gills.
</P>
<P>
   By quickly closing and opening, the two folds of muscle served
as natural valves, blocking everything but air from entering the
respiratory system and allowing the ejection of phlegm from the
lungs. Otherwise the creatures would have choked to death.
</P>
<P>
   In humans and most of the higher animals, closing off air-filled
lungs with this valve mechanism also stabilizes the body during
muscular exertion, including evacuation of the bowels.
</P>
<P>
   Vocal noisemaking came as something of an evolutionary
afterthought. Eventually, various animals equipped with lungs,
including humans, discovered they could sound warnings or attract
mates by blowing air out and vibrating the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect illustration of what is known as Darwinian
preadaptation,'' says Tecumseh Fitch, a biologist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   One set of human vocal cords looks much like another, except
that men's are slightly bigger than women's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably couldn't tell the difference between Pavarotti
and Mick Jagger by looking at the vocal cords alone,'' says Scott
Kessler, a Manhattan otolaryngologist. For that matter, human vocal
cords closely resemble those of other species.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody did a weird transplant where a singer got a dog's
vocal cords, they could probably do a good job of singing,'' Fitch
says.
</P>
<P>
   In making sound, the vocal cords operate like the open end of a
blown-up balloon, which buzzes rapidly if pulled tight so air can
escape more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Ingo Titze, a physicist at the University of Iowa and director
of the National Center for Voice and Speech, says that air rushing
out of the lungs creates a wave motion in the cords. They slam into
one another, only to blow open again, buffeted by the steady
airflow from the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vibration releases an energy that the human ear and the
brain interpret as sound,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   The sound box in which exhaled air becomes musical notes is the
larynx _ the tip of which forms the Adam's apple _ a cartilaginous
shell that contains and protects the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   In humans, the position of the larynx in the throat is
relatively low, allowing the tongue greater freedom to move and
thus shape sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In dogs, by contrast, the larynx is almost even with the mouth,
severely limiting their ability to control how the bark sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Humans can alter their vocal tone by raising and lowering the
larynx. In addition, trained singers relax and contract muscles
within the larynx in order to produce the resonant waver of
vibrato.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the human vocal instrument consists of the throat,
tongue, mouth, lips and, of course, the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pitch depends on the number of times per second the
vocal cords collide _ ranging from as few as 55 times per second
for a low A sung by a bass, to 1,047 times per second for a
soprano's high C _ the refinement and articulation of the musical
notes take place in the singer's throat and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a trombonist, who pushes the slide out or pushes
it in, making air take a longer or shorter route to get to the
bell, a singer must modulate the passage of breath with a series of
mostly unconscious physical movements. The range of sounds produced
is astounding considering the limited length of the air passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human throat is remarkably short _ just six or seven
inches from the larynx to the lips,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches come from the lips and tongue, which shape
vowels ranging from a mellow U to a sunny E.
</P>
<P>
   Like other instruments, vocal cords can be mistreated and
damaged. Some singers stretch their voices trying to hit high
ranges they weren't born to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Over time this can produce vocal nodes, calluslike knobs that
grow on the vocal cords and prevent them from closing completely
during their oscillation. This condition leads to a raspy, hoarse
voice, even in an 8-year-old songstress struggling to belt out
``Tomorrow'' in Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Blisters, calluses and even hemorrhages affect vocal cords, all
impeding a singer's sound. So the best singers learn to use their
whole bodies to safely summon a precisely controlled flow of air
and to modulate their larynx without straining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor once called me a laryngeal athlete,'' Horne says.
``And it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Singers _ like other athletes _ even find themselves resorting
to drugs to repair the damage brought on by physical stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these people, the show must go on,'' says Kessler,
who tends to some of the most famous throats in the world and
sometimes provides steroids to alleviate hoarseness or other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Singing may come naturally to all humans, but vocal artistry, of
course, is rare and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to that little thing we all call talent,''
Horne says. ``You can't get it, you can't buy it and you can't coax
it. As the song says, `You've either got it _ or you ain't.'''

   The rest of the human vocal instrument consists of the throat,
tongue, mouth, lips and, of course, the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pitch depends on the number of times per second the
vocal cords collide _ ranging from as few as 55 times per second
for a low A sung by a bass, to 1,047 times per second for a
soprano's high C _ the refinement and articulation of the musical
notes take place in the singer's throat and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a trombonist, who pushes the slide out or pushes
it in, making air take a longer or shorter route to get to the
bell, a singer must modulate the passage of breath with a series of
mostly unconscious physical movements. The range of sounds produced
is astounding considering the limited length of the air passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human throat is remarkably short _ just six or seven
inches from the larynx to the lips,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches come from the lips and tongue, which shape
vowels ranging from a mellow U to a sunny E.
</P>
<P>
   Like other instruments, vocal cords can be mistreated and
damaged. Some singers stretch their voices trying to hit high
ranges they weren't born to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Over time this can produce vocal nodes, calluslike knobs that
grow on the vocal cords and prevent them from closing completely
during their oscillation. This condition leads to a raspy, hoarse
voice, even in an 8-year-old songstress struggling to belt out
``Tomorrow'' in Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Blisters, calluses and even hemorrhages affect vocal cords, all
impeding a singer's sound. So the best singers learn to use their
whole bodies to safely summon a precisely controlled flow of air
and to modulate their larynx without straining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor once called me a laryngeal athlete,'' Horne says.
``And it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Singers _ like other athletes _ even find themselves resorting
to drugs to repair the damage brought on by physical stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these people, the show must go on,'' says Kessler,
who tends to some of the most famous throats in the world and
sometimes provides steroids to alleviate hoarseness or other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Singing may come naturally to all humans, but vocal artistry, of
course, is rare and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to that little thing we all call talent,''
Horne says. ``You can't get it, you can't buy it and you can't coax
it. As the song says, `You've either got it _ or you ain't.'''

UP CLOSE WITH ALBERT BROOKS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A health-care expert from the University of South
Carolina is explaining to Matt Lauer how early cancers are detected
as Albert Brooks watches from the ``Today Show'' greenroom
upstairs. He's here to plug his latest film, ``The Muse,'' which
is, as he is to say more than 50 times on this day, ``opening Aug.
27.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you just imagine how this is going over in millions of
homes across America?'' asks Brooks. `` `Honey, I found a lump.'
`Be quiet, the guy with the movie's on. He's supposed to be funny.'
`Later on the show, how to take out your own spleen. But, first,
let's talk to funnyman Albert Brooks.' `Our next guest invented
gangrene, but first let's hear from funnyman Albert Brooks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks is funny. And it's not entirely his fault. Funny
is part of his genetic make-up. His father, Harry Einstein, was an
ethnic comic whose life ended as if it were a Mel Brooks version of
a Greek tragedy. During a roast of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball at
the Los Angeles Friar's Club when Brooks was only 11, his father
delivered his stand-up routine, walked back to his place on the
dais, and fell forward into his soup. At first, people thought it
was a joke. It wasn't. After his father's funeral, Brooks remembers
Milton Berle coming over to his house and, in an attempt to cheer
the family up, sticking a cigar up his nose. They lived across the
street from the retired silent-comedy star Harold Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is the youngest of four brothers. The eldest is his
half-brother, Charles Einstein, a noted sportswriter. Then there's
the bullying Bob, more famous as Showtime's satirical stunt man,
Super Dave Osborne; and Cliff, an advertising genius who, among
other things, conceived of the ad campaign that turned Gallo from a
jug wine into ``from the estates of Ernesto and Julio Gallo.''
Albert came last.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant Brooks has carved out a career playing desperate
peole who strive hard to get what they want, get it, aren't sure
they want it, lose it, and strive hard to get it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to be watching this?'' Brooks asks the entourage
in the greenroom. ``I'm at the end, between cancer and the
Globetrotters. And they'll ask me about Einstein.'' Brooks changed
his name from Einstein to Brooks because he didn't really see the
humor in Albert Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   He's spending the day being whisked _ accompanied by a pair of
publicists; his producer-manager, Herb Nanas; and a make-up person
_ from the ``Today'' appearance to a taped interview on ``CBS: This
Morning'' to ABC radio, where he'll do a series of 10-minute
drop-in interviews for radio stations ranging from Boston's WAAF to
Bob, Gene, and Suzy's show in Cleveland. And that's just the
 &UR; morning  &LR; schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really mind it,'' says Brooks. ``It's a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is also a good way to describe Brooks's career.
</P>
<P>
   It started out great, with regular gigs on ``The Dean Martin
Show'' and ``The Tonight Show'' and Merv and Steve doing his
remarkable stand-up _ a routine that included Albert, the elephant
trainer, who loses his pachyderm on the way to the studio and
substitutes a frog. Johnny Carson practically passed out from
laughter as Albert (pronounced in the French manner) tried to
coerce the frog into doing tricks by offering it peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1973, while he was touring to support sales of his comedy
album, Brooks's stand-up career ended with a panic attack at Paul's
Mall, a now-defunct Boston club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting there watching my friend, my livelihood, have a
nervous breakdown,'' said Nanas, who gave up a prosperous career as
a William Morris agent to tie his life to Brooks's. ``He didn't
really recover for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks began making short films for ``Saturday Night Live'' in
1975, and was producer Lorne Michaels's choice to be the permanent
host for the show. Brooks balked at moving to New York; even though
he did become a regular contributor, he never set foot in the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An NBC aide, with a notebook and a headset, enters the greenroom
and asks for Brooks. He follows the aide through the corridors,
walking just the way he did in ``Lost in America'' when he strode
into his boss' office certain of a promotion and discovers it has
been given to somebody named Phil Schibano. Brooks seems confident
but, like David Howard and Wile E. Coyote, he knows that things
could turn in an instant. One tricky question from Katie Couric.
One missed opportunity to snag a viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Brooks does have something going for him. The movie
he's made is a very funny satire of his home town _ a mix of
``Sunset Boulevard'' and ``Sherlock, Jr.'' And Billy Wilder and
Buster Keaton make good company in anybody's book.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks greets Couric and the interview goes well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hollywood, cheesy and sleazy go hand-in-hand,'' he tells
Couric. ``In Hollywood, six months out of prison and you could be
running a studio. At least at GM you have to work in parts for a
couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way out of Rockefeller Center, Brooks stops to sign a few
autographs for the two dozen fans who surround him at the exit.
He's polite. Gets his picture taken with a policeman and it's back
in the limousine and over to CBS. He's already called his wife,
Kimberly, for a review. She said the ``Today Show'' appearnce went
well. And Brooks is happy.
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going well because when we had the premiere party,
people stayed until after midnight,'' he says. ``It was great. And
they were sincere. As sincere as they get. Because I do think that
most people want you to fail.''

`MONARCH' SOARS WITH FINE WRITING, COLORFUL OBSERVATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

CHASING MONARCHS 
Migrating with the Butterflies of Passage 
By Robert Michael Pyle 
Houghton Mifflin, 307 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In about a month's time, an extraordinary natural event will be
occurring in the skies over New England: the annual migration of
monarch butterflies from their northern breeding grounds to their
wintering grounds in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary thing about this migration is not the
fragility of the butterflies or the distance they travel, but the
fact that not a single one of those soon to be heading south had
come north in the spring _ they will be, in fact, the
third-generation offspring of those that had.
</P>
<P>
   Three summers ago, naturalist Robert Michael Pyle set out to
``migrate with the monarchs,'' as he puts it, heading north from
his home in Washington State to meet up with the first wave of
southward-bound butterflies in British Columbia, then to follow
them south toward the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle's stated scientific aim was to settle the question posed by
what he calls (perhaps overstating it a bit) ``a major myth of
American natural history'' _ to determine whether migrating
monarchs cross the high mountain ranges that would appear to funnel
West Coast monarchs up and down the Pacific coast, and New England
monarchs cross-country to and from Mexico. He resolves this to his
satisfaction with the recovery, on the California coast, of a
monarch he had tagged east of the Cascade range.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial test for a book of this kind is whether its
obviously enthusiastic author is able to arouse anything
approaching a similar interest in his readers. Pyle succeeds on the
strength of some very fine nature writing and of some colorful
observations of the non-butterfly world that he encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is early spring,'' he writes, ``and the butterflies'
sex urge has awakened. Their compasses, formerly set for south,
have been recalibrated. Today, after dropping out of the trees,
some will not return to the clusters as the afternoon cools.
Tomorrow, more will depart. The freezes are past, and milkweed is
sprouting in the North. It is time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``sex urge,'' there is a description of the monarch
mating ritual that is quite frankly erotic. ``The male simply
attacks the female on the wing, drives her to the ground, and
wrestles with her. He will maneuver the female onto her back, wings
spread, and cover her _ a face-to-face embrace I've never seen
among other butterflies.'' After copulation, ``he will fly straight
up, carrying her in a postnuptial flight, while she remains closed
and inert, into a tree'' where they may remain ``in coitus'' for
the night.
</P>
<P>
   It is writing that owes much _ if sometimes a bit
self-consciously _ to the novelist Vladimir Nabokov, whose writings
on butterflies Pyle is currently editing. And Pyle's ``burnt
cinnamon and orange'' edges out Nabokov's ``amber brown'' as a
description of the monarch's coloration.
</P>
<P>
   And when there were not monarchs to observe, there was the land
over which they migrate.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle passes through Shoshone, Wash., where ``the early optimism
and pretension of the railroad town were obvious in attractive
black-lava mansions and public buildings (and where) the tracks ran
down the middle of the main street.'' And on another day there is
Kanab City, a self-described ``culinary watershed'' on the
Utah-Arizona border, perhaps, Pyle speculates, ``the divide across
which good beer and coffee would again be available. Or the onset
of Tex-Mex food.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the evocative writing and the wealth of clearly
presented information about the monarchs, there is a caveat for the
reader _ reading ``Chasing Monarchs'' really requires having a
basic field guide handy. The only illustration is an oddly scaled
monarch in flight on the jacket (which looks like the result of the
conflicting ideas of two designers), but the reader will probably
also want to see what monarchs look like in their immature stages.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be Pyle himself who most fully captures the reader's
interest. It is not just his obvious enthusiasm for the quest, but
also the respect, even affection, he shows for the objects of the
quest. While tagging a female monarch _ a simpler and less invasive
procedure than it might seem _ Pyle ``felt the powerful flight
muscles pulse against the vascular pads of my fingers, until she
went limp in the possumlike passive resistance some butterflies
affect. Then, stroking her prickly legs to get them moving, I
replaced her on a fresh sunflower.'' Gracefully done, and
gracefully written.

SCANDAL IS REFLECTION OF A GOVERNOR ADRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was the toughest week of Governor Paul Cellucci's 7
1/2 months in office _ and not until the very end of it did the
chief executive return from vacation in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Massport director Peter Blute, point man for the
administration's controversial Logan runway proposal,
self-destructed on a taxpayer-funded cruise Tuesday with
swimsuit-clad young women and free-flowing booze.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, replete with photos of one young partyer defiantly
flashing her breasts for the cameras, landed like a thunderstorm in
a muggy August, the thunder rolling from newspapers to talk radio
to water-coolers and coffee klatches.
</P>
<P>
   And though Cellucci moved quickly in forcing Blute to resign, on
Friday another story surfaced: Cellucci's economic development
director, Carolyn Boviard, was questioned about whether she was
romantically involved with her top aide, who was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The events, especially the embarrassing details and tabloid
photos of Blute, helped crystallize a growing sense among many
political observers that the Cellucci administration is drifting,
still searching for a vision as State House power shifts elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not exhibit A,'' said Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston
University communications professor. ``This is like exhibit D.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A might be Cellucci's decision to go on vacation in the
midst of a worsening budget impasse, a move that has added to the
sense of an administration without a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Where some governors might have taken to the airwaves to build
public pressure to end the budget stalemate, Cellucci has satisfied
himself with some mild-mannered demands, in effect ceding control
to House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   As weeks have turned to months while the Democratic leaders have
wrestled over the budget, Cellucci's campaign self-portrait as a
bold leader ready and willing to impose fiscal discipline on the
Legislature has faded to a washed-out gray. Indeed, some frustrated
GOP strategists say the governor rebuffs advice to battle the
Democratic leaders in headline-generating spats, preferring cordial
relations even at the cost of results.
</P>
<P>
   The message and the appearance are unmistakable: Cellucci may
hold the title of governor, but he is not seizing control at the
State House. Instead, he comports himself more as legislator in
chief, a man who appears to feel little sense of urgency, who is
willing to go along to get along. When a legislative panel killed
his teacher-testing proposal earlier this summer _ something he had
campaigned long and loud on _ the governor offered hardly an
objection.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he has not taken tough stands on some issues.
His aides point to his push for a new Logan runway despite fierce
political and community opposition. He also fought for, and nearly
won passage of, a death penalty law. And his threat to take his
$1.2 billion tax-cut proposal to the statewide ballot has forced
the legislative leadership to grudgingly consider reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prevailing impression is one of relative passivity.
And Cellucci, of all people, is aware that first impressions are
the most important. As lieutenant governor, he watched eight years
ago as Governor William F. Weld strode confidently into the State
House and took on the old boys, slicing up budgets, rolling back
taxes, and quickly forging an image as an outsider determined to
shake up the system.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the dominant images of Cellucci's first seven
months are of patronage, fund-raising, and junketeering, and, now,
Massport misbehavior. Some in Cellucci's inner circle worry that
the administration seems listless, Cellucci himself indecisive and
irresolute.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, his advisers and GOP supporters are concerned the
governor has consigned himself to playing a secondary role on
Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Finneran has struck a far higher profile with his
aggressive pursuit of policies, while Birmingham has proved almost
as dogged in pursuit of his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And with the clock ticking, Cellucci is now running the risk of
casting in concrete his profile as a chief executive enamored of
the trappings of the office and intent on exploiting his patronage
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, worried Cellucci advisers did find a silver lining in the
Massport scandal. They hoped that the crisis would jolt the
governor and his administration into setting off on a new and
bolder course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ultimately could turn out to be a blessing because it's a
wake-up call,'' said one Republican adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But that would mean a sharp correction from the heading he has
steered in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Cellucci's effort to stack an obscure
environmental board to install a Democrat who broke party ranks to
support him for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Or his jetting off on trade missions sweetened with extravagant
taxpayer-funded extras like a suite at the Beverly Hills Four
Seasons and tickets to the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   Or his appointing a controversial figure like Steven Tocco to
chair the Board of Education, even though Tocco lacks any expertise
for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Or his penchant for loading up state agencies with political
hacks at mid-level positions, forcing highly respected career
managers out.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's campaign fund-raising is reinforcing his
problems. His operation hits up almost every contractor, regulated
industry, and special interest that comes before his administration
for donations. Cellucci raised about $1 million in the last six
months, far more than any other governor has in the first half-year
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that his aggressive fund-raising for presidential
candidate George Bush, governor of Texas. His organization broke
GOP records by raising about $800,000 for Bush at a Boston
fund-raiser in June.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally or not, the fund-raising has sent a subtle message
to the state's big donors, lawyers, and business establishment:
access to Cellucci or appointments to his administration may well
depend on contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Cellucci's advisers say, is that the
governor is less inclined to listen to his inner circle, Cabinet
officers, or top staff, but rather turns to the advice of the likes
of Michael Connolly, the former secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up and these days, instead of talking about changing
the State House culture, Cellucci seems more bent on defending the
local mores.
</P>
<P>
   Take his reaction to a Globe story that detailed the fact that
his appointees at MDC were using political references from
legislators and others to dole out summer jobs, a process that
seemed to freeze out minorities.
</P>
<P>
   That, Cellucci shrugged, is ``just part of life here at the
State House.''
</P>
<P>
   With a political scandal highlighting a long, listless summer,
the danger for Cellucci is that he will come to be seen as a
creature of that culture.

<P>
   ADAPAZARI, Turkey _ Every evening since the earthquake, Nurettin
Cuhadar has locked up his small grocery store, gotten into his red
Volkswagen and curled up in the back seat for another night's
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very comfortable place, but I have no choice,
because there are people going around trying to steal whatever they
can and I need to protect my store,'' the shopkeeper said.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, in the parking lot of the Adapazari
governor's office, Onder Varlik waited on line for a free handout
of food, wishing he had something left to protect.
</P>
<P>
   His son and grandson were among the more than 12,000 people
killed last week in the earthquake that ripped through the mainly
middle-class cities of northwestern Turkey. The apartment building
where his family lived was destroyed, one of the tens of thousands
of buildings turned into rubble or made uninhabitable by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we can get food and water without money, because
otherwise I don't know how I would survive,'' said the 65-year-old
man, slowly shuffling along the line for the packets of macaroni
and crackers being handed out by a Turkish television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have is a place in the park where we go to sleep at
night, praying things will be better in the morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Turkey tries to pull itself together after the quake, which
has left as many as 200,000 people without homes, survivors are
struggling to get through each day in cities where there is no
running water, not much electricity, and the threat of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Many live under sheets and blankets strung up in parks, on
basketball courts and on the sides of roads. With savings often
lost in the rubble, workplaces destroyed and families mourning
losses, most people pass the day trying to get basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities have turned sports stadiums into open-air
health clinics and depots where people come and pick through
clothing and other items collected by those lucky enough to live
outside the quake area.
</P>
<P>
   Food and water is handed out by state authorities and
volunteers, who generally load up trucks with food staples and
drive through hard-hit neighborhoods, stopping whenever they are
flagged down.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Adapazari, where nearly every shop has suffered
serious damage and is shut, the park has been turned into a bazaar
of sorts, where everything from aspirin to telephone calls is
available for free, donated by Turkish individuals and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see my shirt?'' Ozlem Oner, an 18-year-old girl waiting to
pick up some cough syrup for her little brother, asked as she
lifted the edge of her white T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it free from a big pile of clothes in the stadium, like
the jeans and the sandals, and it's a good thing because when our
apartment building collapsed, we were left with nothing,'' she
said, sending another brother to look for someone handing out
tents.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, survivors trying to make a life for
themselves without homes or belongings also have had to deal with
people trying to take advantage of the disaster by stealing from
abandoned buildings or profiteering on the backs of those now
weakest.
</P>
<P>
   In the first reported instance of looting, Anatolian news agency
said five people were arrested on charges of theft in the Sakarya
province, where Adapazari is located.
</P>
<P>
   In what was once Adapazari's bustling downtown shopping area,
where the Benetton shop is boarded over, the chandelier shop a mess
of broken glass and the jewelry store empty, Turkish soldiers
patrol the streets, letting through only those who can prove they
own a shop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop people to make sure that nobody comes here and
tries to steal things,'' said a Turkish soldier standing guard next
to a clothing store where mannequins had collapsed on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Nese Iscan knows all this first-hand. Someone broke into her
furniture store sometime after the quake, stealing a couple of
chairs and the curtains that were covering the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Now every night she and her brother sit on a worn-out couch
outside the furniture store _ the ceiling has almost collapsed,
making it impossible to remove the items _ watching a small
television they plug into the car and waiting to make sure they do
not lose anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are combing through the rubble of buildings, looking
for gold. This city is finished and we have to do what we can to
protect the little we have left,'' she said.

MOUNTAIN VILLAGE CLINGS TO HOPE OF BETTER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   HESHIJIA VILLAGE, China _ Hailstorms, landslides, and soil so
dry that even a cactus has trouble growing. Those are just three
reasons that Ma Zhende, the local Communist Party secretary in this
dusty, remote community high in the mountains of eastern Qinghai
province, wants to move his entire village to a place 400 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Ma has sent annual appeals to authorities for help
resettling the 296 Muslims who live here in mud houses on a dry
mountainside to a better location. But his pleas went unanswered
until last year, when China hatched a plan to resettle 58,000
farmers from high, barren outposts in eastern Qinghai to land in
the west.
</P>
<P>
   Ma is unaware of the flap over the $40 million World Bank
funding that was voted for the plan but put on hold while
inspectors determine if the loan meets the Bank's guidelines. Ma
believes he and his neighbors will finally be able to leave, and
they are thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids can't go to school because the nearest one is'' 3
miles ``uphill and we worry about hailstorms and flash floods,''
said Ma, 58, whose broad straw hat shields him from a scorching
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Ma's family of eight lives on just $43 a year _ the salary his
son earns as a construction worker building roads to Qinghai's
western frontier. In winter, residents borrow grain from other,
better-off villages.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is erosion. Land here is so dry that
threshing grounds and farming plots that were precariously terraced
into the mountainside have crumbled away.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Yinusi, 50, the elected village chief, urgently motions to
where part of the village has been carried down the mountain in
landslides. Ma's 7-year-old son died here six years ago when the
ground fell out from under him.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500 miles away, authorities point to Xinlong village, a
settlement that dates from 1987, as proof that the best way to help
peasants with poor farmland is to move them.
</P>
<P>
   Xinlong is adjacent to the proposed World Bank project site, and
residents report that with the help of government-funded
irrigation, they enjoy crop yields three to four times higher than
before _ and incomes more than 30 times higher.
</P>
<P>
   In Xinlong, majority Han Chinese live peacefully alongside
minorities _ Tibetan Buddhists and Hui Muslims. They have running
water and a school, and a mosque for the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people who come, the more prosperous this region will
become,'' said Ye Youfu, 32, the deputy village chief, who is Han
Chinese. ``Before we moved, we lived in the east where there was a
lot of hail and we didn't even have subsistence living. Now we have
spare cash.''

RESETTLEMENT OF POOR CHINESE FARMERS HOTLY DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANG KAZANG, China _ A five-hour drive across treacherous
mountain passes from the nearest city, this desolate village of 253
people clings to the side of a barren peak. Here, farmers earn as
little as $35 a year, walk a mile to fetch water, and till land so
infertile that they they go hungry half the year.
</P>
<P>
   Shang Kazang is among thousands of destitute villages in China
that house an estimated 80 million rural poor. But in this village
and others in Qinghai province, bordering Tibet in China's remote
northwest, farmers have become pawns in the debate over a massive
resettlement project.
</P>
<P>
   Daja Meston, a gentle 29-year-old US researcher and former
Buddhist monk, became a casualty of the debate last week. Detained
last Sunday with an Australian scholar for ``illegally''
investigating the project, the Massachusetts man suffered grave
injuries while in Chinese custody.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposes to resettle 58,000 farmers from the dry,
overpopulated eastern region of Qinghai to a mostly empty expanse
in the west. There, China would divert a seasonal river, the
Xiangride, and build a dam to irrigate former wasteland for crops.
</P>
<P>
   However, eastern Qinghai is the birthplace of the Dalai Lama,
the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader. And thousands of miles away, in
Washington, D.C., and London, a Tibetan lobby including movie stars
and members of the US Congress has allied with environmentalists to
try to block the project.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese government's plan has received initial
approval from the World Bank, whose financial support is required,
millions of dollars in low-interest loans are being withheld while
the bank investigates social concerns raised by critics.
</P>
<P>
   Activists see a Chinese plot to obliterate the minority Tibetan
culture by transplanting farmers, most of whom are ethnic Chinese
or Muslims of varying heritage, onto the western pastureland used
by Tibetan and Mongolian herdsmen. Cynics say Chinese authorities
are less interested in alleviating poverty than in moving thousands
of potential laborers into a region rich in natural gas, oil, zinc,
and lead _ and that they have duped the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the debate are the people of Shang Kazang, who
must hike three hours to reach a hospital or a school, and whose
only meal, three times a day, is bread. All but three of the
villagers are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate evokes do-good rhetoric on both sides. China insists
its Western Poverty Alleviation Project is an honest attempt to
help the poor. Opponents counter that the plan fits into China's
unattractive history of forced migrations, environmental
degradation, and oppression of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and more than 60 US
senators opposed the World Bank loan, but the bank board voted
narrowly on June 24 to approve the project _ for the first time
overruling a dissenting vote from the United States, the bank's
largest stakeholder. The bank did agree, however, to withhold $40
million earmarked for Qinghai until a bank team and independent
monitors could inspect the area to assess any danger to indigenous
people or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some bank officials complained they were rushed. The vote was
taken in late June because on July 1 China would be disqualified by
its wealth from receiving a loan on the most favorable terms. The
$160 million, largely interest-free loan is not due for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some are questioning whether China intends to live up
to the promises it made in seeking the loan. A public pledge that
officials, reporters, nongovernmental groups and ``legitimate''
individuals would be allowed unfettered access to the project area
was violated by Meston's detention. Only under strict supervision
was a small group of journalists permitted to visit the area this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists' 1,800-mile escorted trip across the province
turned up widespread support for the resettlement among prospective
migrants and their future neighbors _ at least among those to whom
journalists had access. The trip also exposed some misconceptions
held by overseas opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with provincial and county authorities also
raised doubts about the government's commitment to preserving
minority religions and culture, and the sensitivity of Chinese
officials to the people they propose to help.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the 60 monks at Jide monastery, a 300-year-old
Tibetan shrine near Shang Kazang village, believe that they and
their temple will be moved along with their worshippers. Asked
about this, surprised authorities sputtered that the villagers
would have to pay for the move themselves _ a ludicrous suggestion,
since they have no money.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, after orating about the lack of food in remote, arid
villages, several officials helped themselves to bags of peas
plucked from a hapless farmer's land.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying that the people tapped for relocation
are barely surviving, and that the few peasants already resettled
in the west have gained a better life. Three times as many people
have applied to move as will be able to do so if China receives its
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Qinghai was closed to foreigners until 1983, and even after 20
years of nationwide economic reform, there is scant foreign
investment here. The province is China's least developed. Its gross
domestic product accounts for less than 0.3 percent of China's
national output, and nearly 40 percent of Qinghai's population,
mostly farmers and herders, live in poverty, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents ask why the government couldn't first try to improve
conditions in the east, instead of moving people hundreds of miles
from their homes and opening the door to conflicts over land and
water between locals and the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reply that that there was no alternative _ eastern
Qinghai is too barren, mountainous, and overcrowded to sustain its
population.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note that the county where the new villages would be
located is in a historically Tibetan and Mongolian area with an
autonomous regional government. Activists express concern that the
influx of Chinese and Muslim ethnic groups, which will reduce
Tibetans from 23 percent to 15 percent of the population, could
force the assimilation of minorities in Dulan County _ a charge
officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   China has a history of subjugating minorities, especially
Tibetans. Qinghai, where 1 million Tibetans live, was absorbed into
the Chinese empire in the early 18th century. Neighboring
modern-day Tibet was annexed in 1950. Nine years later, China
crushed a rebellion in Tibet, and the Dalai Lama and his loyalists
fled to India. Over the years, China has destroyed thousands of
monasteries and jailed many clerics for remaining loyal to the
Dalai Lama or supporting independence.
</P>
<P>
   However, not a single Tibetan actually lives in the immediate
area of the proposed 126 new villages _ and nearly 3,500 Tibetans
will be moved in under the plan. The people most directly affected
by the project will be Mongol herdsmen, not Tibetans. China has
promised to compensate herders who will lose their pastureland with
$100 each and access to irrigated forage lands.
</P>
<P>
   Qinghai, an expanse 33 times the size of Massachusetts, has been
called the Siberia of China, a sparsely populated, harsh
environment perfect for prison camps, secret arms installations
and, some allege, atomic research facilities, all built after the
Communist Revolution. In the 1950s and '60s, thousands of Chinese
were resettled here to work in weapons factories that had been
moved inland to avoid a feared Soviet attack. ``Rightists'' and
former student radicals were forcibly shipped here, and Dulan
County is believed to have the highest concentration of forced
labor camps in China.
</P>
<P>
   China promises prison labor will not be used in the
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and prisoners are far from the minds of most people in
the villages, which lie at an altitude of 12,000 feet or more on a
vast plateau dubbed ``the roof of the world.'' In eastern Qinghai,
the talk was all about survival.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say that diverting the Xiangride River to
irrigate 47,000 acres may deprive herders of water, kill wildlife,
and damage wetlands. They also fear the environmental damage caused
by exposing the soil to chemical fertilizers and leveling hills to
create farmland that may be subject to wind erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities counter that the project will check erosion and
improve the environment through irrigation, reforestation, and
depopulation of the east, where the population density is at least
70 times that of the west.
</P>
<P>
   The vice governor of Qinghai, Liu Guanghe, is indignant that a
plan to help the poor has been delayed by controversy, and he pins
the blame on ``Dalai Lama cliques.'' Liu said: ``Relations between
us and Dalai are relations between enemies. The issue is heated . .
. while our people are still living in poverty and starvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Western critics fear that indigenous herders in Dulan
County will be encouraged to give up their nomadic lives to farm or
labor in mines.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates counter that it is patronizing for Westerners to
glorify a primitive lifestyle instead of celebrating China's
progress. It is also questionable how ``traditional'' the herding
lifestyle is today. Reporters encountered herders shooting pool on
a hillside and others charging tourists for yak rides and
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Daxicairen, a Mongol chief who supports the resettlement into
Dulan County, said most herders welcome the newcomers, because with
them will come electricity, water, and roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we really thought this nomadic life was good,''
said Daxicairen, 45, whose group rode a full day on horseback from
the Kunlun Mountains to meet with journalists. ``But now that the
country is developing and we visit cities, I myself don't think
this is as good as settling down, growing some crops, and having a
more stable and better life.''
</P>
<P>
   And those who would be resettled are even more enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no land, no water, no doctor . . . no one to take care
of us,'' said La Tai, 37, a Tibetan farmer whose threadbare T-shirt
and face were caked with layers of dirt accumulated in the month
since he was last able to bathe. ``We want to move.''

A SOUND FUND FOR A 75-YEAR-OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am writing on behalf of my mother, who is a 75-year-old
widow. Her expenses are currently about $1,100 a month. She
receives about $700 a month in Social Security. She has $34,000
invested in Vanguard LifeStrategy Income fund, and is looking for
an appropriate investment for an additional $30,000 that is now in
a money market account. She also anticipates receiving about
$100,000 later this year from the sale of a house jointly owned
with her brother, and she wants to invest this money wisely.
</P>
<P>
   K.O., Ipswich, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. She could do a lot worse than simply add to her holding in
Vanguard's LifeStrategy Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move wouldn't really mean that she is placing all her
eggs in one basket, since the LifeStrategy series of funds are
offerings that simply place the assets in a mixture of other
Vanguard funds. In the case of LifeStrategy Income, the current mix
shows nearly half the assets in the Total Bond Market Index fund,
with about a quarter in Vanguard Asset Allocation fund, 19 percent
in its Short-Term Corporate Bond fund, and the rest in its Total
Stock Market Index fund.
</P>
<P>
   When you add the stock holdings in the Asset Allocation fund to
the position in the Total Stock Market fund, it works out to about
a 15 percent reliance on the stock markets. Overall portfolio yield
is 5.1 percent. If she combined the cash now in the money market
account to her LifeStrategy Income position, she could expect a
monthly income stream of $293 _ not enough to meet her anticipated
expenses, but close enough so she shouldn't worry, given the
anticipated proceeds from the real estate sale later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But I think when that lump sum arrives, I'd take a different
course, roughly following the example of the LifeStrategy fund but
without the stock market exposure. With this money, I'd put 50
percent in Vanguard GNMA and 25 percent each in its Short-Term
Corporate Bond and its High-Yield Corporate Bond funds. The latter
two funds represent opposite ends of the risk spectrum, with the
GNMA more or less in the middle. Once such a portfolio was
established, its yield should be more than enough to supply the
needed income stream, and she could simply allow the LifeStrategy
Income account to grow. But before you make up your mind to follow
this suggestion, read the next letter _ and make sure your mother
reads it, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I wish I had waited a while before I invested my money in a
GNMA fund. Shortly after I did, I remember reading a letter in the
paper in which you mentioned that GNMA funds were for a long-term
investor. And, I might add, they're not for real old people of my
age _ which is 87. I invested $64,000 in April of this year, and in
three months it became $61,546. I had no idea how it operated.
There was a man on the radio over the weekend constantly
recommending GNMAs and he never mentioned how it can fluctuate. I
was afraid to stay in as I watched it go down, because of my age. I
think it is a darn shame to keep talking about this fund.
</P>
<P>
   A.K., La Jolla, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm sorry you had such a bad experience, but as you can see
from the letter above, I'm still at it, still recommending Ginnie
Maes.
</P>
<P>
   I think these funds are attractive for people who seek an income
stream and who won't have to draw upon their principal for many
years. As you have seen, the current value of these funds can
fluctuate quite significantly when interest rates are unsettled _
losing money as yours did when interest rates increase or when the
markets anticipate rate increases. The opposite happens when
interest rates fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if you look at results over many years, the losses
and the gains tend to cross each other out, leaving the fund owner
with the income stream he presumably sought in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   An example: As this is written, shares of Vanguard GNMA (which
is probably the fund I wrote about in the column you read) stand at
a $9.99 net asset value. The shares ended 1989 at a $9.79 net asset
value.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a lot of change over most of a decade, and although
the returns through the 10 years varied from a loss of 0.95 percent
in 1994 to a gain of 17.04 percent the next year, the 10-year
average annual total return of 7.87 percent is in line with what
people might have expected a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   So the important point that your experience underlines is that
people shouldn't buy such a fund unless they understand that there
will be bad seasons _ typically about two bad years in every decade
_ and that the owners will have to ignore the bad times and ride
them out. It's equally important to take the attitude: the market
gives, and it will most likely take it away later on during the
good seasons for bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Your experience also underscores another appropriate warning:
GNMA funds are no good for people who can't accept the fluctuations
with ease. There are people who will be upset by a 5 percent
negative swing in principal that the overall experience will be
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   But what a long-term investor can expect from a good GNMA fund
is a return that runs about 1 1/2 percentage points ahead of what
they might have gotten with a money market fund. However, if the
fluctuations make them miserable, forget about that 1 1/2 percent;
a good night's sleep is worth more.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that owners of GNMA funds shouldn't take
notice when their fund is doing poorly. When results are poor,
investors should check to make sure their fund's returns are in
line with other similar funds; if a fund is consistently
underperforming its peers, that is a cause for a change, whether it
comes at a time when GNMAs are doing well or poorly.

   Q. I am a 46-year-old woman with a chronic illness. I work part
time. I also receive some alimony and I own a two-family home and
receive income from an apartment. I would eventually like to move
to a town house or a smaller single-family home, but cannot afford
to do so without the income I receive from the apartment. I don't
know much about investment, but if I were to sell my home and
invest a portion of the money I receive _ say $40,000 to $50,000 _
would I be able to earn at least $600 a month through investments?
If not, how much would I need to invest, and in what type of
investments?
</P>
<P>
   R.A., Revere, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You would need a 16 percent investment yield to realize a
$600 monthly income stream from a $45,000 investment. Needless to
say, such returns are extremely unlikely, and when they can be
found they are very risky.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, you can expect a prudent fixed-income
portfolio to yield only about 6.5 percent in the current market.
You would need $110,243 invested at that rate to replace that $600
monthly income stream from the leased apartment.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the amount you'd have to invest is so far from
what you estimated you could provide that the investment question
becomes academic. But if you can somehow make the arithmetic work,
I'd suggest a portfolio divided among three mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   This would consist of 25 percent positions at the opposite end
of the risk spectrum: a money market fund and a high-yield (or
junk) bond fund, and the rest in a GNMA fund, which holds a
portfolio of government-backed mortgage securities. (Make sure,
also, that you read the two preceding letters, to get a perspective
on how GNMA funds work.)
</P>
<P>
   Most mutual fund companies have offerings in these categories,
and solid examples can be found through Fidelity and Vanguard,
among others. But you should know from the outset that such a
portfolio should be viewed only with a long-term approach, and
money that you might need suddenly should not be put into it.

WHY DOES ICE CREAM GIVE YOU A HEADACHE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does eating ice cream too fast give you a headache?
</P>
<P>
   E.B., Concord, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Nobody knows, really,'' says Dr. Keith Campbell, editor of
the journal Headache and Professor Emeritus of Neurology at the
Mayo Clinic. ``Some people have written about it, but it's really
completely unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Cold stimulus headache, or ``brain freeze,'' is officially
classified as a distinct form of head pain. Some people get it by
being outside in cold weather without a hat. More commonly people
get that throbbing in either their forehead or the temples while
they're eating something cold, or several seconds after they've
swallowed something cold. Some studies suggest it is more common in
people who suffer migraines. Not everybody gets them.
</P>
<P>
   But why does it happen? There are only theories. One suggests
that cold on the palate or tongue upsets a key nerve that carries
sensation from the mouth to the brain in a way that causes referred
pain. Another theory supposes that the rapid cooling of blood
vessels in the mouth and upper throat makes blood vessels in the
brain momentarily expand and contract, which is commonly thought to
be a cause of headache.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly in the name of science, your How and Why correspondent
conducted an unscientific but fatteningly delicious experiment. A
heaping teaspoon of Hagen Daaz Lemon Swirl was applied to the
palate for 30 seconds, inducing palate pain, but no headache.
Another similar portion was placed on the tongue for 30 seconds.
Tongue freeze, but no brain freeze. A similar portion was then
quickly swallowed, and 30 seconds later, the ice cream headache
pounded for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   So why would swallowing something cold cause an ice cream
headache? Dr. Campbell, who gets his when the ice cream is still in
his mouth, says ``We don't know. It hasn't really been studied.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass the vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does eating ice cream make you thirsty?
</P>
<P>
   E.B., Concord, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Here's a quiz. Which will make you thirstier: table salt _
sodium chloride _ or table sugar _ sucrose? Barbara Rolls,
Professor of Nutrition at Penn State University, says ``They're
about the same.''
</P>
<P>
   She explains that particles of sodium chloride and sucrose both
act like water magnets drawing water out of our cells. If the cells
shrink too much, they'll die. We have evolved osmo receptors,
special intracellular fluid detectors, to keep levels just right.
If we eat too many salty french fries, or polish off a sugar-rich
banana split, the osmo receptors sense that water is being drawn
out of the cells. They tell the brain to secrete a hormone that
directs the kidneys to hold onto fluid rather than send it out of
the body as urine. Several related body responses trigger the
sensation we describe as thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder why drinking soda leaves you thirsty? Blame it on
the fructose, the most common sugar in sweetened foods like candy
and soft drinks. It breaks down faster in the body than sucrose so
it doesn't act as powerfully to draw water out of cells.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Meteorologists in recent years have made great strides in their
ability to predict which way hurricanes will move across the ocean,
enabling more timely warnings to coastal cities, and they have even
learned to predict the overall intensity of a huricane season. But
there is still a great deal they don't know about just how these
massive storm systems work _ knowledge that might someday make it
possible to slow the raging fury of an oncoming storm.
</P>
<P>
   In a laboratory in Cambridge, one attempt to begin to unlock the
mystery of exactly how hurricanes derive their energy _ and how
that flow of energy might be curtailed _ is presently underway. An
unlikely team of scientists is using a device that looks a bit like
an oversized blender to learn more about what happens in the
crucial boundary zone between air and water, where a hurricane's
devastating power originates.
</P>
<P>
   The team is doing preliminary tests of a method that they hope
might someday slow deadly hurricanes in their tracks _ or at least
tame their fury before they strike vulnerable coastlines. The
method they are studying uses a concept that originated more than
two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved in this research project, which was originated
by MIT chemical engineer Robert Langer, Children's Hospital cancer
researcher Judah Folkman, and MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry
Emanuel, agrees that it's a long shot, with very slim odds of
success. ``We're going out on a limb,'' Emanuel says.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential impact of such a technology is so great that
even a tiny chance of success make it a project well worth
pursuing, the researchers say. After the multibillion-dollar
impacts of hurricane Andrew on Florida in 1992 and hurricane Mitch
on Central America last year, it is clear that even a slight
moderation of an advancing major storm could be both a money saver
and a lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   And even if this particular idea doesn't work, the research
might lead to other variations or entirely new possibilities. As
Emanuel explained in an interview last week, ``we have almost no
understanding of air-sea interactions at high wind speeds,''
because measurements are so difficult to make in the midst of the
huge waves, powerful winds and churning waters of a large storm
system. For now, he said, ``we've decided to take a highly
experimental approach to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are attacking the problem of trying to gain a better
understanding of hurricanes, Earth's deadliest weather systems, in
different ways. A team in Florida, for example, is in the process
of setting up ten monitoring stations in homes in that state in the
hope that they will eventually wind up inside the track of a
hurricane and provide unprecedented details about how the winds
affect buildings. But the MIT effort, even with slim odds, is the
only present project that has any hope of not just understanding
the storms, but doing something about them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is a simple one, with roots that go back to an
experiment carried out by Benjamin Franklin in 1765. If it works,
it could spare coastal communities billions of dollars worth of
damage and the loss of many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, in experiments he did at an English lake, was the
first to make detailed measurements of an extraordinary phenomenon:
Certain kinds of oil, when placed on a body of water, almost
instantly spread out over an amazingly large area. Franklin was
able to calculate that when he dropped a teaspoon of olive oil on
the lake, the resulting layer of oil was vanishingly thin _ just 25
Angstroms (one ten-millionth of an inch) thick.
</P>
<P>
   Although the concept of atoms and molecules still lay decades in
the future, scientists now know, from experiments done in 1917,
that in fact such a layer of oil spreads out until it becomes
exactly one molecule thick _ no more, no less. What's more, the
individual long, chainlike oil molecules in the resulting
``monomolecular film'' are arrayed in a neat, orderly pattern,
standing vertically like stalks of wheat in a field.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments back in the 1960s showed that such films, spread
over the surface of water reservoirs, could slow the rate of
evaporation by at least half. The potential for preserving scarce
water resources is significant: It has been calculated that the
total amount of water evaporated from the surfaces of lakes,
streams and reservoirs in the United States each year is equal to
the total water consumption of all the nation's cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   But if evaporation can be slowed in a reservoir, what about the
open ocean? It turns out that one typical hurricane is driven by
energy that equals the total power consumption of the world for
several weeks, and all of that energy comes from the evaporation of
water from the sea surface. If the evaporation rate could be slowed
down, then the hurricane could be deprived of its ``fuel'' and
quickly dissipate, or at least weaken severely. That's exactly what
happens when a hurricane moves over land and quickly runs out of
steam.
</P>
<P>
   Langer and Folkman, both of whom devote their professional lives
to biomedical research, became interested in this unlikely subject
while discussing a completely different kind of problem. Cancer
specialist Folkman was trying to find a way to prevent discomfort
for patients who were being fitted with casts, which heat up as
they harden. Especially with large casts and young patients, the
heating can be a real problem, sometimes causing swelling under the
cast that can impair circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman discussed the problem with his friend Langer, who holds
more patents than any other MIT faculty member and who specializes
in inventing medical devices. They soon found a way of solving the
heating problem in casts by adding a simple chemical, urea, that
cooled the plaster, allowing it to harden just as fast but without
heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Then the two researchers started thinking about other issues
that, like the hardening casts, involve heat transfer from one
object to another. Langer, Folkman said, wondered out loud: ``How
much urea do you think it would take to drop into a hurricane from
an airplane to make it go away?''
</P>
<P>
   Such cross-disciplinary discussions are not unusual in Langer's
fertile and freewheeling lab. ``I have a very open kind of
attitude,'' Langer says. ``I want to just encourage people to
explore grand ideas, taking them through to reality.'' And in the
kind of biomedical research he does _ he has devised artificial
skin and drug-releasing implants, among other things _ Langer says
that ``I found that if you want to make a new tissue or do a drug
implant, it really takes a diverse group.''
</P>
<P>
   Langer and Folkman discussed the idea with Emanuel, a renowned
hurricane expert. He said it sounded like a good idea, but in the
course of the discussion suggested that there might be a more
efficient way of accomplishing the same thing: Slowing evaporation
from the sea surface by using an oil film.
</P>
<P>
   MIT visiting engineer Moshe Alamaro was already working with
Langer on a different idea _ how to prevent summer water shortages
in New England by stockpiling snow during the winter. He quickly
became involved in the new project and took on the task of carrying
out laboratory experiments to try to find just the right kind of
substance to do the trick.

 UNDATED: ... the trick.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alamaro emphasizes that all of the substances being tested are
biodegradable and would have a negligible impact on the
environment, because such small quantities would be needed. Only
ten pounds of the material _ just over a gallon _ could cover a
square mile of ocean, and 50 tons, perhaps two airplane loads,
would cover 10,000 square miles. That might be enough to quell an
advancing hurricane, if the idea works. (By comparison, about
3,500,000 tons of petroleum-based oil are spilled into the oceans
every year, mostly from routine ship operations).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of spreading oil on the water to retard hurricanes has
been suggested before, one of several schemes proposed over the
last few decades to try to moderate the storms. Soviet scientists
even carried out some experiments on the idea in the Pacific Ocean
in the 1970s, but those results had been classified and have only
just been released. Piles of documents detailing those experiments
are now at MIT and in the process of being translated, but so far
it is not clear what useful information they may contain.
</P>
<P>
   The concept first originated with Robert Simpson in the 1960s,
when he was director of the National Hurricane Center. Simpson and
his wife Joanne, also a meteorologist, carried out detailed
calculations on how much oil would be needed and how to deliver it
and spread it where needed. ``If you could somehow cut off the flow
of heat from the ocean to the air, you could pretty much snuff out
the hurricane,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the quantities needed could feasibly be carried
by planes to where they were needed, and that the costs would not
be unreasonable. But then they lost interest when some research by
others showed that as soon as the wind speed exceeded 25 m.p.h.,
the wind would break up the film and prevent it from working. ``We
didn't carry it any further at that point,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   Alamaro is convinced that with the right substance, that problem
can be overcome. With the help of some MIT graduate students, he is
carrying out experiments in a container that simulates the
agitation of water in a storm, trying out hundreds of different
substances to see how well they curtail evaporation under turbulent
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Emanuel, there may be a completely
different approach to slowing the transfer of heat from the ocean
to the storm above, depending on exactly how hurricanes really
derive most of their energy _ something that scientists don't yet
know. Instead of retarding evaporation, a different material might
be used to cause the churning sea to form much smaller water
droplets, which would evaporate by absorbing heat from the air, not
the sea below. Larger droplets, by contrast, do transfer heat from
the sea to the air.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out that hurricanes derive most of their energy from
droplets rather than the sea surface itself, Emanuel said, then the
research might turn from looking at monomolecular films and instead
concentrate on testing soap-like materials that could be used to
reduce the droplet size. Either way, the net effect would be to
slow the buildup of energy in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   If the laboratory tests yield a promising substance, then
further tests could be carried out in a large donut-shaped wind
tunnel at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, especially built to
simulate storm conditions over the sea, and then eventually on the
open ocean. Only if all those tests work would anyone try to plan
an experiment under actual hurricane conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Willoughby, the National Hurricane Center's present
director, applauds the effort and has been following it closely.
``If we could actually find a chemical'' that would work in high
winds, he said in an interview, ``then absolutely, it would work.
But much virtue in `if'. Nobody's come up with a chemical that
would work.''
</P>
<P>
   But the impact that such a discovery would have could be so
great, Willoughby said, that the research is worth pursuing. It has
been calculated that if hurricane Andrew had moved a few miles
further north and hit Miami directly, it would have caused $70
billion in damages. Anything that holds promise of reducing a
hurricane's strength should be explored, even if it's a long shot,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this could be made to work, it could have tremendous
impact,'' agreed MIT chemical engineering professor Daniel
Blankschtein. ``It is an exciting idea. Whether it will work or not
remains to be seen. But I'm fascinated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Langer cautioned in an interview that the work is at ``an
extremely early stage. We're on the first step of a very long
road.''
</P>
<P>
   The teaming up of a biomedical engineer, a medical researcher
and a mechanical engineer with an atmospheric scientist on a
project involving hurricanes may seem improbable, but it all makes
a certain kind of sense: The key common element is a desire to
spare people from suffering. As Langer puts it, no matter what the
subject may be, ``if we can make a difference in people's lives,
I'm interested in doing it.''

GOP FINDS TAX CUT PLAN NO PRIORITY AMONG VOTERS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOCCOA, Ga. _ Representative Nathan Deal arrived home this month
like a traveling salesman, toting a pile of posters and a wooden
easel to display his advertising pitch. The Georgia Republican was
on a mission from the GOP: to peddle its current showpiece, a $792
billion tax cut bill that was ailing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But what Deal found in his rural district was not quite the
political climate predicted on Capitol Hill. To be sure, voters
were fired up about an array of issues, from gun control to Social
Security to military deployment around the world. And their eyes
did seem to glaze over a bit at the words ``broad-based tax
relief,'' just as Democrats had gleefully predicted they would.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were also clear worries about the tax code _ probing
questions about the capital gains tax and pension reform among the
region's farmers and working middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who showed up for a town meeting last week hosted
by Deal seemed curious: Was there actually a budget surplus to
spare, as Republicans claim? Or would a tax cut, as the Democrats
say, eat into crucial federal programs?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still an issue,'' said Maggie Downing, a conservative
radio host in Clarkesville, who attended one outdoor gathering. ``I
wouldn't say taxes are my number one priority. But I would call it
up there in the top five.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over tax cuts has thus far been one of definition,
with each side struggling to frame the debate. Democrats have said
the tax cuts might jeopardize other essentials including Social
Security. Republicans have argued the projected budget surplus is
generous enough to fund both a tax cut and necessary programs. And
despite the conventional wisdom that public sentiment is tepid
toward tax cuts, it appears the mood is governed by how the
question is asked.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to choose between a larger tax cut or increased spending
to expand Medicare to include prescription drugs, 66 percent of the
respondents to a Gallup Poll in early August said they would favor
a smaller tax cut with an increase in spending on Medicare. Only 32
percent said they wanted a larger tax cut and smaller increases in
spending on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked only about the tax cut, 63 percent said President
Clinton should sign into law the sweeping Republican tax bill
passed by both the Senate and the House. Just 30 percent said they
would approve of Clinton's vetoing the measure, which he has
promised to do.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, almost two out of three people would like a tax
cut, in theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' said Frank Newport, editor in
chief of the Gallup Poll. ``The bottom line is, Americans want it
all. In isolation, Americans like the idea of tax cuts, and
essentially, they always have. If you ask, `Are your taxes too
high?' they'll always say, `Yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Karlyn Bowman, an analyst at the Pew Center for the People and
the Press, added: ``Since 1947, Gallup has asked the question 50
times. And Americans have always said their taxes are too high.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the main reason House Republicans are taking to the
streets, holding some 300 town hall meetings in their districts to
promote the GOP tax plan. But for Deal, the issue of tax cuts has a
political history dating to the beginning of his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Elected as a Democrat in 1992, he was a fiscal conservative,
voting in favor of the balanced budget amendment and in 1994
helping found ``the Fiscal Caucus,'' a group of 26 Democrats in the
House. That same year, Deal helped promote a plan to cut spending,
calling for a special congressional session on budget cuts. Even
today, Deal prides himself on having voted like a Republican when
he was a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   He switched parties in 1995, a move critics viewed as
opportunistic since it happened as Republicans took control of the
House and another Georgian, Newt Gingrich, became speaker. But Deal
maintained his move was largely connected to the Democrats'
opposition to tax cuts. Four years later, his constituents
overwhelmingly believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where Nathan stands on this,'' said Mark Watson, 45, a
capacity planner for Johnson &AMP; Johnson. ``We don't even need to
ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The district, a two-hour drive north of Atlanta, is largely
conservative _ 55 percent of Deal's constituents favored Bob Dole
for president in 1996, and Deal beat his Democratic opponent by 32
percentage points one year after switching parties. But taxes are
not necessarily a partisan issue here. Even among the region's
lingering core of Southern Democrats, there are signs that a major
tax cut could have appeal as long as it did not cut into funds
designated for something else.
</P>
<P>
   Fen Kolluck, a senior citizen who manages a swath of property
she inherited, said she believes the environment should be the
nation's top concern, alongside morality. ``If we had morality,''
she said, ``everything else would solve itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kolluck said, ``capital gains is high up on the list for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I sell a piece of property, I pay tax,'' she said.
``Capital gains affects an awful lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   George Kaulbach, a retired Presbyterian minister, also said he
was ``still up in the air'' on tax cuts. ``I would like to see some
tax relief, but I don't want to do it so we disturb the balanced
budget,'' said Kaulbach, 66.
</P>
<P>
   Even those totally opposed to the Republican tax cut bill said
it would not affect their votes. According to David B. Baglien, 73,
a retired federal worker, ``People could care diddly about a tax
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nathan's a good guy, though,'' he said. ``I've voted for him.
I guess I will'' again in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Deal, after a day of listening to nearly 100 voters earlier this
week, said he was not entirely opposed to the idea of weighing the
federal debt against a tax cut. Spending a budget surplus on new
government programs would be unacceptable, he said. Spending it to
pay down the national debt ``would be keeping with fiscal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not try to argue that taxes would become a hot-button
campaign issue, or that they would sway voters next year. He hardly
even tried to keep his constituents on the subject of taxes as he
met with constituents throughout the day. Instead, he let them air
concerns about the local rivers and logging, and the future of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But he stayed planted in his position, carting his posters from
meeting to meeting, aware that voters would relate to tax cuts on
some level, whether he sold the GOP bill to them or not.

CAMPAIGN 2000: EXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taylor, Grant, Hoover, and Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short list but an instructive one. Those are the men who
won the presidency without first holding another elected post. Take
out Eisenhower, who as supreme allied commander in Europe had
learned a little something about political leadership, and the
performance picture becomes clearer.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, those presidents were undistinguished indeed,
inactive, ingenuous or inept, ineffectual or overwhelmed. One thing
that list strongly suggests is that though prior political
experience hardly assures success, its absence can certainly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the current crop of Republican presidential
candidates. Of the candidates widely viewed as financially and
politically viable, only Arizona Senator John McCain, with 12-plus
years in the Senate and four in the House, could truly be called
well-qualified, though late-entrant Orrin Hatch, a Republican
senator from Utah first elected in 1976, also clearly meets the
standard.
</P>
<P>
   To date in the campaign, those candidates with the most
extensive electoral experience seem to be faring the worst. Last
week, Lamar Alexander, a two-term Tennessee governor and former US
secretary of education, left the race.
</P>
<P>
   The possessor of the weightiest resume in the group _ former
vice president, US senator, and US representative Dan Quayle _
languishes so low in the polls many expect he too will soon be
forced to exit, stage right.
</P>
<P>
   And US Representative John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget
Committee, bailed out two months ago, unable to turn his fiscal
accomplishments into campaign progess.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are reasons each has done so poorly.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions are important, and by running a 1996 campaign
built on hokum and trumpery, Alexander squandered an opportunity to
build an enduring base. Quayle _ his image as intellectually
mediocre struck seemingly indelibly in the public mind _ hasn't won
a deserved second look from his party.
</P>
<P>
   And though Kasich is a respected and knowledgeable player on
Capitol Hill, most Americans tend to see congressional chairmen as
anonymous insider players rather than well-known public figures.
</P>
<P>
   So does this mean that voters have come to pay more attention to
ideology and personality than experience? Although that's how it
may look at this stage, it's not the case, says Bruce Buchanan,
professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin. When
it comes time for voters to cast their ballot for president, they
give considerable weight to a candidate's background, he says.
``One of the things you have to have is some political
experience,'' says Buchanan. ``People feel more comfortable if
somebody has done this kind of work before.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the more important the office a person holds,
the more seriously he or she is taken as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Previous government experience imparts three types of knowledge
essential for presidential success, says Sandy Maisel, a government
professor at Colby College. First, an actual, as opposed to
civics-book, knowledge of how the federal government really works;
second, an understanding of how to operate in a milieu with
competing power centers; and finally the instincts to ask the right
questions about policy.
</P>
<P>
   Although that grounding may sound basic enough to learn on the
job, it's a sufficiently tall order that it thoroughly confounded
Jimmy Carter, who flooded Congress with initiatives while slighting
its leaders, and at least initially flummoxed Bill Clinton, who
came to Washington assuming he would benefit from bipartisan
bonhomie.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side in 2000, Al Gore, a two-term vice
president who has also served eight years in the Senate and four
terms in the House, and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, who
spent 18 years in the US Senate, both clearly possess the requisite
governmental credentials. But how does the GOP field, as tiered by
Iowa's April 14 Republican straw poll, stack up on the experience
scale? &QL; 
 &QL; 
George W. Bush &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush has served 4 1/2 years as governor of a state where the
Legislature is ascendant and the chief executive's powers limited.
Still, as a big state, Texas figures prominently in the American
imagination, and just running the bureaucracy there alone imparts
an important backgrounding, says Maisel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he has clearly learned the all-important art of
political negotiation and compromise. But a lack of real policy
expertise is just as obviously a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``I think he is just barely over the line,'' says
Buchanan, who has watched the Texas governor closely. ``But at the
moment, Al Gore or Bill Bradley,'' the two Democratic candidates,
``would chew him up and spit him out in a debate.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Steve Forbes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For journalists, it's a reaffirming notion indeed that one of
their own could easily make the transition from scrivener to
president and proceed to set the world aright.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, history suggests otherwise. The best example of a
journalist seeking the presidency is Horace Greeley, crusading
19th-century editor of the New York Herald Tribune, and a far
brighter star in the firmament of his day than Forbes is now. He
was soundly walloped by Ulysses S. Grant in the presidential
election of 1872.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Forbes's second-place straw-poll finish proved that
money can buy a candidate a certain amount of love in politics. But
what experience really qualifies Forbes for the Oval Office? Well,
argues Greg Mueller, senior adviser for communications, the
president is a chief executive and ``Forbes is not only the chief
executive of Forbes Magazine, but he has a number of other business
affiliates.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the fact America has never elected anyone as
politically inexperienced as Forbes? ``In the new millennium, we
think the fact that he hasn't held elective offce is going to be
quite a plus,'' said Mueller. ``If people want to get some of the
reforms done, it is going to take an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Valiant spin _ but history has a sterner standard.
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``Nobody in their right mind would argue that you
could plunk somebody out of nowhere to run Forbes magazine, and yet
he argues that he could be plunked out of Forbes magazine to be the
nation's political leader,'' says Shirley Anne Warshaw, professor
of political science at Gettysburg College. ``I don't think anybody
is going to find that very convincing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Elizabeth Dole &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She likely wouldn't be flattered by the comparison, but the
closest historical analogue to Mrs. Dole, who has run the American
Red Cross and served in a variety of appointed posts, most notably
secretary of transportation and secretary of labor, is probably
Herbert Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, well-regarded, successful in everything he had done,
Hoover was United States Food Administrator under President Wilson,
where he was in charge of price stabilization and food distribution
during World War I. Later, he directed the post-World War I relief
efforts in Europe. And he was a crusading secretary of commerce
under President Coolidge. Still, Hoover proved too ideologically
rigid to deal with the Great Depression, a challenge Franklin
Roosevelt's years as governor of New York better prepared him to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, observers have found Mrs. Dole uncomfortable with the
extemporaneous demands of a campaign, slow to capitalize on
opportunity, and uncertain on the broader range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``Dole has some plausibility because of her name and
high-level government positions, and she has run a $2 billion
organization,'' says political analyst William Schneider. ``Still,
if she were nominated, her lack of elected experience could be a
problem for her. Some voters would say, what has she really done
that qualifies her to be president?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gary Bauer and Pat Buchanan &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is well known among conservatives for the decade he spent
running the conservative Family Research Council, a conservative
policy group. Buchanan, another journalist who would be president,
is widely known as a cohost of CNN's ``Crossfire'' and as a
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   But as for real political experience? Staffers, both.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan counts his days as a Nixon press aide and speechwriter
and his two-year stint as director of communications for Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer held a number of positions under Reagan, the most
important of which were director of the office of policy
development and an undersecretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was ``going to summits when some of these kids were
still riding a tricycle,'' argues Bob Adams, Buchanan's campaign
spokesman. But traveling about the world in the entourage of famous
leaders does not, of itself, qualify one for leadership; If it did,
as Alexander the Great once noted, his longtime pack mule would
have been a general.
</P>
<P>
   So far, says Warshaw, neither has demonstrated the ability to
forge consensus around their agenda, a skill a successful career as
an elected official teachers. Indeed, both in 1992 and 1996,
Buchanan has been just the opposite: a polarizer who scares voters
away.
</P>
<P>
   -- Verdict: ``Their service (as White House aides) doesn't give
either of them any credibility, particularly if you look at what
they were doing when they were in the White House,'' says Maisel,
the Colby government professor. ``They were the house ideologues.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when you combine experience with current standing, what do
you get? With the caveat that it's too early to tell with Hatch,
right now ``there are really three candidates who are plausible:
Bush, McCain, and Dole,'' said Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the GOP wants to win in November, that is.

BUSH'S BIG FLINCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR;  _ Thanks a lot, Junior.
</P>
<P>
   For a few, brief, shining moments, President-in-waiting George
W. Bush seemed to be striking a blow for the majority of the public
and the minority of journalists who believe private lives have
nothing to do with public character _ not in history, not in the
here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also seemed to be striking an equally important blow
against the very idea of those invasive ``questions'' fed by rumors
that self-righteous busybodies and hypocritical character cops use
to feed the infotainment machine in the guise of examining
qualifications for public office.
</P>
<P>
   But then he blew it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of standing for a principle on ``the cocaine question,''
Bush caved at the first sign of political trouble, tossed his
principle overboard, and morphed into a caricature not worth
defending. You can't try to help someone who folds on you.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Bush flip-flop, he did flip-flops on his flip-flops
_ and probably isn't done yet. That's a bad enough public display
for a president-in-waiting, but nothing exceeds the damage the
simple, damning phrase, ``Candidate X later explained,'' can do to
someone's credibility, especially in a period when the electorate
is just getting to know him.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't even close to political damage, much less anything
worse. But it's telling. In presidential preprimary politics,
history teaches that you never know when the lights will suddenly
go up and the country awaken from its appropriate ennui long enough
to take a serious peek at you. That's when you want to be at your
best _ not caving, flip-flopping, and dissembling.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, much more was at stake than one person's
ambition and tactics. He had a chance to stand up against much of
what people justifiably hate about both politics and journalism but
ended up making the game worse.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on _ and has been going on with dizzying speed for
more than a decade _ is a steady plummeting of standards, which has
empowered sleaze politics. The most important of the trends has
been a gradual easing of the obstacles to floating rumors into the
mainstream of campaigns via the press in the complete absence of
any direct evidence relating to truth or accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor had it that a certain newspaper was about to report Mike
Dukakis seeking mental health help after his defeat for governor in
1982 . . . Newly chosen House Speaker Tom Foley might be gay . . .
Did George Bush fool around before becoming president? . . . Bill
Clinton might have tried to renounce his citizenship or played
footsie with the KGB in the late '60s . . . Unnamed people in raw
FBI files suggest the late John Tower was a wild drunk . . .
Questions raised about the alleged associations of one of Pat
Buchanan's associates.
</P>
<P>
   The key common denominator is rumor without directly supporting
evidence, yet each drop of poison had its moment in the mainstream
simply because the press was willing to lower standards so that a
rumor could produce a question that could be dressed up to suggest
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat unscientifically, I have a short-form description of
how this madness has proliferated. I start in my computer's massive
press archive, by entering the words ``rumor'' and ``rumors'' and
then the date 1980. The result is 32,933 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Change the date to 1990 and the number of hits nearly triples to
88,095.
</P>
<P>
   Then change the date to 1998 and the number nearly doubles
again, to 161,400.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could have assaulted this system frontally by sticking to
his guns as a mature man who once wasn't, arguing the irrelevance
of detail and refusing to play the questions game. He had
substantial public support.
</P>
<P>
   But principle was soon unmasked as tactic. Politically, it
helped him to say faithful husband and teetotaler, so he did. But
then, after asking support for a refusal to talk about drugs in the
past in the absence of a single specific allegation, he ditched his
position on the fly last week.
</P>
<P>
   Like any pol playing games loosely, he was trapped by his own
campaign's stupid failure to check the simple facts of high-level
government and White House background checks, which ask about drug
use beginning at age 18, leading him to stonewall on a topic he
himself put into play.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he's equated the presidency with a staff job in the White
House or a slot at the FBI. The Constitution says otherwise;
there's no application form, and it's the people who decide.
Benjamin Harrison's life was stable, and Andy Jackson's was a mess.
Who was the more effective leader?
</P>
<P>
   Bush has squandered his case with astonishing incompetence. But
the more important casualty will be the press's shrinking
credibility, and I shudder to think how many hits my computer will
get after next year.

WHAT IF BUFORD FURROW HADN'T USED A GUN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Media interest in Buford Furrow's Los Angeles atrocity has been
massive. His Aug. 10 assault on a Jewish community center in Los
Angeles _ which left five people wounded, three of them young boys
_ was a national story from the moment it broke. Scores of
newspapers and television stations rushed reporters to the scene.
Countless articles and editorials have been written about it. Every
angle of the story has been explored, from Furrow's mental health
history to the impact the attacks have had on other Jewish
facilities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not coincidentally, Furrow's rampage has also served to
advance two causes that are popular with much of the media and with
the liberal elite they so often reflect.
</P>
<P>
   One, of course, is gun control. Furrow fired 70 rounds from an
Uzi submachine gun at the community center, then used a Glock
pistol one hour later to kill Joseph Ileto, a mail carrier. A
Toyota he hijacked and then abandoned was found with seven guns and
a stockpile of ammunition. Coming as it did after a string of
highly publicized shootings, Furrow's savagery was held out as
further proof that the freedom to acquire guns must be curbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 192 million privately owned firearms in the United
States,'' began The New York Times editorial on the events in Los
Angeles. It went on to ask how many more such calamities it would
take before Congress ``stops babbling about the right to arms and
does something serious about gun control.'' Innumerable media
voices echoed the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's horrifying attack was also offered as evidence that
Congress ought to pass a sweeping ``hate crime'' law, the better to
prosecute violent criminals who target minorities. In this case,
the criminal was a neo-Nazi who ranted about Jews and blacks. When
he turned himself in, police said, he explained that ``he was
concerned about the decline of the white race and wanted to send a
message to America by killing Jews.'' He characterized his
encounter with Ileto, a Filipino-American, as an unplanned ``target
of opportunity'' to kill a nonwhite.
</P>
<P>
   No federal hate crime law is needed to punish Furrow; everything
he did is already illegal in California and prosecutors are sure to
seek a harsh punishment. Still, it has become politically correct
to demand a hate crime statute any time a bigot commits a heinous
assault. On Aug. 12, President Clinton called for a new federal law
as a matter of ``common sense.'' Plenty of media voices have called
for the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   No apology is necessary for paying attention when an evildoer
opens fire on a group of children. But would the media be quite as
interested in Buford Furrow if he wasn't, by their lights, a poster
boy for gun control and hate-crime laws?
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that the kids he tried to kill weren't in
a Jewish institution but in a nonsectarian day-care center. Suppose
he went after them not with an Uzi but with some other lethal
weapon _ a 300-horsepower automobile, say. Absent the gun control
and hate-crime hooks, would the press have covered his monstrous
crime so avidly?
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to suppose. Less than four months ago, just such
an enormity took place. The media scarcely blinked.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, Steven Abrams drove past the Southcoast Early
Childhood Learning Center in Costa Mesa, Calif., where 40 small
children were frolicking noisily in the playground. Deciding, as he
later told police, ``to execute those children,'' he pulled a
U-turn, headed back toward the playground, and floored the
accelerator. The car _ a 1967 Cadillac sedan _ tore through the
chain-link fence, sent the jungle-gym flying, and plowed into the
crowd of children. It stopped only when it ran into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams was unhurt. But Sierra Soto, a 4-year-old who loved to
dance ballet and play with her pet bunny Butterscotch, was dead,
her body so mangled that the paramedics wouldn't let her mother see
her. Brandon Wiener, a 3-year-old whose first word had been
``vacuum'' and who was never without his favorite teddy bear, was
still alive when they got the car off him, but died that night in
the hospital. Five-year-old Victoria Sherman suffered a fractured
skull and a shattered pelvis. Nicholas McHardy, 2, was also badly
injured. Two other children were hurt, and a teacher's aide was
treated for multiple lacerations and cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Two dead, five injured _ Abrams's violence was far more grisly
than Furrow's, and led to a grimmer body count. The sheer horror of
the crime, if nothing else, should have attracted frenzied media
attention. But it didn't involve guns, and it wasn't fueled by
racial or ethnic bigotry, so it attracted almost none.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, many papers around the country ran an Associated Press
story on the Costa Mesa massacre. Perhaps half a dozen ran a
follow-up, also from the AP, on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. No drumbeat of daily coverage, no flood of
editorials and opinion columns, no army of reporters flying out to
see for themselves. The story was fully reported in California. It
was virtually ignored everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Does a homicidal attack on toddlers only make it to the front
page when the killer uses a gun? Is attempted mass murder only
newsworthy when the victims belong to an official minority group?
Perhaps the nation's editors and producers have a sound
journalistic reason for paying so much attention to Buford Furrow
when they had paid so little to Steven Abrams. But none comes to
mind.

LET'S MAKE USE OF THE LULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, it is quiet in the nation's capital. Unusually quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is off on its August recess. The war in Kosovo has run
its course. The year of Monica mania that preceded it is well
behind us. Elections are still more than 14 months away, and the
first presidential caucuses are still five months away.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in more than a year, there is little on the
nation's political agenda _ except, perhaps, for the disquiet over
continued episodes of random violence (whose causes Washington may
be peculiarly unsuited to address).
</P>
<P>
   But what about the issues that were eclipsed by the impeachment
effort and the unexpected war that has thus far dominated 1999? We
have let them fade, maybe at our own civic peril.
</P>
<P>
   So here, in our summer interlude, is a list of topics that can
help shape our resumed national conversation.
</P>
<P>
   A national debate about the use of prosperity. Ordinarily
prosperity can be defined as the period between recessions, but the
prosperity that Americans have enjoyed in recent years is
unprecedented. The economy keeps producing jobs; the stock market
keeps inching skyward; welfare rolls keep shrinking; American
expectations keep growing. This prosperity may be a
once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is fond of saying that the country should fix
the roof while the sun is shining, and now is that time. Big
challenges are easier to confront in peacetime and prosperity than
in war and recession. Among the questions to be debated:
</P>
<P>
   Should a wealthy national government undertake a comprehensive
program to eradicate domestic poverty? What is the responsibility
of a rich nation in a world of the poor, the struggling, and the
striving? How much money should Americans save? Does national
prosperity endanger the nation's spiritual life? What is the
relationship between freedom of markets and freedom of expression?
</P>
<P>
   Some of these questions may have been addressed in graduate
seminars or from church pulpits, but they were seldom confronted in
Washington or on television.
</P>
<P>
   Once bad times return, and they always do, we may regret not
having lingered on such questions in leisure.
</P>
<P>
   A conversation about the role of a superpower in a world without
a single, threatening adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last decade has a single nation, in this case the
United States, stood completely alone, its power dominant, its
ideology in triumph. The century opened with big-power tensions
between Britain and Germany, with Russia and France playing major
supporting roles. At the end of World War II, the United States,
Britain, and France stood triumphant as Germany rebuilt its armed
forces and its threat to Europe. After World War II, the United
States and Russia began a Cold War that held the world in its
thrall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the United States has become the lone superpower, the last
threats to American superiority, economic as well as geopolitical,
all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   That makes now a good time to have a sober discussion about the
role the United States wants to, and should, play in this new
world, a question that is even more urgent in the wake of the
unsettling but successful war in the Balkans. How should we respond
to the kinds of dangers _ terrorism, drug warfare, cyberconflict,
weapons of mass destruction _ that a superpower faces at a time
when there isn't one obvious threat, like Nazism or Soviet
communism?
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily incidents such as the bombings of American embassies
in Kenya and Sudan might have put such a discussion at the top of
our national agenda, but they didn't. Nor did the brief war in
Yugoslavia. Nor has Saddam Hussein's stubborn refusal to honor
United Nations inspections. The death of King Hussein in Jordan,
which underlined the fragility of peace in the Middle East, didn't
prompt it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were discussing the meaning of obstruction of
justice, there was another debate going on _ on the role of America
in the modern world,'' says former White House press secretary
Michael D. McCurry. ``Yet that was back on page A56, and we didn't
pay much attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A national seminar on questions of aging. This is a country that
is growing older in a world where issues affecting the elderly _
housing, pensions, health care, changing lifestyles _ are fast
crowding out conventional political issues. These issues are
particularly acute in Europe and Russia, but they are no less
urgent here.
</P>
<P>
   Here, after all, are the elements of a crisis: Social Security
trust funds will probably remain adequately financed until 2032,
but after that the annual income to the program will only cover
about three-quarters of the benefits. Costs are rising far more
swiftly than income. By 2013, the cost of benefits paid by the
old-age and survivors' trust fund will exceed the income of the
trust fund. In 1960, there were more than five workers for each
Social Secuity beneficiary. Right now there are more than three
workers for each beneficiary. By 2030, there will be only two
workers for each beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the advice of the Social Security trustees:
``Extensive public discussions and analysis of the practical
implications of alternatives (to the current Social Security
financing structure) is essential to developing the broad support
needed to enact any Social Security reform legislation. . . . We
must use the coming months to find changes that effectively
guarantee a basic level of income for the aged, disabled, and
survivors of deceased workers.''
</P>
<P>
   That call went out almost a year ago. The discussion is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   A searching examination of the role that regulation _
particularly Washington regulation _ plays in American life.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is full of the clash of two passionate armies, one
contending that there is too much regulation, the other maintaining
that there is not enough. Together they represent the most critical
question of political philosophy facing Washington today.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 20th anniversary of airline deregulation, began
with growing recognition that the nation's air-transport system
needed fundamental changes, and with the promise that there might
be a serious debate about the commercialization of the air-traffic
control system, deregulating airports themselves, and perhaps
allocation of takeoff and landing slots by a bidding process. But
debate on the topics has yet to resume full flight.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican initiative signed into law by Clinton provided an
expedited mechanism for lawmakers to challenge new regulations, as
a way to rein in out-of-control bureaucrats. But distracted
lawmakers did not use this new tool once in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed landmark legislation in both 1996 and 1997 to
regulate the use of pesticides and to streamline the Food and Drug
Administration's decisions on labels describing health claims for
various food products. The Environmental Protection Agency and the
FDA were expected to finalize the scientific policies that would
form the basis for their decisions. The public is still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and lobbyists from banking and securities interests and
from consumer groups agree that an overhaul of financial services
is at least a decade overdue, mostly as a result of enormous
changes in technology and a dramatic restructuring of the banking
world. Indeed, bankers and consumers are operating under rules
developed after the Great Depression. But again, legislation that
was expected to address the problem got lost in the impeachment
shuffle. It's time to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   A broad colloquium on integrity and ethics in American civic
life. For all the times that the words ``truth'' and ``honesty''
were tossed around during the presidential sex scandal, the country
never had a serious conversation about ethics in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A democracy is built on the foundations of public trust and
public participation,'' Common Cause, the citizens' lobby, said in
a publication released last winter. ``The current campaign-finance
system _ in Washington and in many states and localities across the
country _ has eroded both.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the view of would-be reformers, although
certainly not of the elected officials who have been beneficiaries
of the current system. The point isn't that one side or the other
is right. The point is that this debate never pierced the din of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns in just over two weeks, it has a chance to
resume serious lawmaking for the first time in a year. Voters, too,
have a chance to turn their attention to matters that will shape
our nation as we enter a new century. Let's hope the national
conversation that follows provides a richer discourse than that of
the last year.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, Conn. _ Leaning against the cinderblock walls of her
jail cell, Alejandrina Torres reaches into one of the envelopes her
husband has mailed every week for the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, she always finds a love letter _ ``We'll be together
again one day,'' he reminds her _ along with writings from Puerto
Rican independence groups updating her on the campaign to free her.
</P>
<P>
   The romantic notes and the political manifestos reflect Torres's
odd mix of roles: wife, grandmother, revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 60, is serving a 35-year sentence in a federal
penitentiary here for her involvement in an underground guerrilla
organization that bombed US political and military sites between
1973 and 1983 in an attempt to free Puerto Rico from US control.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years of living inside a sterile cell under the eyes of
armed guards, Torres could walk out of prison soon if she accepts
an offer from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under mounting pressure, Clinton on Aug. 11 offered to commute
the sentences of Torres and 10 others in prisons across the
country. But the Puerto Rican nationalists reject the strings
attached: notifying probation officers when they travel to other
cities, and avoiding contact with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are proposing is to gag us,'' Torres said in an
interview with the Globe. ``Anything that has to do with exercising
our right to self-determination would be a thing of the past. They
think if we keep our mouths shut their burden of colonialization
will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, a bright-eyed woman with deep frown lines, is a world
removed from the chaotic demonstrations of the 1970s and 1980s,
when she chanted ``End US Imperialism! Free Puerto Rico!'' and
lived by Malcolm X's provocative mantra _ ``By any means
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends she was a member of the Armed Forces of
National Liberation, known by its Spanish acronym FALN, which took
responsibility for dozens of bombings, including planting pipe
bombs at the New York City headquarters of several major
corporations as well as the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 11 who have been offered clemency were not involved
in attacks that resulted in injuries, prosecutors branded them as
terrorists. Authorities say FALN violence was responsible for six
deaths and more than 100 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Torres says she no longer believes in violence as a political
tool: ``There was a time when that was necessary. I guess each
generation has its own method.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fire that has fueled her revolutionary spirit still
burns. If anything, her time in prison has only hardened her views.
</P>
<P>
   She said that whenever she is released, she will continue to
demonstrate against the US government for oppressing her people _
even if it takes another five years when she is eligible for
parole.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 conditions of release set by the Clinton administration
include monthly meetings with probation officers, restrictions on
travel, and a prohibition against associating with people who have
criminal records. Because many ``independentistas'' have criminal
records, that stipulation would essentially bar Torres from meeting
or demonstrating with her compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   To agree to the conditions of release, she said, would be to
revoke her First Amendment right to free speech. Supporters of
civil liberties agree and have taken on that fight.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and other cities with large Puerto Rican populations,
a new campaign is under way: A call for the unconditional release
of all 15 independentistas _ the 11 offered clemency plus four
others _ who they call ``political prisoners.'' Among those
pressuring Clinton to free them are Bishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, and Coretta Scott King.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are Puerto Rican patriots,'' said Marcos Vilar, national
coordinator of the Committee to Free Puerto Rican Prisoners-of-War
and Political Prisoners. ``The prisoners are to Puerto Rico what
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and all the founding fathers
are to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gene ``Tito'' Roman, the former director of the
Massachusetts regional office of Puerto Rican Federal Affairs, says
people want to remake them as heroes, but they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantic vision of the terrorist group FALN as patriots
obscures the violence and destruction they have wrought since the
1970s,'' Roman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Poor beginnings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Torres grew up in San Lorenzo, a pueblo in rural Puerto Rico,
where lush vegetation and towering palm trees sweep over the land.
Her father died of stomach cancer when she was an infant, leaving
her mother to support 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother rolled cigars, her hands stained greenish-brown from
the tobacco. When Torres was 11, the family moved to New York
City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where her older sister, who was
a young adult, helped care for the family.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Torres became convinced that Puerto Ricans would
never benefit from US Commonwealth status. She said America holds
on to the territory because it is a strategic military site. She
said most Puerto Ricans are against becoming independent because
they fear they won't survive economically without the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But many Puerto Ricans living in the United States are just as
poor as the ones living on the island _ proof, she says, that
institutional racism in America will continue to keep Puerto Ricans
impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   As she grew older, working as a secretary for Broadway
Congregational Church, a congregation active in the civil rights
movement, she got swept up in the struggle. Her future husband, the
Rev. Jos Alberto Torres, marched in Selma and Montgomery, Ala.,
with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when they moved to Chicago in the mid-1960s and married,
Torres and her husband took up the cause of Puerto Ricans, saying
they were voiceless. Through her advocacy work at a Chicago church,
she said she learned that Latino children were humiliated by
teachers in school and their parents could not find jobs _
especially if they spoke with accents.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a link between their impoverished lives on the mainland
and what she calls the legacy of colonialism: the brainwashing of
children in Puerto Rican schools and the US control of Puerto Rican
trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when a small group of Puerto Rican high school students
fought what they called a Eurocentric curriculum, Torres and
several others founded Puerto Rican High School in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always full of love and singing songs,'' said Marvin
Garca, who grew up in Torres's neighborhood and is now director of
the school. ``She always had a smile, was always full of
laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, Torres worked as a caseworker at the Cook County
Department of Public Aid, helping Cuban refugees. She counseled
teens at the school after work. And during her free time, she went
to every Puerto Rican independence demonstration she could. But she
adamantly denies she ever helped make bombs, or conspired to blow
up military sites.
</P>
<P>
   She said the FBI tracked her family because her stepson, Carlos
Alberto Torres, was a fugitive. Authorities, she said, found
explosives in his apartment. He is now serving time in a federal
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always under surveillance,'' Torres said. ``You
couldn't miss them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a pro-independence activist, she said she offered assistance
to anyone involved in her political struggle who asked for help.
She admitted helping a wanted man escape the country in the late
1970s, but never asked his name.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told another story during the 1983 trial of the 15
alleged Puerto Rican nationalists. They said Torres and the others
possessed explosives and were plotting to bomb a US military
installation near Chicago. The Puerto Rican 15, as they were
called, did not contest the charges, saying they did not recognize
US authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way did I expect justice in the court of my oppressor,''
Torres said. The 15 hoped in vain that the trial would be played
out in an international court.
</P>
<P>
   During her years in prison, including the last five years at the
Federal Correctional Institute in Danbury, Torres has built a life
similar to the one she led outside: She teaches inmates how to
read, and found work at the prison chapel. She makes 40 cents an
hour putting together the church calendar, service programs, and
writing the church bulletin in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who still lives in Chicago, calls weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about the struggle. When I talk to her, I blow
her kisses and tell her I love her,'' said Torres, who is 75. ``But
I continue to be an independentista. She continues to be an
independentista.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Puerto Rican 15
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican 15 have each served 16 years of sentences that
ranged from 35 to 90 years in prison _ time that many, including
Clinton, agree does not fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, four ``independentistas'' who had done worse _ stormed
the US House of Representatives in 1954, unfurled the Puerto Rican
flag, then fired gunshots, wounding five congressmen _ were
pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Carter also pardoned
Oscar Collazo, a Puerto Rican who was convicted in 1950 of trying
to kill President Harry S. Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Though she wants to see her mother free, Catalina Torres, a
chiropractor in Syracuse, said that if her mother signed the
agreement, it would be the same as admitting she committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is not a criminal. What she did was not wrong,''
Torres said. ``There is nothing wrong with fighting against
colonialism.''

THE DEN INTRODUCES INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT VIA THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ It's twilight on a warm Friday evening,
too early to prowl the subterranean Los Angeles night life, yet too
late to be click-clacking away at the office. But at a funky,
two-story converted warehouse here, workers show no signs of
slowing down for the weekend. Some are gathered for an impromptu
cake-and-beer celebration, where a dressed-down executive
introduces 40 new employees. Others remain cheerfully glued to
their workstations, staring at monitors as if they contain the
great secrets of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The intense young computer heads and self-conscious creative
types, most in their early 20s, eagerly pop out of their cubicles
to explain the place to a visitor. The Concept is Big, these
staffers say. It's the biggest thing to hit Hollywood since D. W.
Griffith invented the epic. It's bigger than the talkies. It's
bigger than television. It's bigger than _ gasp _ MTV. It's a brand
new media for a brave new world, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these self-promoters and what is this place? What's the
Big Idea? The company is called Digital Entertainment Network, or
simply the Den. ``We're trying to build something, and it's going
to change the world,'' says the Den's director of marketing, Adam
Solomon, a kind of combination cruise director and spin doctor. The
concept is this: The Den aims to develop Internet-specific
programming geared for Generation Y, today's high school and
college students, ages 14 to 24. This generation, estimated at 60
million and also known as Echo Boomers, grew up with computers and
faxes and cell phones and beepers: They're used to
``multitasking,'' and they're at home getting their information
through one wire or another, often through more than one at once.
</P>
<P>
   Den's low-budget programs, aimed at such narrowly defined groups
as gay teens, Christian young adults, and punk rockers, will be
delivered via streaming video on the Internet; all shows will be
interactive, with built-in e-commerce mechanisms and plenty of
click-on features that provide as much or as little information as
an individual viewer wants. These shows will be available on
demand, 24-7 (Netspeak for every hour, every day). Each segment
(which costs anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 to produce, less
expensive than network television and with a shorter turnaround
time) lasts a mere six or seven minutes, the ideal length for the
generation that is growing up with a mouse in one hand and a remote
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   That's the basic idea, and Solomon discusses it with the zeal of
a scientist pondering the cure for cancer. Solomon leads a
high-energy tour of the warehouse, racing by the conference room
(``Ikea meets money''), the recording studio (``Austin Powers meets
the Jetsons''), and then bounding up to the second floor for a demo
of the site (which is at http://www.den.net). It begins with a
promotional video, in which the familiar NBC peacock logo morphs
into a stuffed holiday turkey. Next up is a preview of ``Frat
Ratz,'' a soap-opera series featuring testosterone-driven students
and their long-suffering yet lovely girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Shallow plot aside, the series does experiment with
interactivity. In one segment, an actor who is shaving delivers a
plug for the razor, just as actors did in the early television of
the '50s and '60s (and in ``The Truman Show''). Viewers can click
on a logo and purchase the razor or surf over to the razor
company's home page. Likewise, when music plays during any Den
show, viewers can stop the program, click to get more information
about the artist, read articles, or buy the album. They can also
stop the show at any point to get more information about their
favorite characters.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of interactive programming _ also known as TV Plus,
telefusion, or convergence _ is suddenly all the rage in Hollywood,
and investors and sponsors are viewing it as the Next Big Thing in
entertainment. And the Den is growing exponentially. Launched in
1998 by three entrepreneurs, it began 1999 with 10 employees.
Today, it has 220 staffers spread out in six buildings, including
the original warehouse. It has raised $26 million so far, with
funds from prominent venture capitalists as well as Dell Computer
Corp. and Microsoft Corp. And Den has signed up Pepsi and Ford
Motor Co. as charter sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a fresh approach to reaching the Echo
Boomers,'' says Dave Ropes, Ford's director of corporate
advertising and integrated marketing. ``It's no question that this
generation has a short attention span; they want to be entertained
in shorter lengths and shorter soundbites.''
</P>
<P>
   Interactive entertainment could be the next gold mine in
cyberspace, but so far, mainstream networks have offered only
regular television programming complemented with a chat rooom or a
fan site on line. ``Convergence usually means a separated
experience,'' says Jim Ritts, the Den's chief executive officer,
pointing out that running between the television and the computer
is hardly an integrated experience. ``It's like saying, `I have a
potato, and I put plastic eyes and a nose and a mouth on it, and
now I have an animated character.' No. It's not an animated
character. It's Mr. Potatohead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Den isn't toying around, though, and neither are several
other companies racing to enter the market before the networks and
film studios offer their own made-for-the-Net entertainment. These
media companies seem to be popping up every day and include
ventures like WireBreak.com, Brilliant Digital Entertainment, and
Honkworm Interactive. Den's primary competitor is the New
York-based Pseudo.com, which has launched a network of Internet
talk shows and bills itself as ``TV you can't get on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo.com founder Joshua Harris considers Den a formidable and
respectable competitor. ``If I had to say anything about their
programming, it's a little too much like regular broadcast TV,''
Harris says. ``Den and Pseudo, not in that order, I hope, are
dogfighting it out to get a toehold in a market that I know will
clobber regular old television in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Harris admits that the technology isn't quite there yet
to satisfy most viewers. Den targets its programs for machines with
Internet connection speeds of 56K or higher _ the faster the
connection, the better the quality. But the New York-based Jupiter
Communications predicts that only 20 percent of all computers will
have broadband Internet access by 2002, creating an accessibility
problem. And some analysts are skeptical in general about the
quality of streaming-video technology, which features grainy images
on matchbox-sized screens.
</P>
<P>
   But others are impressed with the Den model. ``They are creating
unique content and not just reproducing something else on line,''
says Mark Hardie, senior analyst at the Cambridge-based Forrester
Research. ``What normally happens is producers add a chat room to a
situation comedy and think they're doing programming for the Net.
That's nonsense.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some folks in Hollywood, however initially slow to respond to
the Internet, are beginning to get it. Most film studios and
television networks are currently exploring ways to offer
Net-specific entertainment; Warner Bros. Interactive, for one, will
launch a Net entertainment portal, called Entertaindom, later this
year. David Wertheimer, former president of Paramount Digital
Entertainment, launched WireBreak.com, a Web operation that is
developing short interactive shows; when he left Paramount last
fall, he says, colleagues told him he was crazy, but the same
people are now asking for jobs. ``It's suddenly hip and trendy to
be in entertainment on the Internet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hip and trendy is what La-La Land is all about, and so far, the
buzz about the Den has been mostly positive _ with one major
concern. ``They are to be saluted for being one of the leaders
moving the Internet into the entertainment field,'' says Jim
Moloshok, president of Warner Bros. Online. ``But from what I've
seen to date, all they're doing is creating poorly written
television shows and streaming them on the Web. Bad scripts and bad
acting aren't going to appeal to the public just because you're
streaming them on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of Den's programs follow the linear-story format of
traditional television, be it talk show, sitcom, or sci-fi drama
(see accompanying story). ``That's a fair note at this time,'' says
Den president David Neuman. ``Most of the shows are very linear and
true to the Aristotelian storytelling method. But over time, you'll
see more innovative programming. You're literally watching the
previews.
</P>
<P>
   ``But name one network show done with Asian teenagers,'' he
continues. ``Name one show about punk rockers. Name one show about
Hispanic teenagers. This is the most diverse generation in history,
and we think it would be bad business and bad karma to leave
anybody out.''
</P>
<P>
   Den was producing its diverse programming before the NAACP
criticized the television industry this summer for its
overwhelmingly white fall lineup; that backlash might pay off for
the Den. ``I'm disappointed with the lack of commitment television
makes to show the texture of America,'' says Jack Johnson, producer
of a Den show about hip-hop music. ``The beauty of the Internet is
that we're able to take that risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Den prides itself on being a multicultural,
youth-oriented company, its top executive suites are occupied by
middle-aged white men. And one of its premiere shows, a digital
sci-fi thriller called ``Royal Standard,'' is directed by
53-year-old Randall Kleiser, best known for such Boomer teen movies
as ``The Blue Lagoon'' and ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the network is striving to develop a show for every
possible subculture of Generation Y, from punk rockers and
hip-hoppers to skateboarders, surfers, and computer geeks. This
approach is called ``narrowcasting,'' and it's what the Internet
does best. ``A lot of us are really sick of MTV because it doesn't
cater to different subculture preferences,'' says Leo Zhao, a
24-year-old Den designer. ``Me, I'm into post-dance electronic
music, and I'm bored with 99.9 percent of the stuff out there on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao is not just an employee: He's a member of the Den's target
audience. The top brass want today's youth to describe themselves
as the ``Den Generation,'' the same way the Gen-Xers identify with
MTV. But will it work? Will Den capture the attention of a
generation or will it just slip away, like so many other Internet
startups?
</P>
<P>
   The denizens, no doubt, are banking on the company's mix of
industry connections and youthful enthusiasm. The top executives
have ties to Disney Television and Channel One (the controversial
in-school network), while the programming and producing staffers
reflect the pop culture that blooms on the streets of Los Angeles,
with 20-somethings sporting tattoos and piercings and various
unnatural shades of hair. ``I feel very much at home in this
environment,'' says Zhao.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who sets foot in the place learns to talk the talk _
and they might as well, since they all have stock options.
Music-industry veteran Gary Gersh signed on in June to head the new
Den Music Group; he picked up the company line instantly. ``We
think of ourselves as NATO for the music industry; we're here for
everyone to use and interact with,'' he says, explaining that bands
signed by Den Music Group can be featured on other Den programs,
including the dramas and the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to international peacekeeping forces, of course,
mean nothing if the kids don't come to the site. Den debuted its
preview site in May (in what Internet folks call a ``soft''
launch), featuring a few segments of 10 video shows and limited
interactive features. The revamped site (the ``hard'' launch) will
be unveiled in mid-October, with 30 shows, chat rooms, and other
popular Web features. The company is mounting a marketing campaign
on college campuses and in funky hangouts and youthful meccas,
trying to pull off the kind of buzz that turned the low-budget
horror flick ``The Blair Witch Project'' into a phenomenon. The
campaign, with posters designed by Zhao, will hit Boston next week.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stated mission is to provide today's youth with
``a revolutionary replacement for the passive, brain-killing
experience of watching network and cable television.'' Is its
programming really that revolutionary? Industry critics say no, but
Den staffers are convinced they are on the cusp of a radical media
realignment. ``A lot of what we're doing is still rhetoric, but
we're in the process of turning it into a reality,'' says Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   And Ritts adds, ``It will be just as different in 90 days as it
was 90 days ago. This is a network of, by, and for the Y
Generation. So we better be nimble. We better adjust. And we better
be fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   And they better stick around on a Friday night. Solomon, for
one, knows he ought to be home with his toddler, 17-month-old
Theodore. ``You have to understand; we're defining a brand new
medium,'' he says. And as for Zhao, he works all night, every
night, not necessarily at the office. ``It's part of my job to
scope out the underground of LA night life so I can be in touch
with the newest trends,'' he says. It's unclear whether those fads
will play in Peoria, but for the young programmers in Santa Monica,
if one trend loses its luster, the next Big Thing is just a few
clicks away.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... to fail.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's as if Albert Brooks goes through life skinless. He has no
defense against that one person in 10,000 who doesn't think he's
funny, or that one review that isn't thumbs up, four stars, instant
classic.
</P>
<P>
   As his pal Nanas puts it, ``In this business they don't pay you
for being a great comic artist, they pay you for putting asses in
the seats.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Muse,'' there's a sequence where Brooks, a recently
demoted screenwriter, is denied a parking pass to the studio and
trudges endlessly from one end of the lot to the other for a
meeting. It seems he'll never get there. In that scene it's easy to
see the Keaton-Brooks connection. Both know that the end of the
painful journey will even be more painful. But they keep it up
anyway. Trudging along. Sweating. Hoping against hope.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The limousine swings up to CBS. The guard tells Brooks how funny
he is and asks the publicist to take a picture of them. He's got
the camera ready. Brooks agrees and smiles and goes upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   His interview is delayed. While he stands off to the side
watching another guest assemble a wall of the latest handbags, a
producer apologizes for the brief delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go to a bulletin,'' he said. Over at the anchor
desk, the newscaster is doing a few facial warm-ups as an aide
advises her to keep her chin up, avoiding the deadly hints of a
double chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like `Broadcast News,' '' whispers Brooks, referring
to the James L. Brooks (no relation) film that garnered Brooks an
Oscar nomination as best supporting actor for playing the sharp,
but perpetully perspiring, newsman Aaron Altman. This time, Brooks
isn't sweating.
</P>
<P>
   The newscaster updates the disaster in Turkey, where the death
toll from the earthquake now stands in the thousands. Brooks leans
over and asks with a straight face, ``You think people dying in
Turkey is more important than my movie?'' Then he smiles. He smiles
that wonderfully ironic smile we saw on his face when Holly Hunter
dumped him for William Hurt in ``Broadcast News.'' It's a smile
that says he recognizes full well that the entertainment business
is inconsequential when compared to disease and disaster but,
dammit, if you're in it you might as well do the best job you can.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brooks thought his difficulties getting financing for his
pictures was over after the success of ``Mother,'' the hilarious
story of a middle-aged man moving back home with his mother, with
Brooks and Debbie Reynolds as the stars. But when he showed the
executives the best script he and co-writer Monica Johnson had ever
written, they turned him down. Too ``inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too inside? What does that mean?,'' asks Brooks. ``Funny's
funny. Dramatic's dramatic. It's a good movie.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brooks moved his office over to Universal. But he shot some
scenes near his old Paramount office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pay a location fee to go back to Paramount,'' says
Brooks, givig no clue whether this is a joke or not. ``I signed up
under an assumed name. Jackie Chan.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brooks jokes about it, it drives him crazy that he gets
all these critical accolades and still has to beg a studio to make
his movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not after this one,'' he sighs. ``But that's what I said
after the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within a few moments, Brooks is back in the car heading to the
West End for the series of satellite interviews with radio stations
from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to fool listeners at these radio stations into
thinking I'm not in New York but in Salt Lake City, say,'' says
Brooks. Then he adopts a perfectly pitched DJ's voice. `` `So, Mr.
Brooks, how are you spending your time here in Salt Lake City?'
`Well, this mormning I went downtown and drank coffee in front of a
Mormon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is doing his own warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks settles into his seat at a radio console, like a pilot
ready for take-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if they see my movie as long as they buy a
ticket. . . . Buy a ticket,'' he says to John Gambling of New
York's WOR. ``Aug. 27.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bernard of KQRS asks about the cameos played by various
stars and directors _ including Cybill Shepherd, Wolfgang Puck,
Jennifer Tilly, Lorenzo Lamas, Martin Scorsese, Rob Reiner, and
James Cameron. ``I told Cameron the movie was funnier than
`Titanic,' '' says Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   He's on a roll. ``Aug. 27.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Kevin Matthews of Chicago's WXCD wants to know
is about Sharon Stone's nude scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where you're coming from,'' says Brooks, ``and it's a
pretty pitiful place. It was all her idea, to take her clothes off.
It was appropriate. Sharon's great in the picture. She's got a
great comic touch. She really does. Go see it. Aug. 27.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a bit of a problem. For virtually every interview,
Brooks must explain what the title means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeus had nine daughters,'' he says into the microphone for the
seventh time in an hour. ``One of them ends up living in Hollywood.
. . . You see all the crap coming out of that place _ you wonder
how that could be true. But it is. Trust me on this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the DJ comes on from Planet 96.3 somewhere in the Midwest, a
news bulletin pops up on the CNN television monitor in the radio
studio, saying there's an iceberg off the southern coast of South
America. It must be headed straight for Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been laughing at you a long time,'' says the guy from
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, I'm a comedian.''

NEW HORROR THRILLERS SCARING UP BIG PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IAN SHAPIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scary movies are roaring, moaning, and screeching their way into
America's cineplexes _ and they're swathed in greenbacks.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's horror movies involving some element of the
supernatural have grossed about $360 million, led by ``The Sixth
Sense'' and ``The Blair Witch Project.'' The scare tactics began in
May with ``The Mummy'' and ``The 13th Floor'' and continued with
``The Haunting,'' ``Lake Placid,'' and ``Deep Blue Sea.'' The
onslaught of fright will continue with the release of at least a
half-dozen paranormal thrillers in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sixth Sense,'' a psychological ghost thriller starring
Bruce Willis, eclipsed the super-popular ``The Blair Witch
Project'' when it opened Aug. 6 and has been No. 1 at the box
office for three weekends in a row _ earning $107.7 million in
three weeks. The only other summer movie to hold consecutive weeks
at No. 1 was ``Star Wars: Phantom Menace.'' ``Blair Witch'' has
earned $120.5 million to date.
</P>
<P>
   The success of these movies is defining a new horror genre
tinged with a classic style that harkens back to Alfred Hitchcock's
technique of maintaining a taut tension between the characters and
unseen terror.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond McNally, a professor at Boston College who teaches ``The
History of Horror'' film course, believes it's the little things
making the big effects _ and big dollars for the horror industry.
He said audiences are more sophisticated now and perhaps jaded
about the Freddie Krueger-style effects of 1984's ``Nightmare on
Elm Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slasher movies went repetitive. I am bored with the slasher.
He's some freak. He's insane. Most of the time, they're just
funny,'' he said. ``You have to be able to suspend disbelief _ if I
don't believe it, it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crispin Miller, a media studies professor at New York
University, says the success of these movies is rooted in
contemporary lifestyles. ``It takes more artfulness to frighten
audiences. (In `Blair Witch), the prospect of that solitude is so
scary because we're not used to it. How many of us can live without
our e-mail, beepers, or TV?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a summer fondness for these movies. The fall
season promises a new batch of witches, ghosts, and spirit
elements. Slated for release in mid-September is ``Stir of
Echoes,'' a paranormal thriller about a suburban father plagued by
clairvoyant visions. Then October and November will bring ``The
Astronaut's Wife,'' in which Johnny Depp is taken over by a
mysterious outerspace element; ``Lost Souls'' starring Winona Ryder
as a conspiracy theorist out to stop Satan from wreaking havoc on
Manhattan; ``Stigmata,'' a Boston-based story about a woman
possessed by an evil, violent, and invisible phenomenon; and ``The
End of Days,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger fends off the devil
(surprise!) in a doomsday battle. The year wraps up with a Roman
Polanski film called ``The Ninth Gate,'' opening in December.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, this may seem like the calculated work of industry
machinations and grand plans. But to insiders, the phenomenon is
simply Hollywood happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a zeitgeist _ people get hold of the same idea,''
said Kirk Honeycutt, chief film critic for Hollywood Reporter, a
daily trade magazine based in Los Angeles. ``When a producer has an
idea, he hires a bunch of writers. Everybody comes back with their
own pitches and screenplays, but only one is used _ and then
suddenly there are all these scripts floating around.''
</P>
<P>
   However, directors of such movies like to chalk up the recent
horror fix to a combination of serendipity and a response to last
summer's self-referential and witty movies _ ``Scream 2'' and ``I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' _ that relied on comedic
tactics more than scare tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to make scary movies because there really
weren't any more of them,'' said David Koepp, director of ``Stir of
Echoes.'' ``You don't know you're part of a trend when it starts _
it just sort of happens _ otherwise, it's implied that there is
some logic to Hollywood, which is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of movies fill two needs,'' Koepp added. ``One is
the audience needs to be scared, which goes back to peek-a-boo,
when you spring out and scare a kid out of his wits. The second is
that everyone wants to believe in an afterlife _ and ghost stories
are just intensely comfortable notions.''
</P>
<P>
   M. Night Shyamalan, writer and director of ``The Sixth Sense,''
believes in the less-is-more theory of filmmking. ``People want to
savor things . . . (I) do not throw eye candy at them but attempt
to assimiliate them (the audience) into the lives of the
characters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan, whose influences include Hitchcock and Polanski,
cited as his model Polanski's ``Repulsion,'' a psychological
shocker depicting the mental demise of a sexually repressed woman.
``In that film, you were so into this woman's psychosis, that when
she opens a glass cabinet, you see a reflection of a man _ just for
a second _ and you literally scream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Sixth Sense,'' Shyamalan skillfully applies that
strategy to his child-star Haley Joel Osment, 11, who plays Cole
Sear, a hyper-compassionate and sensitive boy who sees ghosts. In
one scene, the audience catches a glimpse of a woman walking behind
Cole. She's onscreen for only a split second, but the moment is
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Osment, who played Gump's son in 1994's ``Forrest Gump,''
admitted he had nightmares after reading Shyalaman's script.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real scary part is that there really could be kids like
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the human side of the story, the filmmakers want to make
the ghosts frightening _ yet believable. In ``Sixth Sense'' and
``Stir of Echoes,'' the ghosts appear as pale, sometimes bloodied
humans _ not invisible creatures who yell ``Boo!''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Stir of Echoes,'' Koepp tried something new with his
teenage ghost Samantha, a camera technique that combines both a
realistic and supernatural feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally you shoot somebody at 24 frames a second, but we shot
Samantha (played by ballet dancer Jenny Morrison) at 6 frames and
had her move a quarter of normal speed,'' he said. ``So on screen,
there's a weird quiver to her _ it's subtle and you know that
something ain't right.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal of scary movies isn't restricted to current
films. Hitchcock, master of the psychological thriller, still
attracts filmgoers. The Brattle Theatre in Harvard Square,
Cambridge, drew 20,000 people to this summer's seven-week Hitchcock
revival in honor of his 100th birthday, said Connie White of the
Beacon Cinema Group.
</P>
<P>
   But the question still remains. Why on earth does one want to be
scared out of their skinnies?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're attracted to dangerous situations, to the repetition of
it, if it's consistent with what you're feeling inside,'' said
clinical psychologist Lynn Margolies. ``There's a push for these
fears and feelings to come out. But even better than that, it's
safe and it has nothing to do with you in the end.''

NO FUTURE? AT LEAST JOHN LYDON ISN'T HUNG UP ON THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Lydon _ once (and probably forever) known as Johnny Rotten
_ does not stomp around the world in a bad mood, contrary to
popular belief. ``How could I walk around angry?'' Lydon says, his
voice rising in mock-horror. ``I am not like that at all. I mean,
when the song is about a specific subject, then I can be angry. But
I am jolly and substantive.''
</P>
<P>
   At 42, he's happily married and living in Venice Beach, Calif.
And still funny, acerbic, and opinionated. ``Humor is the best way
of dealing with complete and utter nonsense,'' says the former
singer for the Sex Pistols and still the voice of the on-hiatus
band Public image, Ltd. ``Because we are mad, we are very prone to
making absurd conclusions regardless of the evidence. The only true
wisdom in life is (coping with) complete and utter confusion. It's
a fine place to be, a lot better than blandly accepting.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild-eyed punk rocker who in 1976 sang of the Sex Pistols as
``the poison in the human machine,'' looks at humankind this way
now: ``I am more amused. I have always spent more time having fun
with things than being miserable and down.'' This goes back to the
Pistols days; there was often a laugh mixed with the vitriol.
</P>
<P>
   But Lydon's idea of fun certainly includes expressing disdain
for the rampant banalities of today's culture. The pop music
business, for which he's long expressed a deep loathing, is at a
nadir in Lydon's opinion. Consider the chart-topping rap-metal
group that is Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello!'' Lydon says, sounding a wake-up call. ``The whole Limp
Bizkit thing is completely manufactured. That band is so aptly
named. It does sum up the industry right now: One big Limp Biz kit.
(Their young fans) aren't interested in anything at all and they
think it's clever not to be interested. They spend a great deal of
time unlearning and being victims, ultimately. There's some people
like that in every generation, but this seems to be the majority in
this one. Let them enjoy being stupid, because in 20 years' time
they are going to be one sorry, sad sack of people, unemployingly
ignorant. To see knowledge as something bor-ing, and to have it
celebrated . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The self-educated Lydon has never minced his words. His tart,
often hilarious, 1994 autobiography, ``No Irish, No Blacks, No
Dogs,'' bristles with sharp criticism, more than a little of it
self-directed. ``I've not told lies,'' he says, ``and I've always
been true to my word and I mean what I say. You might not like what
I do, but at least I mean it.'' When it comes to promoting his own
work, which this recent interview is, ostensibly, about, Lydon is
hardly a rabid cheerleader for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin has just released a four-CD retropsective of PiL's
two-decade career called ``Plastic Box.'' Make no mistake, Lydon is
proud of what he has done _ ``The main thing about it is, you can't
judge PiL as being about one specific era or sound'' _ but he is
unwilling to don a salesman's jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are records I released a long time ago,'' mused Lydon,
of the package, ``and I'm kind of indifferent. If somebody likes
it, then I'm pleased. If not, well, so what? I have other things
I'm starting on. You know I'm always up to something.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lydon's professed indifference probably has to do with
Virgin, a label with which he's long feuded and is no longer
connected. ``I'm bitterly disappointed with the record label,'' he
says. ``There's a real lack of understanding. It's an outrage that
a label like Virgin would find great difficulty with Public image
and put out (bad music) like the Smashing Pumpkins which does
nothing but right-out imitate the '80s. If (`Plastic Box') is a
success, Virgin will claim it's all to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Public image, Ltd., which released its debut in 1979, helped
lead England's post-punk charge, making music that had the edge and
intensity of punk but with less attention to verse/chorus/verse
``rock'' structures. Sonically, early PiL veered between
ingratiating and grating, using expansive guitar washes and
piercing tendrils, coupled to deep dub-like bass lines. All of this
topped with Lydon's caterwauling vocals, and, quite often,
anti-authoritarian lyrics. Difficult music for difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   The early PiL began as something of an idealistic collective.
Various fallings-out and frequent personnel shifts over the years
left the public impression that Lydon-plus-whoever was PiL. With
those changes came changes in sound: a stark, percussive-heavy
sound with the ``Metal Box'' and ``Flowers of Romance'' albums, a
more melodic, but still enjoyably abrasive, approach with
``Album,'' a more traditional-sounding rock era ushered in with
``Happy?'' Public image, Ltd. flitted in and out of the alternative
rock zeitgeist, scoring with the songs ``This Is Not a Love Song,''
``Rise,'' and ``Disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydon doesn't care for labels or quick sketches. Nor does he
care for a common line of thought that suggests PiL flattened out
and became more conservative over time. ``There aren't any phases,
just different members,'' he insists. The aforementioned theory
``is a very lazy outlook the British music press came up with and
it's nonsense. This is one of the very few outfits that does not
believe in compromise. I can't think of any two PiL songs that are
similar. Sometimes we messed about with an absolute strict formula
for a `rock' song, or a `country' song or a `pop' song. Sometimes,
we took it 10 steps further. Whatever was necessary for the song. I
think PiL played some of the smartest hard rock possible. You
cannot judge PiL as retiring from experimentation because that is
not the way we think and never have. It's good when people like
what we do, but that's coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lydon brought together his old mates in the Sex Pistols
for a reunion tour, risking the nostalgia tag and suffering many
slings and arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about paying a lot of outstanding debts,'' Lydon says.
``We went out without hardly any equipment and did it the way we
always did. No nonsense. Small guitar amps, a minimized drum kit.
All the rest is garbage and fluff, a cover-up for basic inadequacy.
Well, the Pistols were basically inadequate, I suppose, but it
didn't matter. It's the content. If you've got something to say,
bloody hell, all the rest fits naturally into play. . . . It was
dangerous to revisit your past because that kind of stuff can
finish you off, but I like that, being on the gangplank. You sink
or swim by your own merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the Pistols played ferociously, creating a
dumb-smile-inducing time-warp and inspiring a frenzy of mad pogo
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Lydon released a strong, but mostly unheard, solo album two
years ago. Public image, Ltd. exists, he says, ``in my mind. It is
very difficult to raise the money to finance it now. There is a lot
of animosity toward a group that won't play by the norms. We have
always been viewed spitefully and it's always presumed we're doing
(our music) to spite people. When we're in fact not. Everything is
begrudged to PiL.''
</P>
<P>
   With the industry as it is, adds Lydon, ``I'm in no rush to sign
up. I'd rather do nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But is he not bursting with ideas that need to see the light of
day?
</P>
<P>
   Lydon laughs. ``I wouldn't say bursting,'' he says. ``I've never
been overly eager to release my indulgences on the public.''
</P>
<P>
   What is in the future? John Lydon, TV talk show host? VH1 has a
show in development with Lydon. ``It's not a set show,'' he says,
``not a weepy guest celebrity nonsense. It does not have a format,
which is murderous on any sort of writing. There might be music,
there might not be. Everything will be on a tightrope. I don't want
the world to expect any great, suave, well-produced thing at all.
This will raise more questions than answers.''

   RETIRED _ WASHINGTON _ Working when you don't have to seems to
be the best way to go. Retired men who return to work have lower
levels of depression than just about anybody, employed or
unemployed, according to a study by Cornell University
psychologists. This is especially true, the psychologists report
Monday, when the retired working man has a wife who remains at
home. On the other hand, the lowest morale and the highest
depression settle on those men who make retirement permanent.

   BRET _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A blustery shadow of its former self,
Hurricane Bret plodded across a sparsely populated swath of
southern Texas today after riding ashore with less might than
forecasters had feared. The storm, the biggest hurricane to strike
Texas in nearly 20 years, continued to drench the region with
thunderous squalls, but no injuries were reported since Bret made
landfall about 6 p.m. Sunday in sparsely populated Kenedy County.

   NC-SCHOOLDESEG _ CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Public officials gather
Monday hoping to end divisivenss and present a unified public front
on the eve of a judge's ruling on whether the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
public schools qualify as integrated, allowing decades of busing to
end. Members of the school board have disagreed on what remedies
are still needed, even as the board defended itself in court this
summer against suits calling for busing to end, and for it to
continue. Nationally, a recent NAACP survey found about half of
young adults believe that separation of the races is acceptable as
long as there are equal opportunties for everyone _ an attitude
reflected in the Charlotte school debate. (Burritt, Atlanta

   EVERGLADES-FUNDING _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A federal-state

water to farms and cities. Half that money, roughly $200 million a

South and Central Florida. (King, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS)(BS) ``Cabaret Balkan'' If life is a cabaret, old
chum, it's a pretty grim one on a night in Belgrade in 1995. With
heightened realism and black humor, Goran Paskaljevic directs his
ensemble cast through a series of vignettes suggesting nihilistic
life on the edge of apocalypse; politics is only in the background,
while the foreground is filled _ fascinatingly _ with ordinary
people under a state of siege. (R) (Jim Sullivan) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BS)(BS) ``Illuminata'' An affectionate but inescapably clumsy
farce about life backstage at a repertory company in
turn-of-the-century Manhattan. Writer-director John Turturro
sometimes falters, but he's right on target in his obvious
genuflection to the company's leading lady, Katherine Borowitz (his
real-life wife). Her depth and delicacy justify the title. Susan
Sarandon is a big help, too, as a stylish and oh-so-worldly rival
diva. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BS)(BS)(BS) ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' Hugh Grant, of all people, mixes
it up with the mob and makes it work. He plays a proper Brit art
auctioneer naive enough to believe he'll be able to handle marrying
a mob princess (Jeanne Tripplehorn). The fun lies in seeing how he
can't, from the moment he meets his prospective father-in-law
(James Caan), who leads him into a deeper, not to say
bullet-riddled, understanding of the word trouble. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BS) 1/2 ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' Kevin Williamson finally gives us
the kind of shlocky scare movie he previously has had such success
mocking. It's an utter waste of the magnificent Helen Mirren, who
plays a spiteful teacher tied to her bed by students she
maliciously intends to derail just
</P>
<P>
   before graduation. They take a lot longer than we do to realize
that they don't know what they're doing in this sluggish exercise.

`DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS' IS A MUST-SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMING ATTRACTIONS: ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' _ One of the
year's best films. Erick Zonca makes his feature film debut with an
understated French tale of two young women on the edge of town and
the edge of life. It's got fully realized characters, subdued
cinematography, and a realism that seems lost in American film.
Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier are magnificent. This one should
not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Ways to Sunday'' _ Be forewarned, this is a very violent
gangster film. But for those who can enter this dark world, it's
quite a trip with Oedipal overtones combined with Judeo-Christian
conflict. Norman Reedus is terrific as a kid from Ohio who goes to
work collecting debts for the Mob. And look for the transcendent
gangsta, Isaac Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Robeson: Here I Stand'' _ One of the greatest singers,
actors, athletes, and linguists of the 20th century got short
shrift in his own country because of his color and his politics.
The only uncontroversial aspect of Robeson's life was his art. This
documentary includes some fine performance footage and an interview
conducted while he was playing Othello on Broadway _ the first
black man to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' _ If anyone should know about celebrity, it's
writer-director Woody Allen. But the man about Manhattan doesn't
get much deeper than a People magazine profile in this
disappointing effort. Star Kenneth Branagh impersonates the
neurotic auteur and Donald Trump plays himself. Also, look for
Leonardo DiCaprio playing a young movie star.

TAKING EDITH WHARTON TO THE OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edith Wharton wrote ``Summer'' in 1916 when she was 54 and
living in Paris. A novel about sexual awakening and coming of age,
``Summer'' presents one of the most memorable heroines of American
literature, Charity Royall; the setting is a small town in the
Berkshires, where Wharton lived in a great house in Lenox called
``The Mount'' that still flourishes as a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton had sold The Mount five years before she came to write
``Summer,'' but her story and her heroine come home to Western
Massachusetts this week when Berkshire Opera presents the world
premiere performances of Stephen Paulus's opera ``Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, when he was 30, Paulus claimed a space on the operatic
map when he wrote a one-act piece for the Opera Theater of Saint
Louis, ``The Village Singer.'' During the rehearsal period, it was
clear the company had a hit on its hands, and even before opening
night, the company asked Paulus to write a full-length opera. His
own suggestion was an opera based on ``Summer,'' but Richard Gaddes
and Colin Graham, who were running the company, advised against a
second period New England piece. (``The Village Singer'' is based
on a short story by Mary E. Wilkins Freeman.) Paulus is a
professional, prolific, and industrious composer with more than 200
works to his credit at age 49; he may be the only American composer
since Gian-Carlo Menotti who has made his living writing operas _
``Summer'' is his seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``By design, I've never taken a teaching post,'' Paulus said
over the phone during a rehearsal break last week. ``At the
begining, when I was young, a composer's salary seemd just fine,
and since then, it's improved greatly _ at any one time, I have
about 20 commissions lying before me, ranging from operas to
chamber music to a new piano concerto for Anton Nel to play. When
St. Louis turned down my suggestion of `Summer,' they were in a way
taking charge of my career. They were afraid I'd be typecast as a
composer, and wanted me to do something completely different. One
day Colin came up with `The Postman Always Rings Twice,' and that
was completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Postman'' has proved Paulus's most popular opera to date; the
Boston Lyric Opera produced it five seasons ago. ``I still thought
`Summer' would be perfect for an opera, and its atmosphere
resonates with my temperament _ the characters, the irony, the
melancholy. I thought, `Well, someday I may get the chance to write
it.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A talk with an old friend &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That chance came about because of a conversation with his old
friend, conductor Joel Revzen, who is the artistic director of
Berkshire Opera. Coming onto the line, Revzen said, ``I had known
Steve in Minneapolis-St. Paul and had conducted several of his
works. I have always felt that his music is both accessible and
honest. We were just having a friendly conversation one day, when
he told me he'd been wanting to write this opera for years. I
didn't know the novel, but I loved the other books by Edith Wharton
I'd read, and when I did look at `Summer,' I thought this was too
wonderful an opportunity to pass up, so I just told him, `We'll do
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Revzen admires Paulus ``because I know how he writes for the
voice; his music fits into the voice so beautifully _ there's no
screeching. It's the exact opposite to Peter Maxwell Davies's
`Eight Songs for a Mad King,' which has its own wonderful
qualities. When I read the book, I saw immediately how it could
work as an opera. It captures the essence of what I feel about this
place _ I've lived and worked here only in the summers, until now.
It has all the atmosphere _ the smell of wildflowers, the soft
mountains, the feelings of nature _ everything but the tourists! I
convinced our board to take the risk, and we commissioned it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Paulus was in Boston for ``Postman,'' he said he hoped his
next opera would be a comedy. He has composed two operas since
then, and neither was a comedy. ``The Three Hermits'' is a church
opera, on the model established by Benjamin Britten, and ``The
Woman at Otawi Crossing'' is a full-length piece based on a book by
Frank Waters about Edith Warner, who lived in Santa Fe and
befriended both the atomic scientists at Los Alamos and the Native
Americans of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it hasn't worked out that I've written a comedy yet,''
Paulus said, wryly. ``But after his second opera, Verdi waited
until he was 80 _ the smart money preceding me waited to write
comedy! My next opera, based on the story of Abelard and Heloise,
is for the Juilliard Opera Center _ this was another subject I
proposed at St. Louis after they turned down `Summer.' Joel and I
started talking about this project in 1993. By the time he had sold
the board on the idea, raised the money, and got people behind it,
it was 1997. I started real work on it about a year ago. I scored
it for a `do-able' orchestra, about 32 players, which should fill
the house and complement the singers without eradicating them,
which some other composers seem to enjoy doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Revzen had a cast in mind almost from the beginning, and served
as a kind of informal adviser throughout the project. ``Steve was
wonderful, letting me sit in a little on the process. We talked
about the vocal types and characters, and I described what I
thought were the particular strengths and colors of the individual
voices. I thought Charity Royall should be a mezzo, someone with
real substance in the voice to convey Charity's strength, and yet a
singer who is able to float the top notes, like Margaret Lattimore
can. I thought of John Cheek for her guardian and the elder
statesman of the community; I wanted a real voice and presence for
the role. Michael Chioldi, like John, was in our production and
recording of Menotti's `The Consul,' and he has weight in his voice
and a real theatrical presence _ like Maggie (Lattimore), he has a
lot of experience in other kinds of musical theater as well as in
opera. And every member of the cast was hand picked; I think we
have major artists for even the smallest roles.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Turning to an old associate &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paulus chose his librettist for ``The Woman at Otawi Crossing,''
Joan Vail Thorne, to prepare the text. ``I think it is a wonderful
libretto,'' he said. ``It's very lean, and concentrates on the very
unusual and sad love story. The relationship between Charity Royall
and Lucius Harney grows and develops _ she's trapped in this small
town, a prisoner in a place where nothing ever happens, and then
here comes this good-looking stranger, and then they're off. But it
also becomes inevitable that this is not going to work out.''
Wharton wrote only one other novel set in the Berkshires, ``Ethan
Frome,'' which has always been more famous than ``Summer''; Wharton
called the later book her ``hot Ethan.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulus said the text and music have been structured very
carefully to bring a rising tension to the relationship between
Charity and Lucius as it develops. ``In the first act, there is one
duet where they sing of their gorgeous surroundings here in the
Berkshires, and it becomes a metaphor for their budding
relationship. There are two big duets in Act 2, which grow
progressively stronger and more passionate; at a fireworks display
they get down to brass tacks. That's the one place where there may
be something specifically New Englandish in the music _ `Yankee
Doodle' makes an appearance in the texture.''
</P>
<P>
   Revzen is very enthusiastic about the score. ``The work is
beyond anything I expected. It has beauty, honesty, passion, and
lyricism. I don't say this lightly, but I believe this work will go
into the repertory like Carlisle Floyd's `Susannah' and Douglas
Moore's `The Ballad of Baby Doe.' It has that same kind of feeling,
that temperature, the same honest human emotions. And the subject
matter is still relevant _ Carol Gilligan from Harvard is doing
work with young pregnant teenage girls in this very community.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Backdrops do double duty &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The production has been designed by David Gordon. Revzen said,
``Because so much of it is set outdoors in nature, we have 20
projectors putting photographs from the Berkshires onto a dozen
different clapboard panels that slide back and forth. A fabulous
side effect is that the panels are all actually made of wood, so
there are hard surfaces behind the singers, which will add some
sonic ambience to the voices in the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's better than trying to put trees and hills onto the
stage,'' Paulus said. Like Revzen, he speaks with quiet conviction
of the piece. ``My own appraisal is that this is my best stage work
so far. It's my seventh opera, and if you pay attention to what
you're doing, you tend to learn a little bit about the art form _
it's an ongoing task!''
</P>
<P>
   Paulus said that from the beginning people have commented on how
the music keeps the opera moving. ``Nobody is being stabbed or
drawn and quartered, but there is plenty of dramatic tension,
psychological and emotional interplay. There are some angular
little dissonant things, but many lyrical moments too. This is a
love story, after all. To me, the human voice is a special,
wonderful thing; I love the voice and all that it can do. And I
love drama _ people tell me that even my orchestral pieces have
dramatic impact. I also think that over the years, I have learned
to use the orchestra in an opera _ in one aria, for example, the
singer is singing a naive, old, sweet song, but the orchestra
represents the tempest going on around her as she sings and
suggests that things are not at all well; the orchestra puts the
aria into a different frame. I created a piece I thought I would
enjoy hearing.''

 UNDATED: peptides emselves.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If yellow jackets seem more frankly aggressive than bees or
hornets, more apt to assault the innocent, they have reason for
their paranoia. They are the only wasps in North America that
produce large quantities of brood, and so a yellow jacket nest
offers an extraordinary nutritional jackpot, as much as two pounds
of protein, to potential predators like raccoons, skunks and bears.
Thus, they sting at the slightest sign of danger, though their
efforts may be in vain. Bears have been seen to continue raiding
nests even as they were being repeatedly attacked, and one
scientist said he found hundreds of consumed yellow jackets in the
belly of a raccoon he had shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets also grow increasingly aggressive as summer turns
into fall, when they start running out of prey caterpillars or
maggots and must rely on scavenged goodies, which people amply if
unwillingly supply. Some yellow jacket species, particularly the
German yellow jacket, which was introduced onto this continent in
the 19th century and lately has spread throughout the country, are
pure scavengers to begin with, and so really like hanging around
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow jackets have a capacity to learn,'' Schmidt said.
``They learn not only where the places are that have good food,
like picnic tables, but they also learn what time the food will be
there. They won't be flying around the tables at 8 in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick up on our timetables,'' he said, and so will emerge
at lunchtime and scout a favored picnic area even when it is empty.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow jackets are hunting for two food sources: meat, to
feed the larvae back at the nest, and sweets, to give themselves
energy as they scavenge. The adults also get some sugar from their
young charges. Upon bringing back some masticated protein and
feeding these so-called meatballs to the larvae, the larvae
regurgitate sugar water that the adults then drink.
</P>
<P>
   The workers truly work themselves to death, with their tasks
changing as their lives progress, from safe to dangerous. Young
workers stay home tending the nest, feeding the larvae or building
new cells. Only as they approach the end of their 30-day life span
do workers assume treacherous foreign assignments like foraging.
Yellow jackets are also adept at switching roles when need be.
Workers operate by the clock: if somebody on the assembly line
fails to show up for duty, after a certain point the worker next in
line assumes her comrade is dead, and does the job herself.
</P>
<P>
   Even the queen is capable of getting down on her hands and knees
(and knees), and doing whatever needs doing. When a queen emerges
from hibernation in the spring, she must do everything herself:
find an abandoned rodent hole in which to start building a nest,
lay eggs and hunt for food to feed the first larvae. Only after she
has reared enough workers to take over the mundane housekeeping
chores does she retreat permanently into the nest and spend the
rest of the season laying eggs, as she alone is capable of doing.
By late summer or early fall, her colony may consist of several
thousand workers.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather cools, the queen starts generating eggs with a
new destiny before them: some will be born potential queens, and a
scattering of others will emerge as drones, males fit only to
inseminate those queens. The virgin queens and males fly up and
mate in an autumnal frenzy. Afterward, the males die, soon to be
followed by the queen mother and her workers.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the newly fertilized queens seek shelter for the
cold weather to come, and they have a genius for persistence.
Studying how yellow jackets survive the harshness of an Alaskan
winter, Brian M. Barnes, a professor of zoophysiology with the
Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska in
Fairbanks, and his students tracked yellow jackets in the field.
</P>
<P>
   They determined that a new queen will dig into leaf litter left
from the previous autumn. In that way, when the new leaves fall,
the queens are under a double layer of protection from cold and
moisture. As the snow falls, it covers the leaves, offering yet
another insulating blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the temperature within the leafy shelter, the
researchers found that it never fell below about 15 degrees
Fahrenheit, compared with an outside temperature of, say, 40 below.
They also learned that the queen was able to ``supercool'' herself,
her body tissues falling below freezing without forming deadly ice
crystals, partly the result of her being sheltered from any water
or ice particles that would set the crystallization process in
motion. She subsists in a state of cryogenic preservation, hanging
under the leaves, Barnes said, ``like a mummy.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not take much to arouse her, though. When the
researchers brought wintering queens into the lab and thawed them
out, the queens rapidly reanimated and, Barnes said, ``started
trying to sting us.''

LURKING IN `THE EMPEROR'S SHADOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stories of ancient Chinese emperors are favorites of modern
Chinese directors, and no wonder. In a country where direct public
commentary on contemporary leaders and social conditions always
risks ruining the commentator, using distant mirrors to make veiled
observations is as close as many Chinese ever come to free public
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Qin Shi Huangdi, the first ruler to unify China, lived 22
centuries ago _ sometimes on one side of the diaphanous curtain
dividing fable from fact, sometimes on the other. Builder of the
Great Wall and the Grand Canal, master of the fabulous terra-cotta
armies of Xian, tyrant, visionary, his life is, literally, carved
in stone, and his legacy _ the imperative for China to maintain its
unity at all costs _ is possibly the strongest single strand in the
country's political culture.
</P>
<P>
   Blessedly for the contemporary storyteller, the stone carvings
are mostly paeans of praise to the great man, providing no main
story line or narrative. The emperor's friends, enemies, and
nemeses are recorded only sketchily, almost as props providing a
backdrop for the great man's life. Directors and writers can't tell
his story without using large doses of imagination. And that opens
the door to a most Chinese practice _ using historical semi-fiction
to comment on contemporary leaders and conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emperor's Shadow'' opens with scenes of military pomp and
pageantry, a bow to the film's billing as the first made-in-China
epic.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is ample marching around and bloodletting to
maintain the appearances of a nation-building saga, this is not
what the story is about.
</P>
<P>
   From armies in the field, the film cuts sharply to a woman
nursing two infants: one her own son, Gao Jianli, who will become
the greatest musician of his time, the other Ying Zheng, who will
become the first emperor. As she nurses them, she sings of ``two
little doggies, dreaming of a bone . . . biting all night, mouths
full of fur.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the true subject of ``The Emperor's Shadow'' _ the
culture war between ruthlessly authoritarian rulers on one side and
doomed but indomitable artists and intellectuals on the other that
persists in Chinese society, discomfiting its leaders, to this day.
</P>
<P>
   A record of 100 Chinese characters establishes Gao Jianli as a
historical character. It states only that he was a master of music
whom the emperor wanted to keep close because they were countrymen
_ an important tie in the era of warring states in which the boys
grew up and faced hair-raising dangers together.
</P>
<P>
   Later histories state that Gao hated the emperor, and refused to
bend to his will. The emperor had him blinded so he would
concentrate on his music; the musician filled his instrument with
lead to strike back at the emperor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition that a latter-day historian could add such
detail accurately is at best improbable, says Zhou Xiaowen,
director of ``The Emperor's Shadow,'' whose previous films focused
on contemporary social conditions. ``History, as soon as you start
writing it, it becomes fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Zhou seizes on the real or imagined tensions between
the men to illuminate the conflict between politics and free
expression that has repeatedly led to spasms of repression in the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists in China have no position, no place in society,'' Zhou
said in an interview at Wellesley College last winter, when it
seemed his film was finally about to be released in the United
States. ``It is easy for the powerful to control them. But to
control their creativity is impossible. Their spirit and creativity
can never be controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   As Zhou tells the story, Gao's and Ying's paths diverge in early
manhood as one pursues music and the other power, but as the goal
of empire comes within his grasp, Ying draws Gao into the imperial
inner circle, and becomes obsessed with the idea that his musician
friend can write an anthem that will win the hearts and minds of
the people in a way that military prowess and grandiose
construction cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Gao stubbornly refuses to do the composition, despite torture
and the enticements of the emperor's favorite daughter, who falls
for the musician and winds up in her own futile, ultimately fatal,
struggle for control of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Rulers for two millennia have shown ``this impulse for control
of people's minds,'' Zhou says. ``Telling people what to do and
having them obey is not enough. The ruler feels `you have to think
as I think.' This first emperor has the supreme power, but he
cannot control the soul or mind of a single friend of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou steadfastly refuses to confirm what seem obvious parallels
between his fictionalized history and Chinese society today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrespective of who they are _ workers, officials, film
critics _ after they watch the film people come to their own
conclusions based on their own experience,'' he says blandly,
laying down a defense a modern thought commissar would have trouble
breaching. ``An artist does not have the right to try to shape
people's minds. I'm not trying to hide anything in the movie. It is
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emperor's Shadow'' was completed in 1996, but has had a
rough time getting shown in China and America. The director and
producers made a US tour last December, when they felt a commercial
release was imminent; the film is just now being screened _ on the
festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the film initially passed censorship. Then, two weeks
after it opened, the filmmakers were told it could not be screened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know why,'' Zhou says. ``It was stopped, banned.
After seven months, I heard it was OK to show again. There was just
a sentence in an `internal' document.''
</P>
<P>
   With a budget of $5 million, ``Shadow'' is one of the most
costly films made in China, and its billing as an epic could be
what made it palatable, initially, to Beijing's current autocrats.
Tired of seeing the megabucks of the moviegoing masses flow to Hong
Kong and Hollywood while cutting-edge Chinese directors, in the
words of a New China News Agency critique, ``produce elitist works
that focus on the oppressed,'' the leadership is trying to
encourage homemade epic production that serves ``as an
entertainment as well as a means of refuge from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the irony of the current emperors winding up
with a film they cannot fully stomach is delicious. Like Qin Shi
Huangdi, they were smart enough to know they could not send a
flunky to do an artist's work. And also like the first emperor,
they overreached themselves: In trying for one of the best
directors, they wound up with someone who would not bend to their
will. He made an epic about ancient history that is all about
today.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They call it ``narrowcasting'' _ that is,
something-different-for-everyone programming. Say you're into
extreme sports: There's a show for you. The rave scene? Click right
in. This philosophy of programming lies at the heart of Digital
Entertainment Network (or Den), an Internet startup targeting
14-to-24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sole mission is the self-actualization of Generation Y,''
says Den president David Neuman. ``And we would not be embracing
that unless we embrace everybody _ every ethnic group, every
interest, psychographic, and subculture.''
</P>
<P>
   So how narrow is narrowcasting? Here are a few examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tales from the Eastside'': Described by Den staffers as a
Latino ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' this made-for-the-Net soap opera
presents the barrio of East Los Angeles as a mix of gangs, love
affairs, and the occasional boxing match. The characters border on
stereotypes _ hardly a cultural breakthrough. But the show is
presented in both Spanish and English, and interactive links
connect viewers to information about prominent Latino artists and
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct Drive'': Host Veronica De La Cruz, a 23-year-old
promoter of dance parties in Los Angeles, spotlights the DJ
culture, introducing viewers to the styles and the spinners. The
show offers an inside look at a phenomenon that has been all but
ignored by the mainstream media. ``The kids don't have a place to
go,'' says De La Cruz. ``It's a very underground community, and Den
is giving kids the programming they want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chang Gang'': Den executives describe this show as a ``Hardy
Boys mystery with Asian-American kids,'' with a supernatural twist
similar to ``The X-Files.'' Den designer Leo Zhao, who was born in
China, says of the series, ``It represents a segment of Asian kids,
the sort who wear designer labels and drive custom-made cars. It
represents a part of us, not all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frat Ratz'': ``Animal House'' for the '90s _ only the clothes
are different. In the Den's own description, the heroes are
``feebleminded stalwarts'' who ``stumble and bumble through
calamity after calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Redemption High'': The pilot hasn't been shown yet, but the
show is about a group of Christian teenagers faced with issues of
faith and fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help Den'': A self-help show for teens that explores such
issues as AIDS and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggronation'': Extreme sports on demand. Watch for
opportunites to click and buy the equipment when the network
launches officially in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of a Punk Planet'': Rival punk rockers band together to
save their favorite nightclub. Not your usual dramatic series
subject, but the script is your basic fill-in-the-blanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exoticom'': Two wild and crazy guys travel the globe and offer
their ``insights.'' In Thailand, they ride elephants, commune with
monkeys, and visit ancient temples. Here's the show's take on
Buddhism: ``I'm not real familiar with the religion, but the monks
lead these really incredible lives'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Rated DG'': The show claims to feature film critics and
reviews, but it offers little more than glorified press releases
for feature films, complete with promotional footage. Here's a
recent ``review'': ``If you like smart scripts, cute chicks, and
pot-eating presidents, check out `Dick.' '' Not.

   On the op-ed page of Sunday's New York Times, Warren Beatty gave
readers fresh hope that maybe he will run for president after all.
He didn't come straight out and say as much, but he's famous for
being elliptical, another indication he'd make a good candidate.
You had to read between the lines of Beatty's column, which wasn't
easy:
</P>
<P>
   ``But when a Roosevelt-Truman-Stevenson-Kennedy Democrat,
comfortably continuing a career of writing and directing movies,
accepts the megaphone tossed to him, it will be to challenge the
present party to admit its timidity in protecting those who need
help most and to acknowledge the undeniable: To achieve universal
health care, to tend adequately to the 100 million Americans left
behind in the prosperity of the global economy, to lift 35 million
of our people out of poverty, a segment of our population that has
remained virtually constant for 20 years, to give the 20 to 25
percent of our children who live in poverty a decent start in life,
to protect our environment and improve our schools, to arouse the
nonvoting half of our population to participate in public life, WE
MUST HAVE COMPLETE PUBLIC FINANCING OF ALL FEDERAL CAMPAIGNS.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one sentence. Amazing. Obviously the man has mastered
political rhetoric. You can almost hear him intoning those lines,
his voice rising on the capital letters. He's running all right,
whether he admits it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has windbaggery down pat. He's also capable of inducing
what I think of as the Clinton effect. It's a perverse reaction
that occurs when you hear a politician articulating an opinion you
hold strongly and you find yourself thinking: Gee, maybe I'm wrong
about that.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to disagree with his point, that too much money is
ruining politics. And yet there's something about the way he says
it that's so . . . political. Not that I doubt his sincerity. As a
struggling actor/writer/director/producer in Hollywood, his
sympathies would naturally lie with the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Beatty's column, I remembered that he's famous for
wanting to control even the smallest details of his film projects.
He's reputed to be so in love with his own work that he finds
editing his films painful. The column in question may be the
journalistic equivalent of ``Reds,'' Beatty's interminable
``masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   I would guess it came to the Times with instructions not to
change a word. I would also guess that if a lesser figure had
expressed the same thoughts in the same way the paper would never
have run the piece. But he's Beatty, and there is a mystique that
hovers about him, a mystique that arises not from his acting,
producing, or directing _ and definitely not from his writing _ but
from his sex life. His reputation as a lover of uncountable numbers
of women has made him a national icon. If someone were to poll
American women and ask, a) Have you had sex with Warren Beatty? or
b) Can you pick Bill Bradley out of a crowd? there would be many
more of the former than the latter.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that after eight years of sexual shenanigans in
the White House, the American public would be ready for Beatty, a
real pro, one of the few men in the public eye whose sexual track
record makes Bill Clinton look positively monklike by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   There's no comparsion, really. Beatty spent four decades on the
prowl in Hollwood and made love to many of the the most beautiful,
famous women in the world. Then he got married.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got married first and then, well, we know too much about
that already.

visitors seem to have become an endangered species. These serene

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Leave Bush's past private life alone
 &HT;    (Eds: Changes ``power'' to ``powder'' in 6th graf.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, OK, we've got it: If George W. Bush hadn't used cocaine as a
young man he would say so, but he won't say so, so he did. Does
this matter?
</P>
<P>
   The reasons recited for it mattering are not meritless.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is running as the un-Clinton, a guy who will bring dignity,
morality and good posture back to the presidency, in the service of
which, and himself bringing his private life into play, he crows
about his marital fidelity. His dodge on cocaine _ and his weaselly
words _ make Bush seem more Clinton-like than not.
</P>
<P>
   (Bush thus joins the lengthening line of glass-house Republican
moralists throwing stones. The most delicious: fallen House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who apparently was slippin' around while trying to
impeach Bill Clinton for slippin' around. And Newt, unlike Clinton,
may even have Gone All the Way. The GOP is turning into an army
marching on clay feet.)
</P>
<P>
   Too, Bush has been hell on criminals, dopers especially, to the
point of demagoguery. There is at best a certain awkwardness in
firing up a wrathful law-and-order politics only after your own
statute of limitations has run out.
</P>
<P>
   No one would expect Bush to volunteer to do five-to-10 just for
makeup, but one of Bush's assets for the GOP has been his ability
to attract minority voters. It will not be lost on
African-Americans that, personifying a persistent pattern, here's
another rich white boy getting a bye on powder coke while their
kids are imprisoned for half of forever for using crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even given all that, the case for caring about Bush's or
any other candidate's distant drug use is made up as much of
excuses for the prurience as of reasons for the information.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with dogging candidates' every old moral misstep
threatens to reduce the draw for political leadership to a
righteous little huddle of prigs who don't have a clue about how
the rest of us live.
</P>
<P>
   These moral shakedowns are said to be in the service of
determining a candidate's character, but ``character'' deserves a
broader assay than adding up Sunday school demerits.
</P>
<P>
   Is President Clinton's character, for the purposes of
governance, defined just by l'affaire Monica or does his rare
political willingness to stand up to the National Rifle Association
count into the balance?
</P>
<P>
   No, we don't want to turn politics over to those awful hedonists
against whom _ o, irony _ Gingrich has been warning us. But voters
have far more poise about private conduct than do the journalistic
inquisitors torturing politicians titularly on the electorate's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Most shrugged off admissions by Al Gore and _ here he is again!
_ Gingrich that they'd smoked a little Mexican laughing tobacco way
back when. Clinton's sexual incontinence struck most, on unpleasant
balance, as preferable to his tormentors' righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   Something like half of us have done dope. Few went to the
nuptial couch virgins. We need to be more wise about, than wise to,
each other.

BUSH'S BIG FLINCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR;  _ Thanks a lot, Junior.
</P>
<P>
   For a few, brief, shining moments, President-in-waiting George
W. Bush seemed to be striking a blow for the majority of the public
and the minority of journalists who believe private lives have
nothing to do with public character _ not in history, not in the
here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also seemed to be striking an equally important blow
against the very idea of those invasive ``questions'' fed by rumors
that self-righteous busybodies and hypocritical character cops use
to feed the infotainment machine in the guise of examining
qualifications for public office.
</P>
<P>
   But then he blew it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of standing for a principle on ``the cocaine question,''
Bush caved at the first sign of political trouble, tossed his
principle overboard, and morphed into a caricature not worth
defending. You can't try to help someone who folds on you.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Bush flip-flop, he did flip-flops on his flip-flops
_ and probably isn't done yet. That's a bad enough public display
for a president-in-waiting, but nothing exceeds the damage the
simple, damning phrase, ``Candidate X later explained,'' can do to
someone's credibility, especially in a period when the electorate
is just getting to know him.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't even close to political damage, much less anything
worse. But it's telling. In presidential preprimary politics,
history teaches that you never know when the lights will suddenly
go up and the country awaken from its appropriate ennui long enough
to take a serious peek at you. That's when you want to be at your
best _ not caving, flip-flopping, and dissembling.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, much more was at stake than one person's
ambition and tactics. He had a chance to stand up against much of
what people justifiably hate about both politics and journalism but
ended up making the game worse.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on _ and has been going on with dizzying speed for
more than a decade _ is a steady plummeting of standards, which has
empowered sleaze politics. The most important of the trends has
been a gradual easing of the obstacles to floating rumors into the
mainstream of campaigns via the press in the complete absence of
any direct evidence relating to truth or accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor had it that a certain newspaper was about to report Mike
Dukakis seeking mental health help after his defeat for governor in
1982 . . . Newly chosen House Speaker Tom Foley might be gay . . .
Did George Bush fool around before becoming president? . . . Bill
Clinton might have tried to renounce his citizenship or played
footsie with the KGB in the late '60s . . . Unnamed people in raw
FBI files suggest the late John Tower was a wild drunk . . .
Questions raised about the alleged associations of one of Pat
Buchanan's associates.
</P>
<P>
   The key common denominator is rumor without directly supporting
evidence, yet each drop of poison had its moment in the mainstream
simply because the press was willing to lower standards so that a
rumor could produce a question that could be dressed up to suggest
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat unscientifically, I have a short-form description of
how this madness has proliferated. I start in my computer's massive
press archive, by entering the words ``rumor'' and ``rumors'' and
then the date 1980. The result is 32,933 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Change the date to 1990 and the number of hits nearly triples to
88,095.
</P>
<P>
   Then change the date to 1998 and the number nearly doubles
again, to 161,400.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could have assaulted this system frontally by sticking to
his guns as a mature man who once wasn't, arguing the irrelevance
of detail and refusing to play the questions game. He had
substantial public support.
</P>
<P>
   But principle was soon unmasked as tactic. Politically, it
helped him to say faithful husband and teetotaler, so he did. But
then, after asking support for a refusal to talk about drugs in the
past in the absence of a single specific allegation, he ditched his
position on the fly last week.
</P>
<P>
   Like any pol playing games loosely, he was trapped by his own
campaign's stupid failure to check the simple facts of high-level
government and White House background checks, which ask about drug
use beginning at age 18, leading him to stonewall on a topic he
himself put into play.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he's equated the presidency with a staff job in the White
House or a slot at the FBI. The Constitution says otherwise;
there's no application form, and it's the people who decide.
Benjamin Harrison's life was stable, and Andy Jackson's was a mess.
Who was the more effective leader?
</P>
<P>
   Bush has squandered his case with astonishing incompetence. But
the more important casualty will be the press's shrinking
credibility, and I shudder to think how many hits my computer will
get after next year.

 &HT;    Archive shows soft drink's changing images
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's the real Coke formula: Team up with Santa and
conquer the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 years ago, Coca-Cola Co. decided to do just that after
getting tired of seeing sales fizzle following the hot summer
months.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta-based company needed an unusually effective
marketing campaign if it was going to change entrenched consumer
drinking habits that had been built over decades. Selling cold Coke
during the winters of the late 1920s and early 1930s was almost as
fruitless as selling ice.
</P>
<P>
   Enter artist Haddon Sundblom with his depictions of the jolly
old man from the North Pole in need of a drink as he slid down
chimneys and flew around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Claus needs refreshment along the way, so why not
Coke?'' Philip Mooney, the company's archivist, asked rhetorically.
``It struck an emotional chord with the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that rich marketing history is stored in the
subterranean bowels of the company's headquarters on North Avenue.
Coca-Cola's archive, one of the most extensive in the corporate
world, is located below the parking garage and requires a special
elevator and security code to enter.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not open to the public, the company recently
provided The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a rare look at its
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The well-organized, 8,000-square-foot basement houses
decades-old Coke bottles and cans, and examples of the company's
marketing and advertising campaigns over the past 113 years. They
are kept on 10-foot library shelves in three rooms, where the
temperature is a constant 68 degrees to protect the documents from
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million-plus collection helps explain how Coke became
one of the world's most famous brands.
</P>
<P>
   19th century junk mail?
</P>
<P>
   If you think direct marketing is some relatively new concept,
think again. In the 1890s, the company mailed redeemable Coke
coupons to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Said an 1898 pitch:
</P>
<P>
   ``We herewith enclose a complimentary card entitling you to one
glass of Coca-Cola free at any soda fountain dispensing it.'' At
the time, Coke was almost exclusively dispensed at drugstore
counters for 5 cents a glass.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, these early marketing campaigns focused on Coke's
alleged health benefits. An 1890 ad described the soft drink this
way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful nerve and brain tonic and remarkable therapeutic
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad in May of that year insists:
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola is needed to overcome depression and languor in the
warm May days.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, of course, the druggists didn't know about Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the archive material shows how the company switched
from its medicinal marketing approach to one centered on fun and
refreshment. Nearly everyone in a Coke ad started wearing a smile
that any dentist would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   As the company attempted to expand its reach, it put its name
and distinctive script logo on as many promotions as possible _
from carrying trays, calendars and soda jerk hats, to counter
stools, toys, puzzles, checkers and school kits.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, executives knew that getting kids to start drinking
Coke early on was key to the company's long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, local bottlers distributed Coke's school kit
around the country. It included a bookmark, ruler, pencil, eraser,
fountain pen and blotter _ all with the company's logo on it.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1950s and 1960s, the company began sponsoring
instructional films for both schools and athletic programs. Titles
included ``Catching a Football'' and ``How to Invite a Girl to the
Prom and What to do There.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can teach a course on American social history and just use
material from Coca-Cola,'' said Mooney, the 54-year-old archivist
who's been at the company for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The archive also holds a lesson about how investors' appetite
for corporate information has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, the company's 40th anniversary annual report was just
10 pages, and only two of them contained financial data. By
contrast, the 1998 annual report is 65 pages, and full of
statistical and strategic information.
</P>
<P>
   Sports is key
</P>
<P>
   By looking at Coke's marketing and advertising campaigns through
the years, it's easy to see how important sports has become, both
in society and to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has spent billions of dollars associating itself with
famous athletes and sporting events around the globe. The archive
not only contains past Olympic and World Cup campaigns, but the
in-depth strategies that generated them. That way, executives can
look at what the company did in previous years when they develop
future promotions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are eight loose-leaf books, each containing
hundreds of pages, about Coke's marketing strategy during the 1996
Summer Games in Atlanta, with stats on how effective the programs
were. In fact, the archive has marketing information on what Coke
did during every Olympics since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The company's reliance on sports began in the early 1900s, when
it used baseball players, including ``Georgia Peach'' Ty Cobb, to
endorse its soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Coca-Cola used such timeless baseball themes,
it also took advantage of topical events. During the height of
World War II, for example, the company depicted men and women in
military uniforms drinking Coke. Patriotism sells, especially
during a war.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has employed imaginary figures to plug its soft
drink, such as the ``Sprite Boy'' of the 1940s and 1950s. This
smiling, young elflike spirit with white hair hawked Coke nearly as
hard as Santa did. (The Sprite brand was not introduced until
1961.)
</P>
<P>
   Archive lives today
</P>
<P>
   When brand managers are looking for fresh approaches to
marketing, they often consult with Mooney about the archive
material. There's usually a lesson there about why some campaigns
worked and others didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa campaign, for example, originally flopped for Coke. In
1930, artist Fred Mizen depicted Santa in a department store as
just a regular guy dressed in a red and white costume. But research
told Coke that consumers didn't relate to that concept. They wanted
``the real thing'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   So the next year, the company commissioned artist Sundblom to
depict St. Nicholas rushing around delivering toys on Christmas
Eve. Sundblom painted Santa as a jovial figure with a hearty laugh
and twinkling eyes. Santa was capable of raiding the icebox or
rewarding you if you left him a Coke.
</P>
<P>
   To this very day, Sundblom's artwork is used in Coke marketing
campaigns in diverse parts of the globe. In fact, as the company
expanded overseas, many of the images Coke initially created for
the U.S. market turned out to have universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The trademark script, bright red color, patented contour bottle
and much of the marketing material frequently could be transported
from nation to nation without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   That also applies to Coca-Cola material used by restaurant
chains in the United States and abroad. Many restaurants want to
have a certain historical motif or atmosphere in their facilities,
so they contact Mooney to see what the archive might be able to
provide. Images can then be reproduced and hung in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The archive has even put about 6,500 historical images on the
company's internal database so employees can see some of the
possibilities. They can then pass the information on to interested
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company licenses many of the images to other firms
that sell everything from Coke playing cards to decorative
glassware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the archives as another resource our managers can
use to increase the business and to connect with consumers in ways
that have been relevant to their lives,'' Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a museum.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-QUAKE-LESSONS (Undated) _ Teams of American scientists and
engineers have joined Turkish colleagues in seeking ``take home''
lessons from last week's devastating earthquake. For Americans the
question is: Can this faraway earthquake help predict the next big
one in California? By Sandra Blakeslee. (1650 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RABBITS (Undated) _ A new rabbit species has been discovered
in the mountains between Laos and Vietnam. By Henry Fountain. (200
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OCEAN-CABLES (Undated) _ Making use of thousands of miles of
discarded telephone cables, scientists have begun to wire remote
regions of deep ocean floor to create an undersea network of
geological observatories. The old cables will serve as deep-sea
extension chords running thousands of miles from land-based power
stations to sensors, some of which are already sending back
continuous flows of data from the ocean floor. By Malcolm W.
Browne. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEPTUNE-RINGS (Undated) _ New observations of Neptune's
rings with space telescopes obliterate the leading theory on why
the rings are there. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: Items on planet-eating
stars, erosion, good news in the air. By Henry Fountain. (700
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-JOURNALS-ECON (Undated) _ A generation ago, leading medical
journals measured their profits in the tens of thousands of
dollars. They were scholarly publications meant to help doctors
keep abreast of scientific advances and share information on new
remedies. That mission has not changed. But increasingly, the
journals have become cash cows for the medical societies and
companies that own them, with annual profits in the tens of
millions of dollars, largely from drug company advertising. By
Lawrence K. Altman Jr. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: If bad
medical news is delivered badly, it can permanently damage the
doctor-patient relationship, leading to a loss of confidence in a
doctor's recommendations and treatment plan. Some news is
particularly devastating to families, and few doctors are prepared
to break it. By Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TEENS-FASHION (Undated) _ Most teen-age girls retain their
self-esteem, despite being barraged by fashion-model thinness in
teen magazines. By Erica Goode. (355 words)

<P>
   SCI-WOMEN-IRONMAN (Undated) _ Two American women are vying to be
the first in five years to complete a Double Ironman: 4.8 miles of
swimming, 224 miles of biking and 52.4 miles of running, in
consecutive events. By Liz Neporent. (670 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ESTROGEN-EXERCISE (Undated) _ Recent studies suggest that
estrogen may make women less prone to muscle soreness after
exercise. By Nancy Stedman. (900 words)

<P>
   Seventy-two years ago, on Aug. 23, 1927, Nicola Sacco and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti were executed in Massachusetts for a crime they
probably did not commit. The two Italian immigrants were hard
working men _ Sacco worked in a shoe factory, Vanzetti sold fish on
the docks. Neither men had a criminal record, nor were they
Communists. They were, however, pacifists and anarchists and had
avoided the draft during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Those three elements convicted them of the murder of a paymaster
and a payroll guard in South Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Despite contradictory evidence, the two were found guilty in
July, 1921 and sentenced to death. An appeal was denied, even
though new evidence implicated other men. In his book ``An Almanac
of Liberty,'' former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas
wrote: ``They were convicted on the flimsiest evidence ... a
reading of the record years later leaves the impression that Sacco
and Vanzetti, charged with murder, were convicted because they were
pacifists, draft dodgers and radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1920s, the nation was convulsed with a fear of
Communist infiltrators. The federal government arrested and
deported thousands of immigrants who had come to our shores from
Europe because they were suspected of being in sympathy with
communism and Russia. The hysteria swept through communities and
states where newly arrived immigrants had taken jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard in this nation, Sacco and Vanzetti did not get a
fair trial. Unfortunately at that time, the Supreme Judicial Court
of Massachusetts had very limited powers of review. The court could
only review questions of law, not the weight of the evidence. It
could not consider the whole record of the case in order to weigh
whether an appeal was necessary. The court could not order a new
trial even when it felt that an injustice had been done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Sacco-Vanzetti case, that changed 12 years
later, after the hysteria against ``foreigners'' had abated. The
power of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was greatly
expanded in capital cases. According to Douglas, ``By an Act passed
in ((Aug. 25,)) 1939 it was granted review of the whole case _ of
the law and the evidence; and it was given the power to order a new
trial, if satisfied that justice required it. No longer was the
trial judge absolute master; no longer could his prejudice or
partisanship determine the fate of men.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson here to consider. In the past decade, the U.S.
Supreme Court has consistently narrowed the right of a death row
inmate to appeal in federal courts _ whether or not new evidence
points to someone else as the murderer. This stricter limit on
appeals must inevitably lead to the execution of those who are
innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted and sentenced
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting appeals in capital punishment cases speeds up the
process from conviction to execution _ but often it is the very
length of time an inmate spends on death row that raises the odds
of a successful appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976 when the high court reinstated the death penalty, 82
death row inmates have been freed, but 566 were executed. How many
more were innocent?
</P>
<P>
   There are currently more than 3,500 men and women on death row
in this nation. How many are innocent?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Reinhardt,
dissenting in the decision to allow Thomas Thompson to be executed
in California, wrote: ``In closing, I would observe that the
miscarriage of justice that is about to occur is the product of the
federal judiciary's elevation of procedure over justice, of speed
and efficiency over fairness and due process. I regret that we have
chosen that course in recent years, and believe that in doing so,
we have severely tarnished our nation's justice system.'' Thompson
was executed on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Dworkin, professor of law and philosophy at New York
University wrote in the Los Angeles Times, July 11 edition: ``The
Supreme Court has become impatient, and `super due process' has
turned into `due process-lite.' Its impatience is understandable,
but it is also unacceptable. If Americans insist on the death
penalty, they must accept the moral consequences of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges must listen, with painstaking and patient attention, to
every argument for life that is not plainly frivolous. If they find
any actual mistake in the process that has condemned a human being
to death, they must repeat that process and give him another chance
for life. These are inescapable moral demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we cannot meet these demands? What if we cannot
tolerate all the stays and appeals and retrials that a decent
respect for human life requires without making the law seem foolish
and without subverting the point of a death sentence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we must abandon capital punishment, even if we think it
right in principle, because then we cannot have it, even if it is
right, without cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 years in Illinois, 12 men have been executed
while 12 others on death row were exonerated. Illinois could take
pride in its judicial system regarding capital punishment, if those
12 inmates were freed by an appeals system that was working well.
However, that wasn't the situation in most of the successful
appeals; it was pure luck that saved the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Darby Tillis and Perry Cobb were convicted of robbing and
murdering two people at a hot dog stand in 1977. Years later, a
young lawyer who read a news story about their case, realized he
had worked with the state's star witness against Tillis and Cobb.
He remembered, too, that she had told him she and her boyfriend had
planned to rob the restaurant but the plan went awry and someone
was shot. In a new trial in 1987, Tillis and Cobb were found not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   David Protess, professor of journalism at Northwestern
University, and a few of his students helped free four men
convicted of gang rape and a double murder. Two of the men were on
death row; two were given life sentences. They had already spent 18
years behind bars. Protess and his students unearthed new evidence
and caused the witnesses to change their stories. Later three other
men confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Protess and his students also helped free a man who was only two
days away from execution after 17 years behind bars. Anthony Porter
had been convicted of a double murder. Protess and his team of
students gathered evidence that proved that Porter was innocent.
Key witnesses changed their testimony. And a Milwaukee man
confessed to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism professors aren't part of the judicial system. We
cannot count on the help of those outside the system to exonerate
those wrongfully convicted. Without Protess and his students, there
is little doubt that Anthony Porter would have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of realizing innocent people might have been
executed, Illinois _ with 156 inmates on death row _ has
temporarily put a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the Sacco-Vanzetti case is pivotal _ appeals
cannot and should not be arbitrarily limited. Streamling the
judicial process for capital punishment irrevocably streamlines
death for the innocent. And that price is too high, morally.

ONE WRONG ANSWER MARRED TEXAS DISTRICT'S HIGH EDUCATION MARKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was praised by one newspaper for its ``standards,
accountability and a demonstrated belief that school systems are
run for the benefit of the children, not the people who work for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called its previous
superintendent ``the wisest education reformer I have met in 55
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ysleta school district on El Paso's heavily Hispanic east
side was above all something most poor, urban districts are not: a
success. It was a model that educators came from around the nation
to study.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the state's highest-performing inner-city school
district suffered a serious blow. The Texas Education Agency, which
last year praised Ysleta for its accomplishments, labeled the
district with a new, low rating because of errors in its dropout
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of an organization is not the absence of problems
but how it deals with them once they arise,'' said Manny Soto,
Ysleta's associate superintendent. ``Even though you get knocked
down, you pick yourself up.''
</P>
<P>
   State ratings are based on the percentage of students passing
the state basic skills test and its dropout and attendance rates.
With 80 percent passing the skills test, Ysleta last year became
the state's first ``recognized'' urban district, second only to the
TEA's ``exemplary'' distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ysleta finds itself with an altogether more troubling
rating: ``unacceptable'' because of erroneous data. Austin was the
only other district to receive such a rating, though the state is
investigating dropout data at 14 other school systems, six of them
in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically Ysleta underreported its dropouts,'' said DeEtta
Culbertson, a TEA spokewoman. ``Adding them back in drove their
rates up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropout rates are believed to be widely underreported in the
majority of the state's heavily Hispanic urban districts, where in
most cases more than half the students who begin ninth grade do not
graduate. Nationwide, one in four Hispanics are high school
dropouts, double the rate of other groups.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the TEA glossed over the problem, a point
underscored by a 1996 state audit that showed weak agency oversight
had resulted in a dropout rate that was less than half the actual
rate. Also at issue was the way the TEA calculated the dropout
rates.
</P>
<P>
   In part to respond to that criticism, the TEA this year unveiled
its new data-quality ranking. But its reprimands of Ysleta and
Austin have triggered a backlash, with critics arguing that these
districts may have misled the state, but probably not any worse
than other major urban Texas districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was why only them?'' said Jay Greene, a
professor of government at the University of Texas and an education
expert. ``One would think the conduct in these districts can't be
that different from Houston, Dallas and San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   The TEA responds that Ysleta and Austin are the only two Texas
school districts with ``confirmed'' dropout data problems, thanks
in part to local media reports, and ``we are not picking on them or
singling them out,'' according to spokeswoman Debbie Graves
Ratcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   In Ysleta's case, the district brought the data problem to the
attention of the TEA, but not before the El Paso Times raised the
issue first. The state says Ysleta systematically misreported data,
either anticipating the accountability consequences or through
carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Ysleta's Soto portrays the situation as one of carelessness. But
the associate superintendent also argues that the state unfairly
penalized Ysleta because of pressure from the Legislature to
address the state's dropout situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TEA has to wrestle with its own credibility,'' said Soto.
``We don't have any problem with ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ysleta's gathering of dropout data raises some troubling
questions. In all, the district reported to the state 378 dropouts
out of a student population of nearly 50,000. But after a closer
look, the number was nearly three times that.
</P>
<P>
   Students who Ysleta reported had moved to another Texas district
had in fact dropped out. The same was true for students who were
reported to the state as having moved out of state or even to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After the El Paso newspaper reported such irregularities, Ysleta
ordered an audit and concluded that there was, in Soto's words, a
``documentation weakness.'' At that point the district ordered a
more comprehensive audit and advised state officials of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the high road,'' said Soto. ``That was the road
fraught with consequences, but it was the road of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dropout flap threatens to erode the reputation made
by the district, which under former Superintendent Anthony Trujillo
sought to graduate every student fully bilingual and prepared for a
four-year college.
</P>
<P>
   His challenge was daunting. Prior to Trujillo's hiring the TEA
had assigned a monitor to Ysleta. Many believed a state takeover of
the district was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Trujillo gave the district's principals considerable
freedom. He also gave them competition, instituting a modified
school-choice plan where students can enroll at any of the
district's campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, test scores were up and Ysleta was all the rage with
reformers, winning praise from Washington, D.C., to California,
where the Sacramento Bee lauded the school system for its
standards, accountability and benefits to the kids rather than
those who work for the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the pendulum swung too far in Trujillo's favor,'' said
UT's Greene. ``He probably made real, substantive gains, but he
also probably benefited from the appearance of gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Trujillo ultimately was forced out by an opposition
school board, his changes were lauded by education reformers around
the country. Ysleta, meanwhile, developed an attitude that heavily
minority urban districts can achieve _ despite the world of poverty
that so often works against them.
</P>
<P>
   Now that spirit is shaken. At Ysleta High School, where some of
the dropout misreporting apparently occurred, principal Ralph
Ornelas says the momentum that seemed to carry the school is
lagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``My community is not happy,'' Ornelas said. ``The teachers are
not happy. The students are not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornelas says the dropout data problems occurred when a satellite
school for at-risk students was folded into the high school. Though
the campus accommodated some of the students, others simply
disappeared, leaving administrators to try to establish their
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hurt for something we had no control over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the details of Ysleta travails may only obscure the larger
issue, which is that the state's Hispanic kids are dropping out at
alarming rates.
</P>
<P>
   Greene says Texas must address the dropout problem by
acknowledging it. That may mean coming up with a new way to
calculate the dropout rate, or giving the accountability
enforcement role to an organization other than the TEA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need above all is honesty,'' said Greene.
``Unfortunately I don't see any general trend for that.''

AT A LOSS FOR WORDS? GIVE THE PVI A CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(Charles Harrington Elster is the author of ``There's a Word for
It!'' and, most recently, ``The Big Book of Beastly
Mispronunciations.'' William Safire is on vacation.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When memory falters and friends cannot help, when the library
has been scoured to no avail, when all avenues of investigation
prove fruitless, they come to me. The lexically perplexed. The
literally lost. The wordstuck. They're a far cry from the
plain-language people discussed in this column last week.
</P>
<P>
   They come because I'm a word detective, a certified PVI (private
verbal investigator). I recover your lost locutions and patch the
holes in your vocabulary. ``Grandiloquent Gumshoe'' is my handle.
My motto is: ``Reliable. Thorough. Discreet.''
</P>
<P>
   For an SASE, I'll track down that missing piece in your verbal
picture of the world, wherever it may be lurking _ in the demimonde
of dialect and slang, in the cobwebbed corners of cyberspace, in
the benthic darkness of an unabridged dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The wordstuck wayfarers who find their way to my door complain
of headaches, insomnia and trichotillomania (a morbid compulsion to
tear out one's hair). A shrink might say they suffer from
denotative depression. All I know is they need a word and they
don't know who (er, in this space let's make that  &UR; whom &LR; ) to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you call that tweed cap that Sherlock Holmes wears,
the one with earflaps and visors in the front and back?''
Elementary, my dear Watson. It's a  &UR; deerstalker &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a word for a woman who keeps a man?'' Yes, she's a
 &UR; keeperess &LR; . Samuel Richardson used it in his novel ``Clarissa''
(1748). You'll find it in the OED.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that funny squiggle or flourish of the pen that people
used in the olden days when signing their names?'' It's a  &UR; paraph &LR; ,
and its original purpose (back in the Middle Ages) was to
discourage forgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a female ballet dancer is a ballerina, what's the
comparable male word?''  &UR; Entre nous &LR; , it's  &UR; danseur &LR; , and because
you asked, I'll also tell you that the twiddle he does with his
feet when he leaps is called an  &UR; entrechat &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a word for the act of crossing oneself. Do you
know it?'' An amateur word detective might try to get away with
 &UR; genuflection &LR; , but the pro knows that means a bending (Latin
 &UR; flectere &LR; , to bend) of the knee (Latin  &UR; genu &LR; , knee) in prayer or
obeisance. The act of crossing oneself, which so often accompanies
genuflection, is called  &UR; signation &LR;  (sig-NAY-shun).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have as yet been unable to unearth,'' wrote a wordstuck
translator from Denmark, ``a word pertaining to the time (if any
such existed) before the creation of Earth, that is, before the big
bang.'' Could I help him avoid ``a dissatisfyingly verbose
paraphrase''?
</P>
<P>
   Could I ever. A dig through the dictionaries unearthed a
translator's mother lode, something for every pre-big-bang
occasion:  &UR; precosmic &LR; , ``before the existence of the universe'';
 &UR; pretemporal &LR; , ``before time began'';  &UR; precreative &LR;  and
 &UR; prehexameral &LR; , ``before the Creation'';  &UR; preplanetary &LR; ;
 &UR; preterrestrial &LR; , and (my favorite)  &UR; antemundane &LR; , ``existing or
occurring before the creation of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Many clients want words about words. ``I need the word that
means `a precise word for a precise situation.''' For that,  &UR; mon
ami &LR; , we must go to France and find my old friend  &UR; le mot juste &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the term for the delayed riposte, the apt remark one
thinks of too late to rejoin the conversation?'' To France we go
again for  &UR; esprit de l'escalier &LR; , the ``spirit of the staircase.''
(Neologists have also proposed  &UR; stairwit &LR;  and  &UR; retrotort &LR;  for this
phenomenon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a word for words that repeat themselves, like  &UR; mama &LR; ,
 &UR; papa &LR; ,  &UR; bye-bye &LR; ?'' They're called  &UR; reduplications &LR;  or
 &UR; reduplicated words &LR; . The term also applies to repetitive couplings
in which the initial consonant or a vowel in the second element is
changed: e.g.  &UR; hoity-toity &LR; ,  &UR; namby-pamby &LR; ,  &UR; ding-dong &LR; ,
 &UR; dilly-dally &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   You can't win 'em all, and I have my share of unsolved word
mysteries. Although I recently found the counterpart to  &UR; avuncular &LR; 
_ the prosaic  &UR; auntly &LR;  (two citations in the OED) _ I'm still
looking for an appropriate companion for  &UR; phallic &LR; . And I doubt
I'll ever discover a word that means ``writing from right to left
with the left hand and left to right with the right hand at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   When clients ask me for a locution I suspect is nullibiquitous
(not in existence anywhere), I hate to let them down, so I make
something up. One wordless fellow implored me to end his
``decades-old nightmare'' by finding a word meaning ``the fear of
review, of revisiting a subject.'' I've tracked down some 600
phobia words, but not that one.
</P>
<P>
   I gave him the name of a doctor and two nonce words:
 &UR; byrotephobia &LR; , fear of rote learning or memorization, and
 &UR; vapulequimortiphobia &LR;  (from Latin  &UR; vapulare &LR; , to be beaten,
 &UR; equus &LR; , horse, and  &UR; mortuus &LR; , dead), the fear of listening to
someone beat a dead horse.
</P>
<P>
   Another nebulous query came from a woman filled with
polysyllabic expectation. She was looking for a word that meant ``a
vagueness of celestial bodies ... something that makes you feel
vague when looking at the moon, stars, the totality of space.'' The
answer came to me as if from above:  &UR; cosmononplusation &LR; , ``the
vague, speechless awe one experiences upon gazing up into the
cosmos and contemplating the pathetic minuteness of one's being.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do I do this crazy job? I do it because _ and I'm not making
this up _ there's a poseur out there who calls himself ``Mr.
Language Person'' and he must be stopped. I do it because it gives
me a glisk to think that I probably know a few more words than
William F. Buckley Jr., who probably doesn't know the meaning of
 &UR; glisk &LR; . (It's a slight touch of pleasure or twinge of pain that
penetrates the soul and passes quickly away.)
</P>
<P>
   If you ever need my services, don't bother looking in the Yellow
Pages or the classified ads. Check your local bookstore. I'll be
hanging out on the reference shelf, belting down a few bons mots
and swapping word stories with the other language mavens.

</P>
<P>
   BRET-TRAGEDY (Houston) _ A South Texas man who was afraid his
mobile home would not survive Hurricane Bret's force drove his
family to Houston. Late Sunday night, he was struck and killed as
he tried to cross a Houston freeway on foot to get food for his
family. Now, his widow and six children remain in Houston, with no
clear idea of what to do next. By S.K. BARDWELL.
</P>
<P>
   INS-DEPORT (Houston) _ It was supposed to be Graciela Meza's
dream trip to the United States, a chance to visit her sister in
Houston before returning to her native Mexico to begin college.
Instead, the bewildered 18-year-old was interrogated for hours at
Bush Intercontinental Airport, put in a jail cell overnight, and
deported back to Mexico the morning after her arrival on the second
leg of a trip earlier this summer. Meza's deportation came under
the terms of a controversial 1996 immigration law giving INS
inspectors unprecedented powers to deport foreigners from airports
and border checkpoints without a hearing. By ED HEGSTROM. (Photos

<P>
   PLACEBO-SURGERY (Houston) _ Four out of five patients at the
Veterans Affairs hospital thought that arthroscopic surgery for
their painful knees was so worthwhile, they said they would
recommend it to their friends. The twist is, none of them actually
had the surgery _ they underwent placebo, or sham surgery. After
being sedated, they woke up with three little incisions on their
knee, but unknown to them, no instruments had been inserted.
Houston doctors are conducting a groundbreaking study to find out,
literally, whether this type of surgery works as well as people

   YSLETA-TEXAS (Undated) _ Once held up as a shining example of a
poor border school district that has worked wonders, the Ysleta
district's reputation was tarnished with a recent district rating
of ``unacceptable.'' The district in El Paso misled state education
officials with its dropout statistics. Dropout rates are believed

he is hypocritical, evasive and arrogant. By MARIANNE MEANS.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ Although nagging questions
about funerals and illegal drugs _ a not-unheard-of combination _
haven't buried Gov. George W. Bush's presidential aspirations, they
certainly have ripped some of the magic from his high-flying
campaign. The outspoken advocate of ``personal responsibility'' is

   SLEEPING-DISORDER (Undated) _ University of Kentucky diver Tracy
Bonner just thought she was tired because she slept a lot. As an

intense practices and nail-biting competitions. But she wasn't just
tired. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with narcolepsy, a

PERSONAL HEALTH: BAD NEWS, WELL DELIVERED _ A PRESCRIPTION FOR
DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breathing difficulties prompted Frank to return to the hospital
days before he was to receive his next chemotherapy treatment for
lung cancer. When Frank asked if he'd be getting his treatment as
scheduled, a doctor neither he nor his family had ever seen before
replied bluntly: ``We can't give you another treatment. It would
kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   To Frank, who knew his life depended on the drugs, those 10
words were a death sentence, delivered in the cruelest possible
fashion. Frank's shaken family members were left on their own to
try in vain to rekindle some slim hope for his survival.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that the doctor meant to be cruel. It is that few
doctors are trained to deliver bad news, and many _ in haste,
anxiety, guilt or sheer ignorance of the impact of their words _
say things to patients and families that cause needless emotional
pain and may even compromise the effectiveness of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians often adopt coping strategies to minimize their own
discomfort with delivering bad news but fail to realize what is
needed to minimize the trauma to patients. If bad news is delivered
badly, it can permanently damage the doctor-patient relationship,
leading to a loss of confidence in the doctor's recommendations and
treatment plan.
</P>
<P>
   People vary greatly in their ability to cope with bad news,
whether it involves a diagnosis of a chronic illness, a potentially
fatal disease, the realization that the best available treatment
isn't working or the unexpected death of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, receiving bad news always causes some level of
distress. But researchers say that how the news is delivered
influences how well that stress is handled and whether it fosters
or impedes a person's ability to cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The harm done can be long lasting, even permanent. In a review
of the medical literature on conveying bad news, published in 1996
in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. J.T. Ptacek
and Tara L. Eberhardt, psychologists at Bucknell University,
stated: ``Our conversations with cancer survivors suggest that,
even after a relatively lengthy period of time, they are able to
recall what made getting the news more or less difficult. Some of
these cancer survivors expressed persistent negative feelings about
the process. We have also noted some family members continued to
harbor intense negative feelings about how the news was conveyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been few scientifically designed studies of
the best ways best to convey bad news to patients and families,
many expert opinions have been rendered based on the experiences of
both medical personnel and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Serious matters about your health should be discussed face to
face in a quiet, comfortable, private place, not in the hall, on
the phone or in the middle of grand rounds with half a dozen
strangers listening.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, a caring relative or friend should be present to
provide emotional support and assist in gathering critical
information. Too often, after the initial statement of bad news,
patients fail to hear most of what else the doctor says and may end
up feeling unduly hopeless when in fact the doctor has suggested
treatments that are likely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer in the journal Behavioral Medicine, Dr. Afaf Girgis
and Dr. Rob W. Sanson-Fisher, cancer education researchers in
Newcastle, Australia, outlined principles for breaking bad news.
Only one person, ideally the primary care physician or senior
consultant caring for the patient, should do the job, they insist.
The task should not be delegated to a nurse or medical resident.
</P>
<P>
   When imparting bad news, the physician should allow an
open-ended amount of time free of interruptions, sit close to the
patient at eye level, look directly at the patient and, if
appropriate, touch the patient. Ptacek and Ms. Eberhardt noted that
``to hold hands or give a hug can have a strong, positive and
lasting effect if done at the right time and with the right
patient.'' Girgis and Sanson-Fisher stated that touch could be used
``to convey warmth, sympathy, encouragement or reassurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Euphemisms like ``growth,'' ``tumor'' or ``cyst'' should be
avoided when in fact the patient has cancer. Euphemisms lead to
misunderstandings and may cause the patient to wonder why such
drastic therapy is needed. However, technical jargon also must be
avoided. Patients and their families should ask for explanations
when they hear something they don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   And, they should be given as much information as needed to
understand the condition, its treatment and the likelihood that
treatment will cure the illness or control its symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In one study of cancer patients, the vast majority said they
wanted all available information, whether good or bad, about their
condition. The diagnosis and prognosis (but without a definite time
frame) should be given honestly but not bluntly. A sensitive
physician, particularly one who has had a prior relationship with
you, will be able to sense just how much information and detail you
can handle at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment options and the reasons for more tests should be
clearly described along with their likely or possible side effects
so that people can make an intelligent choice.
</P>
<P>
   The physician should periodically assess the patient's
understanding of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're involved, ask whether the discussion can be
tape-recorded so that you, your relatives and friends can listen to
it again and again, if needed, to gain a more complete
understanding of what is happening. The doctor should also arrange
to call again the next day or at least provide a phone number and
time to call if questions arise later, as they inevitably do.
</P>
<P>
   There should be ample opportunity to vent feelings and to ask
questions. The doctor should encourage patients and families to
express feelings freely. ``Immediate reactions to bad news may
include crying, stunned silence, disbelief, anger or acute
distress,'' Girgis and Sanson-Fisher wrote. Doctors should let
patients know that ``it is quite normal to feel this way.'' And
those who think it will be difficult to tell relatives or
colleagues about the condition should ask the doctor to assist.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and relatives also should be told about available
support services, including support groups for patients and spouses
coping with the same disease. If the patient is terminally ill or
dies, information about hospice care or bereavement counseling
should be provided.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how grave the situation, a patient should never be
told that ``nothing more can be done.'' There is always something
the doctor can offer. If there is no treatment that can curb the
disease, there is at least treatment to make the patient as
comfortable as possible. But the doctor should never suggest that
palliative treatment might cure the disease and should make sure
the patient understands that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope should always be conveyed,'' Ptacek and Ms. Eberhardt
wrote. ``The goal of maintaining hope does not mean that physicians
should be less than truthful. In the case of imminent death, hope
may entail information about the physician's ability to control
symptoms and minimize discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   When patients cannot be cured, feelings of guilt and
helplessness may prompt the doctor to abandon the patient. An
understanding word from the patient's family may help the doctor
overcome these feelings and remain a source of comfort and hope. In
dealing with bad news, doctors need all the help they can get.

GIRLS' PRIDE REMAINS INTACT DESPITE IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Flip through any magazine for teen-age girls and the
message is hard to miss: beauty equals long, shapely legs,
perfectly coiffed hair and, above all, the half-starved look of
someone who subsists solely on arugula and bean sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that, at least in a laboratory setting,
exposure to such ultra-thin images encourages excessive dieting and
a negative body image in young girls. But few psychologists have
tested this theory outside the laboratory, or investigated whether
the effects of media exposure last over time.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study, presented Monday at the American Psychological
Association meeting, suggests that in the real world, most children
absorb the images purveyed by advertisers and fashion editors with
no ill effects. But for a subset of girls _ those who already are
dissatisfied with their bodies, who have little support from family
and friends, or who feel pressure from peers or parents to be thin
_ exposure to the media ideal does take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Stice, an assistant professor of psychology at the
University of Texas at Austin, and his colleagues, Dr. Diane
Spangler of Brigham Young University and Dr. W. Stewart Agras of
Stanford University, studied 219 girls between the ages of 13 and
17 over a 20-month period. Half of the subjects received a 15-month
subscription to Seventeen, the magazine with the largest readership
among adolescent girls, and they agreed to read it for at least 30
minutes each month. The other half did not receive the
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the study period, the researchers found, most of
the girls were unaffected by the magazine's images of ultra-thin
models. Only girls who were already vulnerable showed more dieting,
body dissatisfaction, anxiety and bulimic symptoms like binging and
purging.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Stice said, indicate that ``providing a supportive,
nurturing environment for developing youth seems to buffer them
against a whole variety of mental and physical health problems,
including eating disorders.''

2 U.S. WOMEN TO ENTER DOUBLE IRONMAN

<P>
   The Ironman triathlon consists of 2.4 miles of swimming, 112
miles of cycling and 26.2 miles of running. That might seem to be
about the upper limit of human endurance, but not for Patricia
Buttenheim and Ann Snoeyenbos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buttenheim, a 38-year-old registered nurse from Brooklyn,
and Ms. Snoeyenbos (pronounced snow-yen-BOSS), a 35-year-old
reference librarian from Manhattan, are training to become the
first American women in five years to complete a Double Ironman.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Double Ironman. That's 4.8 miles of swimming, 224 miles of
biking and 52.4 miles of running. And as Ms. Buttenheim is quick to
point out, those events are consecutive. (The women's record, set
by Tina Bishoff in 1994, is 22 hours, 7 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the two women, who are friends, will be among the
two dozen or so entrants in the 12th annual Odyssey Double-Iron
Triathlon in Colonial Beach, Va., organized by Odyssey Adventure
Racing of Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buttenheim and Ms. Snoeyenbos are members of the New York
University Triathlon Club in Manhattan. They began training for the
competition about six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Each weekday they awaken at 4 a.m. to cycle 40-plus miles around
Central Park, then do an hour and a half of yoga and strength
training before heading off to work; in the evenings, they run or
swim for one to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends they travel all over the country to participate
in a 50-mile races, 100-mile bike rides, or four-mile swim
contests. Ms. Buttenheim said, ``We just completed a single Ironman
as our last long training day before the big race.''
</P>
<P>
   While it might seem a foregone conclusion that the women are
pounding their bodies to a pulp with this grueling training
schedule, neither has had any serious physical setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   To Benjamin Gelfand, a physical therapist, who is the author of
``A Return to Glory Days'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997), a primer on
prevention of athletic injuries, this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultra athletes learn to adapt their form and body mechanics so
that they become very efficient,'' he said. ``This economy of
movement probably protects their joints and muscles from excessive
overuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Because long-distance athletes move at relatively low speeds and
intensities, he added, their injuries may be slower to develop and
thus easier to head off.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Buttenheim acknowledges that with all the running, it
is hard to keep her feet from turning to hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   She spends about $11 a day on foot-care products like moleskin,
blister pads and Epsom salts. Chafing and chapping around the
thighs and along the bra line are sometimes a problem as well, Ms.
Snoeyenbos says.
</P>
<P>
   Both women say that a big reason for undertaking this endeavor
is to prove that ordinary people are capable of performing
extraordinary feats.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both are average athletes with the stats to prove it.
Last year they underwent extensive physiological testing as part of
a study at Teachers College, Columbia University, on the
nutritional needs of female endurance athletes. Their scores for
parameters like body fat percentage, lung power and cardiovascular
capacity were unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, and even though only 33 percent of Double Ironman
competitors make it across the finish line, both Ms. Buttenheim and
Ms. Snoeyenbos say they are confident they can go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps that we've trained safely and sanely and that we have
total support from friends and family,'' says Ms. Snoeyenbos.
Still, neither expects to finish in less than 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The goal in the Double Ironman is to keep moving for the entire
30-plus hours, if at all possible. And some people do stop to
sleep. But for those who are serious competitors, stopping is not
an option.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Buttenheim and Ms. Snoeyenbos were ``handlers''
for a participant in the race. All participants have a handler or
team of handlers to supply water and food and to keep them from
wandering off the course should they become disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buttenheim and Ms. Snoeyenbos say this race is just the
beginning of their ultradistance careers. They have their eyes on
the Eco Challenge, a multiday ``adventure'' race held in a
different place each year.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Fifteenfold Triathlon, a race 15 times the
distance of a single Ironman. The women's record, which stands at
403:01:54, has gone unchallenged since 1992.

   Hard-Headed Birds
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why don't woodpeckers damage their brains?
</P>
<P>
   A. For at least one species of woodpecker, the naturalist Dr.
E.O. Wilson provided a classic answer in his book ``The Diversity
of Life'' (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   The acorn woodpecker of California, Wilson explained, keeps its
wits despite hitting the wood with its bill at speeds of 12 to 15
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The woodpecker survives, he said, because its brain is held
firmly in a case, which acts as a shock absorber, and because its
body moves in a single plane like a metronome, avoiding the
rotational forces that would twist and tear its brain loose from
its moorings.
</P>
<P>
   The human brain does not enjoy this protection.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is encased in a sac of fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when a cyclist hits the pavement, for example, the impact
can make the brain bounce around in its sack, hitting first one
side of the skull and then the other.
</P>
<P>
   That motion can tear nerve fibers and cause permanent damage.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a revealing interview in 1979, Jorge Luis Borges said that
``every writer leaves behind him two works: one, the written; the
other, the image that is left of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, in the long run, the man's image erases the work.
</P>
<P>
   For today's readers, it is hard to read Borges without thinking
of the image of the man: the wise and blind old scholar who had an
answer for all the world's questions and who wandered through the
maze of his favorite library shelves, even though the books were
closed to his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When I started to read Borges, in my adolescence, what really
impressed me were the stories he told, the boundless variations of
his characters' identities and the infinite recreations of his
repertoire of facts.
</P>
<P>
   I felt that, for the first time since the Golden Century, the
Castilian tongue had found, in Borges' austere texts, the greatness
which had been dissipated by the minor regional writers. I felt
that, through Borges, the Argentinean language had acquired a
solidity and an intensity capable of expressing all the Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Once, during a Greek class, the professor found me reading ``The
Death and the Compass,'' and he reprimanded me in front of
everybody: ``Why do you spend your time reading an Argentinean
writer instead of Thucydides?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens that this one is better,'' I replied, fully
convinced my words were true.
</P>
<P>
   For adolescents of the '50s, Borges was, besides, a little-known
writer, a cult writer. We believed that even one of his short
stories or poems _ ``The Poem of the Gifts,'' for example, or the
moving ``Limits'' _ were worth all of the literature yet created.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, a professor at Rutgers University, who had
read only one of Borges' short stories _ ``The Search of
Averroes,'' translated into English _ told me that those few pages
were enough to make him worthy of the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   To read Borges, I thought, and not have the pleasure of his
masterpieces colored in any way by knowledge of the man, is an
enviable achievement now all but impossible for us Argentineans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, soon after he received the Formentor Award, Borges was
asked to select those texts which, in his opinion, best represented
him. The resulting slim volume, of less than 200 pages, was
published that same year by Editorial Sur, ``Personal Anthology.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prologue, Borges says, with a certain emphasis: ``My
preferences have dictated this book. I want to be judged by it,
justified or reproved by it.'' The order he chose was not
chronological, but based _ as Borges defined it _ on
``congenialities and differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the obvious short stories are there: ``The Death
and the Compass,'' ``The South,'' ``Funes the Mindful,'' ``The
Aleph,'' ``The Search of Averroes,'' ``The Circular Ruins'' and
``The End,'' even though at least three, equally worthy, are
missing: ``Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,'' ``Tloen, Uqbar,
Orbis Tertius'' and ``The Garden of the Paths that Bifurcate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the poems, one wonders at the absence of ``Mythological
Foundation of Buenos Aires'' whose ``apocryphal local color''
Borges once said he ``couldn't remember without blushing.''
</P>
<P>
   A second personal anthology, entrusted by him to Emece press,
did cover those voluntary omissions.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Borges many times in the '60s _ sometimes accompanying him
a couple of blocks and helping him cross the street _ and over the
next 20 years or so, I added a few texts to his ``Personal
Anthology'' of 1961 _ stories I deemed invaluable: ``The
Intruder,'' ``The Gospel, According to Mark,'' ``The Book of
Sand,'' ``Juan Lopez and John Ward,'' and his seminars about
blindness and the Kabbala, which are included in the ``Seven
Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, for four months, the only book I had with me was his ``The
Book of Sand,'' and those seven short stories were my only teacher.
I think in those few pages, and in his personal anthologies of 1961
and 1968, it's possible to find everything Borges was and always
will be.
</P>
<P>
   The last two times I saw Borges before he died in 1986, he no
longer was Borges, but his glory. The first time was in Venezuela.
He arrived silently, modestly, at the Ateneo of Caracas, and when
the lights were on him, overwhelming him, the public crowned him
with a 10-minute ovation.
</P>
<P>
   A Venezuelan writer standing by my side touched me with his
elbow and said: ``Look hard. He is Homer, he is Dante, he is all of
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later I found him again at George Mason University,
in Virginia, where thousands of silent, devoted students heard him
speak. I heard him say then that he dictated prologues and poems
when he was flying on airplanes, and that the applause of men is an
undeserved form of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   On those two occasions I was worried by the fact, which I later
confirmed, that many of those who applauded Borges had never read
Borges. Some guessed he had written ``Ulysses'' and had learned his
elegant English at Trinity College, in Dublin. Others, closer to
the mark, thought he was Cervantes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best homage to Borges in this centenary of his birth
is to forget the articles he wrote for newspaper deadlines and the
books he wrote in his youth _ which he later excluded from his
complete works _ and to read again the texts he asked to be
remembered by.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the works of every writer only a few pages remain: some
images, an indispensable stanza, an argument that is often repeated
by others who don't know they didn't create it. Borges exists
forever in his own immortal lines and not in the all-too-mortal
character which has been built by the years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a revealing interview in 1979, Jorge Luis Borges said that
``every writer leaves behind him two works: one, the written; the
other, the image that is left of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, in the long run, the man's image erases the work.
</P>
<P>
   For today's readers, it is hard to read Borges without thinking
of the image of the man: the wise and blind old scholar who had an
answer for all the world's questions and who wandered through the
maze of his favorite library shelves, even though the books were
closed to his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When I started to read Borges, in my adolescence, what really
impressed me were the stories he told, the boundless variations of
his characters' identities and the infinite recreations of his
repertoire of facts.
</P>
<P>
   I felt that, for the first time since the Golden Century, the
Castilian tongue had found, in Borges' austere texts, the greatness
which had been dissipated by the minor regional writers. I felt
that, through Borges, the Argentinean language had acquired a
solidity and an intensity capable of expressing all the Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Once, during a Greek class, the professor found me reading ``The
Death and the Compass,'' and he reprimanded me in front of
everybody: ``Why do you spend your time reading an Argentinean
writer instead of Thucydides?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens that this one is better,'' I replied, fully
convinced my words were true.
</P>
<P>
   For adolescents of the '50s, Borges was, besides, a little-known
writer, a cult writer. We believed that even one of his short
stories or poems _ ``The Poem of the Gifts,'' for example, or the
moving ``Limits'' _ were worth all of the literature yet created.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, a professor at Rutgers University, who had
read only one of Borges' short stories _ ``The Search of
Averroes,'' translated into English _ told me that those few pages
were enough to make him worthy of the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   To read Borges, I thought, and not have the pleasure of his
masterpieces colored in any way by knowledge of the man, is an
enviable achievement now all but impossible for us Argentineans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, soon after he received the Formentor Award, Borges was
asked to select those texts which, in his opinion, best represented
him. The resulting slim volume, of less than 200 pages, was
published that same year by Editorial Sur, ``Personal Anthology.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prologue, Borges says, with a certain emphasis: ``My
preferences have dictated this book. I want to be judged by it,
justified or reproved by it.'' The order he chose was not
chronological, but based _ as Borges defined it _ on
``congenialities and differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the obvious short stories are there: ``The Death
and the Compass,'' ``The South,'' ``Funes the Mindful,'' ``The
Aleph,'' ``The Search of Averroes,'' ``The Circular Ruins'' and
``The End,'' even though at least three, equally worthy, are
missing: ``Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,'' ``Tloen, Uqbar,
Orbis Tertius'' and ``The Garden of the Paths that Bifurcate.''
</P>

Foundation of Buenos Aires'' whose ``apocryphal local color''
Borges once said he ``couldn't remember without blushing.''

 &HT;    A LITTLE WORK KEEPS RETIREMENT HAPPY, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Regardless of their age, income or health, retired
men who return to work in second careers tend to have high morale
and relatively little depression, psychologists reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true if the men's wives are in the home,
Cornell University's Jungmeen Kim and Phyllis Moen told the annual
convention of the American Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among retirees, the highest levels of depression and the lowest
morale are experienced by men who make retirement permanent, the
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men who are free from the demands of their career jobs but are
re-employed are happiest,'' probably because they are working part
time, they reported.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, recently retired women have more trouble
adjusting to depression if they remain at home and their husbands
aren't also at home, Kim and Moen said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall meaning of retirement has changed rapidly in the
past decade, and an even greater wave of changes is just ahead as
baby boomers start leaving the traditional work force, Moen said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start thinking of retirement as a couple
transition, rather than an individual change,'' she said. ``Now
couples are having to coordinate two retirements, and it matters
how they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' study was based on two surveys among a group of
late-middle-age men and women, many of whom were still working
during the initial survey.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied 534 married men and women between ages
50 and 74 in New York. They defined retirement as being eligible
for or receiving an employee pension or Social Security, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Information from a third survey of the same group is still being
analyzed, Moen said.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, retirement is more difficult for women these days,
Moen said. Many entered the job market late and have fewer
benefits, such as buyouts or early retirement privileges, and find
retirement less rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for many men retirement has come to mean
leaving one career for a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an engineer in our sample who retired from a large
Fortune 500 company,'' she said. ``Now he has a hot dog stand at
the ballpark. He is very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said they had wished they could have remained in their
career jobs, but with fewer hours and less stress, she said, but
the choice was not available.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the researchers found that a man's employment status
is more predictive of his self-perceived psychological well-being,
while a woman is more apt to be affected by the quality of a
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers start retiring, many in their mid-50s or even
early 50s, they will redefine retirement, she predicted. They will
be the youngest population of retirees in history, the best
educated, the healthiest and the most likely to be married to a
retiree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start thinking differently about the transitions
involved in retirement,'' she said.

ESTROGEN MAY CURB WOMEN'S MUSCLE PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Mont., Canada) (nk) 
 By NANCY STEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women, who draw on energy reserves of fat more efficiently than
men, frequently outperform men on ultraendurance events like the
85-kilometer marathon. Now, some researchers believe that women may
have another edge. Recent studies suggest that estrogen might make
them less prone to muscle soreness after exercise.
</P>
<P>
   For fitness enthusiasts, the dull pain and stiffness that sets
in perhaps 6 to 12 hours after exercise can be a badge of honor, a
symbol of a workout that pushed the limits. But for most people it
is a consequence they would rather avoid. The soreness generally
peaks 24 hours to 36 hours later, and causes a loss of strength and
mobility, said Dr. Priscilla Clarkson, a physiologist at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some soreness is good because it means that the muscle is
growing in response to unaccustomed exercise,'' Clarkson said.
``But if you are so sore that you cannot walk then you have
exercised too intensely.''
</P>
<P>
   The soreness is presumed to result from the body's reactions to
exercise-induced microtears in the muscle tissue, she said. The
consensus among exercise researchers is that damage most often
occurs when the muscle is extended, as in the downward phase of
biceps curls.
</P>
<P>
   Gender may play an important role in the susceptibility to
soreness. ``The animal data are very clear,'' Clarkson said. In
studies, male rats showed much more muscle damage after exercises
that emphasized muscle extensions than did female rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estrogen seems to explain the difference,'' said Dr. Mark
Tarnopolsky, a neuromuscular disease specialist at McMaster
University Medical Center in Hamilton, Ontario, and the author of
``Gender Differences in Metabolism'' (CRC Press). When researchers
gave male rats estrogen, they showed less damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research is still in the early stages, and it is not known why
estrogen might protect muscles. Clarkson hypothesizes that estrogen
``may be able to insert itself into cells, in this case muscle
membranes, and stabilize them, which would protect them from
tearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Human studies are not as consistent as those with animals. In a
study reported in the June issue of The Canadian Journal of Applied
Physiology, Clarkson found that, compared with women who produce
little or no estrogen, those on oral contraceptives, which contain
estrogen, experienced less soreness after exercise, suggesting that
estrogen does have a protective effect.
</P>
<P>
   And at an academic meeting of physiologists and biochemists in
April, Tarnopolsky reported on a study in which men had much higher
amounts of enzymes that indicated muscle stress two days after
exercising, although men and women showed similar muscle tearing
immediately after exercise. ``The damage was the same for men and
women, but the body's response seemed higher for men,'' Tarnopolsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, more recent data collected by Clarkson showed
no differences between men and women in the experience of soreness
after repeated muscle extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The sex difference in soreness, if it holds up, suggests that
women may be able to endure longer exercise sessions than men.
``Women may accumulate less damage over the course of a long event,
which would enable them to perform better,'' Tarnopolsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Soreness does have a positive side. It means that muscles have
been stimulated to grow stronger as well as more resilient. ``A
single bout of eccentric trauma prepares muscles for subsequent
bouts,'' said Dr. Brent Ruby, an exercise physiologist at the
University of Montana. This ``repeated bout effect'' can protect
muscles from further damage from similar exercise for up to six
months, Clarkson's research showed.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to avoid soreness is to go easy. ``Some soreness is
inevitable when you exercise, but if you go slowly and progress
gradually you won't get one bout that lays you up for a week,''
Ruby said.

squeeze in playing a few more new computer games. You can find some
likely choices in the August issue of PC Gamer. The issue features
a list of a host of new reviews. And there's a look at the 10 best
games scheduled for release next year. The new games include
Freelancer, Throne of Darkness, Alone in the Dark 4 and Planet of
the Apes. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

   TECH-REPORT _ Tech briefs on new products and developments. This
week: Years ago, when science fiction novels _ not video games _
were an obsession with most boys and some girls, the robot was
king. The robots of science fiction were wonderful (and sometimes
awful) creatures that could think for themselves and that seemed
like mechanical versions of a real person. For a time, it seemed
almost certain that _ as technology moved to the stage where such
things were possible _ robot housekeepers and waiters would be
common by the end of the century. (Husted, Atlanta

   &UR; LONGEVITY: Aging Advice: Stay Busy to Stay Healthy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is well established that exercise helps elderly people live
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, new evidence suggests that nonstrenuous activities
_ playing cards, gardening, cooking, going to the movies, attending
church or visiting friends _ may be just as helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, just published in The British Medical Journal,
were based on a study of 2,761 men and women age 65 and over in the
New Haven area from 1982 through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers measured survival rates for people who engaged in
three types of activity: physical, social and ``productive''
(cooking, shopping, gardening, volunteering).
</P>
<P>
   After taking age, sex, race, income, body type and medical
history into account, the researchers found that all three kinds of
activity produced similar benefits in terms of longevity.
</P>
<P>
   While staying involved to stay alive may seem like common sense,
it has been less researched than physical activity, said Dr. Thomas
A. Glass, an assistant professor at Harvard's School of Public
Health, who led the study with three colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that a sense of purpose in life is demonstrably
related to the risk of death?'' Glass asked. The research, he said,
suggests that there are psychosocial benefits that directly affect
the brain in a life-prolonging way.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean it is safe to skip the outdoor walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would under no circumstances say that social activity or
social engagement is a replacement for exercise,'' Glass cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that in helping the elderly, society should rethink
what it means to be active. ``We've tended to ignore the fact that
activity is social in nature,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   _MICHAEL POLLAK
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSEQUENCES: Inner Peace, on the Bright Side of Trauma &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Surviving a plane crash is clearly better than the alternative.
But it may actually have positive long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   A study presented last week at the 107th annual convention of
the American Psychological Association in Boston suggests that
crash survivors may enjoy better mental health than those who have
never been in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, Gary Capobianco of Old Dominion University and
Dr. Thanos Patelis of the College Board in New York, selected 15
crash survivors _ 11 men and 4 women _ as the experimental group
and chose 8 frequent travelers who had never experienced a plane
crash as the control group.
</P>
<P>
   All were asked to fill out questionnaires about their
backgrounds and their levels of anxiety, depression and emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were surprised at how well the survivors seemed
to be doing, Dr. Patelis said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they were less likely to display rash behavior like
anger or aggression than the control group. And the survivors who
did not seek counseling after the crash exhibited even lower levels
of distress than those who did.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers were small and the findings were tentative,
Patelis said he hoped the study would lead to more research on the
long-term benefits of overcoming a traumatic event.
</P>
<P>
   _DENISE DE LAS NUECAS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERFORMANCE: A Matter of Keeping the Men Amused &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Humor has long been known to relieve stress and elevate the
mood. What's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   The benefits, however, may not be distributed equally between
the sexes, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Filipowicz, the researcher, who is also a doctoral student
at Harvard University, set out to investigate whether humor affects
the productivity of workers.
</P>
<P>
   It can, he suggested in a paper presented this month to the
Academy of Management in Chicago, but only if the worker is male.
</P>
<P>
   Filipowicz chose 50 test subjects, 25 men and 25 women.
</P>
<P>
   Half were shown a humorous 20-minute movie clip; half saw a clip
that was not funny.
</P>
<P>
   Then everyone had to complete two tasks, one individually and
the other with a partner of the opposite sex, building a structure
using materials like straws and sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The construction projects were judged on creativity, efficient
use of the materials and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sexes rated the movies as equally funny (or
unfunny), the men reacted to the humor on both the thinking and
feeling levels, while the women responded only on the thinking
level.
</P>
<P>
   The humor seemed to stimulate the men to better individual
performances than those of the women and the control group. And in
groups consisting of a man and a woman, the increased stimulus for
men was offset by the women's lack of stimulus.
</P>
<P>
   _DENISE DE LAS NUECES
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHILDBIRTH: Long-Lasting Scars of Unwanted Births &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An unwanted birth can have harmful emotional effects not only on
the mother and her child but on other children in the family as
well, researchers at the University of Michigan have found. And
their study says the damage can last well into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the September issue of the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, analyzed two sets of data.
</P>
<P>
   The first, a survey of more than 13,000 respondents in 1987-88,
showed that mothers whose births were all intended were less likely
than other mothers to spank or slap their children. And, they were
more likely to take their children on activities and other trips
outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data showed that mothers with intended births engaged in
fun stuff like going to the movies or the zoo with their children
3.7 times a week,'' said the lead researcher, Dr. Jennifer Barber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers with unintended births reported only doing activities
3.5 times a week. Over the lifetime of a child,'' she added,
``that's a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Using another set of data, on mother-child pairs from 1962 to
1993, the researchers found that adults who had been raised in
families where there was an unintended pregnancy were still having
lower-quality relationships with their mothers than children in
families where all pregnancies were wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our 20s and 30s we get a lot of help from our parents,''
Dr. Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children are missing out on this big piece of social
support we all need and expect. The mothers with unintended
pregnancies aren't helping them as much as other mothers _ with
child care or moves or just talking.''

 &HT;    ENGLAND'S CRICKET DREAM TEAM BECOMING A NIGHTMARE
 &HT;    Moving in both International and Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ First the empire, and now this.
</P>
<P>
   Cricket, the sport that symbolizes England, has come to denote a
special sort of misery for the English.
</P>
<P>
   On the grass at London's hallowed Oval stadium, England's
national cricket team on Sunday lost to New Zealand. It was bad
enough to lose to what had been regarded a weak sister team, but it
soon penetrated the nation's collective consciousness that England
now officially and for the first time has the distinction of
fielding the worst national cricket team on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The loss so stung the 10,000 usually stoic fans at the Oval that
they booed the team's captain and repeated often insulting and
sometimes obscene chants.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration has been building throughout the miserable summer
season during which England has recorded three wins in 14 matches.
</P>
<P>
   The lamentable story was on the front page of virtually every
newspaper here Monday. The Sun dedicated its front page to the
somber pronouncement: ``Official: The death of our national game.
English Cricket. 1744 _ 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   While few Americans pay much attention to cricket _ much less
understand it _ the image of players in dazzling white uniforms
whacking a small hard ball and then trotting around inexplicably,
is as English as Big Ben or bangers and mash. For the English to
find themselves so inept at their defining sport would be
comparable to Americans finding themselves unable to field a decent
baseball or basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days have long gone when beating England represented the
taking of a scalp,'' wrote the Daily Telegraph. ``Nowadays, it's
the equivalent of stealing a blind man's wig.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, cricket has been played here in one form or another for
hundreds of years. The English spread the sport across the British
Empire. That was their first mistake. The former commonwealth
players share a love of cricket with and an unbridled joy of
beating the English at their own game. The five best national teams
are Australia, West Indies, South Africa, Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   To end the cricket malaise, The Sun offered a modest proposal:
</P>
<P>
   ``Increase defense spending 1000 percent and re-occupy (the
colonies). Ban cricket everywhere and invent another ludicrous
bat-and-ball game which will take the colonies the best part of
another century to master.''

   RETIRED _ WASHINGTON _ Working when you don't have to seems to
be the best way to go. Retired men who return to work have lower
levels of depression than just about anybody, employed or
unemployed, according to a study by Cornell University
psychologists. This is especially true, the psychologists report
Monday, when the retired working man has a wife who remains at
home. On the other hand, the lowest morale and the highest
depression settle on those men who make retirement permanent.

forecasters had feared. The storm, the biggest hurricane to strike
Texas in nearly 20 years, continued to drench the region with

   NC-SCHOOLDESEG _ CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Public officials gather
Monday hoping to end divisivenss and present a unified public front
on the eve of a judge's ruling on whether the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
public schools qualify as integrated, allowing decades of busing to
end. Members of the school board have disagreed on what remedies
are still needed, even as the board defended itself in court this
summer against suits calling for busing to end, and for it to
continue. Nationally, a recent NAACP survey found about half of
young adults believe that separation of the races is acceptable as
long as there are equal opportunties for everyone _ an attitude
reflected in the Charlotte school debate. (Burritt, Atlanta

STUDY CALLS FOR LIMITS ON HEARING TESTS AT BIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mich.) (nk) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study, running counter to the nationwide move toward
routinely testing all newborns for hearing problems, argues for
testing only those infants known to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted in part by advocates for the disabled, who point to the
longstanding failure of doctors and parents to detect many cases of
hearing loss until a child is 2 or older, hospitals across the
country have begun routinely screening children shortly after
birth. Some 20 states have passed laws requiring the screening, and
Congress is considering taking action.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, in the current issue of The American Journal of
Otology, suggests, however, that the effort is neither economical
nor the best method to insure that infants with hearing problems
receive the appropriate care.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the authors said, hospitals should focus their
resources on newborns known to be at higher risk because of factors
like family history, low birth weight and herpes infection. They
also urged that primary care physicians and other people in contact
with children be better trained to detect the signs of deafness in
those not considered at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that the primary care physician has the key
to this problem,'' said Dr. Paul R. Kileny, a co-author of the
report, who is director of audiology for the University of Michigan
Health System.
</P>
<P>
   About one in 1,000 babies born in the United States each year is
deaf or has a serious hearing disorder, while perhaps four or five
others have a less serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Left undiagnosed for too long, the disorder can cause problems
with language development, education and even social skills. But
with early detection, doctors can provide hearing aids for infants
just weeks old, and cochlear implants for children over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   After studying more than 2,100 high-risk babies born at the
University of Michigan hospital in a 10-year period, researchers
found that 6.4 percent were suffering from at least some hearing
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors used an auditory brain stem response test, which
measures brain activity in infants exposed to sounds. When they
calculated the cost of testing all of the high-risk infants, they
found that each diagnosis cost about $3,000 _ far less than if
every newborn had been tested.
</P>
<P>
   Saving money, however, is not the only issue, said Kileny.
Because many cases of deafness have a delayed onset, he said,
routine screening of all newborns could give a false sense of
security for infants who pass the test but then develop problems
later.
</P>
<P>
   Kileny said he believed universal screening was a fine ideal,
but an impractical one. He and other experts said this was
nevertheless the trend in American medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the train is down the track for very good reasons,''
said Evelyn Cherow, director of audiology services for the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association, which has long advocated
universal screening.

   Planet-Eating Stars
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, a score of giant planets have been
discovered far beyond the solar system. Now, new research suggests
that at one time, other so-called extrasolar planets must have
existed as well. These planets, however, disappeared long ago,
becoming food for the stars they were orbiting around.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers from the Space Telescope Science Institute, studying
the late-stage stars known as red giants, have discovered that some
of them apparently gobbled up large planets whole.
</P>
<P>
   How can they tell? Well, like the cat that swallowed the canary,
while there may not be even a feather left behind, it is evident
what has gone on. A red giant that has been on a binge, the
astronomers note, emits more infrared light (as it heats up from
absorbing the planet's gravitational energy), spins faster (as it
digests all that excess angular momentum), and shows lithium in its
spectrum (getting a fresh supply of the element from the planet).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the large planets that have been discovered are in
orbits that are close enough to their stars that in another couple
of billion years or so, when the stars reach red-gianthood, the
planets will become just so much fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Reassessing Erosion
</P>
<P>
   Modern agriculture has often been viewed as a villain, blamed
for, among other things, the lack of flavor in fruits and
vegetables, the demise of the family farm and the alarming rate of
topsoil erosion in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But at least in the case of soil erosion, agriculture may not be
such a big bad wolf after all. A long-term study of a watershed in
Wisconsin farmland suggests that the erosion problem is not as dire
as has been generally believed. The rate of erosion in the study
area has been decreasing since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and is
now 6 percent of what it was then.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted by a scientist at the University of
California at Los Angeles, who in 1973 resumed a study begun 35
years before. The result is a long record of precise measurements
of sediment buildup and erosion in Coon Creek Basin in western
Wisconsin. A report on the work appears in the current issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In many previous studies of erosion, soil movement was examined
in one area and then calculated, through modeling, for an entire
watershed. The Coon Creek study is much more extensive. Among other
findings, it determined that the amount of soil leaving for good,
headed down the Mississippi River, has remained basically unchanged
for years.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that soil conservation efforts, which have
been greatly expanded over the last two decades with practices like
minimal tilling of cropland, have had the intended effect.
</P>
<P>
   Good News in the Air
</P>
<P>
   If indeed there is less soil erosion these days, then perhaps
society as a whole deserves some of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   A study by scientists from the Carnegie Institution of
Washington and other institutions has shown that elevated levels of
carbon dioxide in the air _ of the kind that accompanies
industrialization _ can change the structure of soil, making it
clumpier. And soil that sticks together better resists rain and
wind.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who discussed their work in a recent issue of
Nature, exposed soils from three types of ecosystems to different
levels of carbon dioxide over three to six years. In most of the
experiments, small aggregates of soil _ clumps about one-tenth of
an inch in diameter _ increased.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are not sure why the soil structure changes, but
suspect that it is the work of a fungus that has a symbiotic
relationship with plant roots.
</P>
<P>
   Plants exposed to more carbon dioxide usually produce more
carbohydrate, some of which is used by the fungi to produce a
sugar-protein compound called glomalin. Glomalin is thought to
function as a kind of lubricant to help the fungi's filament
structure extend through the soil. But it also may act almost like
a glue, holding soil particles together.  &QL;

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD: INSIDE MEDICAL JOURNALS, A RISING QUEST FOR
PROFITS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generation ago, leading medical journals measured their
profits in the tens of thousands of dollars. They were scholarly
publications meant to help doctors keep abreast of scientific
advances and share information on new remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The mission has not changed, but the journals have increasingly
become cash cows for the medical societies and companies that own
them, with annual profits in the tens of millions of dollars,
largely from drug company advertisements. And the imperative to
sustain and build those profits is changing how the journals do
business _ and how the public learns about medicine _ in ways their
founders could scarcely have envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came,'' said Dr. Floyd Bloom, the editor of Science,
which is owned by the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, ``they told me it was a not-for-profit operation. And then
they said in the same breath, `But it is also a not-for-loss
operation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leading journals like The New England Journal of Medicine, The
Journal of the American Medical Association and Nature have long
been criticized for withholding information about their articles
until publication. These embargoes, critics say, serve mainly to
protect the journals' position in the marketplace. The journals
respond that their efforts in evaluating and editing manuscripts
justify the delays.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism has been increasing, particularly after the recent
involuntary departures of the main editors of two weekly medical
journals whose contents often make headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Few would say that articles in leading journals are distorted or
unreliable, but the quest for profits raises several disturbing
issues: the journals' increasing appetite for publicity; how a
burst of publicity from an article can inflate the importance of a
new finding; the drug industry's influence on journals through
advertising revenues; and the reluctance of journals to account
publicly for their profits and how they are spent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, the top editor of The New
England Journal of Medicine, resigned under pressure in a dispute
with its owner, the Massachusetts Medical Society. In January, the
American Medical Association dismissed the top editor of its
journal, Dr. George Lundberg, for publishing a survey during the
Clinton impeachment hearings on attitudes about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Personality clashes played a role, but the common thread in the
departures was unrelated to the journals' scientific mission.
Kassirer was forced to leave in a dispute over the marketing of the
journal's name as part of the society's growing publishing empire.
Although Lundberg's dismissal was ostensibly over speeding up
publication of old research to fit a political context, it also
reflected the need to satisfy the demands of a publishing empire
with $54.7 million of advertising a year.
</P>
<P>
   Money is also changing the meaning of editorial freedom. To
journal editors, the phrase has meant the freedom to publish a
paper even if it counters an owner's beliefs. But ``that idea is
probably too restrictive in today's world, where journals have
become such incredible money-making enterprises,'' said Dr. Suzanne
W. Fletcher, who until she resigned in 1994 was a co-editor of The
Annals of Internal Medicine, owned by the American College of
Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journals' success has created an enormous new market force
that is beginning to dominate the way medical societies are run,''
Fletcher said. In some not-for-profit societies, the business staff
is gaining influence over editors, creating frictions between the
two traditionally separate sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``These societies were kind of frumpy and esoteric, and they are
no longer that way,'' Fletcher said. ``They are big businesses, and
editors who traditionally worked with small staffs and had time to
read a lot now go to meetings about new ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, The Annals of Internal Medicine published a study
showing that advertisements in journals were often misleading about
the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. Drug companies stopped
advertising, costing the journal $1 million to $1.5 million,
Fletcher said. The lost revenue was a factor in her departure, said
Fletcher, now a professor at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific journals, numbering more than 25,000, cover
everything from esoterica to the common cold. Most make their money
selling subscriptions, copyrighting and publishing findings
received free from authors whose research is mainly financed by
taxpayers, and selling reprints. Journals carrying advertisements
often compete vigorously for papers, readers and circulation so
they can charge top rates.
</P>
<P>
   Most journals have small editorial staffs, many of them
volunteers, and send texts to scientists for unpaid criticism, a
process known as peer review.
</P>
<P>
   Many journals are owned by not-for-profit professional
societies, many others by commercial companies. For libraries, the
subscriptions are big budget items, with some exceeding $10,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Most journals refuse to disclose profits. The New England
Journal of Medicine did through 1979, when its earnings were less
than $400,000 a year. Now earnings are estimated to be at least $20
million a year, with the AMA journal not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the journals' financial statements are released, they
are hard to compare because different accounting methods are used
in preparing them, and many not-for-profit professional societies
use varying amounts of journal profits to cover the owners'
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy to find out how profitable one's rivals are,''
said Sir John Maddox, who retired in 1995 as editor of Nature. The
profits of Nature, a for-profit journal published in London and
owned by von Holtzbrinck Group of Germany, are not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Nature's ``profits enabled us to do things we had not previously
done,'' like expanding internationally and opening offices in
several countries, Maddox said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association, the American Heart Association
and the British Medical Association have long published specialty
journals in addition to their main journals. Seeing their success,
other publishers have made or considered similar expansions.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1992, for example, Nature created profitable
specialty journals like Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine, like many other leading
journals, rejects far more papers than it accepts. Since the vast
majority of papers are later published elsewhere, the officials of
the Massachusetts Medical Society saw an opportunity to expand
their publishing empire. The idea was to steer rejected papers to
spin-off specialty publications to be created by The New England
Journal _ a proposal that Kassirer and other editors opposed.
</P>
<P>
   At Science, Bloom said he had opposed a similar expansion of
specialty journals because of lack of funds to hire more editors
and concern that such a move would erode the journal's prestige.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Journals have soared in number in recent years as the government
has paid for more scientific research and patient care and as
publications are required for academic promotions and new grants.
Some experts contend that the number of publications could be cut
by two-thirds, in part because much second-rate research is being
done and findings are split into multiple papers.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest to protect their market position or just to
survive, many journals rely on embargoes, press releases and page
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Embargoes owe much to a rule created in 1969 by the editor of
The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Franz Ingelfinger, out of
what he freely acknowledged was a ``selfish'' concern for
protecting the copyright. Now known as the Ingelfinger rule, and
widely adopted by other journals, it says a journal will not
publish a manuscript if its findings have appeared elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, this means that scientists are restricted in what
they can say even before submitting a manuscript. And though some
may say embargoes put all the news media on an even footing in
reporting on such advances, many editors say the motivation is not
so noble. Maddox said he imposed embargoes at Nature
``shamelessly'' because ``it is entirely proper that if we are
publishing a paper we should get a share of what publicity there is
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for having an embargo is to be able to blow one's
own trumpet a bit,'' he added. ``It is silly to say there is some
high motive of protecting authors' privacy and all that. It is just
the thing journals do so as to protect their own images.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many journals lift embargoes if it is in their interest _ for
example, when a paper on the same subject is about to appear in a
rival journal.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of journals have recently begun issuing
news releases to attract wider coverage of the contents of each
issue. The Journal of the American Medical Association also holds
news conferences to promote papers and issues video news releases.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A standard practice is for many of the more specialized and
lesser-known journals to charge authors for each published page _ a
form of vanity press. Usually, those charges are financed by the
taxpayers, in the form of federal grants to the authors. Federal
health officials say they do not know the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   Editors have expanded the scope of their journals to include
articles about political affairs, some of which oppose society
positions. And as professional societies have become more involved
in the politics of health care, many have engaged in lobbying, thus
increasing their need for more money for such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to the journals' integrity and scientific credibility
has led many experts to urge greater public scrutiny of the
finances of journals and their publishers, particularly if
taxpayers are indirectly contributing to the owners' lobbying
efforts for the welfare of their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be accountable to the public for how they use the
profits,'' said Dr. Michael M.E. Johns, executive vice president
for health affairs at Emory University School of Medicine in
Atlanta, who is a member of a committee searching for Lundberg's
successor at The Journal of the American Medical Association. ``In
a not-for-profit medical society, you would think that most of the
dollars would go to education'' and charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fine for them to make a profit,'' he said. ``But why is
it kept a secret?''

THREE BRIGHT STRETCHES IN NEPTUNE'S RING DEFY A THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Calif.)   (The Science Times)  
(DW) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 15 years, planetary scientists have known that there is
something odd about Neptune. Like the other large, gaseous planets
in the solar system, it has rings. But unlike the others, it also
has arcs, bright clumps of debris along one of the rings. New
observations show that the arcs are still hanging around, when by
some rights they should be long gone.
</P>
<P>
   But if the arcs are alive and well, theorists are sick over it.
For the same observations that showed that the arcs exist also
showed that they are not exactly where they are supposed to be.
That has forced theorists to discard the accepted explanation of
why the arcs are still around in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The ring arcs were detected indirectly in 1984 and first
photographed by the Voyager 2 fly-by mission in 1989. They exist
along a faint structure known as the Adams ring, with the three
main arcs _ called Liberte, Egalite and Fraternite _ spread over
about one-ninth of the ring. It is like a circular toy train track
in which several sections of track are heavier and much brighter
than the others.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the effects of gravity would make the material in
the arcs collide and drift apart, spreading it out until it became
part of a uniform, continuous ring. Arcs that have appeared around
Saturn have done just that, in fact, becoming indistinguishable in
a few months.
</P>
<P>
   But Neptune's arcs persisted between 1984 and 1989, and the new
observations, made last year by teams using the Hubble Space
Telescope and a ground-based telescope in Hawaii, show not much has
changed since Voyager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very stable,'' said Bruno Sicardy, of the University
of Paris-VI and the Paris Observatory, leader of the Hawaii team.
</P>
<P>
   One theory had been largely accepted to explain the arcs'
persistence. It involves resonances, the gravitational interactions
between objects that can create areas of stability. In this case,
the theory held that the resonance between the arcs and a nearby
small moon, Galatea, created 86 stable segments along the ring (and
of the 86, only a few had the extra material in them _ perhaps from
collisions between larger debris _ that caused them to show up as
arcs).
</P>
<P>
   But the new observations, which are reported in the current
issue of Nature, create problems for the theory. Because the
astronomers have determined more precisely the location and
movement of the arcs and Galatea, they have determined exactly
where the area of stability should be. The arcs are outside of this
area, by about 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Although this might not seem like much, there is no fudge
factor; 200 feet might just as well be 200 light years. The arcs,
Sicardy said ``are very close to the resonance but not in the
resonance.'' Close, but no cigar.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, said Christophe Dumas, a scientist with the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and leader of the Hubble
team, there were some difficulties with the theory. For one thing,
some of the arcs are longer than they should be. ``When you looked
into the details, some of them didn't match,'' Dumas said. ``Now it
looks like they didn't match because this wasn't the right
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the two researchers said, some variation on another
theory might be at work. That theory held that the stable zones
could be created by the action of two moons, Galatea and another
moon in the arcs' orbit. Since this second moon was unseen, the
theory was less popular than the first.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rejection of the Galatea-only theory, an unseen
moon might afford an explanation. Or moons, plural: Sicardy and
Dumas said that two or more additional satellites might be acting
as shepherds for the arcs, creating a complex web of resonances.
</P>
<P>
   These moons _ perhaps just clumps of ice less than 10 miles in
diameter _ would be too small to be seen with current observing
techniques. One plan is to go back to the Voyager records from 1989
and, using analytical tools developed in the past decade, peruse
the data for signs of other moons. Other than that, researchers may
have to wait for the next generation of telescopes, or for another
spacecraft to approach Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Dumas said, ``the theorists can work on the subject
and try to find another explanation.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy thunderstorms will drench portions of the eastern
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians on Tuesday as humid air
pushes northward from the Gulf of Mexico. A large disturbance will
develop over the Middle West and this will induce low pressure to
form in Indiana. Showers will spread across the Ohio Valley into
the Appalachians. Cool, moist winds from the northeast will cause
clouds and light rain to linger over the central Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure east of New England will keep dry and warm weather
in much of the Northeast. Clouds will increase from the west and
onshore breezes will refresh the coast. Showers will progress into
the Carolinas and Virginia as a warm front moves slowly north along
the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air over the South will be marked by a few patches of
thunder-storms, mainly inland. The remnants of Hurricane Bret, now
a tropical depression, will creep westward into northern Mexico's
Coahuila state, but torrential rain will still fall in the lower
Rio Grande Valley. Flooding will persist south of the Big Bend.
Less humid, but rather warm air will occupy the northern and
central Plains as high pressure builds south from Manitoba. It will
stay hot over the Rockies with moisture circulating through the
central and northern mountains. Afternoon storms will be most
common from western Montana to eastern Nevada, but a few storms
will form around the Four Corners region.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will return to the Northwest Coast as winds become
lighter. Sunshine should burn off patches of fog in California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Unseen Fury
</P>
<P>
   Although Hurricane Bret was a powerful tropical cyclone when it
made landfall, few people saw the essence of its fury. The
hurricane crossed into the least populated coastal county in the
United States. While the circulation of a strong hurricane
typically covers tens of thousands of square miles, its most
devastating effects are concentrated within 50 miles of the center
of the storm. Sustained hurricane force winds are usually found in
that narrow corridor along the storms path. It is also within that
small zone that the wall of water called the storm surge can crush
coastal structures.

NEW SPECIES OF STRIPED RABBIT FOUND IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Indonesia, Laos, Vietnam)   (The Science Times)  
(DW) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam, where more new
species of mammals have been found this century than anywhere else
on the planet, have revealed another new animal, this time a
striped rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbit, discovered by a researcher with the Wildlife
Conservation Society in 1998 and announced in the journal Nature,
has been shown through DNA analysis to be a distant cousin of the
only other known striped rabbit species, found 900 miles to the
south on Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
   The new rabbit, which began to diverge from the Sumatran species
millions of years ago, when Sumatra was joined to mainland Asia,
has yet to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Robert J. Timmins, first saw specimens of the
animal for sale in a food market in Ban Lak, Laos, in the foothills
of the Annamites. Teams from the society would often come down from
the mountains to replenish supplies in the market, according to
Alan Rabinowitz, the society's director of science for Asia, who
has led surveys in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already made discoveries or rediscoveries of four new
species,'' Rabinowitz said. ``So we were kind of clued in to
anything that looked weird.''
</P>
<P>
   The Annamites, a remote, rugged region inhabited by the Hmong
tribe, have been a major source for new mammals. Of the roughly
dozen large mammal species discovered in the world since 1900,
Rabinowitz said, nearly half have been found since 1992 in the
Annamites.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for all the discoveries is that, until this decade,
the region was largely off limits to Westerners. But another may
have to do with an accident of geography.
</P>
<P>
   During the Pleistocene Epoch, a time of alternating glaciation
and warming beginning less than two million years ago, the
Annamites remained glacier-free. Scientists have speculated that
during the warmer periods, animals that had become acclimated to
lower temperatures sought refuge in the colder elevations of the
Annamites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, with the fragmentation of their habitat, they were
stuck up there,'' Rabinowitz said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teams of American scientists and engineers have joined Turkish
colleagues in seeking lessons from last week's devastating
earthquake in Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans the question is: Does this faraway earthquake help
scientists foretell where the next big one will be in California?
The San Andreas fault in California is almost an identical twin to
the North Anatolian fault that produced the magnitude 7.4
earthquake centered near Izmit, Turkey. The two faults are the same
size and length, move at the same rate and are caused by same
confluence of geological factors, chiefly the movement of tectonic
plates.
</P>
<P>
   The American researchers hope measurements of ground motion in
Turkey will help them pinpoint where the next California quakes are
most likely to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Also, quake-related building codes in Turkey and California are
equally strict. While many structures collapsed last week,
apparently because of shoddy materials or workmanship, it will be
important to learn if those properly built to code withstood the
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   For the Turkish scientists, the big question is: Does this
earthquake increase the risk that another big one will occur closer
to Istanbul and its 12 million people?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Aykut Barka, a geology professor at Istanbul Technical
University and a leading authority on Anatolian tectonics, said
that earthquakes in Turkey seem to be moving toward Istanbul. While
there is no way to predict earthquakes in the short term, he said,
researchers hope that this quake will provide clues about where the
next one will occur in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   In mapping the area affected by last week's quake, Barka said
that the fault ruptured for at least 60 miles east of Izmit. In
some places, one side of the fault zone shifted more than 12 feet
relative to the other side. It appears that two fault segments may
have broken 30 seconds apart, producing the very large shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Dolan, an American geologist from the University of
Southern California who is in Turkey this week, said that
earthquakes as big as this are rare and provide valuable
information on the physics of how and why they occur. ``The more we
know about this quake,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``the
more we'll know about quakes back home.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Andreas and North Anatolian faults are textbook examples
of right lateral strike slip faults.
</P>
<P>
   The San Andreas is a gigantic fracture formed at the boundary of
the Pacific and North American plates _ enormous slabs of the
earth's crust tightly pressed against each other and sitting atop a
deep layer of hot, taffylike rocks. Moving northward, the Pacific
plate is positioned to slide past the North American plate.
</P>
<P>
   The North Anatolian plate is a small slab of crust trapped
between the larger Arabian plate and Eurasian plate. It can be
pictured as a watermelon seed between one's index finger and thumb.
The thumb is Arabia, the index finger is Eurasia and the seed is
Turkey. When the two fingers are squeezed, the ``seed'' slides. The
resulting movement produces earthquakes in much the same fashion as
those seen in California.
</P>
<P>
   Both the San Andreas and the North Anatolian faults are more
than 600 miles long and 10 miles deep and move about an eighth of
an inch each year. In regions of weak rock, small earthquakes occur
frequently. Where rocks are rigid and unforgiving, strain builds
up. Earthquakes occur when the rocks finally give way, releasing
accumulated stress.
</P>
<P>
   The process then repeats itself as the plates continue their
journey. Large fault systems like these tend to be made of segments
that produce earthquakes of varying magnitudes. Moreover, when a
fault segment breaks, neighboring segments can become more loaded
with strain or relieved of strain depending on many factors _ local
fault geometry, the direction of slip, amounts of friction,
relative motions at depth and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Most earthquakes tend to transfer strain to both ends of the
fault, altering stress patterns over tens or hundreds of miles,
depending on the size of the quake. The effects are long lasting.
Thus fault motion in one earthquake affects the probability of
future earthquakes nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, for example, one earthquake can set off stress
patterns that set the stage for future temblors. In fact, it has
``the most spectacular example of progressive earthquake failure
anywhere in the world,'' said Dr. Ross Stein, a geophysicist at the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., who has studied the
sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   In three earlier eras, Stein said, earthquakes migrated in
stepwise fashion from east to west. One began in 967 and ended in
1050. Another sequence took place from 1509 to 1754, and a third
occurred from 1650 to 1668. Many other large, devastating
earthquakes hit Turkey in other centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But most interesting to scientists is the current dominolike
sequence of quakes that began in eastern Turkey in 1939 (killing
30,000 people) and has been progressing westward ever since. Twelve
large earthquakes have occurred along the fault from east to west,
marching toward Istanbul. A few others have struck to the east of
the 1939 temblor but not in the same pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, working with Barka and Dr. James Dieterich of the
Geological Survey, found that all but one of the progressive
earthquakes increased stress in the next fault segment down the
east-to-west line of earthquake activity. No one knows why the
North Anatolian fault behaves in this linear fashion, he said. It
may have a simpler geometry. ``It's something you can't help but
want to study,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sequence of modern earthquakes, Barka, Stein and
Dieterich used computer models of stress accumulation to report in
a scientific article two years ago that the area around Izmit had
an increased probability of a large earthquake occurring in the
near future. It was not an earthquake prediction, Dieterich said,
``but we were certainly not surprised when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   If the earthquakes continue to progress toward the west, the
next big one could strike very close to Istanbul and the Sea of
Marmara, Barka said. But he added: ``Istanbul has two advantages
relative to Izmit. It sits on hard rock, and it is six to 10 miles
away from the fault. If buildings are built according to code, I
don't think it would result in the kind of damage we see in this
1999 earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Izmit earthquake has many lessons for California, Stein
said. The San Andreas fault is more irregular and complex but
earthquakes there also tend to increase strain on the ends of fault
segments and reduce strain on collateral or regional faults
elsewhere.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The good news, he said, is that the 1906 San Francisco quake was
so huge that it relieved stress over all of northern California.
Strain increased in the north, around Mendocino, where the San
Andreas meets other plates. It also increased in the south but that
is in central California where the San Andreas fault encounters
weak rock and tends to ``creep'' aseismically _ without quakes. The
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake added stress to both its ends but the
system has been relaxing since then.
</P>
<P>
   The picture in Southern California is more complicated, Stein
said. Relative plate motions are driving the Los Angeles basin _
home to millions of people _ into a mountain range, producing
accordionlike faults all over the region.
</P>
<P>
   The last large quake on the straight southern end of the San
Andreas, in 1857, increased strain to the south but no records
exist to evaluate much more, he said. The 1991 Landers earthquake
raised stress along the San Bernardino segment of the southern San
Andreas, hastening the next great earthquake there by about a
decade. The 1994 Northridge earthquake probably lessened strain
directly north of the town but increased the probability of another
event toward the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   American structural and civil engineers are also in Turkey this
week studying buildings that survived or failed. For them, every
earthquake is a natural experiment for testing theories of how to
safely construct buildings, bridges, hospitals and freeways.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is chilling, said Dr. Thomas Heaton, a professor of
engineering seismology at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena. Turkey has an advanced earthquake engineering community.
The same building philosophies are used in Turkey and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons from Izmit will be learned from the buildings that
collapsed, Heaton said. If they met code and were well built, it is
time for California to worry. If the structures are substandard,
Americans can feel more confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in any earthquake,'' Heaton said, ``you can expect
nonductile concrete buildings to collapse. If a quake the size of
the one in Izmit were to strike L.A. or San Francisco, you can
almost guarantee that many older buildings will end up in a similar
situation,'' Heaton said. ``Also changes in architectural style can
make buildings more or less dangerous by where you put windows or
shear walls. Two buildings that meet strict code may not have the
same performance in an earthquake. Until we know what happened in
Turkey, we should be humble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Turks mostly believe in the fortunes of God, who decides
everything, including whether their houses will collapse or not,''
Barka said. ``They need to be taught that if their houses are
reasonably well built, their lives will not be in danger.''

KIMBELL MUSEUM WILL HOST TWO MAJOR EXHIBITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Kimbell Art Museum has announced two
important new exhibitions for 2000 _ including an exclusive U.S.
presentation of a blockbuster show featuring works by Renoir,
Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell will be the only U.S. venue for an international
exhibition of 81 paintings from the Musee de l'Orangerie in Paris,
which is closed for renovation. ``From Renoir to Picasso:
Masterpieces from the Musee de l'Orangerie,'' opens Nov. 12, 2000,
and will feature 16 works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and seven by
Pablo Picasso, among other late-19th and early-20th-century
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell also announced that it will unveil a redesigned,
temporary installation of its permanent collection in November. In
addition, the museum will host ``Stroganoff: The Palace and
Collections of a Russian Noble Family,'' an exhibition of 230
masterworks by Botticelli, Poussin, Van Dyck, Watteau and others,
opening in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements are the first major moves made by Timothy
Potts, who became the museum's director in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased we've been able to put in place two
exhibitions as complementary as the Orangerie and the Stroganoff,''
Potts said. ``These are the backbone of next year's visiting
exhibition program.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell, which opened in 1972, has become known as one of
the most important small museums in the United States, recognized
for the quality of its permanent collection, its Louis Kahn
building, and for organizing and presenting major shows. Previous
blockbuster shows include the Impressionist masterpieces loaned
from The Barnes Collection in 1994; ``Monet and the Mediterranean''
in 1997; and a Matisse and Picasso exhibit earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangerie collection was put together by two Frenchmen, art
dealer Paul Guillaume and, after Guillaume's death, Jean Walter. It
equals or exceeds in quality the collection assembled by
Guillaume's most celebrated customer, Albert C. Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is the only other North American venue for the
exhibition, which will also travel to Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt (the Orangerie) show will be very popular,'' Potts
said, conceding the inevitability of comparison between it and the
Kimbell's record-setting presentation of works from the Barnes
Collection. ``But it will be more than another collection of
important works from this period. It also is a story about how a
great collection was built at a time when this work was not so
greatly appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble
Family,'' which will be on view from July 2 through Oct. 1, will
feature a recreation of the Paintings Gallery of the Stroganoff
Palace on St. Petersburg's Nevsky Prospekt, and present more than
200 master works, lent by the State Hermitage and State Russian
museums. The Stroganoffs collected, sponsored and commissioned
artworks over the course of five centuries and had an indelible
impact on Russian cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   Potts is also curating a small, tightly focused show that will
open earlier in 2000 but said that he could not describe it until
loans of art have been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Kimbell visitors will have a fresh opportunity
to view works from the permanent collection in settings evoking
centuries-old tradition. Instead of the neutral linen and
travertine so closely associated with its galleries, the Kimbell's
Old Master paintings and Asian, pre-Columbian and African works
will temporarily be shown against panels covered with fabrics in
muted colors.
</P>
<P>
   The installation is the work of Milanese architect Mario
Bellini, who has designed a number of important historical
exhibitions and worked with Potts on redesigning and adding to the
National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, where Potts was deputy
director and director from 1993 to late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional changes in either the grouping of artworks or in
their surroundings help reanimate familiar artworks, Potts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of telling a different story, one that is commonly
used in museums around the world. And I'd like people to be
thinking more about installation as an aspect of their museum
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes in store include new gallery seating, new cases
and pedestals for three-dimensional works and new furnishings for
the Buffet restaurant. The vertical blinds that for many years
covered the windows around the museum's Maillol courtyard will be
replaced with the finely perforated roll-down scrim seen in many
museums.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary installation ``will be the first time since
(Kimbell founding director) Ric Brown that the permanent collection
has been treated to an art-historical presentation,'' said Patricia
Loud, the Kimbell's curator of architecture.

HERE'S THE REAL QUESTION ABOUT THE QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's put aside the issue of whether George W. Bush will or will
not answer The Question: Did he ever use illegal drugs,
specifically cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems inclined to stick to his guns, refusing to answer
``yes'' or ``no'' beyond suggesting that if he ever did use illegal
drugs, it was more than 25 years ago. But this is subject matter
that is not totally within his control. At some point, Bush might
decide that he has no choice but to answer because The Question is
overshadowing everything else he says or does.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable public backlash against the media's preoccupation
with The Question could eventually make it unnecessary for Bush to
provide The Answer. But it won't be easy for him to keep resisting
until the backlash sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is a question that needs to be considered in
addition to the purely speculative proposition of WILL he or WON'T
he? This other question is: SHOULD he?
</P>
<P>
   We've heard a lot of sanctimonious rhetoric about exactly what a
candidate for president of the United States does or does not owe
the voters in the way of information about his private life. And it
should not surprise us in the least that some of the most
vociferous demands for full disclosure from Bush are coming from
people who only a few months ago were adamant in their insistence
that a president's private foibles are none of the public's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Can we say ``hypocrisy,'' boys and girls?
</P>
<P>
   My position on Bush's situation is that he shouldn't confess to
anything that he doesn't want to confess to _ and that voters can
decide whether his candor or lack of same should be a factor in
their electoral decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   That is Bush's position as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to tell people I made mistakes and that I have
learned from my mistakes,'' Bush said the other day. ``And if they
like it, I hope they give me a chance. And if they don't like it,
they can go find somebody else to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, plenty of people _ including some who
support Bush for president _ who believe that the Texas governor
should answer The Question.
</P>
<P>
   But I have a question of my own: Why should he?
</P>
<P>
   Does a candidate have to answer every question that's asked just
because someone has the audacity to ask it?
</P>
<P>
   If that's the standard, then we can force any candidate to
respond to any unfounded allegation we can conjure up _ no matter
how unfair, no matter how outrageous. It's the standard that Bush
says he's challenging when he refuses to answer the drug question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody floats a rumor and it causes you to ask a question,''
Bush said last week.
</P>
<P>
   If he answers the question, the answer prompts another question.
Which prompts more rumors, more questions, more answers, more
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the game in American politics and I refuse to play
it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to suggest that there could never be some aspect of
a politician's private life that might be relevant to his
suitability to hold office. The problem is, no one exercises any
judgment about which aspects are relevant and which aren't.
</P>
<P>
   The media and the character assassins go after everything _ and
they often go after it without bothering to find out if an
allegation is true or false.
</P>
<P>
   Bush obviously hasn't closed the door to the possibility that he
used cocaine in the distant past. But do any of the people who are
asking him about it have proof that he did? If they had proof,
wouldn't we have seen it or heard it by now?
</P>
<P>
   Why should a candidate have to answer personal questions based
on mere presumptions _ with no evidence of any kind to give them
legitimacy?
</P>

EXPECT NO THANKS OR APOLOGIES _ IT'S A MONOPOLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This century began with Theodore Roosevelt and others urgently
warning of the rapid growth of monopolies and insisting on controls
to keep a few big corporations from poisoning the roots of free
enterprise by squeezing out smaller competitors. Ironically, the
century ends with the most rapid, rampant spread of monopoly in the
world's history.
</P>
<P>
   Duing the first half of our century, America's statesmen
crafted a careful matrix of measures to restrict the always eager
tentacles of the biggest from gaining control of whole industries
by strangling or gobbling up all significant competition.
</P>
<P>
   There were antitrust laws; the graduated income tax; controls on
banks, stock and bond promotions, and interstate telephone,
pipeline and transportation companies; and other legal measures to
protect the public from price gouging by monopolistic greed.
</P>
<P>
   Free enterprise thrived from a million roots, and most
businesses were home-grown, locally owned. Some grew big, but not
so big as to dominate whole industries. America became a beacon to
the world, the symbol of opportunity for all. Franklin Roosevelt's
second vice president, Henry A. Wallace, proclaimed this ``the
century of the common man.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, somewhere along the way, we seem to have lost our zeal for
small, local, competitive free enterprise where businesses knew and
cherished their workers and their individual customers, and where
the well-being of laborers and consumers was the business of us
all. We strayed from that path.
</P>
<P>
   It may have begun changing in the 1970s with the overlobbied
mania for ``decontrol.'' We deregulated the airlines, savings and
loan companies, banking, telephones. Now cable television. This was
supposed to promote competition. It hasn't. Today there are fewer,
not more serious competitors. The biggest keep getting bigger. The
middle-sized are all being squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   How does this affect the consumer? In lots of ways. Mainly, it
reduces him or her to a number, a tiny faceless, voiceless figure
on a ream of computer printouts whose convenience is not important
and whose business is dispensable, buried in a bottom-line
calculation of averages.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider something as familiar as the family TV set. Until
recently, cable TV service was supplied here in Fort Worth by
Marcus Cable. It was locally owned. If you had a problem, you could
call someone locally. For 10 years, my family had no problems.
Everything went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Marcus was taken over by Charter
Communications, a national chain with a million customers. Maybe
Mrs. Wright and I are atypical. We moved our residence in May.
Perhaps our moving angered the computer. Since Charter took over,
we've had nothing but headaches _ and nobody to talk to.
Immediately we began getting impersonal printed duns for $158 that
we didn't actually owe, threatening to disconnect our service if it
weren't paid immediately.
</P>
<P>
   When the first of these arrived, I wrote a personal check for
the stipulated amount, accompanied by a handwritten letter, and
posted it that afternoon from our home. I got no acknowledgement,
then or ever. A week or so later, we got another dun. Then, on a
Saturday evening, just as Betty was settling in for a pleasant
evening at home, our sets went blank except for a message that said
we owed $158. There was a telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only the cable channels that were out. The computer
had shut down our free stations as well. I called the number
displayed on our set. After listening to several options, I pressed
the number for discussing our bill and then waited. And waited. All
Charter's ``service representatives'' were busy, I was repeatedly
told via recording.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to the lady who finally came on line that there was
an error, as we owed nothing and had actually sent in a voluntary
overpayment. She said she could not help, as the computer showed
that we owed $158. She didn't say she was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   So we waited, televisionless, until Monday morning when a young
man called, stating that he would be out soon to ``disconnect'' our
cable. I explained again. He said he didn't work for Charter and
was only a freelance contractor, but he quoted a figure for which,
in addition to the $158, he'd reconnect us. I waited for him most
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, I pointed out that this would be the second
time I'd have paid the unowed bill. ``Too bad,'' he said, but there
was nothing that he _ or anyone else, for that matter _ could do
about it. ``They're a monopoly,'' was his only explanation.
</P>
<P>
   That week, my office assistant got someone on the telephone at
Charter. After considerable discussion, an error was acknowledged.
A ``computer glitch,'' I think they call it.
</P>
<P>
   Charter's computer had been carrying two accounts, one in my
name and one in Betty's. Mine carried a healthy credit. We asked
that the two be consolidated. This done, Charter's spokesperson
said, we had a credit balance.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, I thought. We'll stay ahead and avoid further harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The next week I got another printout threat. The computer hasn't
forgiven me. We owe $158, and if we wanted to avoid a disruption in
service, we'd better pay up immediately!
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't really think that big corporation is deliberately
trying to cheat me. It's just that it's ... well, sort of ...
distant, you know, and ... well, computer-dependent and
personality-deprived, and ... do I dare say ``indifferent''? It
hasn't said it's sorry yet, or thanks, or ... not that I expect it
to.
</P>
<P>
   It's a monopoly.
</P>

`FAMILY VALUES:' SO IT'S ONLY MAKE-BELIEVE. GOTTA PROBLEM WITH
THAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time in the course of ``Family Values: The Mob and
the Movies,'' it is stipulated that most Italian-Americans are
honest, hard-working and as averse to violence as other citizens.
But this documentary is not a production of some Italian-American
Anti-Defamation League. No sooner is ethnic etiquette out of the
way than the program settles into tales of larceny and mayhem among
gangs led by New Yorkers with names like Gotti, Gambino and
Columbo.
</P>
<P>
   What gives these two hours a fresh spin is the real-life cast,
most of them members of what they drolly call the Gangsters Actors
Guild (that's right, GAG). Few viewers may recognize their names or
stage names, but their non-matinee-idol faces, pavement accents and
often abrupt on-screen demises sustain an industry of mob movies.
</P>
<P>
   Their monikers include Adonis, Pastore, Salerno, Serra, Sirico
and Squicciarini, and their professional personas blend with their
mostly fond accounts of growing up in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, on
Belmont Avenue in the Bronx and in other enclaves of ethnic
identity.
</P>
<P>
   If you have trouble sorting out what are offered as authentic
sidewalks-of-New York memories from the scenes from ``Goodfellas,''
``A Bronx Tale,'' ``Gotti,'' ``Donnie Brasco'' and other mob epics
treated here, the confusion is built into a program that never
quite figures out what it wants to be: a lesson in how
Italian-American youths are either lured into the criminal life by
the wise guys or narrowly escape that fate, or just another
exercise in screen-wise battery and slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the actors around a convivial table, the viewer can
easily imagine them playing gin rummy in the back room of a Little
Italy social club. Their memories of family life are appropriately
sentimental, their descriptions of mob life admonitory. The right
clothes (pinky rings and Piaget watches) and an appreciation of
southern Italian cooking (very thin slices of garlic) get their
due.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these chatty gents are delivering firsthand information
or the leavings from years of scripts, flavored with cliches about
respect and honor, you decide. Either way the program is likely to
elicit complaints that once again television is subjecting
Italian-Americans to stereotypes that other minorities are now
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Several nonactors purport to tell of real, unscripted
experiences. There is Dominick, who having testified against some
colleagues is now in the Federal Witness Protection Program; Jerry
Capeci, a no-nonsense journalist who calls the mobs ``killing
machines'' and Frank Pontillo, who is serving a term for declining
to rat on his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Vincent, whom we can see being blown away in one of his
roles, is the evening's host. This gang agrees that being an actor
is wiser than being a wise guy.

 &HT;    Maryland's Vanderlinden looks to buck losing trendBy Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ Since Bobby Ross left in 1986 after winning
three ACC titles in his last four years, Maryland has been a place
for coaches to end their careers.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins have compiled an inglorious 45-86-2 mark since
Ross, have been through Joe Krivak and Mark Duffner, and now are
working on Ron Vanderlinden.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderlinden came to College Park two seasons ago from Gary
Barnett's staff at Northwestern with great expectations, but the
Terps have gone 5-17 under him. This year looks to be more of the
same. Maryland has been picked last in the conference in most
preseason publications, and some of the Terp following are losing
patience. Vanderlinden recited the obstacles he has had to overcome
but conceded, ``I really didn't know what I was walking into. I
knew the records were 6-5 and 5-6. I was hopeful. But for one
reason or another, (a turnaround) hasn't happened. Really, what
happened for us was that the cupboard was bare.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 43-year-old coach said, ``We had to convert
from the run-and-shoot, we didn't have a tight end or a fullback on
campus, and the linemen were only used to pass blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terps have two things going for them that could make this
season interesting.
</P>
<P>
   One is tailback Lamont Jordan, one of the top runners in the
ACC. Jordan had 906 yards last season despite missing most of two
games and running behind a poor offensive line. He averaged 5.4
yards per carry and visited Vanderlinden in the off-season to
suggest that he should carry the ball more.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a freshman named Latrez Harrison, a 6-foot-3,
215-pound quarterback from Atlanta. Harrison, rated as one of the
nation's top schoolboy quarterbacks last season, turned down
scholarship offers from Auburn, Syracuse, Georgia, Alabama and
Georgia Tech to come to Maryland. Harrison is in a battle for the
starting job with last year's starter, Randall Jones, and redshirt
freshman Calvin McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Fall practice observers say Harrison might not start the first
game but he is too good to keep out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrez is everything we thought he would be and everything we
hoped he would be,'' Vanderlinden said. ``Latrez is as talented a
recruit as I've had since I've been here.'' Right now, Jordan is
the best player. Is he the best running back in the ACC? ``Yes and
no,'' Jordan said. ``Yes, because that's the kind of mentality I
have to have. No, because my statistics don't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was fun on game day, but it wasn't any fun watching
the film the week after. It was always the same thing. If this guy
had made a block or that guy had made a block, we might have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line is better this year, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had trouble sustaining drives, and that's why I
wasn't getting more carries, '' he said. ``But we're improved
there, and (defenses) can't put eight or nine people up at the line
of scrimmage. We've got a passing game, too. We're not just a
running team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proof will be at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing,'' Jordan said. ``Last year we were talking
about what we had to do, and then we'd go out and not do it. This
year we've got to show we can do it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Making use of thousands of miles of discarded telephone cables,
scientists have begun to wire remote regions of deep ocean floor to
create an undersea network of geological observatories.
</P>
<P>
   The old cables will serve as deep-sea extension cords running
thousands of miles from land-based power stations to sensors, some
of which are already sending back continuous flows of data from the
ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists and other scientists using abandoned cables have set
out to collect a bonanza of information about earthquakes,
underground nuclear explosions, changes in the earth's internal
structure and its magnetic field, fluctuations in the high-altitude
ionosphere and even whale migration patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Although seismometers and other geological sensors have long
been operating in most land areas, conspicuous gaps in global
seismic coverage exist under the world's deep oceans, and oceans
cover most of the planet's surface.
</P>
<P>
   But this has begun to change, thanks in part to rapid progress
in technology that has made old telephone cables obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of such cables are still serviceable, said Dr. Rhett
Butler, director of a data-collecting network in Washington called
Inc. Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS). ``These cables
were built to last,'' he said in an interview, ``and at least some
of them, which went into use in the mid-1960s, still function
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   One such line is a coaxial cable (similar to the cable that
carries television programs into private homes) that was laid
across the deep Pacific Ocean floor by AT&AMP;T in 1964 from San Luis
Obispo, Calif., to Makaha, Hawaii _ a distance of nearly 3,000
miles. At the time, it was among the most advanced phone lines in
the world, equipped with powered vacuum-tube repeaters every 20
miles to refresh the telephone signals as they traveled along it.
The cable, called Hawaii-2, could simultaneously carry as many as
138 conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989 a fishing trawler working in shallow water near the
California coast accidentally cut the $30 million cable.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone company could probably have repaired the break,
but decided instead to abandon the cable; by then, optical-fiber
cables had come into use, and the new cables could carry up to a
half million conversations with greatly improved sound quality.
AT&AMP;T announced that it would make the abandoned coaxial cable
available to scientists who could find a use for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took several years for scientists to consider the
possibilities,'' said Dr. Alan Chave, a senior scientist of the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. ``But last
year it all came together and we showed that continuous deep-sea
seismic sensing was possible, using these old cables.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's first deep undersea seismic observatory capable of
continuous long-term functioning began operating last September.
Its seismometer failed two months later because of a short circuit,
but Chave and his colleagues plan to retrieve and repair the
instrument in September. With several upgrades now completed, the
observatory (called ``H2O,'' standing for ``Hawaii-2 Observatory'')
will then resume operation, midway between California and Hawaii,
at a depth of 16,400 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A feature of the unmanned sea-floor observatory is a junction
box equipped with eight power outlets and signal connectors
allowing scientists to plug more ocean-bottom sensors into the
line. Among the supplementary instruments scientists plan to
install is a hydrophone capable of listening to whale calls and
tracking their migrations.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of H2O, financed by the National Science Foundation,
was about $2.5 million. If the project had had to start from
scratch by laying its own cable, it would have cost up to about
$120 million, scientists estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that led to the project is a decade old. In 1988 a
scientist at Tokyo University suggested that abandoned telephone
cables might be reused for research, and that suggestion started
American scientists thinking. Eventually, a consortium that
included Woods Hole, the University of Hawaii and IRIS came up with
a plan. A shore-based power station could pump direct current at
5,000 volts into one end of AT&AMP;T's broken cable, creating a
thousand-mile-long extension cord to power scientific instruments
three miles deep. Electricity flowing into the cable would move
along it, powering sensors and repeaters, and finally grounding the
current into the ocean at the severed end, thereby completing a
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But making H2O a reality was a hair-raising challenge, as Chave
described it.
</P>
<P>
   The tools included the 270-foot research ship Thomas Thompson;
the Jason, a deep-sea remotely operated vehicle; and the Media, a
remotely operated camera platform to watch the Jason from above,
helping Jason's pilot aboard the Thompson avoid entangling
obstacles three miles below him.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists focused their efforts on the part of the cable
reaching from dry land in Hawaii to a spot 1,000 miles to the east
_ a smooth region of sea floor where they expected seismic signals
to be especially useful to geophysicists. Searching the ocean
bottom for the cable last summer, the team found it nearly one mile
from where they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the next step, the team sent Jason down. Using a joystick and
a television monitor aboard the Thompson, the craft's pilot, Will
Sellers, slowly steered Jason into position, clamped the jaws of
its maneuvering arm on the 1\-inch cable, and cut it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Next came the hardest part: snagging the severed cable with an
800-pound grapnel and hauling the cut end up to the ship. Sellers
had to make sure that the grapnel grabbed the cable at least 16,400
feet away from the cut to create a counterbalance as the cable was
hauled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like positioning a slippery strand of cut spaghetti on
the tine of a fork, making sure that there was enough weight of
spaghetti on the loose end to keep the strand from sliding off in
the other direction,'' Chave said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's crew then had to haul up six miles of cable weighing
nearly 24,000 pounds _ the maximum weight the ship was capable of
handling. The risky operation took an entire day.
</P>
<P>
   Once the crew had wrestled the cable aboard the ship they
powered electricity into it and used it to make a telephone call to
the National Science Foundation in Washington. The cable worked
perfectly, even though it had lain unused for nine years on the
ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   But time and again unexpected problems arose. When the crew
began lowering the cable and a ``termination frame'' that served as
a connection between the cable and an outlet, a chain broke and
both cable and frame fell to the ocean bottom. Fortunately the
frame fell in a favorable position, so that when the junction box
was lowered, Jason's arm was able to complete the setup by
connecting the frame with the junction box. Finally, a seismometer
built by the University of Hawaii was lowered into position nearby
and plugged into the junction box.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, seismic signals began flowing to Hawaii,
joining the global torrent of signals from more than 100 other
sensors contributing to the IRIS network. After the Woods Hole team
returns the repaired seismometer to the sea floor next month, the
scientists hope the cable will continue to work for up to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can use the data produced by the network, Chave said.
Other groups, including one in Japan, are also exploiting old
telephone cables, although IRIS network is the most extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more evenly you can collect seismic signals from sensors
all over the world,'' he said, ``the better you can tomographically
image the structure deep inside the earth. It's a little like
taking a clinical CAT scan using an inward-looking telescope. For
one thing, the seismic data can tell you about the differential
rotation of liquid metal in the earth's core _ a key factor causing
variations in the earth's magnetic field.''
</P>
<P>
   In collaboration with a scientist at Bell Laboratories, Chave is
also using 10 abandoned cables, all with one end reaching land
somewhere, as passive sensors to measure deep ocean currents and
changes in the ionosphere. As a current of sea water flows through
the earth's magnetic field, an electric current is generated in the
water, and a resulting voltage shows up in a cable with one end
grounded in sea water. Current is also induced in an ocean cable by
the flow of electricity through the ionosphere _ a layer of the
atmosphere 50 miles above the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the Navy announced that it was abandoning some
of the hydrophone sensors it had used to track potentially hostile
ships and submarines. Some of these sensors and their associated
cables and electronics have been made available for civilian
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this activity is really expanding the reach of geophysical
science,'' Chave said. ``We have to thank technological
obsolescence for giving us some wonderful tools.''

CORPORATIONS GIVE NETWORK MONEY TO CREATE FAMILY PILOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Viewers and the media weren't the only ones who
noticed a distinct lack of diversity in the television fall season
lineups. Apparently, advertisers also recognized the lack of
programming aimed at and containing depictions of families,
minorities and older people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a group of 11 major corporations _ including
AT&AMP;T, General Motors, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Sears
_ announced an agreement with the WB network to fund the
development of scripts for potential TV pilots that are ``family
friendly.'' Ameritech, IBM, Nationwide, Pfizer, Warner-Lambert and
Wendy's round out the list of companies in the Family Friendly
Programming Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The group is putting about $900,000 into a ``pilot script
development fund for potential drama and comedy series'' that the
WB will consider adding to its lineup beginning in fall 2000. The
average pilot script costs roughly $60,000 to $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The pact does not guarantee that any of these pilots will ever
become series, and the corporations do not gain any control over or
stake in the shows themselves. But it seems to be a clear statement
by advertisers that they haven't been the ones behind the
saturation of sexy programs aimed at teens and young adults _ a
number of which, ironically, are on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   WB spokesman Brad Turell insists the network carries a broader
range of programming than it is often given credit for. ``The
reality is, we have a very balanced lineup,'' Turell said.
```Dawson's Creek' get a lot of press, but we also have shows like
... `7th Heaven.''' Turell said the latter show has one of the most
evenly split audience demographics of any show, making it
especially attractive to advertisers who market to a broad family
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Defending themselves against criticism that their lineups are
top-heavy with sexy and youth-skewed shows, the networks have all
claimed that they're only giving advertisers what they want. The
advertisers are now making it clear that they would welcome a
better range of choices on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we hear people say that we're dictating what is on
television, saying we need particular (demographics) ... it's just
not the case,'' said John McKeegan, a spokesman for Johnson &AMP;
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   McKeegan said Andrea Alstrup, the ad director of the New
Brunswick, N.J.-based personal care giant (which produces such
products as Band-Aid bandages and Johnson's Baby Shampoo), formed
the coalition of advertisers out of personal interest. ``She was
not all that crazy about some things she'd seen on TV and felt like
there were not a lot of options for us to advertise on
family-friendly programs,'' McKeegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all of this has a promotional value for a company
like Johnson &AMP; Johnson. The firm is leveraging its association with
family programming through a year-long cross-promotion with TV
Guide. The forum's members may partly be hoping to gain some good
publicity through these actions.
</P>
<P>
   But, good press aside, the move is a small step in part of an
overall trend among advertisers, who want more control over what
they're paying for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a step in the right direction. I just would have
liked to see them (advertisers) take it a step further,'' said
Heidi Sinclair, co-founder of Beverly Hills-based Brand X Media.
Sinclair's firm is not involved in the WB deal but is working with
other advertisers to create ``branded'' programming that will give
the sponsor ongoing control over broadcast shows.
</P>
<P>
   This desire is becoming more urgent with the fragmentation of
the TV audience, along with new technology that threatens to render
traditional commercials obsolete. Digital video recorders,
available now for about $500 plus a monthly ``service'' charge,
allow consumers to digitally record shows for viewing at their
leisure. The big catch for advertisers: These boxes, marketed under
the names TiVo and Replay, let viewers skip commercials altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair said younger networks such as the WB and UPN are
generally known to be more receptive to novel financing
arrangements such as this one, as well as ``branded'' programming.
For example, this year UPN is renaming its weekly movie night for a
single sponsor, ``Blockbuster Video's Shockwave Cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Turell said he wouldn't be surprised to see other TV outlets
follow suit if the WB's arrangement pays off in terms of a hit show
or two. ``This deal, simply, allows us to develop more shows,''
Turell said. ``The more shows you develop, the more chances you
have at creating a hit ... TV is a hit-driven medium. One hit can
make a huge difference for a network, and that's ultimately what we
hope to get out of this &UR; . &LR; '' &QL;

THANKS, BUT JESSICA SIMPSON DOESN'T WANT TO BE NEXT BRITNEY SPEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The buzz has already started: She recently finished a
tour with teen heartthrobs 98 Degrees, and she has been featured in
several teen magazines, from ``Teen'' to ``Teen People,'' even
though her Columbia debut, ``Sweet Kisses,'' doesn't come out until
November.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the clincher: She's being compared with Britney
Spears _ and she's not too thrilled about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both young and we both dance, so I hear a lot of, `Oh,
she's trying to be Britney,' '' she said. ``I wouldn't mind selling
as many records as her, but I'm not trying to be her.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Jessica Simpson, a young, gorgeous Texan and budding pop
singer who could very well become pop music's next teen sensation.
</P>
<P>
   She has the looks, the music (a pop/R&AMP;B-flavored disc due in
November), the power (she's on major label Columbia) and, yes, the
talent. She really can sing.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Morales, assistant program/music director for Fort
Worth-Dallas pop station KISS/106.1 FM, was sold on her the day she
performed at the station's recent KISS Party in Dallas. ``The
response from the crowd was very positive,'' he said. ``I told her
record company that with the right material, this girl is gonna be
very, very big. I hate to compare her to Britney, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and her label are getting an early start on muting the
here-comes-the-next-Britney scuttlebutt. In an effort to quash
Britney comparisons, Columbia has taken a different approach to
establishing Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   First, the label, or rather label president and Mariah Carey-ex
Tommy Mottola, has chosen a Celine Dion-type ballad called ``I
Wanna Love You Forever'' as Simpson's first single, which comes out
next month. Traditionally, labels release catchy pop-radio tracks
as launch singles, then later, the big ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Mottola wanted to go the reverse route, to
introduce her voice, not necessarily to introduce her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first single was gonna be `The Final Heartbreak' (an
upbeat track) until Tommy got involved,'' Simpson said. ``He wants
me to be totally respected and have it be about my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Sony has sent Simpson on a promotional tour. Instead of
playing public full-length concerts, she sings in small clubs,
performing to rooms of music journalists, radio station folks and
other industry decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson did this last week at Dallas' Gypsy Tea Room, performing
two songs to a crowd of local writers and radio-station bigwigs, as
well as members of her family and her label's family.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-show presentation was cheese _ images of her flashed
across a video screen, along with phrases such as ``She is bright,
beautiful and blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't necessarily get better when Simpson came out.
Accompanied by four backup dancers (one of whom was her 14-year-old
sister, Ashlee), Simpson proceeded to take her place along
pop-music's conveyor belt of Backstreets and Britneys, dancing and
singing along to pre-recorded music and vocals. It takes talent to
do this?
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed when the dancers left, the lights dimmed and
the canned-music intro to ``I Wanna Love You Forever'' purred
through the club's speakers. Leaning her head back, she began to
sing. Glasses filled with free drinks stopped clinking. Chatter
silenced. Everyone stared. And Simpson wailed, holding onto notes
like she was holding onto her last breath. When the song was over,
the tough-to-sell crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's strategy just might work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ballads are timeless,'' Simpson said. ``It's hard to
think of an uptempo song that has made a big impact on my life. One
year, it's techno, rap another year, but it's the ballads that have
been the same. That's what so many people like about Mariah and
Celine. I'll have to change my music to change with the times, but
I'll always do ballads. I'm never gonna rap or anything, yo, yo,
yo.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Simpson has a professional air that belies her
age, no doubt due to working on ``Kisses'' for the past two years
and touring with 98 Degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, she is still very much a 19-year-old _
giggly, giddy, cracking jokes about rap, fame and even Britney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine are definitely real,'' she said, comparing a particular
region of her anatomy to Spears'. (Spears has been subjected to
criticism for undergoing breast-enhancement surgery, emphasizing
body over talent for her female teen-age fans).
</P>
<P>
   Simpson even has a lighthearted attitude toward a recent surgery
that was not a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week before her Dallas appearance, she had a cyst
removed from one of her fallopian tubes. She canceled her Boston
show, went home to rest for a few days, then was back onstage in
Dallas, despite continued pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really, really sick in Dallas, that's why I wasn't
dancing a whole lot. I was still in a lot of pain,'' she said on
the phone from San Francisco. ``I thought my stitches were gonna
pop open.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Richardson, Texas, Simpson got an early start on her
music career, singing at Richardson Heights Baptist Church, where
her father was a minister. At 14, she cut a gospel record. But by
the time the CD was finished, the label had folded, leaving Simpson
out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing the disc became a family effort. ``My grandmother paid
for it to be mixed and when my dad would speak at different church
conferences, I'd be the special guest and sing. We'd sell CDs that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson quickly established herself on the local Christian-music
circuit, often appearing on bills with Kirk Franklin and CeCe
Winans. Realizing their daughter's potential, the Simpsons hired an
entertainment lawyer in hopes of breaking her nationally. Word got
around. Labels started calling. It got frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showcased to nine record labels in two days when I was 17,''
said Simpson, a graduate of J.J. Pierce High School in Richardson.
``I got a couple offers, but then Tommy Mottola wanted to hear me.
I was so nervous, you know, because he listens to Mariah all the
time. But I sang for him and he signed me on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Simpson has been working on her debut
with a variety of producers, including Sam Waters of Color Me Badd
and Carey's producer, Louis Biancanella. The toughest part, Simpson
said, was choosing songs for it. She said she didn't want the
material to contradict her personal or religious beliefs. That's
also why she passed on appearing in a risque scene in ``Top Gun''
producer Jerry Bruckheimer's new movie, ``Coyote Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to do a sex scene. It was more of an implied
thing, but I still didn't feel right doing it,'' she said. ``I felt
like it was contradicting everything I stand for. Some people think
I'm crazy. There was definitely a lot of money involved, and my
album and the movie would come out around the same time. But my
morals are worth more to me than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said she's taking the same approach to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get caught up in the whole image thing, like
what outfit I'm wearing or how big my boobs are,'' she said. ``I
don't know if that's the case with all artists, but for me, I
really do love to sing. This is something I want to do for the rest
of my life.''

 &HT;    U.S. SEEKS RETURN OF AMERICAN INJURED TRYING TO ESCAPE IN CHINA
 &HT;    400&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The American Embassy said Monday it is seeking Chinese
permission to airlift out a badly injured American of Tibetan
ancestry who reportedly tumbled out of a hotel window last week
while trying to escape Chinese police interrogation in a remote
region near Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. embassy spokeswoman said Daja Meston, a 29-year-old
Tibetan linguist from Newton, Mass., is in ``serious but stable
condition'' in a Chinese hospital 900 miles west of Beijing. He is
suffering from a broken spine and other broken bones as well as
internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of this strange episode was Qinghai Province, one of
China's emptiest and least-visited borderlands near the mountain
passes into Tibet. Qinghai is a land where ethnic Tibetans and
Muslims have been in a centuries-long struggle for domination
against ethnic Chinese settlers, and where the ruling Chinese have
established prison factories for several hundred thousand convicts
from across China.
</P>
<P>
   Meston, along with an Australian human rights activist and a
local Tibetan-speaking guide, were seized by Chinese police in a
Tibetan-populated rural area of the Qinghai Province on August 15.
The two foreigners were charged with conducting ``illegal
interviews'' and entering a forbidden area while visiting China on
tourist visas.
</P>
<P>
   The trio had been looking into a controversial aid project in
which China has tentatively obtained a $40 million World Bank loan
to resettle 58,000 poor Chinese farmers into an area that Tibetan
activists claim as their ancestral land. The loan had been frozen
in June pending further evaluation following protests from the
Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The three were transported for interrogation to a hotel in the
provincial capital Xining, the only part of the province with a
solid ethnic Chinese majority. Following Meston's reported fall
from the window, he was being held under police guard in an
undisclosed hospital in Xining.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embassy spokeswoman, who declined to be identified,
said an embassy doctor who flew to visit Meston over the weekend
found that his injuries ``consistent'' with a report from China's
official Xinhua news agency that Meston ``jumped or fell from the
window while trying to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Chinese authorities have assured the U.S. Embassy that
``his investigation has been suspended while he is hospitalized.''
She said that Chinese and American authorities are discussing a
possible Medivac flight but ``no date has been set.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meston's Australian colleague, academic researcher Gabriel
Lafitte, was deported to Australia over the weekend after he agreed
to Chinese demands that he confess to conducting illegal research
and entering an off-limits area _ a state farm near the
resettlement project that employs prison labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mr. Meston's fall) was not an accident,'' Lafitte said after
an emotional reunion with his wife in Australia. ``That is
inconceivable. There were police in the rooms the whole time. I
think he was driven to it by the calculated cruelty of the
interrogation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte said that as he was being interrogated, he could
sometimes hear through the walls while Meston was defiantly
refusing to sign any confession demanded by the police. Lafitte
said he was intensely questioned from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. each day for
a week, but not beaten.

 &HT;    Former Coke whiz Zyman hired by start-up firms
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To help build brand recognition and grab the attention
of Web surfers and entrepreneurs everywhere, a trio of
Atlanta-based Internet start-up firms have retained the services of
former Coca-Cola Co. marketing whiz Sergio Zyman and his marketing
firm Z Group.
</P>
<P>
   Zyman, author of the best-selling business book ``The End of
Marketing as We Know It,'' has signed on to work with eTour.com,
which delivers Web sites targeted to user interests.
</P>
<P>
   Zyman, famous for launching the disastrous New Coke and the
phenomenally successful Diet Coke, will also be a senior marketing
advisor to local e-commerce enabler Nexchange, along with
eHatchery, the new Atlanta-based next-generation incubator founded
by Relevant Knowledge founder Jeff Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Zyman will serve as senior marketing advisor to Levy's new
company which launched Monday. The new company will provide Web
start-ups with equity investment capital, Internet-ready office
space, complete administrative and financial infrastructure, and
hands-on strategic and tactical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was introduced to Sergio through Roger Barnette of eTour and
Boland Jones of Premiere Technologies,'' Levy says. ``Of all
places, we connected on a golf course in Vail (Colo.). He
understood our vision and the importance of a strong marketing
program for Internet start-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette is also enthusiastic about employing Zyman's marketing
wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wealth of marketing experience Sergio Zyman and his team
bring to eTour is essential for us to realize the full potential of
our business,'' Barnette says. ``We feel the Z Group will help
eTour become a household name.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette's eTour.com will also employ Zyman's Z Group to help
design and develop the eTour brand and assist in helping the two
year old company develop a communications and marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nexchange Corporation, which helps companies create
co-branded online stores that sell products relevant to their
Website's content, will also be utilizing Zyman's services. The
company said Monday it received a $9 million second round equity
round equity financing commitment and will use the proceeds from
the investment to expand its sales and marketing operations. That's
where Zyman comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio is known worldwide as one of the best marketing minds
in the business,'' said Joe Michaels, Nexchange's President and
Chief Marketing Officer. ``To have him join our team is an
invaluable endorsement of the Nexchange business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyman, who spends much of his time in Colorado, said he's been
spending a lot of time online and is enthusiastic about his new
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Zyman believes the clients' Internet savvy combined with his
experience creating brand leadership ``should give each company the
resources it needs to thrive.''

LOST MASTERPIECE? MAYBE. HUMAN FOLLY? INDEED. 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one brightly colored canvas after another, Pieter Bruegel
chronicled the varieties of human folly _ from individual hubris
(``The Fall of Icarus'') to public brutality (``The Massacre of the
Innocents''), from private lunacy (``The Blue Cloak'') to
apocalyptic carnage (``Dulle Griet''). Some of his biographers
suggest that he belonged to an Antwerp circle of humanists who
believed that man is driven to sin by his own foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   In his antic new novel, ``Headlong,'' the British playwright
Michael Frayn has constructed an ingenious plot around a missing
Bruegel painting, and in doing so, created his own resonant
portrait of human folly. In this case, it is the folly of one
impulsive Englishman who allows greed, snobbery and intellectual
hubris to lead him astray and to risk his marriage, his family's
savings and his good name _ all for the sake of a painting that may
or may not be a long-lost Bruegel. It is a story that enables Frayn
to showcase his own gift for satiric farce while re-examining one
of his favorite themes: namely, people's tendency to impose their
own ideas and preoccupations on the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   Reliving the events that changed his life, Frayn's narrator _ a
philosophy professor named Martin Clay who bears more than a
passing resemblance to the self-aggrandizing scholar in the
author's 1990 novel, ``The Trick of It'' _ recounts his story in
the present tense, allowing events to unfurl as they occurred, and
``explaining exactly what I thought as I thought it'' without ``the
distortions of hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   This technique, combined with Martin's confession that he is
afraid of emerging from the story as ``an object of outrage and
horror,'' lends the story a powerful undertow of suspense, even as
it teases the reader into sharing Martin's blindered point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and his wife, Kate, we learn, have left London for an
extended sojourn at their country house with their infant daughter,
Tilda. Kate has taken some time off from her job as an art
historian, while Martin is supposed to be finishing a book about
``the impact of nominalism on Netherlandish art of the 15th
century.'' Their pastoral idyll is abruptly interrupted, however,
when one of their neighbors, a blustering local named Tony Churt,
invites them over for dinner and asks their opinion of several
paintings he wants to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The first painting _ and the one Tony is most eager to get
appraised _ is a gigantic rendering of the abduction of Helen of
Troy, by an Italian artist named Giordano. The second and third are
17th-century Dutch pictorials. The fourth is _ or appears to
Martin, to be _ a genuine Bruegel. Not just any Bruegel, but the
long-missing sixth panel from the Flemish painter's famous 1565
``Seasons'' series _ a painting that would not only make its owner
a wealthy man, but also bring accolades from the art world for
uncovering one of history's most elusive treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas Martin glimpses in Tony's breakfast room is titled
``Pretmakers in een Berglandschap'' (that is, ``Merrymakers in a
Mountain Landscape'') and depicts a springtime landscape: a group
of Bruegelesque peasants perform a heavy, clumping dance in one
corner while a thickset man courts his beloved in another. Martin
is stunned by what he sees, but instead of telling Tony of his
suspicions, he invents a byzantine plot for taking possession of
the painting himself. He rationalizes his unscrupulous plan by
telling himself that the boorish Tony could never appreciate the
magnitude of his find, and he vows to give Tony ``a lesson in the
gentlemanly attributes of ruthlessness and style.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's plot for gaining ownership of ``Pretmakers'' involves
finding a phony buyer for the Giordano canvas and then casually
telling Tony that this buyer would like to purchase the other three
paintings as well. It will mean raising some 100,000 pounds,
finding a genuine buyer for the Giordano and then concocting a
diplomatic mechanism for revealing the Bruegel to the world. When
Martin tells Kate about his discovery, she is duly skeptical, and
he promises her that he will find some way to verify the painting's
authenticity before putting the family's finances on the line.
</P>
<P>
   So Martin immerses himself in Bruegel research, reading
everything he can find about the painter's life and work. Frayn
artfully orchestrates this research, giving the reader a
fascinating tour through the intellectual thickets of Bruegel
scholarship while persuading us to share Martin's growing
conviction that he has found the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Frayn also shows us how easily the eager Martin _
who, like so many of the author's earlier characters, is intent on
finding a way to order the messy world around him _ allows his
speculative fantasies to run away with him, and how he uses all his
intellectual resources to make his research fit ``his'' painting.
At the same time, Frayn draws subtle parallels between Martin and
his world, and the lives depicted in Bruegel's paintings: Martin,
he suggests, may be headed, like Icarus, for a fatal fall, while
Tony Churt recalls all those Bruegel peasants who seem oblivious to
the calamities around them.
</P>
<P>
   While one of the pleasures of this book certainly lies in
Frayn's deft sendup of pompous academics, the novel also delivers
humor of a less cerebral kind. Frayn cleverly builds the clockwork
mechanism of farce _ showcased so brilliantly in his 1983 Broadway
hit, ``Noises Off'' _ into the story of ``Headlong,'' piling one
misunderstanding and complication upon the next to plunge Martin
into a snowballing comedy of errors.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's discovery that Tony is trying to get him to sell his
paintings as a tax dodge; his realization that Tony's wife, Laura,
has mistaken his interest in the paintings for a romantic interest
in her, and his growing antipathy toward Kate for involving one of
her art historian colleagues in his scheme _ each of these
developments will contribute to the explosive conclusion of this
novel, a novel that turns out to be as entertaining as it is
intelligent, as stimulating as it is funny.

SONGWRITER ADAPTS HIT - LADEN MOVIE INTO STAGE SHOW

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Meeting Dean Pitchford at his impeccably appointed
Hollywood Hills home, you may wonder: Is this a middle-aged
all-American boy, or a 40-something rebel with a cause?
</P>
<P>
   You detect a hard-driving, aggressive streak behind Pitchford's
graceful smile and charm-school manners. There's a steadiness in
his storm-gray eyes that says, ``I may be nice, but I'm no
pushover.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you remember that this is the guy who once wrote, in all
innocence and good faith, the following lyrics:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
(ITALICS) &LR; Cut loose, Footloose &QL; 
Kick off your Sunday shoes. &QL; 
Please, Louise &QL; 
Pull me off of my knees. &QL; 
Jack, get back &QL; 
Come on before we crack. &QL; 
Loose your blues &QL; 
Everybody cut Footloose! &UR; (ITALICS END) &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
James Dean, or Andy Hardy? Or perhaps Kevin Bacon? Who better,
after all, than the intense and boyishly likable Bacon to portray
the intense, boyishly likable Pitchford, the guiding creative force
behind ``Footloose,'' that hip-swiveling slice of Reagan-era
optimism?
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, those familiar lyrics will be sung by Joe Machota in
the touring production of the live stage version of ``Footloose,''
which is opening a two-week engagement at the Pantages Theatre in
Hollywood. With the blessing of Pitchford, who penned nine new
songs for the show, ``Footloose'' has been reborn as an acrobatic
Broadway musical directed by Walter Bobbie, who helmed the recent
acclaimed revival of ``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the stage version has logged nearly 400 performances on
Broadway, while the touring production has been drawing stronger
notices than the show did in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway show closely follows the 1984 movie version of
``Footloose,'' in which Bacon portrayed a hip city kid transplanted
to a hick town where dancing has been banned. After several run-ins
with the local hellfire minister, played by John Lithgow, Bacon's
character converts his classmates and soon has the entire town
shaking its collective Midwestern tail-feather.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Footloose'' soundtrack, which teamed Pitchford with seven
composers, including Michael Gore, Kenny Loggins, Tom Snow, Sammy
Hagar and Eric Carmen, spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard
Albums chart. It went on to sell more than 16 million copies
worldwide and yielded six Top 40 hits, including the title track,
``Let's Hear It for the Boy,'' ``Almost Paradise,'' ``I'm Free''
and ``Dancing in the Sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the house that `Footloose' bought,'' says Pitchford,
laughing, as he indicates the surrounding stylishness.
</P>
<P>
   Composer Snow, a friend and collaborator for 20 years, says
Pitchford's lyrics are what gave the ``Footloose'' soundtrack its
coherency and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I thought was his (Pitchford's) greatest achievement was
writing lyrics that could stand alone as a pop song,'' Snow says,
``and yet when you see the film, you realize it related to the
action without sort of breaking into `Oh, what a beautiful
morning!'''
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Footloose'' certified Pitchford as one of
Hollywood's hottest young songwriters of the 1980s. Four years
earlier, he had broken into the club with ``Fame,'' another kinetic
flick about gyrating adolescents, for which he supplied the lyrics
to Michael Gore's music.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although he wrote both the lyrics and screenplay for
``Footloose,'' Pitchford says it didn't occur to him at the time
that there were autobiographical elements in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year after the movie came out, somebody pointed out to me
that this was my life's story,'' says Pitchford, settling into a
pastel sofa. ``And I had no idea what they meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he concedes a few parallels between himself and his
restless hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' says Pitchford, who was born in Hawaii but
moved to Missouri when his parents, who'd split up a few years
earlier, tried to pull the family back together again by relocating
to the American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that any kid from a broken home, as you lose one
family and try to form another, there's a kind of desperation that
you might cover over with a kind of nonchalance,'' he continues.
``But there really is a kind of `Agghh! Where do I go next?' And
all of that eventually made its way into `Footloose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, if you will, the screen treatment for ``The Dean
Pitchford Story'':
</P>
<P>
   A whip-smart kid from Honolulu gets plunked down in Kansas City,
circa 1968. Feeling like a tropical fish in a cornfield, he does
his gosh-darnedest to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   He joins the pep squad, the speech club and the student council.
He writes poetry for the school literary magazine. He allies
himself with any number of cliques, as if to say, ``See? I'm one of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Through hard work, rah-rah spirit and a chameleonlike eagerness
to please, he helps set the school dancing to his own uptempo
rhythms. Pitchford is the type of kid your parents
asked!ital!you!off! to invite over, ``instead of that rough crowd
you're always hanging out with.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he graduates near the top of his class and
heads off to major in English at Yale. But his plans take a sudden
swerve when he goes to New York City, auditions for a barely
heard-of Broadway musical called ``Godspell,'' and gets cast. At
age 19!
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, he's living in Manhattan, commuting to New Haven by
train at 6:40 in the morning and taking classes until 2:30 p.m.
before hopping a train back to New York, catching a short backstage
nap and performing in ``Godspell.'' Then getting up the next day
and doing the same thing all over again.
</P>
<P>
   And loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I was living some kind of exotic movie that
I'd seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, with an Oscar, a Golden Globe Award and two
Grammy nominations under his belt, Pitchford is a seasoned
entertainment pro with a lengthy track record in writing songs and
screenplays for film and television. He also has a directing career
that's been steadily gaining momentum, with several current
projects in various phases of development.
</P>
<P>
   He has written or co-written pop, dance and country hits for
some of the recording industry's biggest stars, such as Melissa
Manchester (``You Should Hear How She Talks About You''), Dolly
Parton (``Don't Call It Love'') and Whitney Houston (``All the Man
That I Need'').
</P>
<P>
   Calvinistically hard-working, he has found time in between for
offbeat projects like the Royal Shakespeare Company production of
``Carrie,'' a 1988 musical version of the Brian De Palma horror
film. The show was a legendary Broadway bomb, closing after just
five performances. But it endures among cultists as an example of
the kind of envelope-pushing Broadway purports to want but seldom
manages to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career, if anything, has been indicative of somebody with
an attention-deficit disorder,'' Pitchford says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kept him balanced all these years, between the
frantic deadlines and the ego-driven stress of collaboration,
Pitchford replies with characteristic candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think 17 years of therapy. Also, I've been doing yoga
now for 11 years, and I've been doing meditation for six years. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing that grounded me was losing so many hundreds
of friends in the AIDS epidemic. On any number of projects I would
find myself in the throes of, `They want to change this line of my
lyrics,' and I'd be so caught up in it. And then I'd get word that
somebody was HIV-positive, or somebody was in the hospital, or
somebody had died. And everything that had loomed so large in my
life went ssssh-ooomp! and shrank down. It didn't happen just once
or twice or 20 or 50 times, it happened hundreds of times. And
after a while you kind of, like, get the message of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Snow agrees that the AIDS crisis altered his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a tempering of Dean,'' he says. ``He kind of
arrived in L.A. riding on the wave of `Fame,' and an Oscar, and
everything he touched turned to gold. It's even embodied in the
lyric of `Fame': `I'm going to live forever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that happen, and they're terribly sad and
tragic, but they temper a person. I've really seen him go full
circle, and I admire what he's done with his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchford says he ``had to be dragged kicking and screaming'' to
revisit ``Footloose'' after putting it away so long ago. It was
Carol Schwartz, wife of ``Godspell'' author and longtime friend
Stephen Schwartz, who convinced Pitchford to adapt the movie,
arguing that high school performers needed more shows with
uplifting messages that allowed them to play characters their own
age.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchford believes that the stage version is better than the
movie, in part because it gives a fuller account of the central
clash between the minister and the juvenile protagonist. He says he
appreciated having the chance to flesh out the secondary characters
and ``to populate a town.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Pitchford says, the story of ``Footloose'' is a
simple one.
</P>
<P>
   As simple, at any rate, as any boy's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember it as a big hit, but it's a small story,'' he
says. ``It was just a small movie. It was made for $8 million! It's
a little, tiny slice of humanity.'' &QL;

WHEN THE FACE IN THE CROWD IS GRANDMOTHERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ At his sellout Tanglewood concerts over the July
4 weekend, James Taylor, crooning ``Sweet Baby James,'' whisked his
audience back to the mellow 1960s and '70s, when the Berkshire
Mountains were a magnet for young vagabonds craving music and the
other arts in rustic surroundings:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the first of December was covered with snow
</P>
<P>
   And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that
frosting,
</P>
<P>
   With 10 miles behind me and 10,000 more to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As they looked around, more than a few of those squeezed into
the middle-aged mosh pit at the foot of the stage or sprawled on
Tanglewood's plush lawns must have wondered where were the legions
of the young _ vagabonds or simply weekenders _ who gave the
Berkshires much of their coltish spirit in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Taylor is now 51 and most of his longtime fans are
lawyers, managers and entrepreneurs _ people who, if they do wander
about, do so in Lexuses and Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that at all the locales that have made the
Berkshires an unrivaled summer paradise for culture seekers _ at
Tanglewood's classical concerts, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival,
the Berkshire Theater Festival, the museums _ the crowd is even
further along in years.
</P>
<P>
   These serene hills are increasingly populated by lifelong
followers of music and theater who started traveling here from New
York or Boston a generation ago but are now gray-haired second-home
owners and Florida snowbirds who summer in the condominiums that
sprouted in the Berkshires in the 1980s. Young visitors seem to
have become an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said to me the other day, `Look at all the old
folks,''' said Murray Katz, a retired New York controller who has a
Stockbridge condo. ```This is turning out to be an old folks'
home.'''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Natalie, was exaggerating for effect, but surveys
taken by the area's worried cultural institutions show that the
summertime population is definitely skewed toward the older age
group.
</P>
<P>
   Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
found that 64 percent of its ticket buyers were over 55 and only 10
percent under 30. At Jacob's Pillow, 63 percent of the audience is
over 50 and only 12 percent under 35.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics for decades past are hard to come by _ Tanglewood did
not conduct demographic surveys in years past _ but local cultural
managers and tourism officials say they are struck by the age
change in their audiences, even if those audiences are growing.
</P>
<P>
   The concern here is not for this summer or next; with the
economy stubbornly robust, the stages and concert halls have drawn
record crowds.
</P>
<P>
   But the cultural managers are doing some deep soul-searching
about why young people are no longer coming in droves, and they are
thrashing about for inventive ways to lure them.
</P>
<P>
   While the managers love the financial support that older
attendees bring in, they worry that a scarcity of young people now
could jeopardize the size of audiences 20 years into the future,
and more immediately, sour the artists whose enthusiasm thrives on
looking out at a varied crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like biodiversity,'' said Ella Baff, executive
director of Jacob's Pillow. ``It's a healthier planet if you have
more species. I can say the same about audience development.''
</P>
<P>
   While the graying of the audience for so-called highbrow culture
is a much remarked phenomenon, the street scene in the Berkshires
shows how these changes affect the personality of a region. On the
picturesque sidewalks of Lenox and Stockbridge and at popular
dining spots like the folksy Carol's and the more decorous Red Lion
Inn, young couples have been replaced by middle-aged or older
foursomes.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkshires, which Arlo Guthrie helped make famous with his
droll tribute to Alice's Restaurant (where you can get anything you
want, 'cepting Alice), are now a place where a Sophie Tucker
imitator can put on 10 shows and know they will be well attended.
</P>
<P>
   An even starker emblem of the changing demographics is what
happened to the legendary Music Inn, where budding singers like
Joan Baez, Carly Simon, Don McLean and Bruce Springsteen
entertained swarms of sybaritic flower children. Its site at the
Stockbridge Bowl is now a complex of 72 condominiums averaging
$400,000 in price and owned by retirees like the Katzes.
</P>
<P>
   Only Great Barrington, a once gritty town that has been
gentrified with cosmopolitan restaurants, seems to have a youth
scene, mostly of local teen-agers who loiter in front of the shops
on Railroad Street until the police, worried about staider
tourists, chase them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard being this age in this town,'' said Bessie
Cherry, a 19-year-old waitress at the Helsinki Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baff and other institutional managers offer a number of
reasons that many young people spurn the Berkshires. ``I think a
lot of it has to do with money,'' Ms. Baff said. ``It is expensive
to buy a house here. It is expensive to rent a house here. It is
expensive to stay at a bed and breakfast. You have to have a
certain amount of disposable income to participate in the leisure
and cultural life of the Berkshires.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer rentals range from $3,500 to $8,000 a month, and official
bed and breakfasts start at $125 a night. The cultural institutions
whose high quality and variety have given the Berkshires a
summertime flavor that is found nowhere else in the country
contribute to the expense. Front-row seats in Tanglewood's music
shed are $74, though admission to the lawn is $13.50. Jacob's
Pillow prices range from $35 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   Although Berkshire County's year-round population of 140,000 has
always been heavily working-class and middle-class _ Pittsfield was
until recent years a leading manufacturing center for General
Electric _ affluence streamed in with the proliferation of
condominiums and second homes in the 1980s. Even many of the
drifters of the 1970s settled in to become prosperous artisans and
shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of places like this start with the hippies, then the
shrewd, the sun-tanned, and finally the wealth comes,'' said George
Wislocki, president of the Berkshires National Resources Defense
Council, an environmental group.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Hamptons, in New York, are far more expensive as a
summertime getaway, but they have always had one irresistible
attraction for the young _ miles of beaches for surfing and body
flashing. The Berkshires, with their lakeside slivers of beach,
have had to compete by offering a quieter cultural cornucopia. Loud
behavior in these surroundings would be as gauche as interrupting
the playing of a string quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different tribe here,'' said Ariel Orr Jordan, a
52-year-old psychotherapist pecking away on his laptop on the porch
of the Red Lion. ``You associate the Berkshires with laid-back
Norman Rockwell country. In the Hamptons the tribe is very
narcissistic. It's all about showing yourself, a peacockery culture
_ the absolute manifestation of the pre-eminent religion in the
United States _ the religion of looking good. In the Hamptons you
shop and you show up. Here you can't shop, and there's no place to
show up.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a more insidious reason for the Berkshires' difficulty
in luring the young, one that echoes what is happening to the
audience for traditional culture across America. The most common
factor in determining who attends Tanglewood ``is not age or
affluence,'' said Mark Volpe, managing director of the Boston
Symphony. ``It's primarily whether they've been exposed to school
music programs, and whether they've had music in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks over the last two decades in federal and local
financing for music, art, drama and dance programs in schools have
produced a generation less versed in and intrigued by offerings
like classical music and theater.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who is 41, remembered that his high school in Minneapolis
had two orchestras and five bands when he attended. It is now down
to two bands. Others lament the demise of television variety
programs like ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' that once introduced young
viewers to ballet and opera with palatable morsels in between the
circus acts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the cultural institutions know that
something needs to be done, but done carefully. They do not want to
alienate their core older supporters and donors, but at the same
time they know they need to cultivate future consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So they have begun taking carefully calibrated gambles, like
Jacob's Pillow's occasional scheduling of more accessible folk
dances or the Web site that Tanglewood has set up to make ordering
tickets easier for computer users, who tend to be younger.
</P>
<P>
   At the Berkshire Theater Festival, Edwin Jaffe, a retired
manufacturer, and his wife, Lola, are paying for 80 local high
school students to see the season's four different plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing down the age,'' Jaffe joked as he watched his
proteges march in for a performance of a Joan Ackermann play, ``The
Batting Cage.''
</P>
<P>
   TDK, the audiotape manufacturer, pays for free Tanglewood
tickets for children. This season more than 10,000 children have
attended, bringing along their relatively young paying parents.
Julianne Boyd, the artistic director of the Berkshire Stage, a
5-year-old company whose recent production of the musical ``Mack
and Mabel'' was well received, lures young parents by operating a
nursery for two performances a week.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Boyd's long-term strategies is staging separate,
leaner productions in the Sheffield high school cafeteria, using
local teen-agers or actors in combination with professional
directors and choreographers. Not only do the four-week runs train
the youngsters in stage discipline, but they cultivate young
audiences as well. The group's production of the musical ``Grease''
has played to sold-out, markedly younger houses.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with young people indicate that the Berkshire
cultural groups may have to try a lot harder. Leigh Marchione, a
21-year-old shop clerk in Great Barrington, said that tickets to
shows she would have loved to see, like Gwyneth Paltrow in ``As You
Like It'' at the Williamstown Theater Festival, were snapped up by
subscribers or seasoned ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Braun, a 17-year-old piano student at the Tanglewood
Institute, the Boston Symphony's school for high-school-age
musicians, wonders why more pieces by modern composers like Bartok
are not mixed in with the standard symphonic warhorses at
Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Rogovoy, pop music critic of The Berkshire Eagle, thinks
Tanglewood and other stages should consider more adventurous
popular programming as well, perhaps not a rap group like Limp
Bizkit, whose audience might be rough on the grounds, but a gentler
act like Alanis Morissette that could draw young listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural institutions seem to be myopic in their catering
to an older audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many here hope that last season may have marked the peak of the
graying curve. Dave Rothstein, who owned the Music Inn until it
closed in 1979 amid local complaints about rowdy, drugged-out
spectators, said he has been heartened by reggae and folk-music
concerts at the Butternut ski basin in Great Barrington and by a
proliferation of new jazz and rock bars.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Maguire, producing director of the Berkshire Theater
Festival, said that when she saw the festival's production of the
Orson Welles play ``Moby Dick _ Rehearsed,'' during its closing
week, ``my insides did a belly flop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around and the audience was young _ 30 to 40 years
old _ and their hair was a lot longer and they had a lot of it,''
she said. ``And I said: `My goodness. This is a huge transition.'''

 &HT;    Museum holds nuts and bolts of Home Depot history
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With two decades of home improvement under its belt,
Home Depot lately has been drilling its history into the minds of
anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   The nostalgia rolled out this spring with ``Built from
Scratch,'' a tell-(almost)-all by co-founders Bernie Marcus and
Arthur Blank.
</P>
<P>
   And now there's the Legend, a new company museum at Home Depot's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The museum opens Wednesday, in time for the home improvement
retailer's 20th anniversary celebration. About 4,000 managers are
expected in Atlanta for the four-day meeting, which is to be equal
parts shop talk, pep rally and party.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the executives will tour the museum, which will be open
to employees and shareholders on an appointment-only basis. The $2
million museum was built as a training tool, not an attraction,
said Rob Hallam, director of internal communication and one of the
original designers of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to create the World of Coca-Cola here,''
Hallam said. ``The idea for an ongoing historical effort began 10
years ago as a way to preserve Home Depot's values.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees won't find ancient hacksaws or primitive hand tools in
the museum. The Legend is more like fancy Cliff Notes of the
company's biography, laid out in the framework of an unfinished
house. Displays are mounted on particle board with nuts and bolts.
In one room, a shower head serves as a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Packrat customers helped stock the artifact section. Thanks to a
shopper who recently brought in a 16-year-old can of paint to match
the color, Home Depot can show off its original ``Atlanta's
Finest'' brand. (The can still had wet paint in it, company
historian Nancy Beliveau proudly noted.)
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of the 2,700-square-foot museum is of Home
Depot's history. The rest is an overview of the company operations
in sectors, including marketing and community affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies start spinning their corporate lore after 50
years or so in the business. While Home Depot's scrapbook is
relatively young, it's packed with milestones already, said Dick
Hammill, senior vice president of marketing and communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dynamic growth of the company, the headlines we've
made and our financial success gave us license to open a museum,''
Hammill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies wouldn't have that much to talk about after 20
years.
</P>

ARTS ABROAD: FROM HOMELESS TO HOUSE-PROUD: BRAZIL'S `OTHER' MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ It was logical and fitting that when the Sao
Paulo State Symphony Orchestra inaugurated its striking new concert
hall here in July, the centerpiece of the debut program was
Mahler's Second Symphony. That work, after all, is known as the
``Resurrection,'' and both the Sala Sao Paulo and the orchestra
that now resides there were celebrating a rise from the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago the orchestra, founded in 1953, was
practically homeless. At one point its 97 members were reduced to
rehearsing in a school auditorium, their schedule dependent on the
willingness of the school's principal and parent-teacher
association to make space available.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the government of Brazil's most important
state began an effort to persuade John Neschling, a Brazilian
conductor living in Switzerland, to lead the orchestra. Initially
reluctant, he acquiesced in 1997 only after the authorities agreed
to a series of basic conditions, one of which was a permanent home
for the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating doubts about selling such a project, Neschling, 52,
took an approach calculated to appeal to Brazilian sensibilities,
urging officials to consider ``what happens to a good soccer team
if it doesn't have a stadium,'' as the maestro recalled in an
interview here early this month. ``It made them understand we
needed a place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   That place turned out to be a cavernous abandoned train station
on the faded outskirts of downtown that was designed in Louis XVI
style in the 1920s. The choice may have seemed odd, but when the
American acoustic consultant Russell Johnson arrived to supervise
the project, he quickly discovered that the dimensions and
characteristics of the station lent themselves to the ambitious
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``More or less by accident, the original architect made this
mammoth waiting room almost the same length and width as a handful
of the great old concert halls in Europe,'' Johnson said in a
telephone interview from New York City, where his company, Artec
Consultants, is based. ``And of course it has plenty of height,
which enabled us to put in a ceiling that goes up and down, so we
can adjust the acoustics of the room to the events going on
onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   This all resulted in a 1,509-seat hall whose most innovative
feature is its flexible ceiling, composed of 15 motorized and
individually controlled panels whose position can be changed in
minutes. A new rear balcony and boxes seating spectators except
when a choir is required were installed around and behind the main
stage without disturbing the 32 imposing Greek columns that remain
the hall's most distinctive visual attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The revamped building also has ample rehearsal rooms and a
recording studio. Work has begun on a documentation center and
archives devoted to Brazilian composers of the 19th century and
earlier, including Carlos Gomes and a group of largely forgotten
mulatto musicians of the 18th century described by Neschling as
``liberated slaves who wrote first-class music, church choirs and
Te Deums.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil has always been a very musical nation, building
a top-flight orchestra was a huge challenge: Even though it seems
as if every one of the country's 165 million people plays an
instrument or sings, the musical energies are directed almost
exclusively at popular music, not the classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to convince people that classical music is part of the
musical expression of a country anywhere in the world,'' Neschling
said. ``I had to remind people that the language of the classics is
as important as the language of pop and that Brazil had this
language for three centuries but forgot it.'' As a composer he
wrote the scores for such films as ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and
``Pixote.''
</P>
<P>
   For state officials who provided $35 million for the renovation,
the hall is a symbol of even grander aspirations. Sao Paulo is
Brazil's richest and largest city and state, with 18 million people
in the metropolitan area and 16 million in the interior. It is an
industrial, financial and agricultural powerhouse that in the words
of Rodolfo Konder, the municipal secretary of culture, yearns to be
recognized as ``a world-class city.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has been regarded as the country's foremost cultural
center since at least 1922, when the series of exhibitions and
seminars known as Modern Art Week established a national agenda for
literature, art and music for decades to come. Abroad, however, Sao
Paulo has always been overshadowed by its flashier, more exotic and
better-known rival 200 miles to the east, Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos Mendonca, secretary of culture for Sao Paulo state, said:
``We want to transform the city's image so that it is not only a
great economic center but has an intense cultural life. We want
people to come not just to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract local audiences that do not normally attend symphony
concerts, ticket prices have been kept low, with the best seats
selling for just over $10. The city and state have also sought to
encourage private sector support for their plans with tax laws that
offer rebates to companies contributing to the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the state and city authorities envision the project here
as the anchor of a much larger complex of museums and galleries.
Next door, for instance, the headquarters of the political police
during military rule from 1964 to 1985 are being converted into a
conservatory and theater, though Mendonca promised that ``a few of
the cells where prisoners were held will be preserved for
historical reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Neschling and state officials are clearly looking forward to
presenting his orchestra to audiences abroad and showing off the
hall's acoustics to visiting foreign orchestras. ``There is a
circuit, and I want us to be on it,'' said Neschling, a Brazilian
who was born and reared in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo State Orchestra plans to tour Latin America in
2001 and Europe in 2002. Performances at the Sala Sao Paulo by the
Vienna and Royal Philharmonic Orchestras are scheduled this year,
and the Berlin and Chicago orchestras are due here in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the auditorium ``may turn out to be one of the
really top-flight concert halls anywhere in the world acoustically,
including in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians who play here regularly seem to agree. Darrin Milling,
a bass trombonist who is one of several Americans and Russians
Neschling has recruited for the orchestra, said, ``What is truly
unique and a great advantage with this hall is the ability you have
to tailor the acoustics to the audience and the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit there in amazement that I am playing in one of the best
concert halls in the world,'' added Milling, 31, who has performed
with the Philadelphia and New World Symphonies. ``I've played in
places like Cologne and at the Kennedy Center, and for me, this is
the dream gig.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the infusion of foreigners, the reshaped
orchestra includes 16 Brazilians who had been playing in orchestras
in Europe or the United States but who welcomed an opportunity to
come home. Neschling maintains that his ensemble is already ``one
of the 50 best in the world'' and, aiming high, cites the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner as its model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sao Paulo is not less important than Chicago,'' he said. ``So
why not have an orchestra like Chicago?''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A Cabinet minister asserted Monday that the
government's response to last week's earthquake was ``a declaration
of bankruptcy for the Turkish political and economic system.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu was a sharp
departure from the defensive tone that officials had been using.
His comments, and others Monday, suggested that at least some
senior political leaders share the bitterness and anger felt by
many earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``All ideological arguments were flattened by the earthquake,''
Mumcu said in a speech in Ankara. ``Lying under the ruins is the
Turkish political and administrative system.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Parliament from a district near the earthquake zone,
Ibrahim Yasar, was equally forceful in expressing frustration with
the government's response to the quake, which has been widely
criticized as slow and disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying that the civil defense organization
collapsed,'' Yasar said. ``It did not exist. I saw that there was
not the slightest bit of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even President Suleyman Demirel, who telephoned a newspaper
editor during the weekend to complain about what he said was
negative coverage of the government's relief effort, seemed
chastened Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell my people that there will be better
coordination among state institutions,'' a grim-looking Demirel
said after emerging from a meeting with seismologists in Istanbul.
``Foundations of buildings will be reviewed. We will follow
movements under the earth more carefully. We will build structures
that can resist earthquakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirel rarely apologizes for anything, and usually portrays the
Turkish state as sacred and all but infallible. His customary
attitude reflects a widespread sense among Turks that attacking
government institutions is dangerous and unwise. Among political
and military leaders in general, self-criticism is an exceedingly
rare quality.
</P>
<P>
   The government's faltering response to the quake has infuriated
many Turks. More than a few victims seem to have lost much of their
respect for the ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I have seen such rage against the state
and politicians,'' one news commentator wrote in a column Monday.
Another wrote: ``It is very clear that after this earthquake,
Turkey will never again be the same. The millennium came to Turkey
a year before other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all government officials have softened their views.
Health Minister Osman Durmus has ridiculed those who have called
for his resignation because of positions he has taken in the days
since the earthquake last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Durmus, a member of the right-wing Nationalist Action Party, has
asserted that Turkey does not need medical aid from the United
States, that Turks should not accept blood donated by Greeks, that
sending portable toilets to the earthquake zone was unnecessary
because there were sanitary facilities in many mosques and that
foreigners should not be allowed to deliver relief aid because they
``do not suit our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He also scorned Turkish volunteer groups that appeared in
devastated towns long before government workers, saying they were
``putting on a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with growing calls for his resignation, including one in a
newspaper editorial headlined ``Shut Up and Go,'' Durmus replied at
a news conference Monday, ``I take being called ignorant and racist
as a compliment, and thank them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest death toll from the quake, reported Monday by the
official crisis center, was 12,148. One U.N. official in Geneva
said he had received a message from the Turkish government on
Sunday night asking for help in obtaining 45,000 body bags,
suggesting that officials fear the toll could rise much higher.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In what some relief workers described as a near-miracle, Turkish
and Israeli teams found a 3-year-old boy Monday beneath the
wreckage of his home in the hard-hit town of Cinarcik. He was
rescued at midmorning after having survived for six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Turkish team discovered him, and they screamed for us to
come and help,'' one of the Israeli rescuers, Noam Amit, said in an
interview with Israel Radio. ``We heard the baby calling out, and
then we called back through a hole in the rubble. The Turkish team
called out to him in Turkish to come closer to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The child, identified by the Israeli army as Ismail Cimen, was
rushed to a hospital in Istanbul and was expected to survive.
Rescue specialists said small children can sometimes survive under
rubble longer than adults because they dehydrate less quickly and
need less air and space.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish military, which has been criticized for reacting too
slowly to the quake, continued to expand its role Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hayri Kivrikoglu, a senior commander assigned to help
direct military operations in the disaster area, said troops would
set up 500 tents in the devastated area each day for the next 10
days. He said every site would be equipped with running water,
toilets, electricity and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large extent, the search and rescue operations have now
ceased,'' Kivrikoglu said. ``There are cases of theft, but we have
increased guard and patrol duties. We are not allowing people to
wander the streets after midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain fell on parts of the earthquake zone Monday, creating
new health problems in towns where sewage systems have been
destroyed. Doctors and medical technicians were told to watch for
signs of epidemic disease, but have found none yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The correct response is the provision of clean water,'' said
Erik Noji, an official of the World Health Organization, ``and
there is plenty of clean water there.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that Aug. 30, a national holiday that
celebrates a key victory in Turkey's independence war, would be
celebrated this year as a day of commemoration for earthquake
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The interior ministry ordered night clubs to control the volume
of their music for the next 45 days, and to avoid creating ``the
image that there is a great deal of enjoyment or entertainment.''

FRANCE'S GREEN PARTY PUSHES JOSPIN ON NUCLEAR POWER POLICY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's Green Party, emboldened by a good showing in
the European parliamentary elections, has threatened to pull out of
the government coalition if Prime Minister Lionel Jospin approves a
new generation of nuclear power stations to replace old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, who joined Jospin's minority government in 1997,
have always insisted that the nuclear energy issue is at the center
of their policy concerns. But even though the Green leader,
Dominique Voynet, serves as environment minister, the party says it
is being ignored on vital questions inside the government
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The issue at hand is the coming debate on the future of France's
energy policy. Its central question is whether France will reduce
its dependence on nuclear energy and turn to other sources.
France's 57 nuclear reactors provide the country with 78 percent of
its energy, one of the highest rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But as those plants become obsolete in the coming years, France
will face the choice of phasing them out or replacing them with a
new type, the so-called European Pressurized Reactors. These
reactors, developed in a Franco-German project, are expected to be
ready to go into operation around 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-nuclear campaign planned in France may cause some
turbulence, but even if the Greens walk out this is not likely to
threaten the fate of the government coalition, which includes the
Communists and would still retain its majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   As Greens have elsewhere in Europe, those in France have
strongly campaigned against nuclear energy, and they say a straight
replacement plan is not acceptable. They insist they cannot
compromise on this point, which they see as a cornerstone of their
agreement with the Socialists before joining the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fundamental question for us,'' said Denis Baupin,
the Green Party spokesman. ``Do we replace the decommissioned
plants with new ones or do we start to opt out of nuclear energy,
like Belgium and Germany? If the decision is for new plants, we
will pull out of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure they will be heard, the Greens say they are
planning a series of protests against nuclear power _ matching the
campaign of Germany's Greens, who have been pressuring the
government of Gerhard Schroeder to phase out nuclear energy use
more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The French environmentalists see the experience of their German
counterparts as a warning sign. German Greens have become angry and
frustrated as Schroeder's promised effort to shut down nuclear
power stations has stalled after pressure from business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say privately that an informal consensus is forming
that France will reduce, though not abolish, its nuclear power
stations. They say that if the matter heats up, the government can
afford to postpone any key decisions until after the presidential
elections of 2002 _ for which the Socialists want to keep the
Greens as allies.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension over the issue underscores the rising influence
of the Green movement here. After long seeming indifferent to
environmental questions, France is now among the European countries
where Greens have gained support and moved from the political
fringes closer to the center of power.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists currently hold Cabinet posts in half a dozen
European governments, including France's. As their neighbors fared
better, France's Greens had remained marginal in political life
because of in-fighting and splits over ideology. But their position
improved after Mrs. Voynet took charge in 1993. Among other
changes, she allied the Greens with the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   But unexpected success came in the June European Parliamentary
elections, when the Greens vote surged to close to 10 percent from
less than 3 percent in the last European election, in 1994. In the
Paris area alone, the Greens scored almost 20 percent. This has
prompted them to fight for greater influence in future local
elections.
</P>
<P>
   They have been taken aback to discover that their new popularity
does not translate automatically into more political clout. Mrs.
Voynet and other party members have said that their 10 percent vote
should have earned them more seats in the Cabinet than the single
one they now have. Party leaders also sound clearly frustrated that
they apparently have not gained greater say over key policy
decisions. Rather they feel rebuffed by Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they appear more determined than before to stand
their ground, and fight, if the nuclear energy debate gets under
way in the coming months.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tsk, tsk. Such howls of outrage. The sedate
coronation may be off. We seem to be in an untidy Republican
presidential campaign brawl after all.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is _ horrors _ being picked on by the
nasty, inconsiderate press. We have discovered he's not perfect!
</P>
<P>
   He got into trouble for sounding oddly evasive about possible
youthful experimentation with cocaine. Bush's weaseling triggered
all sorts of bad memories of President Clinton's habit of
half-truths, obfuscations and glib distortions when confronted with
allegations of embarrassing conduct that often turned out to be
true.
</P>
<P>
   And the treatment of Clinton has set the standard by which all
subsequent presidential candidates will be judged. It is a ruthless
measure, applied unmercifully.
</P>
<P>
   After years of unprecedented scrutiny, Clinton has been stripped
of virtually all privacy, his most tawdry secrets exposed for the
world to see. It is not a pretty sight. He has been accused of
everything from rape to obstruction of justice. He admitted lying
about illicit affairs and was fined for contempt of court and
mocked for claiming not to have inhaled when he tried marijuana as
a student.
</P>
<P>
   All presidents fib when it suits them, but Clinton's fibs seemed
swollen with evil portent for the future. Every small misstep, past
and present, became grist for suspicions about a permanent, deep
character flaw making him unsuitable for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has survived. A majority of voters still approve of the
job he is doing although they don't approve of his personal
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as we know, Bush has led a more exemplary private life
than Clinton over the last two decades. (They are both 53, baby
boomers who are products of the tumultuous '60s.)
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's peculiar performance when confronted with
increasingly specific questions about using cocaine, a felony in
many states, has made him suddenly vulnerable to suspicions that he
is hiding something. The character issue comes in many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bush admits to being ``reckless'' in his youth, drinking and
partying too much, but says that he has grown up and now minds his
manners. He has also admitted to premarital sex, although as
governor he promotes a campaign urging Texas youth to remain
virginal until they are in a ``Biblical marriage relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, declaring that he has been constantly faithful to his
wife, contrasts his marital fidelity to Clinton's promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's straightforward talk is unlikely to interfere
with his presidential ambitions. But it makes his bungling of the
drug issue all the more puzzling. Every other presidential
candidate has flatly denied ever taking cocaine or crack.
</P>
<P>
   Bush at first refused to answer but then last week allowed as
how he had been clean since the age of 28. Naturally, people wonder
what he was doing when he was 27 and younger. In this country, we
are regarded as adults at the age of 18, responsible for our own
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters claim that youthful indiscretions, whatever they
may be, are not relevant to his ability to lead the nation as
president. It was all too long ago. Oh? Clinton's marijuana episode
and maneuvers to duck the Vietnam draft at a similar age were
constantly cited as profoundly indicative of a permanently warped
moral code.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, if Bush snorted cocaine _ and there is no proof so
far that he did _ it was not just a sin, the word preferred by his
spin masters, but a crime. Bush says that what is important is
``who you are today, not who you were yesterday.'' But who he is
today is a vengeful governor unforgiving toward drug users,
insisting on harsh sentences and sending them to jail. He shows no
compassionate understanding for the mistakes of today's
``reckless'' youth. Into the slammer with them!
</P>
<P>
   So here we have once again the issue of hypocrisy. It's not just
Clinton and Democrats who love the old double standard. Republicans
too are happy to believe that others should do what they say, not
what they do. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, that philandering
champion of family values, is merely the latest example.
</P>
<P>
   The next we know, Laura Bush will tell TV interviewers it's all
a vast left-wing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the public doesn't seem to care. In a recent CNN-Time
magazine poll, 84 percent of those surveyed said that cocaine use
should not disqualify Bush from the presidency. This too may be a
legacy from Clinton. We are ashamed to confess how fascinated we
are by political dirty laundry and no longer shocked by misconduct
in high places.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's real problem comes from his GOP presidential rivals.
They sense their first opportunity to jostle him away from the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a presidential
longshot, set the tone by sternly lecturing Bush on the importance
of honesty just as he used to lecture Clinton. ``Questions that
involve a person's leadership potential, attitude toward
leadership, candidness, forthrightness, honesty, these questions
are legitimate and need to be answered,'' Hatch said. ``The problem
is the way it's been handled ... If there was (anything there), he
should answer it _ get it behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is on the right track. Voters may forgive all kinds of
wrongdoing by public figures, but what they really resent is being
deliberately deceived. It's patronizing. It's maddening. It's
dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has created a credibility crisis that can be resolved only
by telling us more about that misspent youth of his. Rumors are
already racing ahead of him, inventing purported new scandals that
point to a pattern of hypocrisy on many public and private issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't listen to Hatch, but Bush ought to. Speak up,
Governor.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ A dark cloud was spreading out against
the sky above John Crowther's house the other morning as he sat
alone on his porch, kicking a pile of sand at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   The cloud would burst _ it is the rainy season in this corner of
West Africa _ and Crowther, 68, could go inside his house. But that
would do no good. The house has no roof and few walls, just the
porch, a shack and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes last January, anti-government rebels burned
down the house in which Crowther had lived half his life and for
which he had saved for many years. They tried to chop off his head
with a machete, threatening to hurl his head into the same fire
that burned to death his sister and one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to forget, really, we just have to forget,''
Crowther said, even as he showed the gashes on his neck. ``Nothing
else. I have no power. Our leaders say we must forget. Am I going
to refuse our leaders? We just have to unite together and build the
country back up together. Finished, finished, that is all.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels who tried to decapitate Crowther, a former car
mechanic who now survives by crushing the remains of his house into
sand that he sells for 12 cents a bucket, were given amnesty under
a peace agreement signed in July between the Revolutionary United
Front and the government.
</P>
<P>
   The deal angered Mary Robinson, the U.N. human rights
commissioner, who described the atrocities committed here as worse
than those seen in Kosovo. The rebels killed or maimed thousands of
civilians, hacking limbs off scores of them.
</P>
<P>
   In few other places on earth have the ideals of justice and the
realities of an elusive peace clashed with such intensity as in
Sierra Leone, ravaged by eight years of an indiscriminately savage
civil war. The rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, escaped a death sentence
and was given the reins of a commission that will oversee the
country's rich mineral resources; his commanders will occupy four
top Cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atrocities reported in Sierra Leone are the worst
atrocities in recent years outside the genocide in Rwanda,'' said
Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of
Human Rights Watch, the New York-based organization that has been
one of the most vocal critics of the agreement. ``But this most
ruthless rebel group and its leaders have walked out with one of
the best deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, the United States and Britain, which oversaw
the peace talks, could have applied more pressure to get a tougher
deal against the rebels, Takirambudde said. ``Amnesty sends a
message both in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa that
atrocities can be committed without consequences,'' he said, adding
that similar deals in Angola have perpetuated an ever more brutal
war there.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the capital, Sierra Leoneans and foreigners alike
say such views overlook the prime importance of stopping the war
and ignore the hard political reality: that Sierra Leone remains
marginally significant, at best, to the international community.
What is more, the new civilian government in Nigeria, which has
been leading a West African force supporting the Sierra Leone
government, was eager to withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the government had been right in granting amnesty
to the rebels, Maj. Paul Aghimien, a spokesman here for the West
African force, smiled. ``When you are sick, you must take medicine
that is very, very bitter,'' said Aghimien, a Nigerian.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Crowther's neighborhood, Calaba Town, the residents all
express grudging support for the agreement. Calaba Town, on the
eastern outskirts of Freetown, appears to have been built over the
past three decades by people seeking cheaper and more spacious
land. In January, much of Calaba Town was destroyed when the rebels
tried to seize Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the people in Calaba Town are busy rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   From the money he has saved crushing his house to sand, Crowther
has built a concrete bed inside a shack that had escaped damage. He
would have preferred a bed made of wood, he said, but that was too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Up a hill, Saido Bangura, 32, a carpenter, was making a wooden
bed for someone able to afford one.
</P>
<P>
   ``By giving them amnesty,'' Bangura said, ``the rest we can
solve. We are going to support that. I will not be happy, but peace
is really the greatest achievement. I only want peace. Where there
is an atmosphere where people will not come and harm us, I can
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to a shed, Bangura was teaching two boys how to
make the bed frame. The pounding of a hammer punctuated the music
from a small radio that was playing ``Killing Me Softly'' by the
Fugees.
</P>
<P>
   Bangura rented two rooms from Saido Turay, 84, who had built
four houses on the flank of a hill over the years. The rebels had
made all but one uninhabitable. ``He cries every day,'' Bangura
said of his landlord.
</P>
<P>
   But Turay said he was ``very glad'' about the peace agreement.
Of the amnesty and punishment, he said, ``That is left to God.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Amado Sesay, 43, who was guarding his older
brother's burned-out house, put it this way: By insisting on
punishment, the government would simply prolong a war it could not
win. And the victims of mutilations, rapes and killings would
continue to be ordinary Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millionaires, when fighting comes, go away,'' Sesay said.
``I have nowhere to go. I need the peace for my land.''
</P>
<P>
   The cloud burst, finally. The rain fell so suddenly and
violently that people scattered for cover inside their broken
homes. The carpenter ducked under the shed, joining his two
apprentices, who kept working.
</P>
<P>
   The rain fell all over Calaba Town, perhaps even all over
Freetown, fell on the carpenter's shed with such clamor that it
drowned out the music from the radio, though not the pounding of
the hammer.

   At an oasis 230 miles southwest of Cairo, people in Roman times
lived well on the wealth they accumulated making wine from dates
and grapes. And in death, their bodies were prepared well for the
afterlife, mummified and fitted with elaborate masks and waistcoats
covered in gold.
</P>
<P>
   A vivid record of affluence, art and religion in Roman Egypt has
been preserved in a large 2,000-year-old cemetery at the Bahariya
Oasis, which came to light three years ago _ literally by accident.
A donkey being ridden on a dusty road stumbled, and its leg slipped
into an opening to one of the many tombs buried there under sand
and rock.
</P>
<P>
   After intensive excavations this year, Egyptian archeologists
have disclosed the first details of what they say is one of the
most spectacular discoveries in Egypt in recent decades. Detailed
pictures of the tombs and mummies are being published this week in
Archaeology, the magazine of the Archaeological Institute of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have such a number of mummies been found in a
single site in Egypt,'' Dr. Zahi Hawass, director of the Bahariya
excavations, said in an interview last week. He is Egypt's under
secretary of state for the Giza monuments, the pyramids near Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   In the four tombs so far explored, archeologists counted 105
mummies of men, women and children. Entire families appeared to be
together in repose. Some of the bodies were wrapped in plain linen,
but many were decorated with gilded masks and painted scenes on
cartonage, which is the pasteboard made of linen and papyrus that
served as mummy cases. No two mummy decorations were alike.
</P>
<P>
   Hawass said the cemetery site included many more multichambered
tombs and extended over more than two square miles. He estimated
that as many as 10,000 mummies might be uncovered at what is being
called the Valley of the Golden Mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Archaeology, Hawass described his first impressions
of the rows of mummies, many of them surrounded by pottery, amulets
and other grave goods. ``I could not believe that such beautiful
specimens existed,'' he said. ``The eyes of some gazed at me as if
they were alive.''
</P>
<P>
   His own eyes were drawn to the mummy of a woman, about 5 feet
tall, adorned with a crown with four decorative rows of red curls
and a gilded mask that extended over the chest to two circular
disks representing breasts. The decorations incorporated images of
cobras and the children of gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the hairstyle was clearly Roman, reminiscent of terra
cotta statues of the period,'' Hawass wrote, ``the iconography of
her mask, painted with deities that protected the deceased and ease
her passage into the afterlife, was pure Egyptian.''
</P>
<P>
   The team of archeologists said the mummies were remarkably well
preserved, with the smell of embalming resin still strong in the
tombs. But it appeared that the Romanized Egyptians applied less
effort on preparing the mummified body itself and more on exterior
decorations. The discovery provided new evidence that funerary
practices from the last thousand or so years of the pharaohs had
continued well into the second century A.D. The Roman rule of Egypt
began shortly before the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The art of mummy paintings, masks and other decorations in Roman
Egypt has been familiar to scholars for more than a century. In
1888, the British archeologist William Flinders Petrie found gilded
masks at a Roman-period cemetery. ``Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits
from Roman Egypt,'' a recent book published by the British Museum
in London, described the practice as being ``derived from pharaonic
traditions of belief, in which the mask served as a substitute for
the head of the deceased, endowing the individual with the
attributes of deities and thereby assisting his or her passage to
the afterlife.''
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptologists and other scholars said the new find promised
to yield important insights into the lives of affluent Romanized
Egyptians, their religious beliefs and funerary traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very exciting,'' Dr. Roger Bagnall, a
classics professor at Columbia University who specializes in
Egypt's Roman period, said of the prospects for gaining a better
understanding of Egyptian culture.
</P>
<P>
   As beautiful and interesting as the gilded artifacts were,
Bagnall said, he was more impressed by the sheer size and condition
of the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the largest known cemetery in Egypt that hasn't
been gotten to by plunderers before the archeologists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most celebrated Egyptian discoveries of this century _
the tomb of King Tutankhamen, opened in the 1920s, and the tomb of
the many sons of Ramses II, still being excavated _ were not
pristine sites. Looters had left their destructive marks and made
off with some of the artifacts. But no one seems to have touched
the new-found Bahariya tombs, and no modern community has risen on
the site to get in the way of excavations. For now, the tombs are
closed to the public and under guard.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Using new tools for pathological examinations, scientists should
be able to study the mummy skeletons for information on what the
people ate, the diseases they suffered and the causes of their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of mummies should provide better demographic
data, including estimates on infant and child mortality and life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture of the Bahariya tombs also intrigued scholars.
Hawass said the four explored tombs, cut into sandstone bedrock,
have somewhat distinctive styles, but have similar passages and
chambers. The entrance of a typical tomb was a hall about 8 feet
long. This led to a ``room of handing-over,'' where the family
would have delivered the mummy for transfer from the world of the
living to that of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that were the burial chambers carved from sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   The tombs generally had two chambers, each with several smaller
rooms where the mummies were laid out. One tomb had catacomblike
burial rooms, one above the other.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to one tomb was flanked by images of Anubis, the
god of embalming. Hawass said it was the first time he had seen
this.
</P>
<P>
   Though the mummies date to the first and second centuries A.D.,
Hawass said the site was probably a burial place from the time
Alexander the Great was in Egypt, in 322 B.C. A Hellenistic temple
stands near the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian archeologists described four general types of mummies
found at Bahariya. About 60 mummies excavated so far wear the
gilded masks. A second type is characterized by the head-to-waist
cartonage, which depicts scenes of various gods such as Isis,
Osiris and Toth, who sat in judgment of the deceased. A third type
of mummy has no decoration but is resting in a human-shaped pottery
coffin. Another type is covered entirely in linen, much as the
mummies were in the time of the pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   Bagnall of Columbia looked forward to comparing the new
discoveries with the mummies French archeologists have excavated in
recent decades at Douch, a former Roman military post 120 miles
west of Luxor on the Nile River. The funerary practices seem to be
similar, he said, but the Bahariya cemetery apparently holds a much
richer treasure of mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian archeologists plan to resume excavations there in
November. It may take them a decade to explore the entire cemetery
and assemble a clear picture of how the affluent classes of Roman
Egypt lived and died.

GROWING NUMBER OF AMERICANS ARE SWITCHING TO IMPORTED FAITHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In retrospect, Carole Sturm traces her conversion to Islam to a
prayer she uttered as a 15-year-old in a Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   It was the appeal of a spiritual teen-ager, raised in the
church; the plea of a young woman who believed in God but struggled
with the Catholic mysteries of faith and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `God, show me what this means or show me something
else,' '' Sturm, now 34, said, recalling an afternoon nearly 20
years ago in Tulsa, Okla. ``After that, I figured I was going to
hell. I mean, I was 15.''
</P>
<P>
   It took about five years, but God answered her prayer and showed
her Islam, Sturm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slow dawning,'' said the Arlington, Texas, resident
and computer systems analyst for Sabre Group based in Fort Worth.
``It wasn't like I woke up one night and said, `This is it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In converting to Islam, Sturm joined a growing number of
Americans who switch to faiths that have been imported to the
predominantly Christian United States. And like many others who
convert, Sturm said she found that her new religion allowed her a
spirituality and an understanding of God that previously seemed
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   National Islamic groups estimate that there are more than 6
million Muslims in the United States, placing the religion's
membership ahead of several of the nation's mainline denominations.
</P>
<P>
   There is no formal or elaborate conversion ritual to the faith.
Someone who becomes Muslim must simply declare a belief in one God
and recognize Mohammed as a messenger of God, Sturm said.
</P>
<P>
   But like Christianity, attracting converts is important in the
religion, especially as Muslims choose to live in non-Islamic
states, said Yvonne Haddad, a professor of Islamic history at
Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a missionary religion,'' she said. ``In the 20th
century, (conversion) has assumed a more important role.''
</P>
<P>
   In many places in the United States, the Muslim community
consists of families from Islamic states worldwide as well as
American converts.
</P>
<P>
   For Cherie Lyle, the decision to convert to Islam from the
Seventh-day Adventist Church was prompted in part by the assortment
of races and ethnicities she encountered during Friday afternoon
prayers at a mosque on Center Street in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this sea of Muslims that ranged from the blackest black
to the whitest white, and what came to me was `This is what heaven
must be like,' '' Lyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle's journey to Islam began when she happened on a television
show about the five pillars, or basic tenets, of Islam: a
declaration of faith in the absolute oneness of God, prayers five
times a day, gifts to charity, fasting during the month of Ramadan
and a pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle, who had taught Sunday school in her church, said readings
of the Koran offered a believable way to understand God and an
account of how to live as a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Bible _ and especially the writings of the Apostle
Paul _ had confounded her with what she considered contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had studied very deeply, but I always felt that the hard
questions went unanswered,'' said Lyle, who is trained as a lawyer
but now teaches at Al-Hedayah Academy, an Islamic school in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sturm said that Islam once seemed a foreign faith to
her, it became increasingly familiar as she pursued a degree in
finance from the University of Oklahoma and met students from
Islamic countries who shared their knowledge, including the man she
eventually married, Shazhad Khan.
</P>
<P>
   For Sturm, reading the Koran answered her questions of faith in
a logical manner. Islam did not require her to make leaps of faith,
such as accepting Jesus as the son of God and path to salvation,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we can earn our way to heaven without God's
mercy, but there is more responsibility on the shoulders of the
person,'' she said of Islamic teachings. ``That was important to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an emphasis on personal responsibility, teachings
on the importance of the family and morality also appealed to her,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Watching his daughter convert to Islam did not feel
instinctively right, said Sturm's father, Charles Sturm. But he
came to accept her decision when he saw how she, Khan and their two
children lived their religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have advised my daughter to do this,'' Charles
Sturm said. ``... When she followed the tenets of the Catholic
faith, she was a good woman. (But) I have no doubt that she is a
good woman now that she is following the religion of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the teachings of Islam may feel instinctively right to
Sturm, following all of the customs is not always easy.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Both Lyle and Sturm said they have struggled _ to different
degrees _ with the Islamic requirement that women cover their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Once she made a declaration of faith, Lyle, 43, immediately took
to wearing long, concealing clothing and to covering her hair. But
after she broke the custom for her sister's wedding, returning to
the covering became more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she sometimes does not cover her hair for business
meetings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Sturm does not cover her hair at work, where she
often deals with Sabre's clients _ although she emphasizes that the
company offers a good working environment for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't been able to face the questions and the
looks,'' she said. ``People do take you differently. ... It colors
how seriously they take you and what you say.''

   Despite their difficulties with dress requirements, Lyle and
Sturm underscore that the decision about what to cover and when is
a woman's to make. Both women object to critics who say Islam is
oppressive to women. Examples of extreme restrictions on women's
freedom to work or even walk unaccompanied outside in some Islamic
countries are cultural or political impositions on Islam, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both say that Islam offers women reign over their money
and names. Requirements of modest dress are for both men and women,
and nothing prohibits sun dresses at home, Sturm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just and fair rules,'' Sturm said. ``People don't
understand that. Really, there is a big misconception that so many
things are forbidden.''
</P>
<P>
   For both Sturm and Lyle, Islam showed them a way to understand
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like seeing God without all the baggage,'' Lyle said.

<P>
   For the financial services industry, the emergence of global
capitalism has unleashed a new horror: global holiday schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Say you are in Warsaw, Poland, on a particular Wednesday,
trolling for business opportunities. It is a short hop to
Lithuania, so why not call on a few bankers in Vilnius?
</P>
<P>
   Here's why not: That Thursday is a holiday in Lithuania, and
when Lithuanian holidays fall on a Thursday, the Friday after is
also declared a holiday. If you were going there on the previous
Saturday, you would need to know that it became a normal working
day. Got that?
</P>
<P>
   And though inadvertently landing in Vilnius on a four-day
weekend is a mere waste of time, consider the coming millennium
celebrations. Financial caretakers are trying to close out
important transactions before the end of the last business day of
1999. But just when will that be? New Year's Day falls on a
Saturday, and some countries don't provide a weekday off when
holidays fall on a Saturday. Except lately, several of those
countries have decided to make Friday, Dec. 31, an ad hoc holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the tacticians and quartermasters of
international finance, there is Paul Spraos.
</P>
<P>
   Spraos, 40, is the London-born founder of Swaps Monitor
Publications Inc. in New York, which publishes a newsletter
covering the exotic world of interest-rate swaps and other
financial derivatives. Since 1992, Spraos has also produced an
international holiday calendar, which heroically tries to identify
all the holidays _ ``bad business days,'' he calls them _ that will
occur in more than 100 countries over the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, Spraos (rhymes with ``house'') will begin offering
his calendar over the Internet _ at financialcalendar.com _ a step
he says will make it far easier for him to deal with the growing
tendency of local governments to tinker with their holiday
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holidays are changing more and more frequently, at a rate that
would amaze people who don't follow this,'' Spraos said. Various
financial centers ``are changing their weekends, introducing or
deleting a holiday or adding the millennium holiday. Or maybe their
soccer team just qualified for the World Cup and they've declared a
spontaneous holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do such far-distant holidays matter so much?
</P>
<P>
   Swaps and other financial derivatives can span many decades and
typically involve large sums _ $100 million is routine. The price
of a swap is determined by calculating the current value of all the
payments to be made over the life of the deal. If some future
payment dates fall on local holidays, the cash will not start
earning interest as promptly as anticipated, throwing the price
calculations out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know holidays approximately 30 years out,''
explained Larry Weissblum, a vice president at the capital markets
unit of Sumitomo Bank and a subscriber to Spraos' calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium countdown would have been even more worrisome
without Spraos' service, added Adrienne Mageras, the operations
support director for General Re Financial Products, a global
derivatives dealer. ``You need to know that you can't make payments
on that day in that particular country _ and we've had six or seven
centers declare millennium holidays in just the past two months,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the derivatives markets, banks and other financial
institutions try to estimate their cash needs and anticipate their
cash receipts _ and both will be affected by future bank closings
in the various countries where those institutions do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be expecting a payment on a particular day, but if
it's a holiday you won't get the money,'' Spraos explained. ``At
best, it's an inconvenience. At worst, it costs you real money. And
the reverse is equally true: If you are the one obligated to make a
payment on a particular day and it's a holiday, you may not realize
that the payment was actually due the previous day.''
</P>
<P>
   As curious as it seems, creating a list of future holidays in
individual countries around the world is anything but
straightforward, as Spraos discovered in October 1991 when he
accepted a friend's challenge to develop a global calendar. ``We
thought we would turn the calendars out and have them laminated to
send around to our subscribers as `freebies' for Christmas that
year,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That was when he began to appreciate that ``holidays are not
unambiguous creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim and some Asian holidays are determined by the lunar
calendar but may vary from country to country based on local lunar
observation. Last spring, for example, the same Muslim two-day
holiday varied by as much as five days among the 18 Muslim
financial centers monitored by Spraos.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each country has its own quirky way of determining
when holidays will be observed. In France, for example, banks and
the union representing their employees negotiate the bank holiday
schedule each year. Sometimes different financial institutions
within the same country even observe different holidays. And
roughly 20 percent of the official announcements of future holidays
turn out to contain errors, Spraos discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Even weekends are defined differently from country to country.
In Taiwan, the weekend consists of every Sunday and the second and
fourth Saturday of each month; in Malaysia, the formula is every
Sunday and the first Saturday. And then there is Lithuania, with
its occasional one-day weekend followed by a four-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Spraos said he soon realized that assembling a reliable
financial calendar was going to involve so much research and labor
``that it would be foolish to give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in 1992, when he published the first edition of his
financial calendar, in book form and on CD-ROM, he offered it for
sale. It sold well at $50 a copy, and the price was soon raised to
$200. Eventually, he began to feed the data to his corporate
subscribers electronically, so they could incorporate it into their
own computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet was a logical next step, he said. It will allow
customers to choose whether to pay a flat monthly fee or pay each
time they seek specific data, and it will offer subscribers
enhanced software that will allow them to pose their own questions
to the holiday database.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, more than 100 large financial institutions around the
world, including most of the largest derivatives dealers, rely on
the calendar to help them avoid running afoul of the countless
holidays that will occur over the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, only one of Spraos' customers _ he won't say who
_ subscribes for the full century's worth of data. Most are content
with the next two or three decades _ a blessing for Spraos, since
computer limitations restrict his Internet service to 30 years of
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Spraos has gradually expanded the scope of the
calendar. The original version listed 18 financial centers, with a
``center'' defined as a category of financial institution in a
particular place. (Banks in New York would be one center, for
example, and the New York Stock Exchange would be another.) The
current calendar encompasses 251 financial centers in 103
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide holidays are simply impossible to provide, Spraos
explained. Just in New York, the New York Stock Exchange, the New
York Mercantile Exchange and the major New York banks all differ
slightly in the holidays they observe. Many countries have regional
holidays that affect banks in one city but not in another.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spraos, Nepal has the highest average number of
``bad business days'' each year, with 26.5 weekdays off, although
it observes only a one-day weekend. Romania has the fewest, on
average, with 5.2 weekdays off.
</P>
<P>
   Some future holidays _ like those negotiated bank holidays in
France _ defy accurate calculations. Spraos deals with them by
declaring them ``asterisk holidays,'' those for which he estimates
a multiday range during which the holiday is most likely to fall
based on historical data.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always the unexpected holidays: A sovereign
dies, and the next day becomes an unscheduled holiday. But Spraos
termed his calendar ``as accurate as you can reasonably get for any
prediction of future events.'' It will be more accurate still, he
said, once the Internet version is up and running.
</P>
<P>
   That debut is going to have to wait until after Labor Day,
however. Spraos, an avid bicyclist, is taking a holiday.

COOK FOR COMPANY  _ AND ENJOY YOURSELF, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can cook for company and enjoy the guests and
festivities, too, says cooking teacher Phillis Carey. Her modus
operandi favors relying on fast and fabulous casual recipes, many
with make-ahead attributes that fit into busy schedules _ including
her own _ and yield attractive and colorful results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like things that have vibrant flavors and are filled with
lots of herbs and spices but are not necessarily hot and spicy,''
said Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Carey recently demonstrated three main dishes and one dessert
for summertime lunch, brunch or dinner entertaining during a recent
class at a local market. Although some of the recipes may seem
overwhelming because they have several parts, once you break them
down and make them, they're not difficult for home cooks to master.
</P>
<P>
   The Roasted Red Pepper Caesar Salad, great for a casual summer
party, involves preparing an easy, creamy Caesar dressing and a
salad and grilling marinated chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real stickler about boneless chicken breasts. You should
always pound them (except if you're slitting and filling them) in
between plastic wrap (on the underside, not the shiny side) with a
flat, round, stainless-steel meat pounder (with no teeth) to even
up the thick and thin edges.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to end up with an even 1/2-inch-thick breast that
requires three to four minutes of cooking time per side, she
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Once marinated in a mixture of oil (which keeps the chicken from
sticking to the grill), lemon juice, garlic and red pepper flakes,
the breasts are grilled or broiled over medium-high heat, then cut
across the grain into thin strips and served atop the salad.
</P>
<P>
   For the class, Carey grilled the chicken on the stove top over
medium heat on a grill that stretched across two burners. It's also
feasible to use a grill pan atop the cook-top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marinate the chicken breasts no longer than four hours in the
fridge, otherwise the acid in the marinade may cause the chicken to
fall apart,'' she advised.
</P>
<P>
   The salad mixture goes together quickly with roasted red bell
pepper strips, small nonpareil capers (rinsed to remove excess
salt), romaine lettuce, garlic croutons and dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like your croutons soggy, toss them with the salad and
dressing. If you prefer them crunchy, sprinkle them on top of the
salad just before serving.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastest way to roast peppers is to cut open the red or green
bell peppers, remove the seeds and broil, skin side up, on a
foil-lined baking sheet under a preheated broiler eight minutes
until black and bubbly. Remove from the broiler, fold up the sides
of the foil and steam the peppers 10 minutes. The skin should slip
off easily.
</P>
<P>
   The upscale Caesar dressing, which also contains a roasted red
pepper, is a delicious doctored-up mayonnaise-based mixture with
Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and
Dijon mustard. Use nonfat mayonnaise, if desired, because the other
ingredients will help disguise it, suggested Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Present the salad mixture topped with warm or cold chicken
strips and sprinkled with coarsely grated fresh Parmesan cheese _
not the already grated type, which does not have the same flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The Caesar dressing by itself also makes a delicious veggie dip
_ and the more you process it, the thinner it gets. Carey noted
that it's also terrific drizzled over fresh cooked vegetables for a
vegetable side dish.
</P>
<P>
   You can skip the chicken and just serve the salad with whatever
else you like _ such as grilled steaks. Another time, if you don't
want to make the entire salad, just whip up the chicken. Add an
herb such as rosemary to the chicken marinade, marinate the
breasts, then grill and serve with a salad and side dishes of your
choice. This recipe, like some of Carey's others, is versatile and
lends itself to different interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Next Carey turned her attention to a Grilled Salmon Salad With
Corn Relish and Basil Vinaigrette _ a mixture of warm and cold
foods. ``It's really three recipes in one,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   You can prepare the Basil Vinaigrette _ which is used to dress
the Corn Relish and salad greens and to marinate the salmon _ by
hand or in a food processor or blender. It's best used within 24
hours of preparation. A combination of both balsamic vinegar (which
is smooth) and red wine vinegar (which has more zing) is used along
with basil, garlic, tarragon, chili paste with garlic and olive
oil. When using basil, chop or mince just prior to using; otherwise
it turns black. Remember that fresh herbs are usually measured
lightly packed, Carey reminded.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful Corn Relish with green and red peppers, black
olives and red onion can be made a day in advance of serving and
kept refrigerated. Use fresh or frozen yellow _ not white _ corn
for best color. If using fresh, the best way to remove the corn
from the cob _ and to avoid having it fly all over the kitchen _ is
to stand an ear in a bowl and cut the corn off with downward
strokes of a knife. Figure each ear of corn will yield half to one
cup corn kernels.
</P>
<P>
   When using red or white onions in a salad, Carey suggests
getting rid of the acid or onion taste by covering with water, a
splash of vinegar (any kind except rice or balsamic) and a pinch of
sugar and letting stand for 10 minutes or longer before draining.
</P>
<P>
   After marinating the serving-sized pieces of skinless salmon
fillets in some of the Basil Vinaigrette (in the fridge) and
grilling them stove-top (about five to seven minutes per side),
serve atop mixed delicate greens with sliced tomatoes and a scoop
(use an ice-cream scoop to mold) of Corn Relish on the side. For
convenience and ease, use prepared, cleaned lettuces purchased in
bags in the produce section. To complete this main-dish selection,
Carey suggests serving with strips of herbed focaccia on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile salad is also good with grilled shrimp or chicken
breasts, added Carey. Try the Corn Relish as an accompaniment with
grilled meats or other fish or as a side dish served in
hollowed-out fresh whole tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting entree choice is Spicy Pork Tenderloin With
Orange Chipotle BBQ Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pork tenderloins have hardly any fat and are hardly any
work,'' noted Carey, who loves them and often finds them at Costco
and supermarkets. The sauce that bastes the pork tenderloins while
they cook and goes over the top before serving is flavorful with
chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, ketchup, liquid smoke, orange juice
and Worcestershire sauce. Adjust the amount of chipotles (chiles
that have been smoked) depending on how hot you want the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   For extra flavor, coat the pork tenderloins with a rub made with
paprika, chili powder, pepper and garlic before grilling, broiling
or oven roasting (on a tray lined with heavy-duty foil). If you end
up with any rub leftover, keep refrigerated and use within a week
or two.
</P>
<P>
   Carey suggests investing in an instant-read thermometer to test
all meats for doneness. For pork, cook to 160 degrees F; higher
than that, the pork will dry out.
</P>
<P>
   Carey serves the pork tenderloins sliced diagonally across the
grain, accompanied by Blue Cheese Potato Salad. One of her favorite
potato salad renditions, it can be prepared with either russet or
red potatoes. Substitute feta cheese or garlic and herb cheese
(Boursin) for the blue, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, offer a square of warm or cold Chocolate Fudge Cake
slathered with a large dollop of White Chocolate Orange Cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never cut back on dessert,'' noted Carey, who offers no
ingredient substitutes for butter, sour cream, heavy cream, etc.
``Either eat it or don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Use heavy whipping cream, not regular whipping cream, she
advised, as it whips up fast and once whipped, holds up longer.
Fold in grated orange peel, orange liqueur and cut-up white
chocolate pieces, then refrigerate until serving time.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to entertaining, Carey suggests planning ahead and
cooking as much of the food as possible a day or several hours in
advance. Freeze things like filo appetizers, lasagna, shortbread
crackers and cheesecakes if you feel so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   As for garnishing, gussy up plates with food items that are
already used in the dish. For instance, if rosemary or basil is
used in a recipe, garnish the plate with either of those herbs.
``Don't put chiles on something that doesn't have chiles in it, as
it sends the wrong message to diners.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time you are looking for casual and easy company fare, pull
out these recipes shared by Carey in her class and from her
cookbook, ``The Casual Gourmet.'' You and your guests are in for
some wonderful dining. &QL;

fresh sliced tomatoes, vegetable salads or any tossed greens.

   Prague, Vienna, Budapest
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I will be in Prague in the fall and would like
to take a river cruise to Vienna and/or Budapest. Through what
companies can we make reservations? _ Elaine D. Trehub, Amherst,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Any traveling between Prague and Vienna won't be on a major
river. The Vltava, which passes through Prague, doesn't go that
way; it links up with the Elbe, which continues into Germany.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Vienna from Prague, you can fly or take a train.
Providing a more intimate view is the Prague-Vienna Greenways, a
250-mile network of six trails each of which covers part of the way
between the two cities. En route, there are historic villages and
monuments, walled towns, castles and quiet countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the trail, you can get around on foot and horseback
or by bike and canoe. In many instances, you can also drive on
roads that essentially parallel the trails. Transporting luggage
and arranging accommodations and the like are handled by Palava
Tours. Its U.S. representative is Summit International Travel, 789
Springfield Ave., Summit, N.J. 07901; (800) 527-8664, fax (908)
522-0657; www.summittours.com.
</P>
<P>
   Peter V. Dytrych, co-owner of Summit, said that under the
flexible tour option, breakfast was included and that the charges,
per person per day, were $80 a day for hiking, $90 for cycling,
$100 for car or canoe and $120 for horseback riding. For a minibus,
which carries 16 to 18 passengers, the charge is $1,049 a person,
based on double occupancy, for 11 days. That includes a night in
Vienna and two nights in Prague. The bicycle tour is 10 days and
costs $859 a person; like the minibus tour, it includes breakfast
and dinner daily. None of the rates include air fare. Tours usually
go from Vienna to Prague, but travel in the opposite direction can
be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   By train, the trip takes about five hours, as does the most
direct route by car: heading southeast from Prague to Brno on the
E50 and then taking the E461 south to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   The train schedule starting late next month calls for a
departure from the Hlavni Station in Prague at 9:40 a.m. and
departures from the Holesevice Station at 1:43 and 5:43 p.m. All
three trains run daily and arrive at the Sudbahnhof in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   The one-way fare is $65 first class, $45 second class.
Reservations are recommended and cost $11 a seat if made with Rail
Europe at (800) 438-7245 or at www.raileurope.com. They can also be
made by a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Although you cannot cruise from Prague to Vienna, you can take a
cruise from Budapest to Vienna, on the Danube. Hydrofoils link
Vienna and Budapest, as do more expensive cruise vessels. The
journey by hydrofoil takes about five and a half hours; through
Nov. 1, vessels leave from Vienna and Budapest at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Danube Cruises Austria/European Cruises in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
(800) 327-8223 or (954) 491-0333, charges $95 one way, $155 round
trip. Tickets bought abroad cost less _ about $62.40 one way, $88
round trip at current rates of exchange _ but availability could be
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   For information about the Czech Republic: the Czech Tourist
Authority, 1109 Madison Ave. (83d Street), New York, N.Y. 10028;
(212) 288-0830, fax (212) 288-0971; www.czechcenter.com. Closed
Monday. Information about the Greenways:
www.pragueviennagreenways.org.
</P>
<P>
   A package combining Prague, Vienna and Budapest can be arranged
by Summit International and by such tour operators as European
Connection, (800) 345-4679 or (516) 625-1805; Isram World of
Travel, (800) 223-7460, and Rivers of Eu-rope/N&AMP;S Connections,
(800) 999-0226.

<P>
   Tony Bennett for 2000
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife is an unabashed fan of Tony Bennett's and wants to
greet the millennium at his show on Dec. 31. Can you tell us where
he'll be performing that night? _ Marvin E. Mazie, Des Moines
</P>
<P>
   A. He will be at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve,
but the odds of your getting in to that show are not on your side
since his performance is a ``private casino party.'' That means it
is open only to those who frequent the Desert Inn casino regularly
and play often enough and bet enough to be awarded a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be quite the same, but you can hear Bennett on Jan. 1
and 2 for $125 a night. No free champagne on those nights. On the
31st, Don Rickles will also be performing at the Desert Inn.
Admission, including a bottle of champagne and party favors, is
$150; on Dec. 29 and 30, it's $75. A 10 percent tax applies to all
tickets. Reservations: (800) 634-6909. If you're thinking of
staying at the Desert Inn over New Year's, the rate is $2,000 a
night plus 9 percent tax, with a three-night minimum. That's
$6,540, based on double occupancy. (No credit cards accepted for
this period.)
</P>
<P>
   What else is going on in Las Vegas for the millennium? See
www.vegas.com or www.lasvegas24hours.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gatwick and Pooh
</P>
<P>
   Q. My family and I will be arriving at Gatwick Airport outside
London at 7 a.m. in the fall on the way to Bath. One of our group
will arrive four hours later. Any suggestions to pass the time? We
will be renting a car. _ Betsy Kirkgard, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not only is time a constraint but so is time of day: not many
places are open at 9 a.m. or before.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan of Winnie-the-Pooh, you're in luck. Ashdown
Forest, a 6,480-acre preserve celebrated in the writings of A.A.
Milne, is about a half hour's drive and offers walks through
heathland and woodland.
</P>
<P>
   To get there from the airport, take the M23 south. At the first
exit, take the A264 to East Grinstead and then the A22 south.
Beyond the village of Forest Row, take a left turn at the traffic
light at Wych Cross. The Ashdown Forest Center office, where you
can pick up a map, is a mile away. The office opens at 9 on
weekdays. On weekends, maps are available at the exhibition barn,
which is open 11 to 5. Telephone: (44-1342) 823583;
www.eastsussexcc.gov.uk/ashdown/icentre.htm. The forest is open all
the time; admission is free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two miles from the office you can see the Enchanted Place,
Gill's Lap, the Sandy Pit where Roo played, Lone Pine and the
Hefalump Trap. About a mile plus 15-minute walk away is Poohsticks
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   If you just want to relax on arrival at Gatwick, the 211-room
Europa Gatwick has day rooms as early as 9 a.m. and possibly
earlier. The hotel is in Crawley, six miles from the airport, off
the M23 at Junction 10A; it has an indoor pool and health club. The
room rate is $80 a day. Telephone (44-1293) 886 666, fax (44-1293)
886 680.

SO YOU WANT TO BE A POKE-MOM
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanied by BC-POKEMON-ESSENTIALS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pokemon Summer Training League drew legions of Game
Boy-toting tykes to The Parks mall in Arlington, Texas, last week,
and one of them was my son, Jack. For five hours I looked on,
confused, as Jack watched experts battling in the Cerulean Gym,
ordinary gamers battling in the Prime and Poke Cups, and
day-traders swapping Pokemon trading cards from their three-ring
binders. In five hours, I learned important Pokemon tips _ for
example, an ``Ash hat'' that Jack now wants is going to set me back
$12.99 at Sears.
</P>
<P>
   My 9-year-old is a Poke-maniac, one of the 4 million Americans
who have purchased the Red or Blue version of the mysterious
Japanese game in the past 11 months and has fallen fingers-first
into the fantasy land of ``pocket monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd picked up a little Poke-knowledge myself. There's a little
creature called Pikachu in the game. The game uses up scores of AA
batteries. The TV show is on at 3 p.m. daily. But mostly, I was a
Poke-moron. I couldn't relate to my kid and the Poke-passion that
drove him to log 115 hours and 20 minutes in front of a tiny little
screen. I was losing him to Poke-play.
</P>
<P>
   So, humbly, I sat cross-legged on the floor next to sensei Jack
and asked him to share the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   For confused parents everywhere, I offer excerpts from a
conversation between Mom and the master:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AWAKENING
</P>
<P>
   Mom: First things first. What's the point of Pokemon? What do
you have to do to win?
</P>
<P>
   Master Jack: There's two ways you can beat the game. First, you
can beat the Elite 4, which are the best trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Trainer?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Someone who catches Pokemon with something called a
Pokeball, a Safari Ball, a Great Ball ...
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (writing furiously) Wait, what? What's a Pokeball _ a
Safari Ball?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: (patronizingly) No, Mom. That's Pokeball _ comma _ Safari
Ball _ comma _ Great Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Oh. Sorry. So that's the first thing _ beat the Elite 4?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: No. That's at the end. That's how you become a master.
Remember you asked me how to win? Another way is to capture all of
the Pokemon, and there are 152 _ but actually, there are 157 with
the glitches of the game and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: The glitches?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Never mind. You just need to get 150 to be a master also.
And to be an ultimate master, you have to do both.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: What way are you working on now?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: I already beat the Elite 4. And I have 133 Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: How did you beat the trainers?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: First you have to have a Pokemon ready. You have it in your
lineup, which is a place attached to you like a belt or something,
and you can carry up to six Pokemon on it.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: And then you ... find the trainers and battle them?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Yeah, yes, if you find them.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Um, where are they?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: They're just, like, there. They're just somewhere like you,
kind of just wandering around looking for others also. Some are
just standing there waiting for you.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Oh.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONING
</P>
<P>
   MJ: The trainers send out a Pokemon or you send out one.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Send one out?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: With the Pokeball.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: And then the trainer sends back a Pokemon?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: No. And then a Pokemon can know up to four moves.
</P>
<P>
   (Silence.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DEEPENING
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Moves?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: When you catch a Pokemon wild, it already knows some moves.
It has to know at least one. 'Cause it can't know zero.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (knowing zero) No, I suppose not. How do you teach it more?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: You have to go to a higher level. Which means you have to
get more hit points. Which means you have to kind of beat more
Pokemon. Or have a weak one at the top of your lineup and then
return it, and it gets hit points automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (!)
</P>
<P>
   Mom again: So let's say you capture your little Pokemon. How do
you get it to the next level?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: You have to raise it.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Like a child?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Not really. You have to battle with it. And then it gets
points. And then it can go up to the next level. And if another
Pokemon is at a higher level, then you get more points if you beat
it. 'Cause it's like a weak one, so it gets more points for just
staying alive. Know what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (feeling weak) Do you want something to drink?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CONFUSED
</P>
<P>
   MJ: When a Pokemon is at a high enough level, it evolves into a
different one. It evolves into an entirely new Pokemon, but it's a
little the same. Kind of.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Can you give me an example?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Like Squirtle is a turtle, and he evolves into Wartortle,
which is another kind of turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (feeling confident) And he has more power?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Yes, and he has more defense and attacks special on his
moves. Things like that. Each Pokemon has one special move. Like
Bulbasaur's is vine whip.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (feeling confused) What?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: It hurts the other Pokemon's health. You have 132 healths.
It beats it and makes it go down to zero, then the other Pokemon
faints. No one can ever kill a Pokemon. It just gets weak and then
you can't use it ... until you go to a Pokemon center.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: And that is ...?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Well, you go to a lady and she heals all your Pokemon.
There's one in every city.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: How do you get from city to city?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: You have to travel on foot. Or you can get a bike voucher
from someone.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: From who?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: From a Pokemon fan club in the Game Boy. There's a guy who's
the leader of it, who gives you a bike voucher and if you go back
to Cerulean City and then you go to the bike shop and you talk to
the guy and he gives you a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Talk to the guy? What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: You go up to him and press A.
</P>

<P>
   FAINTING
</P>
<P>
   Mom: (looking at the Game Boy screen) Who is Bill? What is
Bill's PC?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: He gives you the Pokemon where you can deposit and withdraw
them. And you have a PC, too. See, Jack's PC? That's where you can
deposit items. And withdraw them.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: What kind of items?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Well, I'm about to show you that. You have things like the
Super Rod, the Good Rod, which you go fishing with to find Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: And you just collect those things as you go along?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Some people give you them. Some fishers give you them.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Fishers?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: People who fish a lot.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BATTLE CRY
</P>
<P>
   Mom: So what can happen to your Pokemon when they battle? They
can be put to sleep? What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: It means that there are moves like hypnosis that make it go
to sleep. Or like Blizzard and Ice Beam.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Where do you get your freeze power?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: M-o-o-o-o-o-m. From the moves.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP
</P>
<P>
   Mom: What are the best Pokemon to have?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: The best lineup is Charizard, Articuno, Venusaur, Zapdos,
Mewtwo and Blastoise. You need different types, because some types
are weak against others. Like Charzar is flame, or fire. Fire is
weak against Water. The different types have different moves.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: What's a typical Fire move?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: The best one would be Fire Blast. It's a TM. Like Blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Huh?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Which means you have to get a machine to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Machine?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Sometimes one of the gym leaders gives you a Fire Blast when
you beat him.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   GAME OVER
</P>
<P>
   MJ: (setting up playing cards) Mom, do you want to know about
the cards now? How to battle with the cards?
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Are they like the game?
</P>
<P>
   MJ: Kind of.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Let's watch a video.

PANAMA CONVERTING CANAL ZONE FOR TOURISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)  
(lb) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ On Dec. 31, the United States is scheduled
to complete the transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama. The 50-mile
passageway _ a wondrous feat of U.S. engineering _ transports more
than 13,000 ships, including cruise vessels, and 190 million tons
of cargo a year between the Pacific and the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But the transfer, which is being carried out in steps according
to treaties signed in 1977 by President Carter and Brig. Gen. Omar
Torrijos Herrera of Panama, who died in a plane crash in 1981, also
includes about $4 billion worth of property in what was known as
the American Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   If Panama's ambitious plans are realized, 232,278 acres occupied
by U.S. military installations to defend the canal will be
transformed into an international hub of commerce closer to a
mini-Singapore, with the potential of increasing tourism and
exports and adding millions to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to take advantage of the infrastructure we already
have and use interesting concepts, looking for new markets,'' said
Ricardo Icaza, marketing manager of the Interoceanic Region
Authority, created in 1993 to manage the property relinquished
under the canal treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings on the military bases _ barracks, hospitals, schools,
houses and offices _ are already being turned into private housing,
hotels, industrial parks, ports, universities and sports
facilities. A new 310-room hotel, the Sol Melia, is scheduled to
open in December in what used to be the School of the Americas,
where Latin American military officers trained.
</P>
<P>
   The former military base of Amador is being turned into a
tourism complex, set to open in 2001, that is meant to attract the
passengers of more than 300 cruise ships that transit the canal
annually but do not stop. The complex will offer hotels with views
of Panama City and passing ships, casinos, golf courses, shopping
centers and marinas.
</P>
<P>
   Near the small town of Gamboa, at the canal's midpoint, a $25
million ecotourism project over 91 acres, the Gamboa Tropical
Rainforest Resort, is expected to open next year. The development
on the banks of the Chagres River, about 45 minutes from Panama
City by car, will include a 100-room hotel and marina in a natural
setting that offers rain-forest trails, bird watching and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   As the Canal Zone, which occupied close to 10 percent of the
national territory after the waterway was completed in 1914, has
gradually reverted to Panama under steps mandated by the treaties,
some tourism projects have already been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Soberania National Park not far from Gamboa, the
privately run Canopy Tower hotel opened in January in a former
military radar tower. In an ingenious conversion, the circular,
galvanized-steel tower building topped by a 30-foot-high yellow
dome is now a five-story, six-room ``eco-lodge'' with a 360-degree
view of treetops. There are plans to add four guest rooms nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is enormous for the adaptive reuse of
facilities,'' said Pierre Cowart, a visitor from Chicago on his
honeymoon, who with his wife was spotting birds through a telescope
from the tower's observatory. A construction manager by profession,
he commented, ``It's an architectural challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Panama and countries like Spain and Taiwan have already
invested $1 billion, mostly in tourism and maritime projects due to
be finished over the next five years, Panamanian officials say.
More than 100 such projects are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is also great uncertainty. Many Panamanians I
talked to noted that some of the properties that have reverted to
Panama since 1995 are already deteriorating. Most of the nine
military bases that make up the most valuable property are being
transferred this year. The property's fate hinges on the ability of
Panama to attract more investors, Panamanian officials say.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tall order for Panama, which has greeted the Americans'
departure with a mixture of national pride and anxiety. Besides
disposing of the valuable real estate the United States is leaving,
Panama must replace the jobs and income earned from the U.S. bases
_ up to $350 million a year at one time _ and operate the canal,
which brings in about $545 million a year in tolls.
</P>
<P>
   The government must also oversee an expansion of the canal
already under way and prevent deforestation of the watershed, under
the scrutiny of both Panamanians and much of the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Historically, most of the canal's revenue has been invested in
maintenance and modernization, but there are worries among
Panamanians and Americans that governments here could be tempted to
divert canal money for their own use or politicize its operation,
lowering the canal's standards and safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the newly elected president, Mireya Moscoso, who will take
office on Wednesday, has promised to keep the canal free of
corruption and nepotism and use it to reduce high unemployment and
poverty among the population of 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Panama is monitoring very closely what will happen to
the canal,'' a U.S. official here said. ``They all feel it's an
asset that belongs to the whole country.''

SIX ESSENTIALS FOR POKEMON TRAINERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   So your mom won't buy you all the Pokemon stuff you want. Here's
what's best:
</P>
<P>
   1. Game Boy Color and either the Red or the Blue game pak. Red
and Blue are the same game, except that Red has some Pokemon that
Blue doesn't and Blue has some that Red doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Game Boy Color: $69.99 at Toys R Us
</P>
<P>
   Red or Blue game pak: $29.99 at Toys R Us
</P>
<P>
   2. Game link cables. You need these to battle other people or to
trade Pokemon with other people. Like if your friend has one of the
ones that's only on Blue and you have the Red.
</P>
<P>
   Game link cables: $9.99 at Toys R Us
</P>
<P>
   3. Pokemon Yellow. This game is coming out soon in English, but
I got this one from Japan so it's in Japanese. It's exactly like
Red, except there are a few more trainers. I don't know their
names, but I know what they look like, so I just say, ``Oh, it's a
cool trainer'' or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon Yellow: Due next month
</P>
<P>
   4. Trading cards with coins. Alakazam is rare. More rare than
Charizard. The best way to keep your cards is in three-ring binders
with those clear pocket sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Booster card set: $2.99 at Target
</P>
<P>
   5. Pokemon Trainer's Survival Guide. This is for your mom.
You'll already know everything once you start playing.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich Islands Publishing: $11.95
</P>
<P>
   6. The Pokemon videos. There are 10 of these. They don't really
help you on the game that much, but they're fun. The best is
``Thunder Shock,'' I think. It's Ash vs. a gym leader, and he has
Pikachu's evolved form and it's really hard for Pikachu. You know
Pikachu is Ash's first Pokemon. And he's an electric rodent. He's
not very powerful. He's just the cutest.
</P>
<P>
   Videos: $14.98. At video stores and through Amazon.com.

FRAUD SEEKS OUT OLD AND YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug. 29) 
(jt) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sale of travel climbed into the top 10 categories of complaints
made to the Federal Trade Commission in the last year. Sales on the
Internet and over the telephone helped to push travel operators
into the No. 6 spot, in the unlovely company of organizations that
promise to fix bad credit ratings, say you have won the
sweepstakes, sell telephone access cards that provide no access,
and operate Internet auctions without sending merchandise, among
other classic frauds.
</P>
<P>
   These confidence artists do not prey equally. The old and the
young are their preferred targets, the government discovered.
Around spring break time this year, the Federal agency reports, it
began to hear a crescendo of complaints about tour packages sold to
students. And senior citizens were found to be frequent victims of
companies that did not deliver the trips they promised, to say the
least.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This month the agency announced a wide attack on these deceptive
practices. It, in cooperation with the Department of
Transportation, state attorneys general and other agencies in 19
states, accused 25 travel companies of varied offenses, seeking
injunctions and penalties to provide restitution to defrauded
customers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forty-odd legal actions have been lodged against companies that
operate under many names. One example is Cerkvenik-Anderson Travel
of Phoenix, which sells under the names Student Tours, College
Tours, Mexico Tours and Andy Anderson.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is seeking a permanent injunction against this company
in federal court in Arizona. Thayer Lindauer of Westlake Village,
Calif., who is defending the company in court, said: ``The claims
are excessively overblown and not typical and I expect the company
to win.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such companies' habit of going out of business under one name
and starting up under another is an additional reason the
government is moving now. Back in March 1997, according to Jodie Z.
Bernstein, director of consumer protection for the FTC, the agency
took action against a number of travel companies, and after two
years some operators might have decided that the coast was clear
for re-entering the field. ``We don't want them back,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The form in which most adults encounter fraudulent travel offers
is a pseudo-embossed certificate starting with the recipient's name
and saying: ``Pack your bags! You have been chosen for a World
Class Florida Caribbean package including all accommodations and a
round-trip cruise.'' A prompt telephone reply is demanded, and this
usually evokes a high-pressure sales talk for what may be a day
trip on a ferry, an enforced tour of a time-share property or a
stay at a substandard motel far from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Some version of this fraud is what is usually attempted against
senior citizens, and the government said that frequently older
people find themselves hearing long sales pitches when they claim
their ``prize vacation.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students are approached by fellow students, some of whom may be
getting trips free for selling a certain amount. This creates a
more difficult situation because the student agents may not know
they are window dressing for bad merchandise, and a group mentality
may take over.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sara Walker, a high school senior in Eugene, Ore., came
home from school with a flier for a Cerkvenik-Anderson ``graduation
blowout'' in Mazatlan, Mexico. Her mother, Vicki L. Walker, said
her son had gone on a similar trip ``and everything was on the up
and up.'' But this one, she said, ``turned out to be a nightmare
that my daughter still has trouble talking about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plane, flown by a charter operator, sat at the Portland
airport for an hour and arrived in Mexico quite late. No food and
no water were aboard. Ms. Walker, who has since taken her seat as
an Oregon state representative, said she got a hysterical telephone
call from her daughter at the hotel at 11:30 p.m. that night, June
11, saying that the flight had involved wet T-shirt contests among
five female students incited by the flight attendants and judged by
the flight crew. On the bus to the hotel, Ms. Walker continued, her
daughter said beer at $1 each was offered to all 153 students, some
of whom were only 17 and none of whom had eaten since Portland. The
hotel quarters were not as advertised, and although she had paid
for a double room, she was told that she would have to pay $120
additional for a double. The tour operator's staff, which was
supposed to be in charge, was drinking with the kids, she said.
``There was constant sexual innuendo,'' Ms. Walker said, and the
activities all focused on alcohol and sex.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many things paid for in advance had to be paid for again,
including a bracelet to provide identification and entry into
various clubs. Sara Walker told her mother that unpleasant threats
were made to students who refused to buy the new bracelets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the flight returned seven days later, Ms. Walker, a court
reporter, interviewed 40 of the students and got the transcripts
notarized. Since almost all the students were from Oregon, this
material provided grist when the Oregon legislature approved a law
regulating sellers of travel and requiring that school districts
develop policies that could prevent trips like the graduation
blowout. Ms. Walker said that the American Society of Travel Agents
had helped with the bill's language.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that has seen little scrutiny,'' Ms. Walker
said. ``Kids take a bad trip and then come back and they want to
move on. My goal is to be sure everyone knows what can happen.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said she was discouraged to hear from some parents who were
letting their children go on such trips this year ``because all of
their friends were going.'' She said that parents had to take a
stand with their children that nothing should be allowed to
threaten the safety and health of family members.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ronna Brown, president of the Better Business Bureau of
Metropolitan New York, and Ms. Bernstein of the FTC both emphasize
the importance of doing research about travel offers, particularly
if the seller approaches the customer, rather than the other way
around. ``Do business with somebody you know,'' Ms. Brown says.
``If not that, somebody a friend knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales information on the Internet, like that given by telephone
sales-people describing free or discounted trips, does not tell the
consumer what company is offering the trip. Just because a company
is on the Internet, Ms. Bernstein said, does not make a proposition
real or assure the honesty of the operator. For confidence artists,
the Internet provides still another cover for identity, whereabouts
and past history.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The experts say that once you find out what company is actually
chartering the plane, making the hotel reservations and providing
the transfers, there are ways to check up on it _ although, as
several notable cases prove, the ownership can change quickly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau in New York compiles complaints about
companies in the city, Long Island and most of the 914 area code.
It seeks responses from them. If a company fails to respond to
multiple complaints, the bureau gives it an unsatisfactory rating.
The potential customer needs to know the company's name and
address. There are two ways to call for information: (212)
533-6200, which will involve a charge of $3.80 on the caller's
credit card in addition to any long-distance tolls, or (900)
555-4222, which costs 95 cents a minute. The Web site is
www.newyork.bbb.org. Written inquiries, with a stamped
self-addressed envelope, should be directed to 257 Park Avenue So.,
New York, N.Y. 10010. If a company is not in its area, the bureau
can provide a reference to a bureau in the right area.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission wrote two new leaflets as part of
its drive against travel fraud. They are available free on request
to the address below, or through the Internet. ``Avoid a School
Break Bust'' gives the number at the Department of Transportation,
(202) 366-2396, to call to verify that an air-charter operator has
filed for permission to operate the flight. ``Telemarketing Travel
Fraud'' describes all the ways the truth can be shaded and depicts
the pressure tactics often used.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it is too late for leaflets, complaints can be filed with the
agency at (877) 382-4357. The number for TDD is (202) 326-2502. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agency cannot help individual consumers resolve their
problems, but their complaints may help an investigation, or create
a probable reason for the agency to act. Written complaints should
go to the Consumer Response Center, Federal Trade Commission, 600
Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the experts counsel people in situations they consider
ticklish to pay with credit cards. In New York, it is illegal to
charge extra for the use of a credit card, but Ms. Brown concedes
that nothing can be done about companies that provide discounts for
those paying cash. ``It is worthwhile to pay the extra to provide
yourself with the added margin of safety,'' Ms. Brown said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This advice certainly applies to parents whose children are wild
to take a trip a friend is selling: legitimate operators will
accept at least one type of credit card.

   2 Airlines Offer Deals on New York Fares
</P>
<P>
   Air fares within New York state have caused politicians and
business leaders to complain that it can cost more to fly halfway
across the state than all the way across the Atlantic. But now
prices have come down in two more markets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle America, a regional airline based in Windsor Locks,
Conn., began flying from MacArthur Airport in Islip, N.Y., about 45
minutes from Manhattan, to Albany and Buffalo on July 13 at steeply
discounted fares. Round-trip fares between Islip and Albany or
Buffalo are $98 if purchased at least 21 days in advance. With a
14-day advance purchase, fares are $158 to Albany and $178 to
Buffalo. Walk-up fares are $198 to Albany and $298 to Buffalo. No
Saturday-night stay is required, so even the lowest fares allow a
round trip on the same day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently only US Airways offered service between Islip and
Albany.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flights from Islip to Buffalo are also available via Albany,
Boston or Philadelphia on US Airways, via Cleveland on Continental
and via Cincinnati on Delta. But US Airways, Delta and Continental
charge walk-up coach fares of $495 to $1,538, far above the
comparable Shuttle America fare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Shuttle America began flying between Islip and Buffalo,
the lowest round-trip fare was $318, but the US Airways schedule
shows that after Shuttle America began service, its cheapest fell
to $118.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle America has three daily nonstop flights between Islip
and Albany (the same as US Airways), each with connecting Buffalo
service. It flies 50-passenger Dash-8 turboprops.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next year a new low-fare airline backed by the financier George
Soros is to begin flying eight Airbus A-320 jets (seating 150 to
180 passengers) from Kennedy Airport to several cities, one of
which will be either Buffalo, Rochester or Syracuse. David
Neeleman, the company's chief executive, said recently that the
airline will operate as Jetblue Airways. Each passenger will have a
personal television screen showing programs broadcast by satellite,
he said.

   Edinburgh Puts Planet in Dramatic Light
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, erupting volcanos and torrential rains are a few of
the simulated catastrophes awaiting visitors to Dynamic Earth, a
new attraction in Edinburgh's Old Town. Housed in the William
Younger Center, a new building with a translucent roof, Dynamic
Earth tells the planet's story through interactive exhibits, videos
and state-of-the-art special effects.
</P>
<P>
   After boarding a ``time machine'' elevator, visitors may explore
11 environmental zones, ranging from a tropical rain forest with
computer-controlled daylight cycles to a Restless Earth zone,
replete with sulfurous emissions and a vibrating floor that lights
up. An indoor iceberg can be found in the chilly Polar Zone, and
the Showdome offers a planetariumlike display of earthquakes,
lightning storms and tidal waves. Human evolution, extinction of
the dinosaurs and the sustainability of the planet are among the
themes explored elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dynamic Earth, at 112 Holyrood Road in Holyrood Park, is open
Wednesday to Sunday. Admission is $9.50; $5.60 for children.
Information: (44-131) 550 7800.

   Amtrak Is Rolling Out Satisfaction Express
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak plans to put a customer-satisfaction guarantee into
effect by the end of the year. Passengers dissatisfied with the
service, food or other aspects of their trip will be able to get a
voucher with a value equal to the trip's cost.
</P>
<P>
   The guarantee will take effect after the company completes a
training program for its 24,000 employees, establishes standards
for its service and creates employee incentives. It is similar to
programs at many hotel chains, and its announcement last month came
at the peak of a dispute in Congress over airline passengers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to guarantee passenger rights while others in the
transportation industry are fighting them in Congress,'' said
George Warrington, Amtrak's president. The Air Transport
Association, representing major U.S. lines, has agreed on a
``customer service commitment'' to improve airline performance.
Amtrak said its new hiring would focus on people with traits that
met customer-service needs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the program will involve checking each train before
departure for adequate food supplies and properly functioning
plumbing, among other things. Trains that don't pass muster won't
be permitted to leave, said John Wolf, an Amtrak spokesman. The
first phase has begun on four trains: the California Zephyr; the
Crescent, between New York and New Orleans; the San Diegans, and
the Washington-New York corridor service.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver Exhibit Shows Rich Tribal Past
</P>
<P>
   Since ancient times, the Nuu-chah-nulth people of the west coast
of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, have preserved their
cultural heritage, which celebrates their reverence for the sea,
land and wildlife. In ``Out of the Mist: HuupuKwanum/Tupaat,
Treasures of the Nuu-chah-nulth Chiefs,'' a new exhibition at the
Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, that heritage is
explored.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Nuu-chah-nulth tribal council of chiefs, elders and
contemporary artists worked closely with museum officials on the
exhibition. Among the 241 artifacts and 75 images on display are
18th-century ceremonial bowls, a serpent headdress and a cedar
mask. One of the key pieces is the Frank Family curtain, a
24-foot-long ceremonial cotton curtain, circa 1900, that was a part
of the Andy Warhol Collection and is now owned by the museum. The
curtain is normally kept in storage, and the exhibit offers a rare
opportunity to view the spectacular hand-crafted piece.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum expects the exhibition to travel to at least 10 other
museums in North America after it closes in Victoria on April 30.
The Royal British Columbia Museum, 675 Belleville St. in Victoria,
(250) 387-3701, is open daily. Admission is $6.40; ages 6 to 18,
$2.60, at $1.50 Canadian to the U.S. dollar.

VICTIMS OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 BRIEFED ON UPCOMING TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Relatives of those killed in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland said Monday Attorney General Janet Reno
assured them that prosecutors would pursue any foreign official,
including Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, implicated by the evidence
in the 11-year-old case.
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyan men are accused of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing that
killed all 259 people on board the plane, including 189 Americans.
Eleven people in the southern Scottish town of Lockerbie were
killed by falling debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``After speaking with Ms. Reno, I have no doubt in my mind that
prosecutors will not shy away from going after the people
responsible for this attack,'' said Stan Maslowski of Haddonfield,
N.J., whose 30-year-old daughter Diane died in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Dater, of Pittstown, N.Y., who lost her 20-year-old
daughter Gretchen in the attack, also said Reno and the case's
prosecutors were committed to following the evidence ``wherever it
may lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno declined to comment on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In closed-door meetings at a Washington hotel, the families were
briefed on the upcoming trial by Scottish prosecutors and Justice
Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, both
presumed intelligence agents, are scheduled to be tried under
Scottish law in the Netherlands on charges of planting a suitcase
bomb that blew up the jumbo jet. The trial is to begin in early
February.
</P>
<P>
   For families of the victims, the upcoming trial has brought a
mix of reactions. Dater sees it as positive step in a crusade for
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly never thought this day would come,'' Dater said
after meeting with Reno and the prosecutors from Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But for others, like Stephanie Bernstein from Bethesda, Md.,
whose 36-year-old husband Michael died in the bombing, the trial is
merely a way for the U.S. and British governments to put the
tragedy behind them and to renew relations with Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   She said the two government were ``trying to put the best face
on what I feel was a very politically motivated compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, the United Nations lifted stiff sanctions against
Libya after Gadhafi handed over the two Libyan suspects to U.N.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The end of those sanctions, in place since 1992, allowed
international air travel and the sale of vital industrial equipment
to Libya to resume. The step also released Libyan assets that had
been frozen in a number of countries.
</P>
<P>
   But separate sanctions imposed by the United States before the
bombing over Lockerbie will not end until other conditions are
fulfilled, according to the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although fractured in their feelings about the upcoming trial,
the victims' families are united in their belief that the bombing
was likely ordered by Gadhafi and that if evidence in the trial
implicates him and other foreign officials, they should be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all hoping and believe that the Scottish prosecutors
will not stop pushing if evidence begins to emerge showing just who
ordered the bombing,'' Dater said.
</P>
<P>
   Using funds derived from fines paid by U.S. criminals, the
Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime is helping pay to
fly some relatives to the Netherlands to watch the trial, arranging
a satellite telecast of the trial or its highlights for families
here, and providing a daily report of trial activity on a toll-free
telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   It also is establishing a secure Internet Web site with trial
reports and an electronic bulletin board through which families of
those killed can communicate with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition of the two suspects and the upcoming trial have
marked a turning point in the efforts of the victims' relatives.
Through quarterly meetings, monthly conference calls, newsletters
and trips around the world, they have fought tirelessly to see
those responsible brought to trial. They have also lobbied to make
skies and airports safer for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans suspects were taken to the Netherlands under a
complex arrangement that treats a former military base near the
college town of Utrecht as Scottish territory so the suspects can
be tried under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   It was this formula _ promoted by Britain _ of holding the trial
in a third country that finally broke the deadlock and ended
Libya's long refusal to cooperate with American and British
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish judges will have to weigh the still-secret evidence
provided by the United States and Britain and decide whether the
two Libyans are guilty of planting the suitcase bomb. The judges
will then face the fundamental questions of who gave the orders to
blow up the plane and why.
</P>
<P>
   British and American investigators concluded that a bomb was put
aboard the Pan Am flight on its way from Frankfurt to New York
during its stopover at Heathrow Airport in London. Less than an
hour after takeoff, the Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded into flames,
killing its passengers and crew members. In 1991, Britain and the
United States indicted al-Megrahi and Fhimah in connection with the
bombing.

<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ In a country where there is no vocation
more perilous, indeed more radical, than being a voice for peace,
Neelan Tiruchelvam had worked to bring an end to the savage ethnic
conflict that has tormented this lush island nation.
</P>
<P>
   His friends and family had watched in dread as other leaders of
his moderate ethnic Tamil political party were gunned down or blown
up by guerrillas fighting for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka's
Hindu Tamil minority.
</P>
<P>
   When some of them pleaded with Tiruchelvam, a member of
Parliament who helped draft the government's peace plan, to get out
of Sri Lanka with his life, he told them: ``I can't run away. My
duty is here.''
</P>
<P>
   So on a hot, sunny morning last month, he went to work as usual,
with armed men in a jeep behind him and on a motorcycle in front.
As usual, he got stuck at a busy intersection just a couple of
blocks from his whitewashed bungalow.
</P>
<P>
   As he turned the corner, a stranger walked up to his car,
pressed his belly against the window and detonated a bomb strapped
to his waist.
</P>
<P>
   Tiruchelvam's shattered body exploded out the other side of his
car, and hung limply out the window like a rag doll. The suicide
bomber's severed head flew over the vehicle and landed on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, brazenly carried out just a stone's throw from the
prime minister's residence, has provided yet more evidence of the
brutal effectiveness of the terror tactics used by separatist
rebels in silencing fellow Tamils who favor political compromise
over armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other Tamil leader, it seemed that the
Harvard-educated Tiruchelvam (pronounced teer-oo-CHELL-vum), 55,
had the intellectual stature, the gentle temperament and the web of
high-level contacts to coax from the majority Sinhalese rulers
constitutional changes to redress the grievances of the Tamil
people.
</P>
<P>
   His death has been a blow to the search for a peaceful end to
Sri Lanka's 16-year-old civil war, which has left 60,000 dead in a
country whose population _ 18 million _ is about the size of New
York State's.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's justice minister, G.L. Peiris, a Sinhalese lawyer,
said his dead colleague was a bridge between the Tamils and the
Sinhalese _ a bridge that the guerrillas wanted to blow up. ``We
are now without a consensus builder,'' Peiris said.
</P>
<P>
   The package of constitutional reforms that Tiruchelvam and
Peiris crafted to give Tamils more power is still stuck in the
poisonous partisan deadlock between the country's two main
political parties, both dominated by the Buddhist Sinhalese
majority. That deadlock is unlikely to be broken before national
elections next year, political experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While the rebels, who call themselves the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, have neither denied nor claimed responsibility for
Tiruchelvam's slaying, they have been blamed for it by officials
and political experts. They note that the group had demonized
Tiruchelvam in their propaganda and that the method of killing _ by
a suicide bomber _ is a Tiger signature.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his life, Tiruchelvam, a constitutional scholar,
was discouraged by the lack of progress in getting the peace
package through Parliament. But his wife and colleagues say he
never lost hope that a resolution to Sri Lanka's fratricidal war
lay in ideas of federalism, individual liberty and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still felt that it was in his grasp to bring about this
historic settlement,'' said Gowher Rizvi, a friend and former
professor at Oxford University who now heads the Ford Foundation's
South Asia office. ``He would say, `We're almost there. Our work is
almost done.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Tamil moderates like Tiruchelvam, 1994 was a year of great
hope. They believed that the majority Sinhalese might agree to a
just settlement of Tamil grievances and that the guerrillas might
accept a peace deal to end the fighting in the country, off India's
southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Chandrika Kumaratunga, daughter of the powerful
political family most associated with the rise of Sinhalese
nationalism, had won a landslide victory on an unprecedented peace
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Her victory came with strong support from Tamil-speaking Hindus
after she promised to open peace talks with the separatist Tiger
militants. Many Tamils believed that her government would deliver a
plan to give them a measure of political autonomy in the north and
east of the country, where Tamils are in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between Tamils and Sinhalese _ over language,
religion, university admissions and government patronage, among
other things _ had festered since the country gained its
independence from the British in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils, who make up slightly less than a fifth of the
population and who had maintained a privileged position under the
colonial rulers, felt discriminated against after the Sinhalese,
who are about three-quarters of the populace, took the reins of
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga's election seemed to be a moment Tiruchelvam
had been preparing for his whole life.
</P>
<P>
   He was an upper-caste Hindu born into a politically engaged
Tamil family that was part of Colombo's English-speaking elite.
When he was a teen-ager, his father, a prominent Tamil lawyer and
politician, was hauled off to a detention camp in the midst of a
campaign of civil disobedience against the government's ``Sinhala
only'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   After he earned his doctorate at Harvard Law School in 1972 as a
Fulbright scholar, Tiruchelvam came home and spent his career
searching for ways to end Sri Lanka's ethnic strife. He helped
organize the International Center for Ethnic Studies, a research
group here, and became an expert on how countries had accommodated
ethnically diverse societies in their constitutional make-ups.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Sithie, also a lawyer, built an influential,
multi-ethnic circle of friends. She described him as ``a small-made
man,'' just 5 foot 3 and a half inches tall, whose shy, quiet ways
complimented her own teasing gregariousness.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Unger, a professor at Harvard Law School who had been
close to Tiruchelvam since their student days at Harvard, said,
``He was completely devoted to reconciliation on the basis of this
intuition he had that we have to forgive one another before we can
talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During her long years in the political wilderness, the country's
new Sinhalese president, Mrs. Kumaratunga, had joined the
Tiruchelvams around the dinner table in their home on Rosmead Place
in the posh Cinnamon Gardens neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In political discussions with Neelan, she always felt that the
Tamils had gotten a raw deal that had to be corrected,'' Mrs.
Tiruchelvam said. ``He believed she had the courage of her
convictions and that she would carry out her promises.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1994, when Mrs. Kumaratunga became president with a huge
mandate for peace, and Tiruchelvam was elected to Parliament, it
was only natural that he began working with her government to draft
a package of constitutional reforms that were to turn Sri Lanka
from a centralized state into an ``indissoluble union of regions.''
</P>
<P>
   As that work progressed, however, her administration's
negotiations with the guerrillas fell apart in 1995. The
government, in turn, stepped up its military campaign against the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, by late 1995, the authorities had learned that the
Tigers planned to stake out Tiruchelvam's home. The government
began providing him with round-the-clock security. He never again
left his walled enclave without bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan stalled. It needed a two-thirds majority in the
225-member Parliament to pass, but opposition from the other major
Sinhala-dominated political party, the United National Party, left
the governing People's Alliance coalition about 17 votes short.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997 and 1998, the Tigers, who had already killed a
dynamic leader of Tiruchelvam's party over tea and biscuits in
1989, began killing more of the party's most promising talent,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the underground leader of the Tigers,
had built a battle-hardened corps of 4,000 to 8,000 followers, as
well an elite cadre of suicide bombers, celebrated as martyrs to
Tamil Eelam, the separate country they were fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   First, they gunned down a member of Parliament at a ribbon
cutting. Then they killed the newly elected mayor of the northern
city of Jaffna, herself the widow of an assassinated partyman, and
a few months later, killed her replacement, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tiruchelvam's elder son, Nirgunan, 26, an investment banker in
Singapore, became almost obsessed with his father's security. He
begged his father to stay inside their house, or to wear a bullet
proof vest and travel in a bomb-proof car.
</P>
<P>
   The son tracked down an aging bomb-proof Jaguar that had carried
the queen of England when she visited Sri Lanka in the early 1980s.
But when his father used the car, it broke down. The one garage
that could fix it always seemed to be busy.
</P>
<P>
   The signs that Tiruchelvam himself was a target mounted. D.B.S.
Jeyaraj, a respected, Sri Lankan journalist living in Canada, kept
up with the militant's propaganda and saw that the Tiger's verbal
attacks on Tiruchelvam as a traitor to the separatist cause were
becoming more venomous.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned Tiruchelvam, but Tiruchelvam replied that there was
little he could do to stop the Tigers if they were determined to
get him, especially in Colombo, where he was often immobilized in
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   The constant threat of death took a toll on Tiruchelvam's
family, especially his wife, who seemed increasingly tired and
worn, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Grodzins, a longtime family friend who was an
administrator at the John F. Kennedy School of government at
Harvard, decided to find a way to get the Tiruchelvam's to safety,
if only for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   She phoned Tiruchelvam's admirers at the Rockefeller Foundation
and Harvard Law School. Soon, he had offers from both places and
accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   For a restful month this summer, the Tiruchelvams went to the
Rockefeller Foundation's study center in Bellagio, Italy. Mrs.
Grodzins had expected them to go directly from Italy to Cambridge,
Mass., where Tiruchelvam was to be a visiting professor at Harvard
Law School for the fall semester. She had rented an apartment for
them there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the couple returned to Colombo on July 19. There was
then widespread speculation that Mrs. Kumaratunga's government
planned finally to introduce the peace plan in Parliament this
August.
</P>
<P>
   The day they got back, the government warned Tiruchelvam of a
new assassination threat from the Tigers, but did nothing to
increase his security. He considered asking the government for more
protection, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neelan did not want to be under obligation,'' his wife said.
``He did not want to ask for something that was not given.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of July 29, he and his wife had breakfast together
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   He had a long, relaxed telephone chat with his journalist friend
in Canada, Jeyaraj. Tiruchelvam spoke of the Tigers' latest
threats, and said he was convinced that they were out to extinguish
his party, the Tamil United Liberation Front. But he needed just a
little more time in Parliament to see the constitutional reforms
package through, he said. Then he would relinquish his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, he got in his car to go to work. At 9:18
a.m. the suicide bomber's blast rocked the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, Tiruchelvam's fellow Tamil moderates have
become even more fearful. Party workers recently filled rusty tar
barrels with sand and lined them up at the entrance to the party's
shabby headquarters in Colombo to block any bomb-laden car. V.
Anandasangaree, a senior party leader who was on the hit list with
Tiruchelvam, is now a virtual prisoner of the headquarters. He
lives and works there and leaves only on the rarest occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the guarantee that I will come back alive?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In national elections next year, he said, the party's candidates
will campaign only on radio and television _ places where bullets
and bombs cannot reach them.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, Tiruchelvam's sons sat with their mother
in their father's darkened, book-lined study and spoke of what the
national tragedy has cost them.
</P>
<P>
   After anti-Tamil riots swept Colombo in 1983 and Sinhalese mobs
killed hundreds of Tamils, there was an exodus of Tamils from the
city and from Sri Lanka itself. Even then, when virtually every
Tamil moderate who had been in Parliament moved to India,
Tiruchelvam refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But he and his wife decided to send their sons, then just 8 and
10, to boarding school in India to protect them. Mithran, now a
24-year-old law student at Cambridge University, still seems
wounded by the experience of growing up so far from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard for the younger one,'' Mrs. Tiruchelvam said,
as her sons listened. ``He felt unwanted because he wasn't allowed
to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to them, she continued, ``Even in Bellagio, Neelan
recounted having to send the two children to boarding school. He
told how painful it was and how guilty he felt about not having his
children with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The sons admire their father's commitment and sacrifice, but
agree on this: The family tradition in Sri Lankan politics ends
with them. They want no part of it.

STUDY OF RETIRED COUPLES POINTS UP CONFLICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retirement is supposed to represent the golden years, when
husband and wife finally get to enjoy their time together,
unbothered by worries about children or work.
</P>
<P>
   But a study presented Monday at the American Psychological
Association meeting in Boston finds that for some couples,
depression and marital conflict develop, especially when one spouse
is newly retired and the other continues to work.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the first psychological studies to look at
couples during retirement, not just middle-aged men, or men and
women separately.
</P>
<P>
   With more women now in the work force and companies offering
early buyouts, the possibility of spouses having different
retirement timetables is greater than ever, prompting an increasing
number of researchers to call for studies of retirement as a
couples phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Pare, 66, knows first-hand what tensions can develop, saying
the study's findings made sense to him. He took an early buyout in
December 1993 from Raytheon Co., while his wife, Claudette,
continues to work as an administrative manager for the curriculum
department at a technical high school.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the popular notions of retirement as idyllic, of
``two people holding hands, walking the beach, both very slim, both
looking 20 years younger than the age they're trying to portray. .
. ,'' Pare said, ``It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's been five years that I've been retired. I've
been a house husband. The first year, I almost went nuts,'' said
Pare. He and his wife have since worked things out, but Pare said
he's still looking forward to his wife's retirement in October of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, based on interviews with 534 married men and women
in upstate New York, Cornell University researchers found some
interesting differences based on gender, and on who's retired and
who's still working.
</P>
<P>
   Newly retired men whose wives still work experienced more
marital conflict than those whose wives have also retired or have
never worked outside the home at all, while newly retired women
whose husbands still work tended to be more depressed than women
who have long been retired or have never worked outside of the
home, especially if they are dissatisfied with their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   For men, the solution seems to be to find some other kind of
paid work after retirement, even if it's part-time. Those who did
had the highest morale and lowest depression, while those who did
not know what to do with themselves had the lowest morale and most
depression, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``For men, post-retirement employment appears to be beneficial
for their psychological well-being,'' according to the study by
Jungmeen E. Kim and Phyllis Moen.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to describe the situation for Pare. While working on
house repairs helped to fill the time that first year of
retirement, Pare says he didn't feel satisfied until he started
working with the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   He is now state coordinator for AARP/VOTE in Massachusetts,
setting up forums for congressional and gubernatorial candidates to
share their views with voters, among other activities. While the
work is unpaid, it entails as much commitment as a paid job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the volunteering rewarding in a lot of ways,'' Pare
said, especially when he helps low-income elderly hook up with
programs to assist with prescription drugs and other services. ``I
get something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For women who are newly retired, the answer doesn't appear to
come from finding other work, but from having a happy marriage,
according to the study presented Monday. In fact, women who found
post-retirement employment did not feel significantly less
depressed than those who stayed in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent gender difference seems to support earlier
researchers' findings that men tend to identify more with their
work, and women with their relationships, say Kim and Moen.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that men who came out retirement and whose wives stayed
at home were the happiest of all, suggests that men ``appear to be
more satisfied with their lives when their spouses are following
traditional gender role expectations,'' said researcher Kim.
</P>
<P>
   The research is part of an ongoing Cornell Retirement and
Well-Being study.

THE GREEN SLIME NETWORK: 20 YEARS AT NICKELODEON

 (Includes a color slide from Nickelodeon's 20th anniversary party)
 By LAUREL GRAEBER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Scientists believe that all life may have originated in some
great prehistoric molecular stew. The same could be said of
Nickelodeon, except that the medium wasn't primordial ooze: It was
more like green slime.
 &HT;    That gloppy goo has become a trademark of Nickelodeon, the first
network for children and the No. 1 cable network.
 &HT;    Now 20 years old, it has been celebrating its birthday this
summer with special programming, contests, retrospectives,
giveaways and, of course, some green slime.
 &HT;    But while Nickelodeon's signature is the messy and the
irreverent, it wasn't always been the case.
 &HT;    In 1979 it was known to more kids as the ``green vegetable
network'' than the ``green slime network.''
 &HT;    ``The joke was that our early research showed that kids thought
Nickelodeon was like a green vegetable,'' said Cyma Zarghami, the
network's executive vice president and general manager. ``Just
because it's good for kids doesn't mean it tastes good.''
 &HT;    A typical program, she says, was ``Going Great,'' which
showcased the talents of Wunderkinder, a concert pianist.
 &HT;    ``Kids said it didn't do anything to build their self-esteem,''
she says. ``So we decided to create everyday heroes out of everyday
kids.''
 &HT;    The network found its new direction in 1982, when it began to
create programs such as ``You Can't Do That on Television,'' which
Zarghami described as ``one of the earliest versions of `Laugh-In'
for kids.''
 &HT;    A running routine was that anytime anyone said ``I don't know,''
green slime was dumped on his or her head.
 &HT;    (The slime was so successful that it has resurfaced on other
Nickelodeon programs and in its annual Kids' Choice Awards.)
 &HT;    The network also reinvented other adult concepts, like the talk
show and the game show, and came up with a ``Twilight Zone'' for
pre-teens, the still-running ``Are You Afraid of the Dark?''
 &HT;    The series ``makes kids hide behind the couch and bite their
nails, but (it's) never bloody or gory,'' Zarghami says.
 &HT;    In all this programming, there was one constant: ``We looked for
talent that looked like someone you might know from school,''
Zarghami says. ``Not exceptionally beautiful people, but ones who
had ordinary kid personas.''
 &HT;    Funny how things turn out.
 &HT;    During its anniversary bash, the network is showing ``Nick Knew
Them When,'' a series of Nickelodeon programs whose stars are far
from ordinary today. But back then, in the early days of slime and
silliness, they were pretty green and unformed themselves.
 &HT;    Just imagine, for instance, rock singer Alanis Morissette,
poster girl for the jilted and vengeful, as a winsome 12-year-old
getting slime poured on her head in ``You Can't Do That on
Television.''
 &HT;    A series regular, Morissette ``was sort of happy and peppy and
had bigger hair,'' Zarghami says.
 &HT;    ``She doesn't appear to be happy and peppy now,'' she added.
 &HT;    Or James Van Der Beek, the heartthrob in the hit series
``Dawson's Creek,'' playing a musician in an early 1990s episode of
``Clarissa Explains It All.''
 &HT;    Clarissa, played by Melissa Joan Hart, meets him when she's
disguised herself as a punk teen-ager. He's an aspiring rock
drummer who falls under her spell so much that he dons a
skull-shaped earring. Not exactly Dawsonesque behavior.
 &HT;    Some old roles are not such stretches, though.
 &HT;    Neve Campbell, the television star who went on to Hollywood fame
in ``Scream'' (1996) and ``Scream 2'' (1997), can be seen in a 1994
episode of ``Are You Afraid of the Dark?''
 &HT;    She plays the hostess of a restaurant that serves fare that's,
well, unusual _ not a bad training ground, given all the screaming.
 &HT;    Other Nickelodeon graduates include actress Michelle
Trachtenberg (star of the movie ``Harriet the Spy,'' 1996), actor
Will Fredell, who has appeared in the television series ``Zoe,
Duncan, Jack and Jane,'' and singer A.J. McLean, now a member of
the immensely popular Backstreet Boys.
 &HT;    At age 12, McLean starred in the pilot for ``Hi, Honey, I'm
Home,'' the network's comedy series about a 1950s sitcom family
facing life in the 1990s.
 &HT;    As these stars have grown up, so has the network.
 &HT;    ``The way it looks now is different,'' Zarghami says. ``And the
way it looks five years from now will be different. Kids are always
changing, the world is always changing, we are always changing.''
 &HT;    Just don't expect them to abandon the green slime.

A LONG AND WINDING ROAD FOR `VARSITY BLUES' STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Amy Smart and Sean Hatosy in a scene
from ``Outside Providence.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She never saw it coming.
 &HT;    Amy Smart had been in several movies that either closed quietly,
failed to capture the collective imagination of moviegoers, or
featured gigantic man-eating space insects.
 &HT;    Her credits included ``Dee Snider's StrangeLand'' (1998), ``The
Last Time I Committed Suicide'' (1997) and ``Starship Troopers''
(1997), a film which confirmed the showbiz adage that actors should
never work with babies, small dogs or monstrous flesh-eaters.
 &HT;    Then, last year, Smart played the sensible girlfriend opposite
``Dawson's Creek'' star James Van Der Beek in ``Varsity Blues,'' a
high school football movie that opened at the top of the box-office
charts despite lukewarm reviews and went on to score as a solid
hit.
 &HT;    Go figure.
 &HT;    ``We had no idea it would do what it did,'' Smart says. ``It
surprised everyone.''
 &HT;    The weekend the movie opened, people on the street began to
recognize the pretty blonde with the pale blue eyes and low-key
demeanor.
 &HT;    It wasn't exactly Beatlemania, but it was a welcome change.
 &HT;    ``It was very random and it happened when I least expected it,''
says Smart, who sits bundled up in her chair and laughs easily
during a conversation in a New York hotel suite.
 &HT;    ``Middle-aged mothers recognized me and I didn't expect them to
notice. I still don't know how or why they did,'' Smart shrugs.
 &HT;    ``It was an exciting weekend, but I didn't think my life
changed. `Varsity Blues' was an ensemble film, and there wasn't a
lot of hype before it came out, so it really didn't change
everything for me.
 &HT;    ``I do think `Varsity Blues' gave me more credibility going into
auditions _ it could have been my worst performance, but because it
was a hit people took notice of me. That can be distracting. They
see you in that role and think that's as far as you can go as an
actress.''
 &HT;    Smart has gone the distance in her 23 years. Born and reared in
Los Angeles, she steadily worked her way up the Hollywood ladder
after catching the bug at a drama class run by the noted teacher
Howard Fine.
 &HT;    ``I fell in love with the art of it,'' she says. ``I knew after
taking these classes _ and I was the youngest person in a group of
adults _ that I wanted to continue acting.
 &HT;    ``Then, with every job I got, it just kept getting better and
better. I still feel new at it and I've been doing this for almost
six years. There's still so much to learn and to grow from, but
each time I do something I know it feels right.''
 &HT;    Smart recently filmed a television pilot that didn't get picked
up and says she is ``this close'' to landing a role in a film she
won't mention by name.
 &HT;    Why jinx it, she figures, or embarrass herself if she doesn't
get the part? If she loses out it will likely go to one of the many
other well-regarded young actresses Smart so often finds herself
competing against: Claire Danes, Rachael Leigh Cook or her friend
and ``Varsity Blues'' co-star Ali Larter.
 &HT;    ``There have always been a lot of young actors, but now we're
all getting the roles because there are so many teen films,'' she
says. ``Personally, I don't want be this kind of overnight success
that's hyped up for a couple of years and then disappears.
 &HT;    ``I'm young and I'm still learning so much. I don't expect to
win an Academy Award in the next five or 10 years,'' Smart says
with a cheeky smile. ``Well, maybe in 10. Who knows?''
 &HT;    At first glance, her latest project may not be typical Oscar
material, but Smart shows her range in ``Outside Providence,'' a
comedy written by the Farrelly brothers, who were responsible for
1998's bad-taste sensation ``There's Something About Mary.''
 &HT;    Set in Pawtucket, R.I. in the 1970s, the new film tracks the
exploits of Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), a poor but decent kid
who lives with his widower father (Alec Baldwin), her
wheelchair-bound brother and a three-legged dog, and hangs out with
a group of grungy, rudderless pals.
 &HT;    When Dunphy crashes into a parked police car, his father trades
in some favors and ships him off to a fancy prep school. There, he
meets Jane (Smart), a well-off, well-adjusted girl, and the two
begin an unlikely romance.
 &HT;    ``Jane gives him motivation and inspiration, and she shows him a
whole different side of life ...'' Smart says enthusiastically.
``She has something to say and she has an impact on this guy's
life.
 &HT;    ``Through their relationship, they both experience new things.
She's inspired by his wild side, his rough edges and his endearing,
tender qualities ... She has a heart and she wants to learn,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    ``Providence,'' Smart says, also has heart. ``... And depth and
a lot of comedy that comes of out natural situations, which is
always the best kind of comedy.''
 &HT;    Wait a second. A movie with heart and depth? From the brothers
Farrelly, who not only unleashed ``Mary,'' but also made ``Dumber
and Dumber,'' as well as the taste-impaired ``Kingpin?''
 &HT;    Smart laughs.
 &HT;    ``I think people will be pleasantly surprised that it's a
Farrelly brothers movie, and that it's not over the top or
outrageously funny,'' says the actress, who filmed ``Outside
Providence'' well before ``Mary'' gave hair gel a whole new
meaning.
 &HT;    ``I think they'll reach an even wider audience with this.''
 &HT;    And so, too, might Smart.

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, Sarah
Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall in ``Sex and the City.'') 
 By ANITA GATES  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There will be no more dating.
 &HT;    There are several reasons for this, among them Neil LaBute
films, my advanced age, my last blind date (a man who pronounced
``theater'' to rhyme with ``free gator'' _ and he rejected me) and
HBO's ``Sex and the City.''
 &HT;    Especially ``Sex and the City.''
 &HT;    Have you seen this show? Sarah Jessica Parker and three other
good-looking actresses play single New Yorkers in their 30s who
repeatedly suffer horrible humiliations at the hands of men.
 &HT;    In one painful episode, Charlotte (Kristin Davis), an art
dealer, decides not to have sex on her first date with a handsome
man because she wants to get the relationship off to a better
start.
 &HT;    He says, sure, he understands and he respects her for it, and
he'll get her a taxi home. Then he jumps into the cab with her, so
he can go back to the party and pick up someone else.
 &HT;    ``I really want to have sex tonight,'' he explains politely.
 &HT;    During this half-hour tragicomedy's first season, Carrie, the
sex columnist (Parker) woke up after a tryst with a French
architect to find that he'd left her $1,000 in cash.
 &HT;    Samantha (Kim Cattrall), who's in public relations and is the
most gleefully promiscuous of the four women, dated a man who was
such a ``modelizer'' that he videotaped all his sexual encounters
with models. But when Samantha went to bed with him, he didn't
bother to turn on the camera.
 &HT;    Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), a levelheaded lawyer, had a better time
of it (although she was upset when everyone started talking about
sexual threesomes, and no one wanted to have one with her).
 &HT;    In one episode Miranda called an old boyfriend, Skipper, who
heard her voice on the answering machine and picked up the
telephone, even though he was in the middle of sex with the new
woman in his life.
 &HT;    In a short conversation he agreed to go back to Miranda and
explained that to the other woman, still in flagrante.
 &HT;    Yes, it's funny. The show, which recently began its 18-episode
second season (Wednesday nights at 8:30), is a hit for good reason.
 &HT;    But those of us who aren't out at Moomba (or wherever hip young
people go now) every night cannot watch without asking a couple of
crucial questions:
 &HT;    Are things really that bad for single women in New York these
days?
 &HT;    Does this show represent the sort of things that really happen?
 &HT;    That guy jumping into Charlotte's taxi, for instance. ``True
story,'' said Darren Star, the show's creator and executive
producer, in a telephone interview from Silvercup Studios in Long
Island City, Queens, N.Y., where the series is filmed.
 &HT;    ``There is nothing on the show that has not been, in one way or
the other, verified,'' he says. ``The stories I hear are endless
and horrifying and horrifyingly funny.''
 &HT;    Cattrall sees the situations in ``Sex and the City'' as
heightened versions of real life but not grossly exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It's awful for the men and for the women'' in real 1990s life,
she said. ``I think our empowerment has put men in some ways on the
defensive.''
 &HT;    Not that Cattrall has to worry about dating problems anymore.
Last September she married a man that she met at a Greenwich
Village jazz club. (She went there alone, and he came over to talk
to her.)
 &HT;    Parker has been married to Matthew Broderick since 1997, and the
two have been a couple since 1992.
 &HT;    Nixon has been in a committed relationship for 11 years, but
they never really dated, she said. She and her boyfriend, who now
have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter, had been friends since junior high
school. Then one day ``we kissed, and he moved in,'' she said.
 &HT;    Only Davis is unattached. Her most humiliating experience has
been finding her date's roommate's written comment about her beside
the phone: ``Kristin. Not funny or clever but single.'' It could
have been worse.
 &HT;    A visit to the ``Sex and the City'' set made it all look so
harmless. On a perfect spring afternoon, with the park's daffodils
in bloom, Parker and Cattrall stood at a pretzel cart at Central
Park West and 90th Street doing dialogue about the masculine habit
of looking at other women.
 &HT;    ``It's like I'm the amazing disappearing girlfriend,'' said
Parker, wearing a floral spaghetti-strap dress.
 &HT;    Cattrall, in a fabulous white coat, replied, ``Looking doesn't
mean he's buying the merchandise, sweetie.''
 &HT;    It could have been an exchange from a Neil Simon comedy.
 &HT;    Later, in her trailer between scenes, Parker said: ``I'd rather
be single in New York City than anywhere else in the world. There
are so many distractions. It's thrilling and sexy and combative,
and we live on top of each other, so at least we're not that
isolated.''
 &HT;    Nixon is sympathetic, too.
 &HT;    ``It's like running for the presidency: the dating obstacle
course,'' she said. ``You know, getting through it and succeeding
in it is not a very good judge of what you would be in a long-term
relationship. To succeed in the dating world you've got to be very
facile, you've got to blow your own horn, be confident, almost numb
to rejection. Which is exactly the opposite of what you want to be
in a relationship.''
 &HT;    ``It's sort of the problem with America in general,'' she added.
``We've become so obsessed with selling. Everything is advertising
now, even dating.''
 &HT;    Chris Noth, who plays Mr. Big, Carrie's on-again, off-again
grand passion, doesn't think very highly of contemporary dating
behavior either.
 &HT;    ``We're living in an adolescent age right now,'' he said, then
headed off to a scene in which his character panics when Carrie
asks for a key to his apartment.
 &HT;    In all fairness, ``Sex and the City'' sometimes makes dating
look just as hideous for men as for women. In one episode Carrie's
gay friend Stanford (Willie Garson) stands on Fifth Avenue waiting
for a man who has answered his personal ad.
 &HT;    When the man arrives, he takes one look at Stanford, says,
``Sorry, it's not going to happen,'' and walks away. As Stanford
later tells Carrie, ``It's so brutal out there.''
 &HT;    Whatever the case in the real world, ``Sex and the City'' itself
seems less romantically bleak this year, albeit much more risque.
 &HT;    So far this season Carrie has captured Mr. Big's attention
again, Samantha has discarded a boyfriend because of his anatomical
shortcomings, and Miranda has risen above it all and bought a huge
new apartment.
 &HT;    But she is now convinced that she will die alone, and that her
cat will eat half her face before anyone finds her.
 &HT;    Charlotte has had an unfortunate experience. After meeting a
great man in a cemetery, at his wife's grave, she comforts him,
beds him, gets all starry-eyed and then discovers that she's one of
four women he is stringing along during his time of need. The
secret is out when all four girlfriends turn up at the wife's grave
with armfuls of white lilies.
 &HT;    Mr. Star, whose first big television success was ``Melrose
Place,'' sees the show as equal-opportunity abuse. ``I think men
are slammed so badly,'' he said. ``It shows some of their worst
characteristics. My guy friends look at the show and say, `How can
you be doing that to men?' ''
 &HT;    Things are tough all over.

<P>
   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Hundreds of Albanians with tractors, cars
and trucks spread out across a hillside and for a mile along a
winding road Monday, blocking an advance column of Russian
peacekeepers from moving in to take charge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, mostly young men, but also families with young
children, bore placards in Albanian and English that read
``Russians killed us,'' and ``We don't trust Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long day on the isolated road, where cars and trucks
wound up into the hills beyond their blockade, they showed no signs
of backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them here because they fought here on the side
of the Serbs,'' said Vesel Vehapi, a farmer from a nearby village.
``We are scared of them from what happened before, and there is no
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have said Russian mercenaries fought beside the
Serbian militias in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Orahovac is one of the most tortured areas in Kosovo and as
such, a microcosm of the province's agony and continuing
insecurity. The area has the greatest concentration of mass graves
_ 75 in an area of 4 square miles _ and was where more than 1,000
people were massacred during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping officials say it also has the largest concentration
of war-crimes suspects still living in Kosovo, local Serbs who have
been named by witnesses and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of these Serbs, and others like them, is at the heart
of a tension that has been simmering in Kosovo since the end of the
war. The International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague has handed
down indictments against major Serbian figures, like President
Slobodan Milosevic, and sent scores of investigators to the
province to gather those cases.
</P>
<P>
   But many Albanians are interested in more personal, and pressing
questions, suspecting their former neighbors of burning their homes
and killing their relatives and eager for the kind of detailed
accounting the tribunal has no intention of providing them.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Tony van Loon, who commands the Dutch task force here,
said there are dozens of suspected war criminals in the Serbian
quarter and in a nearby Serbian village, Velika Hoca.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frenzy of killing,'' said Lt. Col. Tony van Loon, who
commands the Dutch task force here, referring to March and April
when violence by Serbs was frequent. ``People were shot in the legs
and then burned when their house was set on fire. A baby was found
with its head chopped off. There is tremendous rage among the
Albanians when they find their family members dead when they
return.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Monday, inside the Albanian blockade, within an even
tighter blockade of Dutch troops, the city's 2,500 Serbs live in a
small cluster of narrow steep streets, clustered around the Serbian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   They are the source of much of the tension, and the main reason
behind the Albanians' aversion to letting Russian troops deploy in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch troops guard the ends of the streets with huge
self-propelled guns pointing outwards. They are guarding the Serbs
from attacks by vengeful Albanians, but they are also preventing
the Serbs from leaving, to make sure the war-crimes suspects living
there do not escape. Only a few Serbs are allowed to leave each
day, taken out under the protection of the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the quarter, which the residents themselves liken to a
ghetto, there is a dead, dispirited air, but also a lingering trace
of menace. People hang around the streets buying or selling a few
vegetables or sweets. Young men in tracksuits swagger along with
nowhere to go. Older men sit on street corners and question
strangers as to who they are and what they want.
</P>
<P>
   According to van Loon, there are dozens of suspected war
criminals in the Serbian quarter and in a nearby Serbian village,
Velika Hoca.
</P>
<P>
   The tension soared on Friday when Dutch troops received orders
to hand over the sector to Russian peacekeepers and move east to
another area in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time they got the go ahead to arrest three local
Serbian leaders, which they did without incident, with the help of
German military police. They had been investigating the three men
in connection with war-crimes accusations for some time and had
been watching their movements.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the wives and relatives of the three arrested men were
cloistered in the walled garden of a house in the Serbian quarter,
looking scared and trapped. They said they had not been informed of
what, if anything, the men had been charged with.
</P>
<P>
   Vesna Kolasinac said she had no idea why her husband, Andjelko
Kolasinac, the mayor of Orahovac, had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no responsibility for mobilization during the war. He
was only involved in things like the water supply, and the
electricity supply. The reason he stayed behind was because he did
not do anything bad, and that can be confirmed by 90 percent of
Albanians, if they are honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever committed the crimes, they have run away. Only the
innocent are left behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Simic said the same about her husband, Vekoslav Simic, 37,
the former chief of the town hospital and for the last two months
the only working doctor in the Serbian quarter. ``He was involved
in humanitarian things, not politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The third man arrested was Stanislav Levic, who worked at a
flour mill.
</P>
<P>
   The order to arrest the men came from the U.N. mission in
Kosovo, said Capt. Mike Bos, spokesman for the Dutch task force
here. U.N. police and a representative of the international war
crimes tribunal from the Hague were present during the arrest, a
German policeman confirmed, and Bos said the arrests were made
based on evidence collected by tribunal investigators. But no
charges or indictments have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the leaders,'' the policeman said of the three men.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The men appear to have aided and even orchestrated the campaign
of ethnic cleansing in and around the town of Orahovac. As
community leaders they are expected to be charged with organizing
the campaign, rather than doing the killing themselves, said Fehmi
Cena, chief pediatrician at the town hospital and acting president
of the Albanian-run Council for Human Rights in Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Both Kolasinac and Simic worked with the military and were seen
in uniform during the war, he said. Kolasinac, the mayor, was a
more reasonable type, Cena said. ``At least you could talk to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simic, the doctor, was a known extremist, he said. ``The
people think that he is one of the Serb chauvinists who created
ethnic cleansing of Orahovac,'' Cena said. ``He examined many of
the bodies of those killed during this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men were taken to the southern town of Prizren and are
thought to be still there, where the families understand they will
be detained pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if the men have or will be removed to the Hague
for trial. Their arrest brings the number of people detained on
suspicion of having committed war crimes in Kosovo to about 15.
There are more Serbian suspects in both Orahovac and Velika Hoca
under investigation, Dutch and German officers confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs will remain blockaded in their own ghetto, trapped
with their own horrors. A woman called to reporters from her
upstairs room that her son was kidnapped two months ago. ``I want
to tell you, it is all the fault of the evil, nationalist politics
of Slobodan Milosevic,'' she said, weeping into a handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the Serbs say they want to leave for Serbia, but
for now they are stuck. The Russians, when they come, are unlikely
to help them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Russians are stuck too. An advance unit drove
several times up toward the protesters Monday and then turned back.
Their commanders were negotiating with Dutch and German troops and
local community leaders, they said.
</P>
<P>
   When they do arrive in Orahovac, they will inherit a cauldron of
tension. ``The situation is very difficult,'' said a German
military policeman on duty in the Serb quarter. ``The Albanians are
scared, the Serbs are scared, and the two communities hate each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Loon, in an interview last week, said, ``Anyone who expects
the enmity to end between the Serbs and the Albanians is a wild
optimist.'' And the political decision to send Russian troops here
will complicate things further. ``It will set us a whole lot of
steps back,'' he warned.

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Malcolm McDowell, the actor who became a role-model for young
sociopaths when he played the ``ultra-violent'' Alex in Stanley
Kubrick's classic ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), is reading a fax
from Hugh Hefner.
 &HT;    It's only a few months after Kubrick's death, and the Playboy
publisher has just screened ``Clockwork'' for a handful of friends.
 &HT;    Hefner has sent McDowell a couple of questions about the movie.
 &HT;    One is about the brutal water torture scene. The other is about
sex.
 &HT;    ``Hef is a very bright observer of film, but he always wants to
know more,'' McDowell says.
 &HT;    ``He wants to know about the underwater scene in `Clockwork.' He
wants to know if I had an air hose in the water to sustain myself
... And somebody else wants to know why I didn't get an erection
during the orgy scene.''
 &HT;    McDowell laughs uproariously.
 &HT;    ``I told him there were a few other actors around and I was
feeling quite shy that day,'' he adds.
 &HT;    McDowell, 56, has never been known as a shy one.
 &HT;    It's been nearly three decades since he played the ruthless punk
with a penchant for Beethoven in the Kubrick film, which is still
considered so violent it is banned in Britain. McDowell has worked
steadily ever since, but ``Clockwork'' is the film he is best
remembered for and the performance against which all of his work
has been measured.
 &HT;    ``Critics said it was the `performance of a lifetime,'''
McDowell shrugs. ``The only problem is that it came very early in
my career. And you can't keep that level of art up. That type of
movie is so wonderful and special, it only comes along maybe once
in an actor's life.''
 &HT;    ``Clockwork'' became McDowell's calling card after Kubrick saw
him play an insolent schoolboy in Lindsay Anderson's
anti-establishment ``If...'' (1968) and sent him Anthony Burgess'
novel.
 &HT;    ``Stanley sent me the book and said simply, `Read it. Call me.'
Well, I read it three times and I said, `This is marvelous, but how
the hell will you do this as a movie?'
 &HT;    ``Stanley said, `Oh, I don't think that will be a problem.'
 &HT;    When McDowell paused to consider the offer, the irascible
Kubrick asked him: ``Look do you want to do this part or not?''
 &HT;    ``It was a magical shoot,'' McDowell recalls. ``Just to be on
the set with Stanley Kubrick and see him laughing was spectacular.
I remember Stanley putting an actual hanky in his mouth during
certain scenes just so he would stop laughing.''
 &HT;    McDowell also remembers painful moments playing the snarling
delinquent Alex, including the filming of one sequence in which his
character's eyes are propped open and he is forced to watch a
series of violent and terrifying film clips.
 &HT;    ``I actually scratched my cornea and had to walk around putting
antiseptic in my eyes.'' McDowell says. ``Of course, I can't really
complain. I got to work with a great man.''
 &HT;    In the end, McDowell says, he had a somewhat turbulent
relationship with the late director.
 &HT;    ``I would have liked to have settled things with Stanley,''
McDowell says. ``We had a few issues: First of all, I was upset
with his withdrawal from my life after the film shoot was over. I
found that very difficult to understand at my young age.
 &HT;    ``I didn't grasp the fact that you move on after a film. I
thought we had become best friends.''
 &HT;    There were also financial disagreements.
 &HT;    ``He used me,'' McDowell says without much malice. ``Stanley
cheated me out of a percent of the grosses ... I wasn't paid what I
should have been paid in the end.''
 &HT;    ``I guess it's all water under the bridge,'' McDowell sighs.
Today, McDowell is looking back at his career in more ways than
one.
 &HT;    His 1980 film ``Caligula,'' co-starring Peter O'Toole, Helen
Mirren and John Gielgud, will be re-released in America in
September.
 &HT;    Produced by Bob Guccione and Penthouse magazine, it was the
called the first $15 porno movie. In excruciating detail, it told
the story of the Roman emperor's life and included scenes of
decapitation and disemboweling in addition to six minutes of
hardcore sex footage that made it a cult classic.
 &HT;    ``The movie has made more money than any other film I've ever
done,'' McDowell says, laughing. ``I credit the porn.''
 &HT;    The actor says the ``Caligula'' shoot was a heated one for other
reasons.
 &HT;    ``All I remember about that one is trying to make it through the
week and wracking my brain to find ways to keep going,'' McDowell
says. ``It was a tough shoot. We didn't have a script. Our original
director Gore Vidal walked off. And I was Gore's man. I was
devastated when he left.''
 &HT;    Enter new director Tinto Brass. McDowell was not a happy Roman.
 &HT;    ``I was left all alone on this movie where no one could write or
speak English,'' he says, citing further headaches he says were
caused by Penthouse founder Guccione.
 &HT;    ``He owned the film. He owns everything,'' McDowell gripes. ``I
made it clear where I stood. I said, `Mr. Guccione, you have hired
me for 10 weeks. You don't own me.'''
 &HT;    Ownership is also the theme of McDowell's latest film.
 &HT;    ``My Life So Far'' is a pre-World War II period piece which
stars McDowell as a wealthy, self-made Scottish landowner with a
beautiful young fiancee (Irene Jacob).
 &HT;    McDowell says that, in marked contrast to his stint on
``Caligula,'' making the new film was one of the best experiences
of his career.
 &HT;    ``It takes place over a beautiful summer and wants to tell a
story about what family is and what family isn't,'' he says, adding
that he liked playing a vulnerable man, not the kind of part he is
usually offered. He is currently in London playing a more typical
role in the mob film ``Gangster 1.''
 &HT;    ``It's a very violent, profane and brilliant piece in the same
vein as `Reservoir Dogs,''' he says. ``It's about the rise and fall
of the very first gangster ... It's also about a man's descent into
madness.''
 &HT;    McDowell, whose films include ``Voyage of the Damned'' (1976),
``Cat People'' (1982) and ``The Player''(1992), grew up in Leeds,
England as the son of a pub owner and says he always planned to
become an actor.
 &HT;    ``The first time I stepped on stage, I felt all the tension
leave my body,'' he recalls. ``Of course, I was nervous before the
play started. But as soon as the lights went up, I was totally
relaxed.''
 &HT;    After brief stints working at his father's bar, in a coffee
factory and as a regional salesman, he began taking acting lessons.
He gave up his odd jobs when was hired at a repertory theater
company on the Isle of Wight. A year later, he was accepted into
the Royal Shakespeare Company.
 &HT;    He has never looked back, and remains one of the hardest working
actors in the business.
 &HT;    Last season, he took on the Ricardo Montalban role as the
mysterious, white-suited host in an ill-fated re-creation of the
hit television series ``Fantasy Island.''
 &HT;    And this year, in addition to the British gangster role, he is
playing a wizard in a re-make of the French time-travel comedy
``The Visitors.''
 &HT;    ``I know I should take a bit of time off, but they keep asking
me to play these wonderful parts, '' McDowell says.
 &HT;    ``And it's funny because even now I still feel like every role
could be my last.''

QUAKE SHAKES ATTITUDES TOWARD `FATHER STATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN GORVETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ Handing out everything from water to blankets to
diapers from the backs of trucks, pickups, and cars, thousands of
ordinary Turks have been rallying to help out since the very first
day of the country's worst earthquake this century.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they also may have ushered in political and social
changes that could have far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are learning civic solidarity again,'' says columnist Oral
Calisor of the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet. ``We are learning what
we can do for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of a dozen line workers from the Ford Otosan car factory
south of the stricken town of Yalova got to the scene well in
advance of army and municipal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our colleagues were from here,'' said Omer Selcuk, as
his workmates shifted rubble from the collapsed roof of what had
once been a five-story apartment block. ``So we got together, asked
the boss for some tools, a generator, and a winch and headed down
here. When we arrived, there was nobody official at all here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quake-ravaged Istanbul district of Avcilar, Asena Erdem
and friends from her street in an unaffected part of the city moved
in last Wednesday with an impromptu field kitchen, assembled from
anything they had on hand in their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard,'' she said. ``We have done all this completely
by ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people have volunteered to help,'' said Turkish Red
Crescent worker Oznur Onen at a tent city set up outside Izmit to
house 5,000 of the devastated city's homeless. ``I've never seen
anything like this in Turkey before.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Haluk Sahin of the daily Radikal sees in this
outpouring of public self-organization a radical shift in
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of coordination and paralysis of the government in
the first 48 hours of the crisis was a very dramatic demonstration
that it was not capable of dealing with an emergency,'' he said.
``In Turkey, people tend to expect everything from the state. It's
very different from the US. People here have a phrase _ ``father
state'' _ and an idea that everything will come from there. But
this time, the state's sons and daughters took their own
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, things must change,'' said Calisor. ``This state is
organized for killing, not living. We have the sixth-biggest army
in the world, the largest in Europe, but no civil organizations
because the state always puts so much pressure on them that they
don't have a chance. The vacuum got filled though by the ordinary
people themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   One government minister agreed Monday that the quake, which
killed more than 12,000 people, had exposed an administrative
system that was unprepared and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This earthquake is a declaration of bankruptcy for the Turkish
political and administrative system that lacks a city planning
policy,'' said Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu.
</P>
<P>
   Political and military leaders met Monday in Ankara to discuss
the earthquake crisis, but there was little expectation that any
heads would roll, except perhaps that of Health Minister Osman
Durmus, who told reporters on Sunday that Turkey did not need any
help from foreigners and said on Turkish TV that the nation did not
want any ``Greek blood'' in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread public anger at the ineffectiveness of the
government is unlikely to benefit any one faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``No party can say that they are completely clean in this,''
said Sahin, ``so none of them can really move against the other in
parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists, the main opposition party, have been widely
accused of turning a blind eye to shoddy construction practices,
held to be a major cause of the huge death toll. Many of the
buildings that collapsed were built in Islamist-governed
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   For now, one week after the quake first hit, burying the dead
and dealing with the immediate humanitarian disaster is uppermost
in most people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we should not forget how it was,'' said Selcuk in the
ruins of Yalova. ``We won't forget it.''

1,500-METER FINAL PITS IMPRESARIO, UPSTART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ To glimpse the future, Hicham El Guerrouj need
only look behind him. There, just a literal breath from his
shoulder, the magnificent Moroccan will see _ has already seen _ a
young Kenyan coming perilously close to claiming that future for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to it,'' said Noah Ngeny, undaunted about
facing defending world champion El Guerrouj in the men's 1,500
meter final Tuesday night at the World Championships of Track and
Field.
</P>
<P>
   As does everyone else. The matchup of impresario El Guerrouj and
upstart Ngeny, who staged a rare and precious duel last month as El
Guerrouj added the mile world record to his 1,500 mark, is one of
the most eagerly awaited of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' said Kim McDonald, Ngeny's agent. ``It may
be the race of the championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: World records at the middle distances are usually
set with a clock as the only true opponent, but on July 7, when the
24-year-old Moroccan shattered the world mile record in a stunning
3 minutes 43.13 seconds in Rome, Ngeny was ticking just as
relentlessly and almost as precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Both men actually bettered the record, as the 20-year-old
Kenyan's finishing time of 3:43:40 came in under the previous mark
of 3:44.39, set by Algeria's Noureddine Morceli in 1993. (Morceli
will be in the final, as will favorite son Fermin Cacho of Spain,
who is the European champion, and American Steve Holman.)
</P>
<P>
   Although no time was recorded at the 1,500 meters in Rome, both
men are thought to have also bettered El Guerrouj's world record of
3:26. Nonetheless, Ngeny soon became the third-fastest man in
history at the distance, behind only El Guerrouj and Morceli,
thanks to a 3:28.84 performance July 23 in Paris. And despite
taking a convincing beating by El Guerrouj earlier this month (``I
have struck a psychological blow for the world championships,'' El
Guerrouj said after that race), Ngeny is seen as both capable of an
upset here and of challenging El Guerrouj in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both very young,'' said McDonald. ``I think they will
go on and push each other for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both camps believe the pair will whittle the mile and 1,500
records by at least another two seconds over the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Not that El Guerrouj has needed a lot of pushing. Often compared
to Moroccan great Said Aouita, El Guerrouj won 38 of his 40 races
between 1996 and 1998, and is undefeated this season. Despite the
two world records, however, he is probably best known for the
sickening fall he took just before the bell lap in the 1,500 meters
at the 1996 Olympics, when he clipped Morceli's trail leg and
fought to regain his balance before dropping to the track. After
picking himself up, he finished last; Morceli went on to win the
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed and weeping, he received a telephone call moments later
from King Hassan II, who reassured him he was still a winner to his
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if another El Guerrouj was born at that moment,'' he
said later, explaining the zeal with which he has since run.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was sidelined briefly by a severe case of
hemorrhoids soon after his record-breaking run last month, El
Guerrouj appears back in form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can run faster than 3.26 here, because I am feeling
really good,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Ngeny, who at the age of 18 broke Jim Ryun's 1966 world junior
mile record (3:50.41) and was actually a pace-setter in El
Guerrouj's world-record 1,500 last year, has little reason to be
intimidated by his Moroccan rival. But neither, he insists, is he
motivated by him.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly perplexed by the notion, the Kenyan barely out of his
teens answered simply: ``He's my competition.''

2,000 US MARINES ARRIVE FOR QUAKE RELIEF DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS KEARSARGE _ US Marines in Izmit Bay readied
themselves Monday to join the relief effort to help Turkey recover
from the earthquake that killed more than 12,000 people last week.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 Marines, who were last in Kosovo providing
security and ferrying aid after the NATO bombing operation against
Serbian forces, arrived on ships of the Sixth Fleet, which patrols
in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the USS Kearsarge, the largest of the three ships that
make up the quick response force sent here, Marines prepared
transport helicopters, operating rooms, and water purification
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go out it's a different type of situation, but
we are trained for humanitarian assistance and for security
operations and basically, whatever it is, we will do it well,''
said Marine Corporal Irving Barney, a 25-year-old from Watertown,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission now is to help the hundreds of thousands of people
made homeless by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit were already
in the hard-hit Izmit region _ a mainly middle-class region where
tens of thousands of apartment buildings either collapsed or were
heavily damaged _ trying to assess needs.
</P>
<P>
   With electricity still out in many areas, water lines cut and
many roads blocked by rubble, the Marines expect that much of their
job will be to provide clean drinking water and get aid where it is
most needed.
</P>
<P>
   International organizations have sent planeloads of medical
supplies, blankets, and plastic sheeting to protect people living
outside, but part of the problem has been getting the materials
from the Istanbul airport to survivors a few hours' drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Roads are blocked in some towns and cities, and the airport is
overcrowded because of the large numbers of planes bringing donated
supplies from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,532-ton USS Kearsarge carries 26 helicopters, some of
which can transport heavy machinery that can clear roads, extract
bodies from the rubble, or tear down heavily damaged buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are living in tents in parks and
empty lots, without running water, few toilets, and almost no
showers.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish authorities and volunteers are handing out bottled water
in areas where water mains are broken, but there are fears it may
not be enough to prevent the spread of water-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Three US ships _ the USS Kearsarge arrived with the smaller USS
Gunston Hall and USS Ponce _ have brought in mobile water
purification systems and can produce clean water that can be
shipped by barge along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   With hospitals damaged by the quake, the ships are ready to step
in with medical assistance. Together they have six operating rooms,
five X-ray suites, 47 beds for intensive care, and 588 extra beds.
</P>
<P>
   In the medical care unit of the USS Kearsarge, Navy personnel
stacked supplies in rooms once used for office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing for the expected and the unexpected, we've
broken out additional supplies, and we're ready,'' said First Class
Navy Corpsman Brent Davis, a 29-year-old Virginia native.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is part of a large US relief effort that was
mobilized after the quake shook northwestern Turkey, leaving some
30,000 people believed still buried under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Two US search and rescue teams have been among those combing the
rubble for survivors, a Navy field hospital was set up to help with
emergency operations, planeloads of supplies have been coming in,
and disease experts were sent to help Turkey evaluate potential
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial response focused on saving lives,'' said US
Ambassador Mark Parris at a news conference on the ship. ``In
recent days the focus has shifted to meeting long-term health and
medical needs of the population, and the Kearsarge can make a
direct contribution.''

UNIVERSITIES SEEK RESEARCH FUNDS FROM CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Mont., Pa., Ala., Hawaii, Mass., Alaska)  (lb) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, members of Congress have slipped
millions of dollars into spending bills to build dams and highways
back home. Increasingly, the money is going to academic studies of
papaya viruses, wood pulp, auto safety and the aurora borealis.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are lobbying to get money directly from Congress,
rather than from federal foundations and institutes, in a process
that critics say often sacrifices good science for politics. By
getting provisions _ called earmarks _ inserted into spending
bills, universities and their lobbyists have obtained over $7
billion since 1980. Earmarked legislation in this year's federal
budget was a record $797 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same phenomenon that used to result in sewers and
bridges,'' said Bob Park, a physics professor at the University of
Maryland and director of the Washington office of the American
Physical Society, an organization of more than 40,000 physicists.
``Academic science has now replaced the sewers as the place where
the money goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal money for research traditionally has come from
institutions like the National Science Foundation after proposals
go through a rigorous process of review by scientific panels.
Supporters of that process call it a meritocracy run by scientists
and academics, rather than a struggle for political pork.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of earmarking, like John Silber, chancellor of
Boston University, one of the largest beneficiaries of such money,
say it merely allows academics to appeal directly to the source of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about sordid _ they'd better read the
Constitution,'' said Silber, whose university has received over $57
million, including $48 million for two science centers. ``I've got
a right to appeal to the Congress. Every citizen does. If that's
dirty, the whole country's dirty. The Constitution's dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of academic earmarking say the practice distorts good
science. ``If politicians' decisions govern where research money is
spent, you will not necessarily set the right kinds of scientific
and national priorities,'' said Robert Walker, who was a Republican
House member from Pennsylvania for 20 years before retiring in
1997. ``The concern is that we jeopardize the long-term knowledge
base of the country by spending money in a political rather than a
scientific way.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker added: ``The universities are also at fault; they came to
town shopping for this kind of representation. I think it's been
very destructive. I had some testy sessions with deans and
presidents saying they were damaging their own credibility as well
as scientific policy. I asked one what he was going to use the
money for. He didn't know but said he was sure it would come in
handy.''
</P>
<P>
   James D. Savage, a professor of government at the University of
Virginia who wrote the only book on the subject, ``Funding Science
in America: Congress, Universities and the Politics of the Academic
Pork Barrel,'' said Congress and the public ``have no idea how the
$7 billion has been used to meet national needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Earmarking _ the word comes from a farmer's notching of a hog's
ear as a mark of ownership _ is an act of legislative legerdemain
that is used for many types of spending. A member of Congress
inserts a short paragraph in a spending bill, ordering that money
be spent on a certain program in a certain place. The insertion
usually occurs in a closed-door conference without public debate.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarking language is often deliberately obscure _ for example,
creating a tax break for a university ``established on Aug. 6,
1872,'' without naming the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarks sometimes seem to have little direct relationship to
the spending bills in which they appear. The foreign aid bill for
the coming year, for example, contains $485,000 for an agribusiness
program at the University of Idaho and $1 million for a soil
management project at Montana State University.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, millions of dollars were included in a last-minute
$500 billion omnibus spending bill that passed in October. Examples
include $1 million for Kings College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to
explore commercial pulverization technologies and a donation of a
$375,000 Coast Guard patrol boat to the University of South Alabama
for use in a scientific project.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken months for The Chronicle of Higher Education, which
tracks academic earmarks, to decode the legislative language used
to disguise them.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarks are often the work of a lobbying firm. In a filing last
year with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Washington
lobbying firm Cassidy &AMP; Associates, which said it had annual
revenues of more than $40 million, listed 30 colleges and
universities among its clients. It also said it intended to name
Silber as an outside director. Boston University paid the firm
$760,000 in 1998 for its assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, an increasing number of colleges and
universities have found it easier to go to Congress, keepers of the
government's purse, with the help of lobbyists than to go through
time-consuming peer-reviewed proposals. Congress can often provide
more money more quickly than institutions like the National
Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A disproportionate amount of money flows to universities and
colleges in states and congressional districts represented by
lawmakers who are experienced in the appropriations process or who
are members of the appropriations committees.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the largest recipient of academic earmarks between
1980 and 1996 was the University of Hawaii, with $197 million,
Savage said. Hawaii's senior senator, Daniel Inouye, a Democrat, is
a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest recipient was the University of Pittsburgh,
with $151 million. The university is the alma mater of Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa., who has long served on the House Appropriations
Committee. Universities in Alabama have gained millions of dollars
since its senior senator, Richard Shelby, a Republican, rose in
rank on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarks in next year's spending bills benefiting the home
states of these three lawmakers include $500,000 for Auburn
University in Alabama to run a transportation management program,
$293,000 for the University of Hawaii to study the papaya ringspot
virus and $1 million for Pennsylvania State University to study
automobile accidents among older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Silber said the argument that earmarked appropriations were
dirty while peer review was pure _ a view expressed by the
Association of American Universities even though most of its 62
institutions have received earmarked money _ helped entrench an
elite group of universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley and Columbia _ all of those hogs
at the trough in the AAU _ they are the establishment,'' Silber
said. ``They don't want a new boy. You can sit there on the outside
and break your nose pushing against the glass. There are spiteful
individuals in the establishment who resent the fact that every now
and then a new boy gets in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Park said that ``the science community sees earmarking as
threatening the whole purity of peer review, resulting in serious
mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   Park cited as an example the efforts of Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, now chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars have gone to Alaskan universities to harness
the power of the aurora borealis, the electrical energy shimmering
in the northern skies, an objective that many consider elusive, at
best. The earmarks also financed, among other things, ``a
supercomputer north of the Arctic Circle'' without naming the
University of Alaska as the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only factor,'' Park said of getting an earmark
appropriation, ``is whether you've got the ear of a congressman who
sits on the right committee. It can cause a lot of trouble.''

NEW AIRPORT'S LOCATION EYED IN HONG KONG CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN AND JOYCE HORCHUNG LAU AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Sunday's fiery crash of a Taiwanese passenger jet
trying to land in typhoon winds has left some wondering whether
this city's year-old, ultra-modern $20.2 billion airport was built
in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   The crash fueled speculation that the location of new Hong Kong
airport, on landfill astride a mountainous island, may make its two
runways more vulnerable to dangerous wind shear and crosswinds,
especially during storms.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the 12th reported fatal crash involving planes
operated by Taiwan-based China Airlines, leading some aviation
analysts to worry about the effect on the reputation of the Asian
aviation industry in general.
</P>
<P>
   Seven China Airlines crashes since the 1980s have claimed 542
lives _ one of the worst safety records in Asia, alongside Korean
Air and Garuda Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Two people, a Portuguese woman and a Taiwanese man, were killed
as the right wing of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 scraped the runway
on landing, leaving a trail of fire and flipping over onto its
back. More than 200 passengers were injured, and 60 people remained
in hospitals Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been a bad year for the MD-11 aircraft. At least 240
people have perished in MD-11 accidents in the last year, including
a Swissair crash over Nova Scotia and a Korean Air crash in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash came as Hong Kong was lashed by Typhoon Sam,
which brought gale force winds and rains that halted bus and ferry
services and shuttered shops. The airport remained open, as it does
except in the most severe typhoon warning.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials defended its location, calling it
``appropriate'' for safety. ``The meteorological phenomena there is
not the cause of the accident,'' said Albert Lam, director of the
Civil Aviation Department. He also said typhoon warnings that shut
down businesses and public transport have ``no direct relation on
whether or not the airplanes can land.''
</P>
<P>
   But aviation analysts questioned who should have final say on
whether it is safe to land in poor weather. The Hong Kong
Observatory says its system of giving weather updates to
air-traffic controllers, who pass alerts on to pilots, is the best
in the world. As at most airports, the pilots decide whether to
land.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Eckes, managing director of Hong Kong-based Indoswiss
Aviation consultants, suggested Hong Kong should be considered an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is decided that Hong Kong has a propensity for heavy
crosswinds or wind shear, the authorities may decide to
preventively close the airport during bad weather. But the
government may be embarassed politically to make that decision,''
he said, because it could imply the airport's design was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Wind shear occurs when a strong wind changes directions
suddenly, sometimes in a matter of seconds, often forcing the
airplane's nose down. Two months ago, 11 flights diverted from Hong
Kong to other airports during Typhoon Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind shear is a problem of terrain. Winds do all sorts of
funny things with mountains,'' said Stephen Miller, managing
director of Hong Kong-based Trinity Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the new airport, with runways abutting Lantau
Island's 3,300-foot-high peaks, was questioned by industry insiders
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport project _ at $20.2 billion the
most expensive in the world counting related infrastructure _ has
been fraught with controversy since work on it began under the
former British colonial government in 1989. After many delays, it
opened July 6 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the airport encountered mishaps, from chaotic cargo
operations that left tons of goods stranded at warehouses, to lost
luggage, delays, and errant flight displays. Even the brand-new
toilets were stopped up at first.
</P>
<P>
   After early bugs were ironed out, however, the airport became
popular with travellers for its efficiency, spaciousness, speedy
public transport system, and architectural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Asian airlines accounted for one-third of all crashes worldwide
over the last five years _ three of the seven fatal crashes last
year _ though they represent just 20 percent of all air traffic,
according to Airclaims, Ltd., a British insurer.

   NEW YORK _ Yields on Treasury securities hovered at their lowest

the Federal Reserve, which was expected to raise interest rates
Tuesday, would not do so again this year.

   Buying Monday was also influenced briefly by the dollar's early
weakness against the yen, even though it later recovered. Foreign
investors are always a little wary of snapping up Treasuries when
the dollar is down against other currencies because that situation
raises the possibility of a loss when investors convert dollar
proceeds into their own currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors and economists expect the Fed to raise the
federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate among banks, by a
quarter percentage point, to 5.25 percent, when the policy-setting
Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, there's more uncertainty about other related
issues,'' said Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc.,
``such as the nature of the operating policy directive adopted at
the FOMC, when the Fed might raise its current 4.5 percent discount
rate, and the Fed's future actions at the following FOMC meeting on
Oct. 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he did not expect the Fed to announce a tightening
bias, even though such a directive initially sent a misleading
signal to the markets after the previous FOMC session on June 29
and 30, when the Fed also tightened. At that time, the financial
markets initially rallied on the hope the Fed was finished
tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Blankman, a Treasury market analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's
MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said:
``The focus will be on reading smoke signals from the wording of
the announcement, the policy directive and the discount rate. We
believe the Fed is apt to tread cautiously, in order to leave all
the options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Blankman predicted that the rate increase expected
Tuesday might be the lone policy move for the remainder of 1999.
``As for the text of the announcement, we doubt the FOMC will back
itself into a corner by issuing an overtly friendly message about
the future course of policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At most, the Fed could note that inflation is still tame and
that GDP growth was appreciably slower in the second quarter,''
Blankman added, referring to the gross domestic product. ``The Fed
may prefer the short and sweet approach in order to keep the market
from making any unwarranted assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the international environment remained a wild card for
Treasuries. ``Weakness in the dollar is still a source of concern,
and the market will continue to eye prospects for intervention by
the Bank of Japan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury will auction two-year notes on Wednesday. ``The day
after the presumed Fed rate hike,'' Blankman said, ``so a dismal
auction would not be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the weekly bill auction was weak _ especially in the
shorter bill, which was awarded at 4.85 percent, while the
six-month bill came in at 4.95 percent.

MOST QUESTIONS ABOUT HONG KONG AIR CRASH BEGIN WITH THE AIRLINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ As investigators pored over the wreckage of a China
Airlines plane that crash-landed here Sunday night, aviation
experts began asking questions about the company, Taiwan's flagship
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the jet, with 315 passengers and crew members, try to
land during a howling typhoon that had driven other airlines to
cancel or divert flights? Why has China Airlines had four major
accidents in the past six years, the worst safety record in Asia?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been trying to improve, but how can you defend it when
you've lost four airplanes since 1993?'' asked Nicholas Ionides,
the Singapore-based editor of Air Transport Intelligence, a news
agency that covers the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Hong Kong and Taiwan would not speculate on the
cause of the crash, which killed 2 people and injured 212. But the
chairman of China Airlines, Chiang Hung-i expressed deep apologies
for the accident, which he said was ``possibly caused by the
typhoon.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the airline declined to comment on the crash or
on the airline's safety record.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, Flight CI-642 from Bangkok, was landing in heavy wind
and rain at Hong Kong's new $9-billion international airport when
its right wing touched the runway. Witnesses said the plane, a
McDonnell Douglas MD-11, flipped over and skidded to a stop before
being engulfed by flames that apparently began when its right
engine scraped the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government said that of the 212 injured
passengers, 152 had been treated and released. Sixty remain in
several local hospitals, two in critical and six in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The crash bore eerie similarities to two other recent China
Airlines crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a China Airlines Airbus A300 crashed while trying to
land in rain and fog at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
in Taipei, Taiwan, killing 196 passengers and crew and 7 people on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a China Airlines 747 overshot the runway while landing
in a typhoon at Hong Kong's old airport, Kai Tak. That accident
injured 23 people; the plane had to be fished out of Victoria
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   China Airlines suffered its deadliest crash in 1994 when an
Airbus A300 crashed while landing in Nagoya, Japan, killing all 264
aboard. The weather that day was fine; an investigation found that
the pilots had tried to override the plane's autopilot, which was
aborting the landing.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation experts lay the blame for the safety problems
at China Airlines on its senior pilots, most of whom are drawn from
the Taiwan Air Force. The experts said these pilots tend to be
authoritarian figures who are not open to dissenting opinions from
their co-pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But the plane that crashed here Sunday was piloted by an
Italian, Gerardo Lettich, 58, who joined China Airlines in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chang Kuo-cheng, the deputy director of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration in Taiwan, said the co-pilot had noticed the plane
was tilting 15 degrees as it came in to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the co-pilot found something wrong in the angle of the
plane in approaching the airport, he asked the pilot to `go
around,''' Chang said at a news conference, citing a report filed
by the co-pilot. ``But the pilot did not act, and then a wing of
the plane hit the ground.'' Industry experts said China Airlines
was taking steps to improve safety, such as recertifying its pilots
and recruiting more foreigners. It has hired the German airline,
Lufthansa, to help tighten its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the plane should have landed in such tempestuous
conditions is another question. The weather observatory had hoisted
a No. 8 cyclone warning signal, indicating winds of 39 miles to 73
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials in Hong Kong said that it is routine to
operate the airport during typhoons, but that it is up to the
airlines to decide whether to land. By the time Flight CI-642
arrived in Hong Kong, 3 incoming and 3 outgoing flights had been
canceled, 10 incoming flights had been diverted and 14 outbound
flights had been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong's new airport is not an easy place to land a
plane,'' said David A. Sherman, who specializes in transportation
at A.T. Kearney, a global consulting firm. ``When there are strong
winds, it creates a lot of challenging turbulence.''
</P>
<P>
   While pilots are trained and planes are designed to land in such
conditions, Sherman said, there is a higher risk. ``The question is
whether it is a reasonable risk to take,'' he said.

GROUP RECOMMENDS USE OF PRIVATE FUNDS TO PRODUCE STEM CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal funds should be used to speed research and development
of human embryonic stem cells for a variety of potential treatments
and cures, says a preliminary report from the nation's largest
scientific group on the controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile cells, which are formed soon after conception, can
change into any type of cell in the body. Many scientists believe
the cells will eventually be harnessed in unprecedented ways to
repair damaged and diseased tissue throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the enthusiasm of others that (stem cell research)
will offer the real possibility for cures and treatments for many
diseases for which adequate therapies do not exist,'' says the
report.
</P>
<P>
   But the working group of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science recommends against allowing public funds to
be spent in destroying embryos to obtain the stem cells. The cells
could be extracted from human embryos in the private sector; once
transferred to laboratory dishes, the cells could be used in
publicly funded research, says the AAAS report.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the cells remains a controversial issue because
human embryos are destroyed in the process of isolating the stem
cells from them.
</P>
<P>
   One logical source of embryonic cells would be the surplus
embryos created through in vitro fertilization that infertile
couples no longer planned to use.
</P>
<P>
   The AAAS report also said there was no need to create new
regulatory mechanisms for stem cell research. The research itself
raises no new ethical or policy issues, and oversight by the
government's existing Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee would be
adequate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report of the AAAS working group is to be
released publicly Wednesday at a Washington hearing on the issue.
The final version is to be completed within a few weeks, said
Audrey Chapman, an AAAS official who co-directed the study.
</P>
<P>
   She said the timing was aimed at providing ``an informed set of
recommendations'' in advance of expected congressional debate on
the issue of funding stem cell research. The working group included
scientists, physicians, religious scholars, ethicists, and
representatives of patients' groups.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative lawmakers have vowed to prevent public funding
because the embryonic cells can only be obtained from human embryos
or aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Actually there are three types of human stem cells: embryonic
stem cells, which are found in the days-old embryo; embryonic germ
cells, which are similar but are obtained from a fetus; and adult
stem cells, which exist in adult tissues and can develop into some,
but not all, types of human cells.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Snyder, a researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston and
Harvard Medical School, who is investigating the potential use of
adult stem cells in the brain to treat neurological diseases,
agreed with the AAAS report that public funding of the work is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does the government have more money than private
sources, if (support) comes from the federal government the public
will hopefully find that the work has been done in a scientifically
rigorous way, and not just to have a product at the end,'' said
Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first isolation of the embryonic cells was reported
only last year, their scientific and medical potential has
attracted great interest among scientists, said Snyder. ``Everyone
in every discipline is beginning to wonder, what can stem cells
offer to my field, or my interest?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the AAAS working group, the stem cell issue is
being reviewed by the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC)
and the National Institutes of Health, which contends that public
funding is legal but is in the process of setting up guidelines for
stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary report in July, NBAC agreed that it would be
proper to spend federal funds on stem cell research, but, unlike
the AAAS working group, NBAC recommended setting up a new oversight
and review panel specifically to review stem cell research.

CORPORATIONS GIVE NETWORK MONEY TO CREATE FAMILY PILOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
( Note c orrection in fifth graf  to ``Dawson's Creek'' gets sted
``get'') 
 
 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Viewers and the media weren't the only ones who
noticed a distinct lack of diversity in the television fall season
lineups. Apparently, advertisers also recognized the lack of
programming aimed at and containing depictions of families,
minorities and older people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a group of 11 major corporations _ including
AT&AMP;T, General Motors, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Sears
_ announced an agreement with the WB network to fund the
development of scripts for potential TV pilots that are ``family
friendly.'' Ameritech, IBM, Nationwide, Pfizer, Warner-Lambert and
Wendy's round out the list of companies in the Family Friendly
Programming Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The group is putting about $900,000 into a ``pilot script
development fund for potential drama and comedy series'' that the
WB will consider adding to its lineup beginning in fall 2000. The
average pilot script costs roughly $60,000 to $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The pact does not guarantee that any of these pilots will ever
become series, and the corporations do not gain any control over or
stake in the shows themselves. But it seems to be a clear statement
by advertisers that they haven't been the ones behind the
saturation of sexy programs aimed at teens and young adults _ a
number of which, ironically, are on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   WB spokesman Brad Turell insists the network carries a broader
range of programming than it is often given credit for. ``The
reality is, we have a very balanced lineup,'' Turell said.
```Dawson's Creek' gets a lot of press, but we also have shows like
... `7th Heaven.''' Turell said the latter show has one of the most
evenly split audience demographics of any show, making it
especially attractive to advertisers who market to a broad family
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Defending themselves against criticism that their lineups are
top-heavy with sexy and youth-skewed shows, the networks have all
claimed that they're only giving advertisers what they want. The
advertisers are now making it clear that they would welcome a
better range of choices on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we hear people say that we're dictating what is on
television, saying we need particular (demographics) ... it's just
not the case,'' said John McKeegan, a spokesman for Johnson &AMP;
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   McKeegan said Andrea Alstrup, the ad director of the New
Brunswick, N.J.-based personal care giant (which produces such
products as Band-Aid bandages and Johnson's Baby Shampoo), formed
the coalition of advertisers out of personal interest. ``She was
not all that crazy about some things she'd seen on TV and felt like
there were not a lot of options for us to advertise on
family-friendly programs,'' McKeegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all of this has a promotional value for a company
like Johnson &AMP; Johnson. The firm is leveraging its association with
family programming through a year-long cross-promotion with TV
Guide. The forum's members may partly be hoping to gain some good
publicity through these actions.
</P>
<P>
   But, good press aside, the move is a small step in part of an
overall trend among advertisers, who want more control over what
they're paying for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a step in the right direction. I just would have
liked to see them (advertisers) take it a step further,'' said
Heidi Sinclair, co-founder of Beverly Hills-based Brand X Media.
Sinclair's firm is not involved in the WB deal but is working with
other advertisers to create ``branded'' programming that will give
the sponsor ongoing control over broadcast shows.
</P>
<P>
   This desire is becoming more urgent with the fragmentation of
the TV audience, along with new technology that threatens to render
traditional commercials obsolete. Digital video recorders,
available now for about $500 plus a monthly ``service'' charge,
allow consumers to digitally record shows for viewing at their
leisure. The big catch for advertisers: These boxes, marketed under
the names TiVo and Replay, let viewers skip commercials altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair said younger networks such as the WB and UPN are
generally known to be more receptive to novel financing
arrangements such as this one, as well as ``branded'' programming.
For example, this year UPN is renaming its weekly movie night for a
single sponsor, ``Blockbuster Video's Shockwave Cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Turell said he wouldn't be surprised to see other TV outlets
follow suit if the WB's arrangement pays off in terms of a hit show
or two. ``This deal, simply, allows us to develop more shows,''
Turell said. ``The more shows you develop, the more chances you
have at creating a hit ... TV is a hit-driven medium. One hit can
make a huge difference for a network, and that's ultimately what we
hope to get out of this &UR; . &LR; '' &QL;

 &HT;    Elder-Beerman to repurchase its own stock
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. said Monday it will
buy back $24 million of its stock over two years and take other
steps to strengthen itself financially and bolster its share price.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Moraine-based retailer's initiatives comes a week
after a Washington state investment group notified the federal
government that it has purchased 845,000 common shares, or 5.3
percent of Elder-Beerman's 16 million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Elder-Beerman executives say the share repurchase program and
other steps outlined Monday are not a response to calls from the
group, D3 Family Fund L.P., to either fire top management or sell
the company.
</P>
<P>
   At current prices, Elder-Beerman could buy back about 23 percent
of its stock through the open market and privately negotiated
transactions, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Elder-Beerman's biggest shareholder is Snyder Capital
Management Inc., a San Francisco money manager, which holds 10.8
percent or 1.7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   D3 Family Fund L.P. says the holders of more than 50 percent of
Elder-Beerman's stock have expressed support for the group's
efforts to raise the share price.
</P>
<P>
   Elder-Beerman's stock jumped 15 percent Monday, closing at 7
7/8, up 1 1/16 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer's management has been considering a stock
repurchase program for several months, but pursued it heavily over
the last month, said Scott Davido, executive vice president and
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company sought approval from its board and banks for a
repurchase program because its shares are undervalued and buying
back stock seemed like a good use of capital, Davido said.
</P>
<P>
   David Nierenberg, D3 Family Fund L.P.'s fund manager and general
partner, said he supports the idea of a stock buy back, but he
still wants Chairman Fred Mershad and President John ``Jay''
Muskovich fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``A share repurchase by itself does nothing to address those
concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other steps outlined by the company include:
</P>
<P>
   _Restructure the merchandising organization. The company also
announced Monday the hiring of Charles P. Shaffer as executive vice
president of merchandising and marketing. Shaffer has been with the
company since 1985 in various executive positions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Open more concept stores similar to those scheduled to open in
Warsaw, Ind., and Frankfort, Ky., over the next couple of months.
The company also will open stores in Sandusky and Winfield, W. Va.,
this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Implement a four-point program to increase the usage and
profitability of the company's credit card division. The program
includes more aggressive recruitment of cardholders in new markets
and creation of a card-holder affinity program, Davido said. In
fiscal 1998, about 43 percent of Elder-Beerman's sales were made on
its private label credit card, according to the company's annual
report.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pursuit of more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased emphasis on moderate price zones in the core
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's announcement is of things we think will drive
shareholder value,'' Davido said.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg said he supports most of the ideas offered by the
company. But he doesn't want the retailer to make more acquisitions
under its current management, he said. Growth is not a cure-all for
a struggling company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, I don't think a company grows its way out
of problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's announcement did not mention Nierenberg or his
investment group, which includes about 80 investors and $30
million. But the board said it believes the current management team
can carry out the plan, according to a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer today is expected to release its fiscal second
quarter financial report that includes a substantial loss. Earlier
this month Elder-Beerman cautioned investors to expect a loss of up
to $1.6 million or 7 to 10 cents a share in the fiscal second
quarter ended July 31.

 &HT;    Growing pains linger for league
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WNBA continues to expand, averages five-figure crowds in
most cities and has begun attracting some top coaches. By the time
play gets under way next summer, the league will have doubled in
size, from the original eight to 16 teams. The season will serve as
the perfect lead-in to the Sydney Olympics, with virtually the
entire U.S. team and many international stars culled from WNBA
rosters.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing pains aren't completely over. The league might
stress greater ``parity,'' brought about primarily by an influx of
talent from the defunct American Basketball League, but it's a
euphemism for mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings declined, especially during the Women's World
Cup soccer tournament. But the playoffs should generate greater
interest, with the dramatic story line of the Houston Comets' drive
for a third consecutive title as they mourn the death of point
guard Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA set another cumulative attendance record, topping the
1.8 million mark and maintaining a league-wide average of around
10,000. The Atlanta Hawks want to be part of the next round of
expansion, but WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman said a decision won't
be made for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the WNBA starts in four more cities, with coaches
already hired in three. Lin Dunn and Linda Hargrove, who coached in
the ABL, are in place in Seattle and Portland, respectively.
Indiana will get U.S. Olympic coach Nell Fortner for the 2001
season and Miami is still looking.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the expansion Orlando Miracle nearly made the
playoffs under coach Carolyn Peck, who led Purdue to the 1999
women's NCAA title.

   Comets playing with a purpose
</P>
<P>
   By Wendy Parker
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   The moment was a brief one, and the words certainly had to be
chosen carefully. After his Los Angeles team had beaten the Houston
Comets on Friday near the end of the WNBA regular season, coach
Orlando Woolridge quietly consoled his sideline counterpart, Van
Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were subdued by the death the day before of Kim
Perrot, starting point guard on their league championship teams the
last two years. But as they await the winner of tonight's one-game
Western Conference playoff, the woman who was the focus of their
dominating 26-6 campaign figures to take on even greater
motivational significance in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Your team really scares me now,''' Woolridge
said. ``After back-to-back championships, sometimes the hunger
isn't there. But when you have something to rally around, you have
something to focus on, and with the emotional stress and trauma
that they've been through, that sometimes can be a rallying cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, the crowd-pleasing floor general who played in the
shadows of the ``Big Three'' of Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and
Tina Thompson, succumbed Thursday after a nine-month bout with lung
cancer. She will be buried today in her hometown of Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   As she recovered from surgery to remove a brain tumor and then
sought non-chemotherapy treatment in Mexico, the Comets charged
ahead. Swoopes posted the WNBA's first triple-double and might be
the league MVP, succeeding Cooper, 36, just named to the U.S.
Olympic roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always going to be the favorites until somebody beats
them,'' said former University of Georgia standout guard Kedra
Holland-Corn of the Sacramento Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, which plays Los Angeles for the right to take on
Houston, will be without forward Yolanda Griffith, the WNBA's
second-leading scorer and leading rebounder, out with a knee
injury. Los Angeles rallied late, partly because Woolridge inserted
La'Keisha Frett, Holland-Corn's Georgia teammate, into the starting
lineup. And up front, ex-Bradwell Institute star DeLisha Milton, an
All-American at Florida, has helped Lisa Leslie, who is enjoying
her best professional season.
</P>
<P>
   In its third season, the WNBA has improved its overall talent
considerably. Aside from Houston and the New York Liberty, the
playoff teams are built largely around players from the defunct
American Basketball League. But only four of the 12 WNBA teams
posted winning records. New York won the Eastern Conference, but
its 18-14 record would have been fourth best in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's opponent in the conference finals will have a
losing record. Detroit hosts Charlotte, also tonight, in a one-game
matchup of 15-17 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much like the NCAA format,'' said coach Nancy
Lieberman-Cline of Detroit, whose team won its last three games to
make the playoffs. ``You have to win to stay alive. For us, it's
been good, because we've been in a one-game playoff for about two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name missing from the playoffs is former Tennessee
All-American Chamique Holdsclaw. She helped the Washington Mystics
go from 3-27 a year ago to 12-20. But even by WNBA standards, it
wasn't close to being good enough.

   MARKET (New York) _ Investors swagger back into stocks, surer
than ever that the Federal Reserve Board, at its meeting Tuesday,
will raise rates only once more and then be done, at least for this
year. The turnabout in investor mood comes after weeks of
directionless stock trading. Having peaked in mid-July, most of the
market indexes fell as investors grew concerned that rising
commodity prices and labor costs as well as strong economic growth
around the world would push the Fed to take a more aggressive
stance on rates. But over the last week or so, a consensus started
to build that a quarter-point increase might be enough. By Gretchen

   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK LIBERTY
</P>
<P>
   _ Record: 18-14, 1st East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Richie Adubato.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: G Vicky Johnson, G Crystal Robinson, G
Teresa Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: In Adubato's first season, New York has returned to the
playoffs despite losing Rebecca Lobo to injury. Johnson and
Robinson are a potent backcourt, and Weatherspoon is still the
team's heart and soul. Rookie Tamika Whitmore has been sensational
at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT SHOCK
</P>
<P>
   _ Record: 15-17, 2nd East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Nancy Lieberman-Cline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: G Jennifer Azzi, G Sandy Brondello, F Wendy
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: A midseason trade revitalized Detroit. Palmer, who came
over from Utah in the deal, has strengthened the front line.
Brondello and Azzi had the top two 3-point shooting percentages in
the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE STING
</P>
<P>
   _ Record: 15-17, 3rd East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dan Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: G Dawn Staley, G Andrea Stinson, F Vicky
Bullett.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Charlotte's All-ACC starting lineup had a 5-7 record
when Hughes was bumped up from assistant to interim head coach on
July 11. Stinson is an electrifying offensive player at shooting
guard, while Staley is steady at the point.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON COMETS
</P>
<P>
   _ Record: 26-6, 1st West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: F Sheryl Swoopes, F Tina Thompson, G Cynthia
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: The two-time defending champions are the class of the
league again, but they must attempt a three-peat after last week's
death of Kim Perrot from cancer. Swoopes is the favorite to unseat
Cooper as MVP. The only concern is lack of depth.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES SPARKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Record: 20-12, 2nd West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Orlando Woolridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: F Lisa Leslie, G Mwadi Mabika, C DeLisha
Milton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Woolridge has livened up a poor franchise. Leslie is
having her best pro season, in part because of the addition of
ex-Bradwell Institute star DeLisha Milton. Another key figure in
igniting the Sparks is ex-Georgia standout La'Keisha Frett.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO MONARCHS
</P>
<P>
   _ Record: 19-13, 3rd West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Sonny Allen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: G Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, G Kedra
Holland-Corn, G Ticha Penicheiro.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: The Monarchs are revamped, but their hopes were damaged
when forward Yolanda Griffith, an MVP candidate, went down with a
knee injury two weeks ago. Holland-Corn, who starred at Georgia, is
part of a terrific guard trio that will have to carry the load.

MICROSOFT DICTIONARY ATTACKED BY RIVAL PUBLISHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Words in boldface are set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The breathless promotions for Microsoft's first foray into the
rarefied dictionary market promise a mighty international reference
guide for the English-speaking world _ the ``first dictionary born
in the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Weightier than a laptop computer, the Encarta World English
Dictionary _ published in book form last month and due in an
electronic version this month _ does indeed deliver words,
warnings, sensitivity traps, quick definitions and an earnest
photograph of Bill Gates on page 738. (``Gates  &UR; /gayts/ &LR; , Bill
(b.1955) U.S. entrepreneur. He co-founded Microsoft.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Encarta's self-described ``image of English at the turn of
the millennium'' has also ignited a tart war of words in the elite
universe of dictionary publishing: a high-volume, low-margin
business that suddenly finds itself warily facing the threat of
Microsoft Corp.'s unmatched financial resources, marketing muscle
and global reach.
</P>
<P>
   If traditional publishers have any advantage in this war, it is
their collective credibility. So, not surprisingly, since the
publication of the 2,208-page Encarta dictionary in July, rival
lexicographers have made gleeful sport of word spotting,
discovering errors and trading jokes about its painfully sensitive
warning labels, which assert that terms like ``lady friend'' and
``hard of hearing'' are potentially offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The susurration (the sound of whispers or rustling _ in this
case dictionary pages) is discernible at a handful of established
dictionary publishing houses that have meticulously compiled their
findings into in-house lists. Among the bons mots is the Encarta
pronunciation of Niagara Falls _ `` &UR; nigara falwz &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The wordsmiths chuckle at the inclusion of a photograph of
Gates, the Microsoft chairman, in light of the absence of a
photograph of President John F. Kennedy (though Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis does merit an illustration).
</P>
<P>
   Some note the lack of an entry for Northern Ireland, while
others ponder why the dictionary gives no pronunciations for
``Ontario'' or ``focaccia.'' Others are bemused over errors of
fact: George Gordon Meade is identified as the Union general who
commanded the Army of the Potomac during the Revolution instead of
during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Some are distracted by creative spellings:  &UR; Casper &LR;  Milquetoast
instead of  &UR; Caspar &LR; , the timid cartoon character that inspired the
meaning of ``milquetoast.'' And all marvel at the seemingly
obsessive warnings; one well-known expletive that is a singular
favorite of movie tough guys was labeled offensive almost 20 times
in a single passage.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the criticism emerging from rival dictionary
publishing houses, Microsoft dismisses the complaints as the kind
of response to be expected from aggressive competitors. Its
attention is given to promoting the arrival later this month of the
electronic version of the Encarta dictionary, an extension of its
popular electronic Encarta Encyclopedia brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All dictionaries contain mistakes,'' said Microsoft's
editorial director, Richard Bready, who noted that first editions
typically are known for errors. ``If you are a lexicographer, it's
possible to find this level of error in any dictionary. This is not
the result of any haste to publish. This is the result of
publishing a dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals concede that no dictionary is perfect, but
contend that the error rate is usually far below the level of
popular trade books. Such errors rarely get much attention,
although a new edition of the venerable Larousse French dictionary
in 1990 mistakenly said some highly poisonous wild mushrooms were
harmless, forcing a very public recall.
</P>
<P>
   The established publishers argue that pointing out errors is not
a matter of sour words _ although it certainly couldn't hurt in the
midst of the frantic back-to-school high season for dictionary
duels.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, IDG Books Worldwide issued the fourth edition of
the Webster's New World College Dictionary, while Houghton Mifflin
is working on its fourth edition of the American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language _ the dictionary that Microsoft
has published electronically as part of its popular Microsoft
Bookshelf suite of reference books. (The company says it will
continue to ship the American Heritage dictionary with Bookshelf
through next year.) Random House has also updated its Webster's
College Dictionary for publication this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And on the same July day that Microsoft announced the Encarta
dictionary, the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary
coincidentally issued an appeal for contributions of new words from
English speakers worldwide. Those submissions will be used in
preparation of an online version of the OED _ as it is known _
which now numbers 20 volumes in print and will be available
electronically in March.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Abate, the editor in chief of U.S. dictionaries for Oxford
University Press, said his publishing house did not consider
Encarta true competition because it did not approach the depth of
information in the Oxford English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed concern that Microsoft was trying to introduce
the more relaxed standards of the software industry to what has
historically been a highly disciplined endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a dictionary proves to have errors that are embarrassing
and obvious, then it makes our work as lexicographers harder
because it lowers the standards,'' Abate said. ``With all sympathy
to the pressures that they were under, it looks to me like this is
version 0.1 _ a beta version of a dictionary.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dictionary wars are nothing new in this fiercely competitive
market, which through the centuries has periodically engaged in
battles for linguistic supremacy. Even the revered American
lexicographer Noah Webster got caught up in some mid-19th-century
sniping, pitting his American approach to the English language
against Joseph Worcester's dictionary, which tilted to the British.
</P>
<P>
   These days, dictionaries rely on promotions to point out their
distinctive qualities, and in this case Microsoft and its
publishing partners _ Bloomsbury Publishing PLC in London and St.
Martin's Press in the United States _ are boasting about Encarta's
world view of English, with words like ``toenadering'' (a political
rapprochement) from South Africa or ``tickety-boo'' (perfectly
fine) from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bloomsbury Publishing's chief executive, Nigel Newton,
who first proposed the project to Microsoft in 1991, even though
Bloomsbury had never before produced a dictionary. Eventually,
Microsoft agreed to back the project, a deal intended to extend the
brand of its electronic encyclopedia into the print market, while
also securing electronic rights for publication of the dictionary
online and on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to being an upstart,'' said Newton, whose company
published the highly successful ``Harry Potter'' series of
children's books after other London publishers scorned the original
manuscript. ``But we can establish ourselves pretty quickly. How do
you take on any establishment? By being new, different and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   When the project got under way about three years ago, Bloomsbury
took charge of recruiting a group of about 320 lexicographers
scattered around the world. These linguistic experts generally
answered to London-based editors, who then passed the information
to the Microsoft team in Redmond, Wash., for final review.
</P>
<P>
   Many lexicographers were hired on a freelance basis to
participate in an ambitious project: developing a database of the
English language that the publishers describe as the first newly
written dictionary in over 30 years. But one veteran lexicographer
who worked on the project said that the work was carried out under
extreme pressure and that the dictionary was assembled without
strong editorial coordination, in a tremendous rush to get it to
the market before this year's back-to-school season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to have no standards,'' said the lexicographer, who
asked to remain anonymous. ``You find inaccurate information,
missing information, repetitious information.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney I. Landau, the author of ``Dictionary: The Art and Craft
of Lexicography'' and the editor-in-chief of the Cambridge
Dictionary of American English, said that many skilled people had
worked on the Encarta project but that the final result answered an
old question: ``If it takes one man many hours to dig a ditch, can
10 men dig a ditch in an hour?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of dictionary work, no,'' he said. ``There are a lot
of good people who worked on it, but logistically it was very
difficult to do in the time frame that they had with many people so
disparately located. I think it shows in various ways.''
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft officials have any private misgivings about the new
dictionary, they are not acknowledging them. The software company
and its two print publishing partners are already laying out a
10-year plan to use the database of English words and definitions
to spin off other Encarta products in electronic and print formats
_ a collegiate edition, a thesaurus, a quotation guide and a
mass-market paperback version of the dictionary. Bready,
Microsoft's editor in chief, said that his team was working with
Bloomsbury to identify and correct errors.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, which bought the U.S. rights to the print
version, has invested millions of dollars in the Encarta project
and is spending easily more than $1 million to promote the new
dictionary in a flashy style unusual in that market. For example,
it is sponsoring an author's tour by Encarta's U.S. editor, Anne H.
Soukhanov, a former executive editor of the American Heritage
Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's is so enthusiastic about Encarta's prospects that
its Web site lists a time line of defining moments over the last
three decades that starts with the first landing on the moon on
July 20, 1969, and ends with the publication of the Encarta
dictionary on the same day in 1999. (The fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989 is followed a year later by the release of Microsoft's Windows
3.0.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are good that this will be the most widely used
dictionary in the world,'' said John Sargent, chief executive of
St. Martin's Press and president of its parent company, Holtzbrinck
GmbH.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that ambitious goal, Ms. Soukhanov is making the
rounds of morning talk shows on television and on National Public
Radio, which questioned her about exotic foreign words described in
an Encarta press packet as examples of its new-world English
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   As the news release noted, one of those words is ``dinkum,'' an
Australian adjective that means genuine or reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, rival publishers immediately rustled through the
pages under ``d'' in Encarta, which prompted another gleeful
discovery: ``Dinkum'' had vanished.

COMMENTARY: SHAKESPEARE DOES MALAYSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ The first lesson they teach in
columnist school is that even if you have mixed opinions about some
issue _ and you are torn 50-50 _ when you write the column you have
to come down 100 to 0 for one side or the other. The case of
Malaysia compels me to break that rule.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is this: In the wake of the Asian financial crisis,
Malaysia's mercurial prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, spurned the
advice of the IMF, the U.S. Treasury and many economists and
adopted capital controls to stabilize his country's currency and
protect it from speculators. Thailand, Korea and Indonesia, by
contrast, kept their economies open, liberalized their political
sectors and took the IMF medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So who won? For now, everyone. All four countries are
recovering, and Mahathir boasts that his much-derided capital
controls have worked just as well as the cures that all the
economists were trying to foist on him. This Malaysian case has
significance because it could encourage other countries to adopt
capital controls, rather than the Anglo-American model of steadily
opening up to free flows of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mahathir justified in his boasts? Now we come back to the
lead of this column: the answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Capital controls can never be a long-term solution for an
export-oriented economy such as Malaysia's. They are instituted to
buy time to stabilize an economy. So the real question is, How has
Malaysia used the time since Sept. 1, 1998, when it barred foreign
investors from taking their funds out of Malaysia for a one-year
period after their investment in order to curtail the movement of
hot money? Answer: Economically, Malaysia has used the time pretty
well. Politically, it has gone backward.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, one has to give Mahathir his due. When he put on
the controls, he wisely fixed the Malaysian ringgit at a low rate _
one that has made Malaysia's exports quite attractive, prevented
the rise of a black market and been easily defensible with
conservative fiscal and monetary policy. Several Malaysian
businessmen told me this fixed, cheap ringgit has allowed them to
plan again. Malaysia's economy should grow 2 percent this year
(pre-crisis it was at 8 percent), the local stock market has perked
up and some foreign investment is coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the state has begun forcing the merger and restructuring
of weak banks and corporations. This is critical, because it was
the excessive lending and borrowing of these institutions, and the
lax oversight of them, that got Malaysia in trouble in the first
place, with overbuilding. The restructuring, though, remains
limited. Still, all in all, Mahathir is entitled to boast on
economics _ a little.
</P>
<P>
   But not on politics. Mahathir's decision last year to oust his
popular deputy and emerging rival, Anwar Ibrahim, on sodomy charges
has embarrassed many Malays and engendered a sense of political
risk here that is still keeping many foreign investors away.
(Anwar, who was making a bid to oust Mahathir, says he is being
framed because he was about to expose high-level corruption.) This
political turmoil is the main reason Malaysia has to pay 1 percent
more for its foreign borrowings than its neighbors. The whole
sordid Anwar case has rattled the country. As one Malaysian
intellectual put it: ``The message is that if this can happen to
Anwar, what about mere mortals like us? So you better keep your
mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe that while Malaysia is recovering from the immediate
economic crisis, the only way it will return to sustained high
growth, and prevent another crisis, is with improved productivity
and efficiency. That requires political reform _ in corporate
governance, in the judiciary, in regulatory institutions, in the
free flow of ideas. All of these have been undermined by the Anwar
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Shakespearean tragedy,'' a Malaysian woman friend
remarked. ``The truth is Anwar and Mahathir made a good team.
Mahathir had the courage to make bold economic reforms, even create
a multimedia super corridor. And Anwar combined a sense of Islamic
tradition and Asian renaissance that appealed to the young and
middle classes that Mahathir's own economic reforms gave birth to.
Without Anwar, things are out of balance. The two of them are
destroying each other and unmaking their own achievements. I think
the only hope for Mahathir is, when the Anwar trial and elections
are over, if he really makes an effort to redress the damage done
to our institutions by this whole affair.''
</P>
<P>
   And what are the chances of that? I'd guess about 50-50.

FIFTEEN RESIDENTS RIDE OUT STORM IN COASTAL TOWN
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT MANSFIELD, Texas _ Tamara Hecker and Cindy Rutledge were
not about to be bullied by Bret.
</P>
<P>
   Hecker, 36 and the daughter of missionaries, and Rutledge, 50, a
watercolor artist who is battling breast cancer, were among 15
residents of this bayside community about 100 miles south of Corpus
Christi who shrugged off evacuation warnings as the fierce winds
and rain of Hurricane Bret crashed into the Texas Gulf coast Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us just decided to stay for the adventure of it,''
said Hecker, who withstood a South American earthquake as a child
and faced down a Southeast Texas tornado as a young adult. ``Our
homes are here, our lives are here. So we figured we'd stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecker and Rutledge spent part of Monday afternoon sipping
coffee in the unlighted office of the Fisherman's Inn motel
reliving their overnight adventure for awe-struck visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who chose to ride out the storm in Port Mansfield
toyed with the idea of heading for higher ground, just as the other
1,000 or so residents of the community had.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time officials ordered the closing of Texas 186, the
main road inland, the self-proclaimed bitter-enders thought they'd
be safer in their homes than on the wind- and rain-swept highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I felt rather stupid by staying once those
100-mph winds came crashing in,'' said Rutledge. ``It seemed like
trifling with fate. So I just grabbed my Bible and hunkered down,
but I don't think I had time to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bret, which came ashore as a Category 4 storm with 140
mph winds, missed such population centers as Corpus Christi and
Brownsville, saving the bulk of its fury for largely rural Kenedy
County and the sprawling King Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But the unincorporated community of Port Mansfield was not
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Winds tore sections of rooftops from homes and small businesses
along Laguna Madre, which separates the town from the barrier
islands off the Texas Coast. Several trailer homes were toppled and
boats stored on a dry lot were tossed around like toys in a
sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, assisted by an army of work crews from the local
utility company, spent Monday cleaning up and trying to restore
electric and water service, which had been out for more than 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The 900-square-foot bungalow belonging to Margaret and Gerald
Raleigh lost the front side of its roof, exposing the bathroom and
living room to the driving rain. But the 50-year-old home, which
also weathered Hurricanes Allen and Beulah, remained on its
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing we can't fix,'' said Margaret Raleigh, who has
a fishing boat charter business with her husband. ``This is the
most enjoyable and relaxing place there is. We're not going to give
this place up.''
</P>
<P>
   Across from the Raleighs, the home of John and Patsy Turney
escaped unscathed. The once-sturdy gnarled mesquite on the corner
of their property was not so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky in the sense that the winds came in from the
northwest and not straight in from the bay,'' said John Turney,
also a charter fishing guide who has lived in Port Mansfield since
1984. ``Basically, it kept the water from coming up onto the
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecker and Rutledge said they felt fortunate to survive the
storm, and for just having the experience, even though two
Department of Public Safety troopers patrolling the town on Monday
said they were foolish not to have evacuated before the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little freaky seeing parts of roofs and hunks of tin
flying through the air,'' Hecker said. ``But this building (the
Fisherman's Inn) is made of concrete and steel. I really felt
safe.''

 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the financial services industry, the emergence of
global capitalism has unleashed a new horror: global holiday
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Say you are in Warsaw, Poland, on a particular Wednesday,
trolling for business opportunities. It is a short hop to
Lithuania, so why not call on a few bankers in Vilnius?
</P>
<P>
   Here's why not: That Thursday is a holiday in Lithuania, and
when Lithuanian holidays fall on a Thursday, the Friday after is
also declared a holiday. If you were going there on the previous
Saturday, you would need to know that it became a normal working
day. Got that?
</P>
<P>
   And though inadvertently landing in Vilnius on a four-day
weekend is a mere waste of time, consider the coming millennium
celebrations. Financial caretakers are trying to close out
important transactions before the end of the last business day of
1999. But just when will that be? New Year's Day falls on a
Saturday, and some countries don't provide a weekday off when
holidays fall on a Saturday. Except lately, several of those
countries have decided to make Friday, Dec. 31, an ad hoc holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the tacticians and quartermasters of
international finance, there is Paul Spraos.
</P>
<P>
   Spraos, 40, is the London-born founder of Swaps Monitor
Publications Inc. in New York, which publishes a newsletter
covering the exotic world of interest-rate swaps and other
financial derivatives. Since 1992, Spraos has also produced an
international holiday calendar, which heroically tries to identify
all the holidays _ ``bad business days,'' he calls them _ that will
occur in more than 100 countries over the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, Spraos (rhymes with ``house'') will begin offering
his calendar over the Internet _ at financialcalendar.com _ a step
he says will make it far easier for him to deal with the growing
tendency of local governments to tinker with their holiday
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holidays are changing more and more frequently, at a rate that
would amaze people who don't follow this,'' Spraos said. Various
financial centers ``are changing their weekends, introducing or
deleting a holiday or adding the millennium holiday. Or maybe their
soccer team just qualified for the World Cup and they've declared a
spontaneous holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do such far-distant holidays matter so much?
</P>
<P>
   Swaps and other financial derivatives can span many decades and
typically involve large sums _ $100 million is routine. The price
of a swap is determined by calculating the current value of all the
payments to be made over the life of the deal. If some future
payment dates fall on local holidays, the cash will not start
earning interest as promptly as anticipated, throwing the price
calculations out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know holidays approximately 30 years out,''
explained Larry Weissblum, a vice president at the capital markets
unit of Sumitomo Bank and a subscriber to Spraos' calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium countdown would have been even more worrisome
without Spraos' service, added Adrienne Mageras, the operations
support director for General Re Financial Products, a global
derivatives dealer. ``You need to know that you can't make payments
on that day in that particular country _ and we've had six or seven
centers declare millennium holidays in just the past two months,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the derivatives markets, banks and other financial
institutions try to estimate their cash needs and anticipate their
cash receipts _ and both will be affected by future bank closings
in the various countries where those institutions do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be expecting a payment on a particular day, but if
it's a holiday you won't get the money,'' Spraos explained. ``At
best, it's an inconvenience. At worst, it costs you real money. And
the reverse is equally true: If you are the one obligated to make a
payment on a particular day and it's a holiday, you may not realize
that the payment was actually due the previous day.''
</P>
<P>
   As curious as it seems, creating a list of future holidays in
individual countries around the world is anything but
straightforward, as Spraos discovered in October 1991 when he
accepted a friend's challenge to develop a global calendar. ``We
thought we would turn the calendars out and have them laminated to
send around to our subscribers as `freebies' for Christmas that
year,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That was when he began to appreciate that ``holidays are not
unambiguous creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim and some Asian holidays are determined by the lunar
calendar but may vary from country to country based on local lunar
observation. Last spring, for example, the same Muslim two-day
holiday varied by as much as five days among the 18 Muslim
financial centers monitored by Spraos.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each country has its own quirky way of determining
when holidays will be observed. In France, for example, banks and
the union representing their employees negotiate the bank holiday
schedule each year. Sometimes different financial institutions
within the same country even observe different holidays. And
roughly 20 percent of the official announcements of future holidays
turn out to contain errors, Spraos discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Even weekends are defined differently from country to country.
In Taiwan, the weekend consists of every Sunday and the second and
fourth Saturday of each month; in Malaysia, the formula is every
Sunday and the first Saturday. And then there is Lithuania, with
its occasional one-day weekend followed by a four-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Spraos said he soon realized that assembling a reliable
financial calendar was going to involve so much research and labor
``that it would be foolish to give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in 1992, when he published the first edition of his
financial calendar, in book form and on CD-ROM, he offered it for
sale. It sold well at $50 a copy, and the price was soon raised to
$200. Eventually, he began to feed the data to his corporate
subscribers electronically, so they could incorporate it into their
own computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet was a logical next step, he said. It will allow
customers to choose whether to pay a flat monthly fee or pay each
time they seek specific data, and it will offer subscribers
enhanced software that will allow them to pose their own questions
to the holiday database.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, more than 100 large financial institutions around the
world, including most of the largest derivatives dealers, rely on
the calendar to help them avoid running afoul of the countless
holidays that will occur over the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, only one of Spraos' customers _ he won't say who
_ subscribes for the full century's worth of data. Most are content
with the next two or three decades _ a blessing for Spraos, since
computer limitations restrict his Internet service to 30 years of
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Spraos has gradually expanded the scope of the
calendar. The original version listed 18 financial centers, with a
``center'' defined as a category of financial institution in a
particular place. (Banks in New York would be one center, for
example, and the New York Stock Exchange would be another.) The
current calendar encompasses 251 financial centers in 103
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide holidays are simply impossible to provide, Spraos
explained. Just in New York, the New York Stock Exchange, the New
York Mercantile Exchange and the major New York banks all differ
slightly in the holidays they observe. Many countries have regional
holidays that affect banks in one city but not in another.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spraos, Nepal has the highest average number of
``bad business days'' each year, with 26.5 weekdays off, although
it observes only a one-day weekend. Romania has the fewest, on
average, with 5.2 weekdays off.
</P>
<P>
   Some future holidays _ like those negotiated bank holidays in
France _ defy accurate calculations. Spraos deals with them by
declaring them ``asterisk holidays,'' those for which he estimates
a multiday range during which the holiday is most likely to fall
based on historical data.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always the unexpected holidays: A sovereign
dies, and the next day becomes an unscheduled holiday. But Spraos
termed his calendar ``as accurate as you can reasonably get for any
prediction of future events.'' It will be more accurate still, he
said, once the Internet version is up and running.
</P>
<P>
   That debut is going to have to wait until after Labor Day,
however. Spraos, an avid bicyclist, is taking a holiday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As they go through the rites of passage into the
history books, the old-timers of the early days of space flight
have had their reunions for John Glenn's nostalgia trip back into
orbit and moments of reflection on the 30th anniversary of their
greatest triumph, the first moon landing, in 1969. So the next step
was perhaps inevitable: Some of their stuff of history is headed
for the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's East, the New York City auction house, will test the
market for space memorabilia on Sept. 18. It is putting on sale
more than 300 items of space apparel and equipment, mission manuals
and notebooks, astronaut-autographed flight plans and commemorative
postal covers and coins. The auction house described this as the
first large public sale of materials from the American space
program, with a few important items included from the Soviet
Union's rival program.
</P>
<P>
   Price estimates range from $400 for some mission emblems to
$80,000 for a Neil Armstrong spacesuit and possibly $250,000 for a
vintage Soviet spacesuit complete with a Vostok spacecraft ejection
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Austin, who organized the sale for Christie's East,
conceded that it was unusual for historical materials to be the
subject of a major auction so soon after the events they are
associated with had occurred. Often the importance of a historic
event as an area of serious collecting is recognized only in
retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sale gives collectors a chance to preserve significant
pieces from a historic event that took place in our lifetime,''
Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's East began planning the auction eight months ago
after a private collector made inquiries about selling some of his
space materials. Several former astronauts who were then approached
agreed to consign items from their attics and basements.
</P>
<P>
   Among those contributing material were Buzz Aldrin, Gordon
Cooper, R. Walter Cunningham, Edgar Mitchell, Walter Schirra and

SOUP IS REASONABLY GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to think Pax TV isn't for cynics. What could those who
disparage the motives of others, who disdain accepted standards of
morality, ever gain from a ``family values'' network?
</P>
<P>
   But after one serving of ``Chicken Soup for the Soul,'' it's
easy to think Pax TV is expressly for cynics.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the astoundingly successful series of books by
self-esteem gurus Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, ``Chicken
Soup'' becomes a weekly series this year after airing as a Pax
special last season. Simplistic and moralistic, the collection of
stories contained in ``Chicken Soup'' is a sort of uplifting
</P>
<P>
   Reader's Digest cavalcade. Even sad endings aren't really sad,
because there's always a silver lining, a hidden message, intended
to give the principal character _ and the viewer _ a life-changing
ray of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Is that inherently bad TV?
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Chicken Soup,'' premiering tonight at 8 on KWPX/33,
is reasonably good TV: well-produced, well-written, well-acted. And
the kitchens of Vin Di Bona Productions, where ``Chicken Soup'' is
prepared, have managed to attract some medium-profile stars to
participate in the vignettes _ average length: about six minutes _
that make up an evening's bill of fare. Tonight's debut program has
stories featuring Roxanne Hart, Teri Garr and Shirley Knight.
Future episodes will include Carl Weathers, Gordon Clapp, Ray
Walston and the show's host, Michael Tucker, appearing with his
wife, Jill Eikenberry.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of tonight's program, Tucker says the universal
appeal of good storytelling is no mystery: The best stories, no
matter how fabulous, how mythical, are ultimately about us. As a
steady diet, however, the high-sugar content of the ``Chicken
Soup'' tales may cause intellectual constipation. Each vignette,
whether it's about having the moral courage to do the right thing
or simply the good sense to open all of one's wedding gifts, is
uniformly sappy.
</P>
<P>
   Charming performances, most notably Hart's as a depressed
divorcee, help rescue most of the stories, but even good acting can
get tiresome when a theater company stages plays that have an
unremitting sameness about them. All stories _ parables, fables,
whatever _ have more impact when parceled out judiciously, not
lumped together in a mind-numbing anthology.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a little ``Chicken Soup'' can go a long way. And too
much of a goody-goody thing will make you queasy.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Soup for the Soul. A weekly collection of stories about
hope, inspiration and triumph of the human spirit, hosted by
Michael Tucker. Season premiere Tuesday night at 8, KWPX/33.

 &HT;    University of Florida's president expected to resign amid
controversy
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The University of Florida's popular but
often controversial John Lombardi is, after several close calls
over the years, finally stepping down from the flagship school's
top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Probably.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many Lombardi incidents since his arrival in 1990,
the announcement of his departure Monday itself became high drama.
After scheduling a news conference for 3 p.m., Lombardi left it to
UF spokeswoman Linda Gray to relay the message at 2:56 p.m. that he
wouldn't be talking to reporters Monday after all. No reason was
given.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi, 57, did not respond to a reporter's e-mailed query on
the matter. Earlier in the day, Gray told the Associated Press that
Lombardi would resign as president but would probably remain at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Universities Chancellor Adam Herbert, who has had a strained
relationship with Lombardi ever since Lombardi called him an
``Oreo,'' did not return phone calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the matter, who spoke on the condition they not
be named, said Herbert lost patience with Lombardi and has been
insisting he step down by the end of next month but that Lombardi
has repeatedly put it off.
</P>
<P>
   In past battles with the governing Board of Regents, Lombardi
was rescued by influential alumni and legislators. But on Monday,
state Sen. George Kirkpatrick said he thought now was an opportune
time for Lombardi to leave, adding that he didn't really try to
talk him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really wants to retire and pursue other things, from
working on his truck to writing a couple of books,'' said
Kirkpatrick, a Gainesville Republican and a perennial Lombardi
booster. ``For his sake and his family, it's a good decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of somber academicians speaking in careful, heavy
prose, Lombardi has been the glib rogue. At regents meetings or in
testimony before various legislative committees, Lombardi was
always off-the-cuff, lively and sarcastic, sometimes openly
disrespectful of the group he was addressing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, legislators, most regents and particularly his
students found his unpretentious style and appearance irresistible.
His Latin America history classes were among the most popular on
campus, and students frequently chatted with him as he got in or
out of the beat-up, red pickup he drove.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State University President Sandy D'Alemberte on Monday
called Lombardi the smartest man he knows, but added that he had no
real knowledge of what happened or why.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Jim Heekin, possibly Lombardi's strongest critic on the
board, also said the apparent sudden departure came as a surprise.
``He's his own worst enemy, in many ways,'' Heekin said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, it was Heekin's letter criticizing Lombardi for going
around the board and taking UF's case directly to lawmakers that
prompted the first major Lombardi crisis, with the president
threatening to return to Johns Hopkins University, where he'd been
provost before coming to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Another row came two years later, when Lombardi called new
Chancellor Herbert an ``Oreo'' _ black on the outside but white on
the inside. Regents responded by putting Lombardi on a sort of
probation for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The final crisis came this summer, when regents learned of a
letter written by two prominent law school deans complaining of
Lombardi's abusive treatment during a campus visit the previous
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sharlot of the University of Texas and Judith Welch
Wegner of the University of North Carolina wrote that Lombardi
behaved ``with gross discourtesy and as an immature bully'' when
they tried to discuss their findings regarding UF's law school
program.
</P>
<P>
   The two had been hired by the regents as outside consultants for
the law school's periodic evaluation by the board. Sharlot and
Wegner suggested that any future consultants be ``given notice that
the president may vent his penchant for abusive behavior upon them.
They should be told that they may have their intelligence, ethics,
and good faith questioned to their faces and expect to have their
professional reputations impugned behind their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They just caught John on a bad day, is the kindest way I could
put it,'' Heekin said of the consultants' complaints, adding that
influential law school alumni who in the past had lobbied state
officials to keep Lombardi this time had suggested he leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this was the straw that broke the camel's back, I
don't know,'' Heekin said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert told the regents in July that he planned to deal with
the problem himself, in Lombardi's performance review scheduled for
September. It was not clear Monday whether the timing of the review
affected the timing of this latest episode.

 &HT;    Exploring options for aging parents
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time's ($3.50) cover story about caring for aging parents is a
topic that weighs heavily on baby boomers. What happens when mom
and dad can no longer cope? Nursing homes are one choice, but there
are new alternatives, such as the Gardens of Towne Lake in
Woodstock. Time correspondent John Greenwald talks with 82-year-old
Marjorie Bryan, who decided against living with her grown son and
moved into her own apartment in the Woodstock complex. Staffers are
available 24 hours a day to help with daily tasks, but the
residents maintain their independence.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, the search for Person of the Century continues.
Asked for their choices, author Tom Wolfe nominated Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, while historian John Keegan cited Vladimir Lenin.
When Solzhenitsyn's ``The Gulag Archipelago'' was smuggled out of
the Soviet Union, Wolfe says, ``it was as if a stake had been
driven through the heart of Marxism.'' On the other hand, Keegan
insists that the spread of Lenin's Bolshevism exerted a malign
influence that included creating nationalist reactionaries such as
Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where there's smoke: Cigar Aficionado ($4.95), the slick
entertainment magazine for stogie lovers, is not famous for its
investigative reporting. But the October issue has a surprisingly
in-depth article detailing efforts by the Kennedy administration
and Fidel Castro to end the conflict between the United States and
Cuba. Peter Kornbluh, an analyst at the National Security Archive,
sifted through declassified files to reveal the secret U.S.-Cuban
dialogue that began in March 1963.
</P>
<P>
   According to a secret memo, President Kennedy overruled the
State Department's position that Cuba had to break its relations
with the Soviet Union as a precondition for normalizing relations.
A pivotal role in the negotiations was played by ABC News reporter
Lisa Howard, who carried messages between Havana and Washington and
provided her New York apartment for meetings between U.S. and Cuban
officials. The talks ended in December 1964.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Grading parents: Many harried parents feel guilty because they
don't spend enough time with their children, but children don't
necessarily feel the same way, says Ellen Galinsky, whose book
``Ask the Children'' is excerpted in Newsweek ($3.50). According to
Galinsky's research, while 56 percent of parents think their
children want to spend more time with them, only 10 percent of kids
want more time with their mother and 15.5 percent with father.
Children also resent it when they feel that the time parents spend
with them is rushed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Manly things: Males who may be in doubt about their
masculinity are invited to take Esquire's ($3.50) Hugh Grant
Manhood Test. If you talk like Prince Charles, stammer a lot,
refuse to go to a gym and live in fear of your lady friend, then
you probably are Hugh Grant. In a lively interview, the British
actor talks about his macho shortcomings and his role in the
gangster movie ``Mickey Blue Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More about men: Susan Faludi, whose 1992 book ``Backlash: The
Undeclared War Against American Women'' made her a feminist icon,
speaks out on the oppression of men in the September/October issue
of Mother Jones ($3.95). The author of the forthcoming book
``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man'' says that ``being a
feminist opens your eyes to the ways men, like women, are
imprisoned in cultural stereotypes.'' Even with the economy
booming, Faludi writes, men feel betrayed by their communities, by
their companies, and by their sports teams which abandon one city
for another. But the greatest sense of betrayal, she says, has to
do with the loyalty between fathers and sons. Instead of handing
off positions of leadership to their sons, the fathers of the World
War II generation gave them ``a consumer culture that focused on
winning, and on dominating everything and everyone. ... We are now
living in a culture that runs on image.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The music scene: When Rolling Stone ($3) covered Woodstock in
1969, managing editor Robert Love says the prose was idealistic to
the point of being almost dewy-eyed. ``Out of mud and hunger and
thirst,'' one reporter wrote, ``a new nation had emerged.'' Thirty
years later, the mood of the country has changed. In a report from
the trenches of Woodstock '99, correspondent Joe Rosenthal says
that a more fitting name for the gathering might have been
``Fratstock.'' It was simply one big party, with no thoughts of
peace or politics.

 &HT;    Real informant the star of `Family Values'
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analyze this: Watching mob movies are a left brain, right brain
experience.
</P>
<P>
   On some level, we're instinctively drawn to the colorful swagger
of characters who follow a strict code of respect and loyalty. But
we're also repulsed by men wearing pinky rings who kill for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not too surprising that TNT's documentary ``Family
Values: The Mob &AMP; the Movies'' can't decide if it's a lighthearted
look at the history of Hollywood gangsters, or a fascinating,
frightening meditation on a real-life mobster turned informant. Too
bad it tries to be both.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on the recent spate of movies such as ``Analyze This''
and ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' this two-hour tour through the show
business underworld is guided by Tony Sirico and Vincent Pastore, a
pair of wiseguys from the hit cable series ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   They are members of GAG _ the Gangster Actors Guild _ a crew of
Brooklyn-based regulars who have spent their careers playing
mobsters. The narrator is fellow GAG member Frank Vincent, a
white-haired, craggy-faced actor most moviegoers could easily pick
out of a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   GAG's small fraternity spends time busting each other's chops at
Bensonhurst social clubs, making spaghetti sauce and hanging out at
off-track betting parlors like any self-respecting gangster might.
But they make it clear that none of them ever becomes a ``made
guy'' _ a full-fledged Mafia solider.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes Dominick, a sad-faced, real ex-hood in a cartoonish
fake beard who steals the show from the make-believe mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever knew was backstabbing, lying and best friends
killing best friends,'' says Dominick, who doesn't give his last
name. ``I gave up the best wife and the best kids in the world to
be a creep.''
</P>
<P>
   We learn that Dominick has spent the last five years ``in the
wind,'' lingo for a soldier who
</P>
<P>
   ratted out his family and eventually left the federal witness
protection program to fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   His life _ recorded in family snapshots and chilling homemade
movies _ sounds like the plot of every great modern mob film we've
ever seen or memorized.
</P>
<P>
   Raised by an uncle who was a vicious mob captain in the Gambino
crime family, Dominick remembers cousins who suddenly disappeared,
missing school because of a gangland war and being ordered to kill
an old classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Dominick tried to get out of the family ``business''
(he was a Green Beret in Vietnam commended for combat bravery and
later formed a rock band), they kept pulling him back in.
</P>
<P>
   Dominick's narrative is so engrossing that midway through the
documentary the GAG-fellas' muddled moralizing about their onscreen
characters becomes an annoying, silly distraction. Who cares about
the wannabes when you have the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   There are other voices in ``Family Values'' worth hearing,
including character actor Paul Sorvino, former John Gotti attorney
Bruce Cutler and Katherine Narducci, an actor on ``The Sopranos''
whose father was killed in a mob-related shooting when she was 10.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Dominick's story that slices through the nonsense of
our collective Mafia-mania and offers a sobering dose of reality
that's very hard to refuse.

LITTLE CHANGED (SO FAR) IN PATRIOTS ROSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ If the Patriots roster were set today, the
midpoint of the preseason, there would be few changes from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Chris Carter plugs in for Willie Clay, Andy
Katzenmoyer for Ted Johnson, Tedy Bruschi for Todd Collins, and
Damien Woody for Dave Wohlabaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Other than center, the much-maligned offensive line of a year
ago is currently unchanged, which is good news for Todd Rucci, Max
Lane, Zefross Moss, and Bruce Armstrong, bad news for Damon Denson,
Ed Ellis, and Heath Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have no major shifts in what we're doing,'' said
coach Pete Carroll. ``We are shifting a little bit of playing time,
but nothing dramatic has happened. Nobody has made a move to take a
spot on the offensive line. Woody has a chance to start this week
and we'll see if he can make it through the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go with the best guys we got. The starters are holding
their spots. We're making progress. I don't see anything happening.
We've got two more weeks for these guys to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, Kevin Faulk will be starting at running back
over Lamont Warren, and Steve Israel is beating out Tebucky Jones
at right corner. The fullback spot could change, with Chris Floyd
edging Tony Carter, but indications are the two will share time.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also spoke of one or two young guys making the roster
because of their special teams prowess. Sean Morey and Bernard Russ
are the front-runners, but Florida State defensive end Willie
Cohens is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots follow their pattern of recent years, all of
this year's draft picks will make the team. This also could be the
year when some picks of three years ago _ fellows such as Denson
and Ellis _ are fighting to keep a spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots must reduce their current roster of 86 to 65 by
next Tuesday, then get down to 53 by 4 p.m. on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what the final roster may look like:
</P>
<P>
   --QUARTERBACK (3): Drew Bledsoe, John Friesz, and Michael
Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   There is no debate that these three will make it. Jim Murphy or
Scott Mutryn could stick on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   --RUNNING BACK (4): Kevin Faulk, Lamont Warren, Derrick Cullors,
and Harold Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots could tweak this if they pick up a veteran running
back. It doesn't appear that Marques Brigham, the rookie from
Wyoming, will have a spot, though he is a practice squad candidate.
Though Cullors and Warren do the same things, Cullors is valuable
as a kick returner; for the moment, nobody is better.
</P>
<P>
   --FULLBACK (2): Chris Floyd and Tony Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The only debate here is, who starts? The Patriots prefer Floyd
as a blocker and a tough runner at the goal line, but Carter has
the experience and catches the ball very well.
</P>
<P>
   --RECEIVERS (6): Terry Glenn, Shawn Jefferson, Vincent Brisby,
Tony Simmons, Troy Brown, and Sean Morey.
</P>
<P>
   This is where things may get interesting. Will all five veterans
be on the roster Opening Day or will either Jefferson or Brisby be
dealt, for draft picks or to fill another need? And whither Morey?
All indications are that the Brown grad has made it, based on his
special teams play and his fourth-quarter receiving. He shows grit
and fight.
</P>
<P>
   --TIGHT END (4): Ben Coates, Rod Rutledge, Henry Lusk, Mike
Bartrum.
</P>
<P>
   The first two are no-brainers, and Bartrum is the long snapper,
so he makes it. The question is, Lusk or rookie free agent Jamie
Bowers from Wabash, who is also a fullback? The Patriots cleared
salary cap space by reworking Lane's contract to fit Lusk in, so
they must believe he'll be on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   --OFFENSIVE LINE (8): Zefross Moss, Bruce Armstrong, Damien
Woody, Todd Rucci, Max Lane, Heath Irwin, Damon Denson, Jason
Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll reiterated at his press conference Monday that the
backup guys haven't pushed any of the starters out of a job. It'll
be interesting to watch how they handle fifth-round pick Derrick
Fletcher. Though enamored with his size, quickness, and strength,
they believe he needs time to learn the system. The decision may
come down to whether they should keep Fletcher on the roster or
risk placing him on the practice squad, which means he has to go
through waivers. If the Patriots want to keep an extra defensive
lineman, Ellis could be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   --DEFENSIVE LINE (8): Willie McGinest, Chad Eaton, Henry Thomas,
Chris Sullivan, Brandon Mitchell, Greg Spires, Garrett Johnson,
Leonta Rheams.
</P>
<P>
   They are fragile here and must be careful about whom they keep.
Johnson is a tough kid who has made an impression inside, which is
where they're most vulnerable to injuries (Thomas and Eaton are
already hurt). Rheams also has looked good inside. Veteran free
agent Sterling Palmer and rookie free agent Willie Cohens could
break in. Carroll mentioned that Cohens could make the special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   --LINEBACKERS (7): Chris Slade, Tedy Bruschi, Andy Katzenmoyer,
Ted Johnson, Marty Moore, Bernard Russ, Dana Cottrell.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have to decide whether to keep Johnson on the
active roster or place him on injured reserve. Despite the recent
surge by Katzenmoyer and Bruschi, the Patriots will likely tinker
with this group before deciding on the final six or seven. Cottrell
has been getting a shot lately and has pushed third-year vet Vernon
Crawford out of the picture, but Crawford still has a shot to get
back into it. Newly acquired Aaron Adams, who flunked his Packer
physical before being signed here, needs to show something in a
hurry. Ron Merkerson, who was on IR last year, needs to rebound
from his latest injury before the rosters are set.
</P>
<P>
   --CORNERBACKS (4): Ty Law, Steve Israel, Tebucky Jones, Kato
Serwanga.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will likely go with five corners, but the fifth man
may not be on the team yet. These four are sure bets, and there's
always the possibility they go with an extra safety, such as
sixth-rounder Marcus Washington, who can play both positions.
</P>
<P>
   --SAFETIES (4): Lawyer Milloy, Chris Carter, Larry Whigham, Tony
George.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is the bubble guy. He'll have to have a strong final
two games or he'll wind up on the practice squad, especially if the
Patriots acquire another defensive back. The Patriots like Cory
Gilliard of Ball State, who had a good NFL Europe season, but he
hasn't played yet because of knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   --KICKERS (2): Adam Vinatieri, Lee Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The only debate is over which of the two will kick off. Johnson
appears to be in the lead based on the past two games. Young kicker
Marcus Williams looks like a practice squad guy, as Phil Dawson was
a year ago.

BRET SPARES SOUTH TEXAS COAST; INLAND BRACES FOR RAIN, TWISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ Communities along the south coast of Texas
breathed a sigh of relief at narrowly escaping heavy damage from
their first major hurricane in two decades, while inland residents
Monday braced for Bret's potent remnants in the form of tornadoes
and flash floods.
</P>
<P>
   Even as families began returning to the homes they fled when
Hurricane Bret was approaching the mainland on Sunday, officials
issued warnings for the second consecutive day that people in the
Rio Grande Valley take cover and clear the roads because of
torrential rains and the threat of deadly twisters.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 25 inches of rain pelted portions of this cattle and
farming region, turning streets and highways into rivers and
flooding low-lying areas, officials said. Several funnel clouds and
at least two tornadoes were spotted in different inland areas as
the storm continued to march west toward Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the worst of the storm for us,'' said Eleazar
Garcia, city manager of Raymondville, a small town where at least
two funnel clouds were spotted Monday afternoon. ``The hurricane
was not as bad as we thought, but the rest of the danger is the
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the hurricane, residents and officials reported no
casualties or heavy damage from the sweeping winds and driving rain
that moved unpredictably across the region throughout the day. But
authorities warned that flash floods and tornadoes could hit at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   The anxieties prompted by the afternoon storms were in contrast
to the relief felt earlier in the day that this area near the
Mexican border had escaped the muscle of Bret's punch.
</P>
<P>
   Many families who had taken shelter in schools and community
centers on Sunday, when the hurricane hit, returned to their homes
in the morning only to go back to the shelters when threat of
tornadoes and floods became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   One state emergency official, who requested anonymity, wondered
whether local workers had been premature in allowing residents to
return to their neighborhoods before it was clear that Bret had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day, winds inland were reported between 40 and
55 mph and up to 25 inches of rain fell in Kenedy County, where the
eye of the hurricane passed on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains and flash floods were also expected further north in
the city of Laredo, where forecasters predicted up to 20 inches of
rain. At least 3,800 residents were evacuated and moved to higher
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the region's residents, the formula for dealing
with Bret seemed to be a mixture of early preparation, careful
monitoring and a heaping of good luck.
</P>
<P>
   With winds as strong as 140 mph and waves up to 25-feet high on
Sunday morning before it made landfall, the hurricane seem poised
to be one of the deadliest to hit the Texas coast in more than 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of hitting directly on any of the heavily-populated
cities that dot the coast, Bret's eye passed between Brownsville
and Corpus Christi, over rural towns which had been largely
evacuated by the time the hurricane arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Some damage was reported in the towns of Falfurrias, about 60
miles west of Corpus Christi, where residents said roofs were
ripped from homes and most of the town had no electrical power.
Several mobile homes and other insecure structures were heavily
damaged in Port Mansfield, about 50 miles north of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning,
once the minimum sustained winds fell below 74 mph. Meterologists
expected the heavy rains to continue, although weaker, as the storm
pushed ahead over land with diminished winds.
</P>
<P>
   Bret was the first storm to hit directly on this area since
Hurricane Allen blew through in 1980, causing serious damage and
killing three people.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its bluster, though, Bret may have brought some
much-needed moisture to the area. Officials said that several areas
of the state have registered less than average rainfall this year,
including Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky this time, but we always have to be prepared,''
said Irma Cantu, 39, a waitress in Brownsville who spent most of
the storm's worst moments in a dark house with boarded windows. ``I
hope we don't have to go through something like this again for
another 20 years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, members of Congress have slipped
millions of dollars into spending bills to build dams and highways
back home. Increasingly, the money is going to academic studies of
papaya viruses, wood pulp, auto safety and the aurora borealis.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are lobbying to get money directly from Congress,
rather than from federal foundations and institutes, in a process
that critics say often sacrifices good science for politics. By
getting provisions _ called earmarks _ inserted into spending
bills, universities and their lobbyists have obtained over $7
billion since 1980. Earmarked legislation in this year's federal
budget was a record $797 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same phenomenon that used to result in sewers and
bridges,'' said Bob Park, a physics professor at the University of
Maryland and director of the Washington office of the American
Physical Society, an organization of more than 40,000 physicists.
``Academic science has now replaced the sewers as the place where
the money goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal money for research traditionally has come from
institutions like the National Science Foundation after proposals
go through a rigorous process of review by scientific panels.
Supporters of that process call it a meritocracy run by scientists
and academics, rather than a struggle for political pork.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of earmarking, like John Silber, chancellor of
Boston University, one of the largest beneficiaries of such money,
say it merely allows academics to appeal directly to the source of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about sordid _ they'd better read the
Constitution,'' said Silber, whose university has received over $57
million, including $48 million for two science centers. ``I've got
a right to appeal to the Congress. Every citizen does. If that's
dirty, the whole country's dirty. The Constitution's dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of academic earmarking say the practice distorts good
science. ``If politicians' decisions govern where research money is
spent, you will not necessarily set the right kinds of scientific
and national priorities,'' said Robert Walker, who was a Republican
House member from Pennsylvania for 20 years before retiring in
1997. ``The concern is that we jeopardize the long-term knowledge
base of the country by spending money in a political rather than a
scientific way.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker added: ``The universities are also at fault; they came to
town shopping for this kind of representation. I think it's been
very destructive. I had some testy sessions with deans and
presidents saying they were damaging their own credibility as well
as scientific policy. I asked one what he was going to use the
money for. He didn't know but said he was sure it would come in
handy.''
</P>
<P>
   James D. Savage, a professor of government at the University of
Virginia who wrote the only book on the subject, ``Funding Science
in America: Congress, Universities and the Politics of the Academic
Pork Barrel,'' said Congress and the public ``have no idea how the
$7 billion has been used to meet national needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Earmarking _ the word comes from a farmer's notching of a hog's
ear as a mark of ownership _ is an act of legislative legerdemain
that is used for many types of spending. A member of Congress
inserts a short paragraph in a spending bill, ordering that money
be spent on a certain program in a certain place. The insertion
usually occurs in a closed-door conference without public debate.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarking language is often deliberately obscure _ for example,
creating a tax break for a university ``established on Aug. 6,
1872,'' without naming the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarks sometimes seem to have little direct relationship to
the spending bills in which they appear. The foreign aid bill for
the coming year, for example, contains $485,000 for an agribusiness
program at the University of Idaho and $1 million for a soil
management project at Montana State University.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, millions of dollars were included in a last-minute
$500 billion omnibus spending bill that passed in October. Examples
include $1 million for Kings College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to
explore commercial pulverization technologies and a donation of a
$375,000 Coast Guard patrol boat to the University of South Alabama
for use in a scientific project.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken months for The Chronicle of Higher Education, which
tracks academic earmarks, to decode the legislative language used
to disguise them.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarks are often the work of a lobbying firm. In a filing last
year with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Washington
lobbying firm Cassidy &AMP; Associates, which said it had annual
revenues of more than $40 million, listed 30 colleges and
universities among its clients. It also said it intended to name
Silber as an outside director. Boston University paid the firm
$760,000 in 1998 for its assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, an increasing number of colleges and
universities have found it easier to go to Congress, keepers of the
government's purse, with the help of lobbyists than to go through
time-consuming peer-reviewed proposals. Congress can often provide
more money more quickly than institutions like the National
Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A disproportionate amount of money flows to universities and
colleges in states and congressional districts represented by
lawmakers who are experienced in the appropriations process or who
are members of the appropriations committees.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the largest recipient of academic earmarks between
1980 and 1996 was the University of Hawaii, with $197 million,
Savage said. Hawaii's senior senator, Daniel Inouye, a Democrat, is
a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest recipient was the University of Pittsburgh,
with $151 million. The university is the alma mater of Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa., who has long served on the House Appropriations
Committee. Universities in Alabama have gained millions of dollars
since its senior senator, Richard Shelby, a Republican, rose in
rank on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Earmarks in next year's spending bills benefiting the home
states of these three lawmakers include $500,000 for Auburn
University in Alabama to run a transportation management program,
$293,000 for the University of Hawaii to study the papaya ringspot
virus and $1 million for Pennsylvania State University to study
automobile accidents among older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Silber said the argument that earmarked appropriations were
dirty while peer review was pure _ a view expressed by the
Association of American Universities even though most of its 62
institutions have received earmarked money _ helped entrench an
elite group of universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley and Columbia _ all of those hogs
at the trough in the AAU _ they are the establishment,'' Silber
said. ``They don't want a new boy. You can sit there on the outside
and break your nose pushing against the glass. There are spiteful
individuals in the establishment who resent the fact that every now
and then a new boy gets in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Park said that ``the science community sees earmarking as
threatening the whole purity of peer review, resulting in serious
mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   Park cited as an example the efforts of Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, now chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars have gone to Alaskan universities to harness
the power of the aurora borealis, the electrical energy shimmering
in the northern skies, an objective that many consider elusive, at
best. The earmarks also financed, among other things, ``a
supercomputer north of the Arctic Circle'' without naming the
University of Alaska as the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only factor,'' Park said of getting an earmark
appropriation, ``is whether you've got the ear of a congressman who
sits on the right committee. It can cause a lot of trouble.''

ILIE ALL TORN UP _ ABOUT WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Before Brandi Chastain, the shirt-shedder,
there was Andrew Ilie.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't feel she's a copycat or that she infringed on his
act when the US women won the world kickball championship and she
ripped her jersey off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that came naturally to me _ to celebrate a
great occasion, a great win,'' Ilie said Monday at Longwood Cricket
Club after a leadoff victory over Andrei Pavel. ``I understand how
she felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Pro was on again, marking the 35th anniversary of its
long run here, but so was Ilie's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   This may have disappointed the growing cult of Ilie-watchers,
but Monday wasn't a day for a topless triumph, he said. The score
was 6-3, 1-0, before Pavel surrendered with a gimpy right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad for Andrei to have to quit; he was hurting,'' said
Ilie. ``It was no time to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the match rate a subtitle: ``championship of Romania on a
patch of Boston pavement''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' Ilie said while smiling, something he does often.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ilie, Romanian-born Australian, had gotten the better of
a Romanian who lives in Germany. Unlike Pavel, who plays Davis Cup
for the homeland, Ilie turned down a lucrative opportunity to do so
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eligible because of my Romanian birth,'' he said. ``But
I'm Australian first, and my goal is to play for Australia. I feel
very grateful that the country took me and my parents in 13 years
ago. Those were bad times in Romania under the Ceausescu
dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   But 10-year-old Andrew didn't joyfully tear his shirt to tatters
when the Ilies (father Dan, mother Katherine) scored a familial
victory by landing in the sunshine of Melbourne. They arrived from
a refugee camp in Austria with one bag apiece, and a few hundred
dollars. Shirts were precious. He wasn't on a clothier's free list
then, although in a few years he would be Australia's best
14-year-old tennis player, then 16 and 18, a pro at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Sartorial demolition began ``spontaneously'' last May in Paris
when he beat Swede Jonas Bjorkman in five tough sets as the French
Open commenced. You could hear the rrrrippp! on top of the Eiffel
Tower as Ilie danced gleefully and made the chemise suitable for
dust rags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was my best win,'' said Ilie, currently No. 53.
``Jonas had been in the top 10. I had to play five sets again in
the next round, beating Martin Rodriguez _ and there went another
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have had a hat trick of shirts, but, going five once
more, Ilie fell to Dominik Hrbaty. Still, it was a $27,337
three-day stretch of turning riches and rags. His wardrobe stayed
intact until Los Angeles three weeks ago, a double-dicer. The names
of his victims were big in his mind: Byron Black had spearheaded
Zimbabwe's huge upset of Australia during the 1998 Davis Cup; Goran
Ivanisevic was, well, the Croat Croaker, the guy who'd nearly
beaten Pete Sampras in the 1998 Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing of the usual frenzy in his post-Ivanisevic
garment dismembering. It was artistic, according to a witness.
Surgical. He went at it very slowly, savoring every
cotton-picking-apart tug.
</P>
<P>
   Longwood accommodated his largest and perhaps most appreciative
audience, 5,300, last month as Ilie, a squad member, ripped and
raved. He was leading the Aussies' celebration of their Davis Cup
victory over the US after Patrick Rafter clinched against Todd
Martin. ``It seemed like the thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five shirts have been sacrificed by the blocky, good-natured
23-year-old, a 5-foot-11-inch 160 pounder. Nevertheless, he has an
ample supply, saying he's ready to go on a tear in our town. Next
to test his rending tendencies Wednesday will be the survivor of an
intramural matinee matching Frenchman Guillaume Raoux and Sebastian
Grosjean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to have fun playing tennis,'' said Ilie, and he wants
the people watching to have fun, too. Maybe it comes with the name,
Ilie. Certainly Romania's foremost product was the picaresque Hall
of Famer Ilie Nastase. But this Ilie, Andrew, seldom boils over.
</P>
<P>
   He wraps a ``lucky'' red bandanna around his white cap and goes
about his work bullishly as though seeing red, mashing heavy
groundies.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys talking to umpires, like the other Ilie, but is more
playful. If he thinks an umpire has failed to hear a let, he will
crack his racket hard against the tape, inquiring, ``Could you hear
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Like most parents, Dan and Katherine Ilie would give the shirts
off their backs for their boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to leave Bucharest, get out of Romania then,'' said his
father, a metallurgical engineer (mom is a mechanical engineer).
``There was no future for Andrew. We were doing all right by the
standard of the time, but we wanted more for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took six years of applying for exit visas before they let
us go. Then we were a year in the refugee camp before Australia
would take us. Andrew is the only jock in the family, but I could
see that he could be a very good player. I'd taken him to the
Progresul Club when he was 5, and when he saw kids playing tennis
he said, `I want to play that game.' He had the gift, but Romania
was no place to develop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my engineering,'' papa said with a laugh, ``is devoted to
keeping Andrew in working order.''

FILENE'S BASEMENT SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign that the competitive discount apparel sector may
be ripe for a shakeout, the Filene's Basement Corp., which
pioneered the business of offering designer clothing at cut-rate
prices, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is no longer related to Filene's, said it had
assets of $200 million and liabilities of $148 million. It has
4,000 employees and operates 55 stores, including 12 in the New
York metropolitan area, and said all of its stores would continue
to operate until a reorganization plan is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement also said it had secured $135 million in
financing from the General Electric Capital Corp. and Paragon
Capital LLC, subject to bankruptcy court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Top creditors include companies like Sak's Fifth Avenue and
Nike.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind Filene's Basement started in 1908 when Edward
Filene decided to offer the previous season's fashions at low price
in the basement of his elegant Boston Department store. The company
was bought by Federated Department stores in 1929, which split
Filene's and Filene's Basement into two companies in 1984. Filene's
is now owned by the May Department Stores Co.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement, based in Wellesley, Mass., was taken private
in 1988 by top managers and then went public by in 1991. It is
probably best known for the quarterly wedding dress sales at its
flagship Boston store, where brides-to-be have been known to fight
for $8,000 Christian Dior gowns that can be had for as little as
$280.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing surprised few in the industry because the
chain, has had sales troubles since the mid-1990s. Its stock had
been sinking since January. A week ago, the company said it lost
about $15 million in the quarter ended July 31 on sales of $144
million.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of Filene's Basement's troubles was that
suppliers had stopped delivering merchandise because they feared
the chain would not meet it financial obligations. For bargain
chains that rely on customers returning frequently to sniff out a
new jewel, the lack of fresh offerings can prove deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our stores' inventory below optimal levels, we determined
it was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders to file for
Chapter 11 in order to insure strong inventory positions prior to
the holiday selling season,'' Sam Gerson, the chairman and chief
executive of Filene's Basement, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue is that the discount and off-price apparel
sector, which has been highly competitive in recent years, is
increasingly dominated by a few big companies, putting pressure on
smaller players. Loehmann's Inc., another venerable name in the
off-price apparel world, filed for bankruptcy protection in May. In
particular, the TJX Co., the owner of both T.J. Maxx and Marshall's
stores, which had $8 billion in sales last year, has been
aggressively scooping up the best offerings from houses like Ralph
Lauren and Donna Karan, leaving Filene's to pick over clothes in
colors like burnt orange and chartreuse and offer lesser status
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Filene's competitors have also been raising their
profiles through aggressive advertising, a move Filene's could not
or would not counter. ``The others have been very sharp with both
pricing and promotional vehicles, but Filene's still operates as if
low price only is enough to get people through the doors,'' said
Wendy Liebmann, president of W.S.L. Strategic Retail.
</P>
<P>
   Before the filing, Filene's Basement said it had been working on
a strategy to streamline the business. The headquarters staff was
recently pared 15 percent, to 200 people. The company is focusing
on a concept known as Aisle 3 stores. The company now operates four
of these stores, which are open only on the weekends and offer
moderate brands, as opposed to designers, at discounted prices. It
plans to open four more by the end of the year.

TRAGEDY STRIKES SOUTH TEXAS FAMILY FLEEING HURRICANE BRET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By S.K. BARDWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sabas Quiroga feared for his family's safety. As
Hurricane Bret approached Sunday, he loaded up his wife and
children and left their mobile home in Seadrift, heading up the
coast to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of the family's arrival at a southeast Houston
motel, Quiroga, 32, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Quiroga said their children were hungry after the
150-mile drive, and after they were settled into a room at the Red
Carpet Inn about 9:30 p.m. CDT, her husband decided to walk to a
fast-food restaurant on the other side of the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   As he reached the inside northbound lane of the freeway, Sgt.
Mark Newcomb of the Houston Police Department said the wind blew
off Sabas Quiroga's hat. He stopped and stepped back to retrieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Quiroga saw a vehicle strike her husband. It tossed him
up in the air and into the windshield of another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomb said the driver who struck Quiroga stopped. The sergeant
said he doesn't believe the driver was at fault, and he doesn't
expect any charges will be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the room at the Red Carpet Inn, the children heard the
commotion and ran outside before their mother could stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all at the scene,'' said Newcomb, who helped
investigate the accident. ``They kept asking, `Is that my dad? Is
that my dad?'''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the children and their mother were crying, as
were some of the officers and many of the passers-by who stopped to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was (their father), but we didn't want to tell them
there in front of everybody,'' Newcomb said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, police called Ben Taub Hospital, where a room was set
up for the family and the bad news related in privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heartbreaking, very sad situation, to see all those
children,'' Newcomb said. ``They didn't have any money.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `I can't go to bed tonight, until I do
something.''' Newcomb began making telephone calls to anyone who
might help.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Santana Funeral Home had offered its services to the
family at no charge, and the Sabas Quiroga Memorial Fund had been
set up for contributions to help the family.
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to donate to the fund may mail money to the Sabas
Quiroga Memorial Fund at Seaport Bank, P.O. Box 670, Seadrift,
Texas 77983.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Melinda and the five children, ages 3 to 12, spent the night on
the floor in the family room at Ben Taub Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Sabas' brother, Jose Quiroga, drove in from Tyler, Texas, as
soon as he heard about the accident, and he and Sabas' older sister
were trying to care for the family Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The widow had no idea of what she would do. ``We'll go home, I
guess, because that's the only home we have,'' she said. ``I just
don't know what to do when we get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Quiroga said his brother worked in construction and made
just enough to keep his family going. Melinda, Jose said, is
disabled and cannot work.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Jose said it appeared the family's trailer in
Seadrift, just south of Port Lavaca, was untouched by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fleeing the hurricane, but he caught up with death
anyway,'' Jose said of his brother. ``Just a different way.''

FED EXPECTED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it done.
</P>
<P>
   Financial-market analysts and economists are confident that
Federal Reserve Board members will vote Tuesday to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices at both the retail and wholesale level were
remarkably tame in July, and no one can be certain the Fed will
raise rates, the widely held belief is that the Fed must act to
rein in an economy that is simply growing too fast.
</P>
<P>
   If Fed members, at their scheduled meeting, boost the federal
funds rates, as expected, by another quarter of a percentage point,
to 5.25 percent, it would mark a second preemptive strike against
inflationary steam that may be building in an economy forecast to
pick up momentum as the year rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   The funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other for
overnight loans, was first raised a quarter-point, to 5 percent, on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged to a record high Monday
of 11,299.76, despite investors' expectations of a rate hike _ an
event that would normally send markets tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nonevent,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer
for BankBoston Corp. Now, Riley added, ``The markets are working on
the proposition that's the last increase we'll see for quite a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The market's certainty stems from recent testimony by Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan, including a July 22 speech to Congress in
which he warned that he would not hesitate to raise rates if data
suggest ``the pace of cost and price increases will be picking
up.'' As if on cue a week later, the employment cost index for the
second quarter leaped 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do anything that would be absolutely
mind-boggling,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet
Financial Group Inc., ``The reaction would probably be a big rally
on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors and economists said they believe a rate hike is
required to undo the three rate reductions, in rapid succession,
the Fed announced last fall to soothe world currency markets and to
avert a near-crisis on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But, the data watched closely by the Fed to gauge inflation
continue to send mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, government reports showed consumer and
wholesale prices in July have been calm. The consumer price index
rose just 0.3 percent in July, an increase spurred largely by a
spike in gasoline prices. The producer price index rose a modest
0.2 percent last month, following a 0.1 percent drop in June.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Angell, a former Fed governor during the Reagan and early
Clinton administrations, noted that the core inflation rate _ the
CPI minus volatile food and energy prices _ has risen only 1.7
percent, annualized, this year. In 1998, the core CPI rose 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given such data, ``What is there that requires us to act today?
Why not wait for more data?'' asked Angell, a senior vice president
of Bear Stearns Co. Such a sentiment, he said, ``may be overlooked
by such a strong consensus as to what the the Fed will do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next meeting to set monetary policy is scheduled for
Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the
second quarter after growing 4.3 percent in the first, but is
expected to accelerate this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock market typically falls when rates rise, the
market, oddly, soared in anticipation of the outcome of the Fed
meeting. That's because investors long ago factored in the Fed's
action and are now looking beyond it to whether a third rate hike
would follow, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged 199.15 points to a new
record close of 11,299.76. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a
broader measure of the market, gained 23.61 points and closed at
1360.22.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, said Doug Cliggott, equity strategist for J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Co. in New York, ``is like a beach ball. Try to hold it
under water. It wants to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   One force pushing the market higher, Cliggott said, has no
direct link to interest rates: an ``astonishing'' influx of foreign
capital, in the form of overseas, mainly European, acquisitions of
US companies. Through July, overseas companies announced mergers or
acquisitions of US companies valued at $242 billion. That's on a
pace to far oustrip the $232 billion in similar deals for all of
1998 and $64 billion in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the market rally, economists said, is that
investors may also be hoping that two positive inflation reports
indicate that while the Fed would raise rates, it may continue to
hold a neutral bias toward further increases in rates in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's Perna said the Dow's rise in the wake of the last
tightening by the Fed may be in response to a drop in yields on
30-year Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term government bond has fallen from recent highs of
about 6.20 percent to below 6 percent. Thirty-year yields Monday
fell 1 basis point to 5.98 percent, the lowest level since July 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also sent the stock market soaring on June 30 when it
last boosted interest rates. Although its announcement of a rate
increase was expected, investors were ebullient at the Fed's
remarks that no future rate increases were planned.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Dow has gained more than 325 points, while the
S&AMP;P has lost 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cut and dried that they're going to hike funds another
quarter point'' at the Fed meeting, said David Jones, a veteran Fed
watcher for Aubrey Lanston &AMP; Co., a New York securities firm. ``The
markets are pretty comfortable with that idea, and they could
conclude that would be the last one for a while.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer and Rand are my Sara and Gerald Murphy. (Or _ a more
disturbing thought _ I am their Zelda Fitzgerald.) Like the
Murphys, the Americans who almost singlehandedly made the Riviera
fashionable in the '20s, these are friends who know how to enjoy
life and how to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've visited them in New York, Philadelphia,
Jamaica, Switzerland and the Berkshires, and I've never had less
than a wonderful time. Whether we're having Negronis before a city
dinner or plantains at a Caribbean breakfast, food and drinks
always taste better and the conversation seems more sparkling when
they're the hosts.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Rand, facing the trauma of his 50th birthday, announced
that they planned to spend it in Provence at a house he and
Jennifer had rented several times before, I immediately invited
myself. ``Next year in Fayence!'' we said, waving goodbye last
summer at their rented house in Rhode Island. I didn't know where
Fayence was exactly, but that seemed incidental. Fly to Nice. Hitch
a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Which I did. But as is so often the case, the adventure began at
the airport, in this case Charles de Gaulle, near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There are nonstop flights from New York to Nice, but I
sacrificed that for a lower air fare ($444 round trip on Air
France, reserved six weeks ahead, but available only on flights
through Paris). Two other guests landed air fares of $262, thanks
to an Alitalia sale announced the day after I booked my flights.
Those are the breaks.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived at de Gaulle, after a stress-free overnight
flight from New York, I couldn't find my connecting flight to Nice
on any of the airport's information screens. In pathetic French, I
asked, and was told to walk to Terminal F. This was an invigorating
stroll (comparable to walking from Times Square to Columbus Circle
indoors), but unfortunately none of the information screens there
listed a flight to Nice either.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I spotted my flight number on the screen, but the
destination was listed as Toulon. I decided that Nice must be an
intermediate stop or something. Only when I opened my copy of The
International Herald Tribune did I learn what was happening: ``Nice
Airport Stoppage in 4th Day'' read a headline near the bottom of
page 2. The first French word I ever learned outside the classroom
was greve (strike), and it has come in handy all too often.
</P>
<P>
   And so after some delays, I arrived in Toulon (on the coast,
east of Marseilles) at 3:25 p.m., about the time I had planned to
be checking into my hotel. The free Air France bus left at 4:10;
almost two hours later, we arrived at the Nice airport, where taxis
were waiting as if the airport were actually in use. After another
hour and a $37 taxi ride, I checked into the Le Metropole in
Beaulieu-sur-Mer.
</P>
<P>
   Provence may be paradise, but it doesn't have a beach. So my
plan was to spend the first two days of the trip on the Cote
d'Azur, feeding my insatiable need for a water view. I had stayed
at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes once and loved it, but Cannes seemed
almost urban and, anyway, the beach was all the way across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   None of the alleged world travelers I knew had a good hotel
recommendation in the area, so I chose Le Metropole from a
guidebook, based on a combination of factors. It was between Nice
and Monaco, a ``huge white villa'' with ``opulent gardens,'' a
pool, a beach and room service, the service was described as
peerless, the clientele as wealthy but ``anything but flashy,'' and
the clincher: it was a Relais et Chateaux property. What worried me
was the room rate: about $145. Since when do you get luxury on the
Riviera for this price?
</P>
<P>
   But I did. Considering the rates, I would have splurged and
reserved an oceanview room but a garden view was the only thing
available on the dates I needed. And the garden view was such that
by turning my head slightly to the right, I was facing the pool and
the Mediterranean beyond it. From where I stood, the two bodies of
blue water seemed to merge. The pool is heated, so even though it
was only late April it was being put to use.
</P>
<P>
   The room was smallish but very pleasant with black-and-tan
carpet, white-on-white latticework wallpaper, a small television on
top of a minibar, and a walk-in closet. The bath was small but
elegant, white and chrome, with a forceful shower, double basins
and a real medicine cabinet with triple mirrors. Its only flaw was
a weak hair dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu turned out to be a charming town, and I spent my two
days strolling, shopping a little and just reading and staring at
the sea from the hotel lobby or its small outdoor tables
overlooking the water. On the second day, it was warm enough to
take advantage of the pool but I had to meet George and Mary,
friends from San Francisco, at the airport and move on.
</P>
<P>
   When I checked out, my bill _ including meals (except one goat
cheese salad I'd had in town), considerable wine and careless
expenditures like small $6 bottles of Evian from the minibar to
carry around with me _ came to about $485. The food, incidentally,
was excellent; completely out of control, I ate a basketful of
bread at every meal.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in the middle of the airport strike, George and Mary's
plane managed to land in Nice. The flight was late, though, so I
had a little airport food while I waited. Only in France can you do
that and find yourself savoring a large piece of crisp, very
lightly breaded whitefish (the plat du jour), a large serving of
haricots verts accented with red peppers, mushrooms and eggplant, a
bottle of Pellegrino and a half bottle of very decent local red
wine (Chateau Virant 1997, Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence). The bill was
just under $20.
</P>
<P>
   We soon piled into a rented Citroen, got out our hand-drawn maps
and headed out on Autoroute A8. Less than an hour later, we were in
Fayence (which turned out to be west of Grasse). Jennifer and Rand
seemed dressed for New England, including hip boots, a sign that
the weather might not be as glorious as we'd hoped, and Jennifer
was worried that the house might be ``a little too rustique.''
</P>
<P>
   It was definitely not a palace. The kitchen looked like a
particularly dreary ``before'' picture in a decorating magazine.
The living room was the size of a breakfast nook. To get to my
bedroom, I had to walk through George and Mary's, and there was one
bathroom for five people.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an olive grove and a set of stone steps leading up
a hill to the ``pool'' (actually an ancient sheep dip). Something
was at work _ the transforming power of great hosts, some
exclusively Provencal magic, I don't know _ but a couple of hours
later, we were happy as clams.

 &HT;    Possible busing halt has NAACP, parents waiting for judge's
decision
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ In the city that pioneered busing as a tool
for school desegregation, some of Charlotte-Mecklenburg's public
schools could again become segregated if a federal judge allows the
district to end busing, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But while an end to forced busing would mean that some schools
would be either all-white or all-black, Mecklenburg County
Commission Chairman Parks Helms said, it would not mean ``that we
are going back to separate but equal.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility, however, alarms the NAACP and others who
oppose any retreat in the integration of the county's 101,000
school students, whose fate is in the hands of U.S. District Judge
Robert Potter. The outcome in the case, brought by white parents,
could have broad ramifications on race in public education,
especially if an appeal reaches the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as school officials in DeKalb County, Ga., and in
Boston are stopping busing as a means to achieve integration. In
cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland and Seattle, school districts are
phasing out desegregation plans.
</P>
<P>
   The trend seems bolstered by the findings of a recent study
sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. In a random survey of 1,001 people, aged 18 to 29,
about 50 percent of whites said separation of the races is
acceptable, as long as everybody has equal opportunities. About 40
percent of blacks responded the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Griffin, chairman of Charlotte-Mecklenburg's Board of
Education, said the findings do not suggest to him that public
acceptance of segregation in schools and other institutions is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte has too much invested in integration to reverse
course, said Griffin, 50, who attended all-black public schools in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get back to rigidly separate schools, you lose the
public will to make these schools a positive educational
experience,'' Griffin said Monday in an interview, after appearing
at a public gathering in downtown Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Local school, political, business and church leaders issued a
call for unity in what has has been a wrenching debate over schools
in this fast-growing city of 500,000 people. The discord comes 30
years after another federal judge ordered busing in Charlotte, then
a relatively unheralded Southern city where the peaceful
desegregation of schools served as a model for other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The 1969 ruling, Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of
Education, set a national precedent, ushering in busing in many
cities seeking to desegregate schools.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Charlotte, a 1997 lawsuit challenging the Swann ruling
led to a three-month trial that ended in June. A group of white
parents sued, arguing that forced busing and race-based student
placement violated their constitutional guarantee of equal
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The original plaintiff, Bill Capacchione, complained that his
daughter waited two years trying to enroll in one of the county's
magnet schools. At the time of the lottery for seats, spots
reserved for black children had gone unfilled. Blacks eventually
took the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are bused because of their race,'' said Scott
Willard, 34, another plaintiff. He said he believes it is unlawful
that his two daughters are forced to travel 10 miles to a
predominantly black school, even though six other elementary
schools are closer to their northeastern Charlotte home.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others who attended Monday's meeting, Willard believes
that Potter's ruling will bring an end to Charlotte-Mecklenburg's
forced busing, at least the way it has been practiced over three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 12,000 students in Charlotte-Mecklenburg are forcibly
bused. Historically, black inner-city children have been bused to
predominantly white suburban schools. Since 1992, a growing number
of white students have voluntarily been bused to inner-city magnet
schools, raising concern among black parents.
</P>
<P>
   If the school board decides to turn magnet schools into
neighborhood schools_a likely scenario if forced busing ends_black
parents fear their children will not have adequate access. The
Board of Education has endorsed a plan to eliminate busing for
integration over five years by dividing schools into three to five
geographic areas that would reflect the county's racial and
socio-economic diversity. In that way, students would be able to
attend schools in the areas where they live.
</P>
<P>
   While school officials generally believe that the judge will
decide that Charlotte's schools have reached an acceptable level of
desegregation, and thus busing can end, nobody is sure of the
outcome. The NAACP has threatened to appeal if it believes that
desegregation is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot stop busing now,'' said Reginald Hawkins, 75, a
Presbyterian minister and dentist who was a plaintiff in the
original lawsuit in 1965.

 UNDATED: as clams.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a visit to the local olive oil factory and the supermarket
(I love French supermarkets: they look just like American ones
until you notice that there's a creme fraiche section and those
things on ice next to the shrimp are giant eels), the five of us
were in the kitchen having a little foie gras on brioche toast and
drinking a white Cote du Rhone, Domaine de Durban
Beaumes-de-Venise, that Rand said went perfectly with foie gras _
and it did. Mary snapped the haricots verts while Jennifer cooked.
We might as well have been at Villa America.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Friday, was Rand's birthday, and our hosts had
made reservations at Le Castellaras, a nearby restaurant in the
hills. We were meeting the other two guests, John and Corby, who
were staying at a hotel in the village. It rained, but the
restaurant's nighttime view was still beautiful. The main dining
room is formal with a massive fireplace, but it feels open because
the outside wall is floor-to-ceiling glass. Beyond that is a
gorgeous patio that must be heaven on summer days.
</P>
<P>
   The food was largely wonderful, particularly the foie gras and
langoustine terrine, the cheese course and the wine. One guest had
brought along a bottle as a gift, and the sommelier graciously
opened it for us. Although he announced, only half-joking, ``There
is no wine in California,'' after decanting the gift bottle, he
pronounced it ``not bad.'' Gifts were opened, toasts were made, and
Rand survived his cinquantenaire.
</P>
<P>
   Fayence itself is one of those hilltop conglomerations of red
roofs and narrow medieval streets where every shopfront exudes
effortless charm and you could swear that nothing has been changed
in a century at the very least. It has a nice Saturday morning
market, with everything from wonderfully smelly cheeses to
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   During our three days in Fayence, we did some shopping in the
village, but mostly for food. My only nonedible purchase was at
Fayence-Tissu, a great fabric store where everything looks like
Pierre Deux but costs less. I picked up matching Provencal-print
oven mitts and toiletries bag, which will come in really handy if I
ever want to bake my shampoo, moisturizer and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   One day, we made a group excursion to St.-Tropez. I had been
there before and warned the others that they were going to be
disappointed (they were) but no one listened. One day, we drove
back to Beaulieu. But mostly we ate: simple lunches on the patio of
lettuce, tomatoes, tuna, olives, cornichons, delicious bread and
cold white wine; one breakfast of amazing croissants from the
patisserie in the village, strawberry jam from the farmers' market,
strong coffee and some candy that Corby had brought from Nice.
</P>
<P>
   On our last night, we had dinner at Patin Couffin, which I
translated as the Skating Basket or Skate in a Basket, neither of
which made any sense (it turns out that in the Nicois dialect, it
really means something like ``this and that''). It was a rustic
place in the village that the others had discovered on a morning
walk. Our table was in a cavelike alcove with plaster walls and low
ceiling, which matched the hearty, inexpensive food. We paid about
$35 each for appetizers, main courses, desserts and voluminous
amounts of wine. (I had the sole and a pork terrine; both were very
good.)
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight of the evening was meeting the owner,
Virginie, a transsexual who likes to play Marilyn Monroe albums as
background music. The last thing I remember is Virginie sitting in
somebody's lap and all of us singing along to ``Diamonds Are a
Girl's Best Friend.'' Feeling very old, we gave special emphasis to
the line ``and we all lose our charms in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to have to turn 50 (or 40 or 60 or any of those
round numbers), I am now sure that doing it in the right place can
substantially reduce the pain. Especially if foie gras is involved.
</P>
<P>
   French charm
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before driving to Fayence, I stayed at Le Metropole, 15
Boulevard du Marechal Leclerc, 06310 Beaulieu-sur-Mer, a 47-room
seaside hotel, with bar, restaurant and heated outdoor pool.
Doubles with bath, $145 to $450; telephone (33-4) 93.01.00.08, fax
(33-4) 93.01.18.51.

<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   Le Castellaras, Fayence, (33-4) 94.76.13.80, fax (33-4)
94.84.17.50, has a Michelin star. The lamb and the frogs' legs are
specialties. Dinner with wine is about $50 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Patin Couffin, Placette Olivier, Fayence, (33-4) 94.76.29.96,
serves hearty, casual Provencal cuisine. Dinner with wine: $25 to
$35 a person.  &QL;

<P>
   Fayence-Tissu, 24 Place Leon Roux, 83440 Fayence, (33-4)

makeup bag is about $25, a pair of oven mitts $17.

 &HT;    Possible busing halt has NAACP, parents waiting for judge's

 &HT;    BRAVES NOTEBOOK: Maddux not in as much pain
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Maddux said Monday afternoon his right wrist was
feeling much better, which means a start for him Friday may at
least be possible, a start the next time through the rotation
likely and talk of his missing the rest of the season is beginning
to fade out.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had an MRI on Monday which confirmed the earlier
diagnosis of a chipped bone and a sprained right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real encouraged by how much better I feel than
yesterday,'' Maddux said Monday afternoon. ``I'm pleasantly
surprised. Yesterday was no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux even asked manager Bobby Cox if he could play a little
long toss on Monday, though Cox recommended he didn't. Maddux was
just happy to return to some normalcy in his everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can brush my teeth, tie my shoes,'' Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   As courtesy to his fellow starters, Maddux plans to get together
with Cox and make a decision about his Friday start on Wednesday.
That would allow Terry Mulholland the off day Thursday to get ready
for the start on Friday in St. Louis if Maddux can't go. Maddux
could very well skip his next start and pitch Aug. 31 in Cincinnati
when his turn comes around again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three more days to get treatment, let it heal up and
see if I can pitch Friday,'' Maddux said. ``If not, I'll try to get
ready to pitch the next time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux hasn't missed a start since April of 1997 when he missed
one with a hamstring strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his mind, I think he wants to make his next start, but
we'll see,'' Cox said. ``We'll wait a couple days and play it by
ear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cox is sounding and feeling much more positive on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a disaster,'' Cox said. ``He could have
been out all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan to get shot
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan paid a second visit to a hand specialist on Monday
and was reassured his right hand was getting no worse physically,
though the pain undoubtedly was. To combat that, Jordan is planning
to get a third cortisone shot on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two cortisone shots have been ineffective probably because the
affected area is so small. Jordan will have to miss three to five
games following the shot, but is hoping if he gets it after
Wednesday's afternoon game he can miss only Friday's game following
the off day Thursday and try to return on Saturday in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been bothered by a sore right hand ever since he was
hit by a Mike Thurman pitch on June 22. Sunday afternoon was one of
his toughest days yet but he still finished with two hits and drove
in the game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind it felt like it was getting worse, but it really
wasn't,'' Jordan said. ``The doctor said `You're playing every day,
you're swinging and using it, you're going to generate a lot of
pain...All I've got to do is suck up the pain. It's hard to do. It
just frustrates me. I'm so angry on the bench. I'm growling at
people on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's game-winning hit Sunday brought him his 99th RBI of the
season. He's topped 100 in RBI only one other season - in 1996 with
the Cardinals when he drove in a career-high 104. Through Sunday's
game, Jordan was hitting .300 and was on pace to drive in 127 RBI
this season and score 108 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred (RBI) is still a big deal,'' Jordan said. ``My
goal every year is to score 100 runs, drive in 100 runs and hit
.300.''
</P>
<P>
   All in the family
</P>
<P>
   If Reds third baseman Aaron Boone has been looking for some
fun-loving trash talk from his older brother Bret, he's apparently
been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries to talk trash, but I don't,'' Bret Boone said.
``He'll call me up and say `We're for real.'... This is not a big
series. What's bigger than losing two out of three to San Diego?
Every series is big.''
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time in their lives the two Boones, the
sons of former major leaguer Bob Boone and grandson of former major
league Ray Boone, have played against each other at any level. The
first was May 2 in Atlanta when the Braves beat the Reds 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's happy for us,'' Aaron Boone recently told the
Cincinnati Post of his brother and former Reds teammate. ``But deep
down I can tell he thinks we're playing a little over our heads.
That's OK because I understand that Braves mentality. They're
thinking `There's the Braves and then there's everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the Braves named fired Detroit Tigers pitching coach Rick
Adair their minor league pitching coordinator. Adair worked as the
Tigers pitching coach from September of 1996 until he was released
on July 9. Adair was also the pitching coach for the Cleveland
Indians in 1992 and 1993. Adair will take over on Sept. 15. He'll
replace Jerry Nyman, who will be reassigned.

AS FED PREPARES TO MEET ON RATES, THE MARKETS JUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors swaggered back into stocks Monday, surer
than ever that the Federal Reserve Board, at its meeting Tuesday,
will raise rates only once more and then be done, at least for this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of
11,299.76, up 199.15 points, or 1.79 percent. The average has risen
23 percent so far this year, well above its 16 percent gain during
all of 1998. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also rose 1.77 percent
Monday, but remains 4.1 percent below its high reached on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout in investor mood comes after weeks of
directionless and confused stock trading. Having peaked in
mid-July, most of the market indexes fell as investors grew
concerned that rising commodity prices and labor costs as well as
strong economic growth around the world would push the Fed to take
a more aggressive stance on rates.
</P>
<P>
   A slight weakening in the dollar, which could push up prices of
imported goods and make U.S. stocks less attractive abroad, was
also a worry.
</P>
<P>
   Traders feared that the Fed's quarter-point increase in rates on
June 30 would be followed by similar increases at its meetings in
August and October, increases aimed at cooling an economy in danger
of overheating. But over the last week or so, a consensus started
to build that a quarter-point increase on Tuesday might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Helping investors to regain optimism was a trickle of economic
data indicating that inflation was still under control and that
growth in output was slowing. Bond traders, hypervigilant for
inflation harbingers, have liked what they have seen in the numbers
as well. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged
Monday at 5.985 percent, down from 6.277 percent Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates have stopped going up,'' said Alan Kral, vice
president at Trevor, Stewart, Burton &AMP; Jacobsen Inc., a money
management firm in New York, ``so people can focus on earnings
growth. If we don't have to worry about interest rates, the market
ought to do well, and people are getting a jump on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kral noted that by all accounts, third-quarter earnings at U.S.
companies will be robust, thanks mostly to rebounding global
economies in Europe, the Pacific Rim and Latin America. The results
will look especially good against the third quarter of 1998, when
economic crises in Latin America, Russia and the Far East dragged
down corporate profits. A slight weakening in the dollar will also
contribute to better sales of U.S. goods abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most economists believe that corporate earnings
will rise about 15 percent in the second half of 1999 from the
second half of 1998. If fulfilled, those predictions could become
fuel for even more stock-market gains.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the recent view among investors could quickly turn to
ash if economic data in coming weeks showed an economy that was a
bit too heated.
</P>
<P>
   Traders will pore over this week's news releases _ particularly
the growth rate of orders for refrigerators, washing machines and
other durable goods, out on Wednesday, and the revised gross
domestic product growth for June, out on Thursday. If either number
comes far afield of investors' expectations, inflation fears could
be reignited.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a fact of life on Wall Street that investors always
believe immediately before a Fed meeting at which rates are
expected to be increased that the increase will be the last.
Indeed, in June, after Greenspan and some of his colleagues had
warned investors that rates were likely to rise, most analysts said
that increase would be the last for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But stock investors seem now to believe that the Fed is simply
trying to slow the economy, and betting that it will not go too far
and bring it to a halt. As they grow more comfortable in their view
of the Fed's abilities to fine-tune the economy, they may be happy
to buy stocks even if they cannot rule out a third rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we're going to have a U.S. economy that stays
stronger for longer and that we will be in a longer tightening
cycle,'' said Stefan Abrams, chief investment officer, asset
allocation, at Trust Company of the West in New York. ``But people
should not confuse a longer tightening cycle with a draconian body
slam by the Fed. They're not trying to break the back of inflation;
all they're trying to do is keep us on a path to a soft landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's move in the Dow came as many on Wall Street were on
vacation. Some 683 million shares traded hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, a respectable if not torrid day. The Nasdaq
Composite rose 71 points, or 2.69 percent on the day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One reason investors have become more confident about guessing
the Fed's behavior is that the bond market has become a leading
indicator in recent years. In the 1970s and early '80s, the Fed
would move, and bond traders would follow.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. In the spring of 1997, just before the global
economic crisis began and well after bond yields had begun to rise,
the Fed raised rates. By the fall of 1998, bond yields had plunged
when the Fed finally eased to help stem the growing panic in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer to what do you think the Fed is going to do is look
at what the bond market has already done,'' said James Paulsen,
chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis. ``The real interest-rate setter in this country is the
bond market. They speak daily and they speak clearly. If there was
an inflation problem, they have addressed it.''
</P>
<P>
   With inflation fears on the shelf, at least momentarily,
investors' focus will shift to identifying which industry sectors
or stock-market groups will be the top performers going forward.
</P>
<P>
   The move on Monday in the Dow average, which has twice the
percentage gain of the S&AMP;P 500 so far this year, continues a broad
shift in market leadership away from the kind of high-powered
growth stocks that investors have favored for the last five years
and into more mundane manufacturing companies that have been much
less popular. Drug companies, for example, are down over 5 percent
this year, while the chemical sector is up more than 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even as investors celebrated on Monday, market strategists
warned that a weak dollar remained a concern. ``The dollar is the
one thing that keeps me awake at night,'' Abrams said. ``It has
been the linchpin of the stock market for the past five years. If
the weakness is contained, we're OK. If it gets out of hand, it's a
huge negative for interest rates and stock prices.''

MICROSOFT ACTS TO REMOVE CLIP ART IMAGE OFFENSIVE TO BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Students headed back to school will get a nasty surprise when
they search for ``monkey'' on one of Microsoft's key educational
software programs.
</P>
<P>
   A search function of the Clip Art tool in the Teaching and
Learning with Microsoft CD-ROM returns several images of monkeys.
But it also returns an image of a black couple posed on monkey
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls the incident unfortunate and unintended,
explaining that the image of the couple comes up because the
program reads ``monkey bars'' as a match for monkey.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of apology sent this summer to educators, Microsoft
called the juxtaposition ``inappropriate and offensive,'' and said
the company was taking swift action to deal with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The same racially charged match was discovered this spring on
the company's Publisher 1998 software, which is sold separately or
included in Microsoft Office 97 and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the company learned four weeks ago
that its ``Teaching and Learning'' CD contained the offending
clips. The program, which debuted this spring, is distributed to
schools with a $4.95 shipping and handling fee around the nation. A
Microsoft spokeswoman said 75,000 copies were affected.
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego man has already filed a lawsuit againt Microsoft
over the Publisher 1998 software. John Elijah, 32, is seeking
$75,000 in damages, saying he was humiliated after co-workers
showed him the images.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's troubles offer a lesson in the perils of computer
search functions. Microsoft's Clip Art Gallery allows users to
search for images that can be pasted onto newsletters, posters, and
other documents.
</P>
<P>
   The program searches for partial matches as well as complete
matches of search words.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the word ``dog'' returns images of dogs and
hotdogs. The search word ``monkey'' returns seven images of
monkeys, and an image of the black couple posing on ``monkey
bars.'' The software linked the photo of the couple with several
keywords including ``playground,'' ``couples,'' ``recreation,'' and
``monkey bars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to note that the Clip Art Gallery includes
several other photos of this same African-American couple as part
of Microsoft's commitment to diversity in our clip art images,''
the apology letter said. None of these other photos, Microsoft
said, show the monkey-bar equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it discovered the problem through its own
testing, and found no evidence of malicious intent by the vendor
who worked on the Clip Art feature or anyone at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they were concerned,'' said Lisa Wolfe, a
public-relations specialist with Grant-Jacboy in Chicago that
represents Microsoft. ``They wanted to take steps to resolve the
problem as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said only a handful of educators had called Microsoft. She
said all of the calls were in response to the company's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will send a free replacement CD to customers who
request one. The company's Web site offers information on how to
remove the offending clips. In its letter, Microsoft announced it
was instituting a new process for reviewing its Clip Art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal with these images and others was to ensure that the
images in our Clip Art Gallery are multi-cultural, and contribute
to greater ease of use for our customers.''

ANIMAL RIGHTS PROTESTS LEAD SMITHSONIAN TO CANCEL FOIE GRAS
TASTING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yielding to protests from animal rights
organizations and celebrities like Sir John Gielgud and Bea Arthur,
the Smithsonian Institution on Monday canceled a panel discussion
and tasting of foie gras, the fattened liver of a duck or goose,
that had been scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
   The animal rights advocates celebrated. The producer of the foie
gras at issue called himself a victim of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   David Umansky, the spokesman for the Smithsonian, said the 133
people who had bought tickets, at $25 or $30 apiece, would get
refunds. He said the Smithsonian had canvassed them before deciding
on the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received messages of protest,'' Umansky said. ``Some of
them were of a tenor that led to the decision that we should talk
to the ticket holders and get their opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the protests had taken the form of threats,
Umansky declined to answer. But he did say, ``Some were way over
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The foie gras program, one of a long-running series that raises
money for the Smithsonian and provides a setting for authors to
sell their books, was the first ever canceled by the Smithsonian,
Umansky said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision led Michael Ginor, owner of Hudson Valley Foie Gras
in the Catskill community of Ferndale, N.Y., and author of ``Foie
Gras ... A Passion,'' to complain of the protesters: ``What these
people are doing are terrorist acts. They intimidate. They use
means that are close to terrorists but without the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   When it became known that the program would be an occasion for
Ginor to promote his book, which will be published next month by
Wylie, organizations including People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals and the Humane Society of the United States complained that
a scientific organization like the Smithsonian should not allow
itself to be identified with the production of foie gras, which
involves the force-feeding of ducks and geese to make their livers
swell.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arthur said in a letter to the Smithsonian that she was not
a vegetarian but that the treatment of ducks and geese in the
production of foie gras ``would be shocking to any meat eater.''
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud wrote to the Smithsonian that he was ``extremely
distressed'' that it was planning the foie gras event. He
complained that foie gras production involved thrusting long metal
pipes down the birds' throats and forcing ``two to three pounds of
corn mixture into their stomachs'' three times a day for four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his office in Great Neck, N.Y., Ginor (pronounced
ghee-NOR) maintained that much of what Gielgud had said was
incorrect. The pipes that are used, Ginor said, are not metal but
plastic, and are not long; the largest are six inches, he said, and
are held in the bird for one and a half seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not painful, and it is not distressing,'' Ginor said,
offering as proof that ``when a person comes to feed them, they
come to the feeders.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McGraw, the spokesman for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, denied that his organization had ever engaged
in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made no threats whatsoever,'' McGraw said. ``We would
most likely dress up as ducks or geese and hold up signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginor disputed that, saying, ``It's a great shame to succumb to
stuff like this, like succumbing to a terrorist hijacking of a
plane.''

CALIFORNIA COURT BLOCKS EXPANSION OF INDIAN GAMBLING INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Throwing up a major roadblock to California Indian
tribes' efforts to build a gambling empire to rival Las Vegas, the
state Supreme Court on Monday overturned a ballot measure that
would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on Indian lands
here.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, known as Proposition 5, passed last November with
63 percent of the vote after a $100 million spending campaign _ a
national record. The campaign pitted the state's $1.4 billion
tribal gambling industry against Nevada casino operators, who
feared the measure had the potential to clear the way for new
casinos that could draw thousands of customers away from Las Vegas.
The new law had been on hold pending the outcome of the court case.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-1 ruling, the state Supreme Court held that by seeking
to legalize card games like ``21'' and slot-machine-style
videogames, Proposition 5 had improperly skirted the state
constitution's prohibitions against such games. Because Proposition
5 was a statute ``and because in a conflict between statutory and
constitutional law, the constitution must prevail, we conclude
Proposition 5's authorization of casino gambling is invalid and
inoperative,'' the majority wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling raised the prospect that some of the lucrative tribal
casinos that have sprouted around the state in recent years might
soon risk being shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Indian tribes, anticipating Monday's decision and determined to
protect their network of cavernous casinos around the state, have
already begun collecting signatures to place a new measure on the
ballot in the state's presidential primary election in March; the
measure would amend the state constitution to allow casino
gambling. But the casinos' legal status in the meantime is in
doubt, since a federal appeals court ruled last January that if
Proposition 5 was invalidated, some 10 tribes that have been the
subject of a federal case would have just two weeks to cease casino
operations. Monday's ruling does not take effect for at least 30
days, so the tribes and state officials have about six weeks to
reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that the Indians will follow the law,'' said
Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U. S. attorney's office here,
which has been trying to shut down about 10 tribal casinos, most of
them in the Palm Springs area. The U.S. attorney contends that the
tribes have been operating thousands of slot machines and other
games illegally, without a valid compact with the state as required
by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, who remained neutral on the ballot measure last
year, has been trying to negotiate compacts with tribes running
casinos since he took office this year. In a statement Monday
afternoon, he said he was determined to find ``a constitutionally
acceptable means'' of allowing Indian gambling, in light of last
year's popular vote in favor of Proposition 5. He said he would
work with the state Legislature and the tribes to that end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the benefits to the tribes themselves,'' the
governor said, ``I am mindful of the fact that some 16,000
Californians, currently employed by Indian gaming, may lose their
source of employment if we cannot respond to this challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Le Doux, a spokeswoman for a group of California residents
who had sued to overturn Proposition 5, backed by Nevada casinos
and joined by the Hotel Employees &AMP; Restaurant Employees
International Union, said she was ``delighted'' by Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is ratify everything that we have said for so
long, that it's unconstitutional,'' Ms. LeDoux said in a telephone
interview from her home in Shingle Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Milanovich, a spokesman for the gambling tribes and
chairman of the Agua Caliente Indians, who operate a spa and casino
in Palm Springs, said the tribes would press ahead with their
efforts to pass a constitutional amendment, and perhaps appeal some
aspects of Monday's ruling to the U. S. Supreme Court. The
California Supreme Court is the final arbiter of issues relating to
the state constitution, but Indian gambling is also regulated by
federal law, and lawyers said that some aspects of the ruling might
be subject to federal judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a close look at that,'' said Mark Epstein,
a lawyer for the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Indian gambling has been a subject of controversy in California
for most of the decade, as long-impoverished tribes sought new
revenues by moving beyond traditional bingo parlors to operate card
games and video slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   But under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988,
tribes are allowed to offer games like ``21'' or slot machines only
after negotiating compacts with states, and former Gov. Pete Wilson
refused to open negotiations with any tribe that was already
offering such games, which he contended were illegal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The tribes sponsored Proposition 5 last year and spent heavily
to pass it. From the beginning, there were doubts about the
measure's constitutionality, but fewer voter signatures were needed
to qualify a statute for the ballot than to qualify a proposed
constitutional amendment, and the tribes were eager to resolve the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5 essentially required the state to enter into a
compact allowing gambling with any tribe that wanted one. The
tribes have long contended that their slot machines and card games
did not constitute Nevada-style casino gambling as defined by the
1984 state constitutional amendment, because players do not bet
against the house but against a pool of other players, with no
chance for the house to win.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's ruling held for the first time that the tribal
casinos' card games and slot machines do not operate as lotteries,
in which casinos distribute fixed winnings without any interest in
the outcome, but in fact more like a traditional casino bank,
because the amount of money the players' pool pays out depends on
whether individual bets are won or lost.

RELIGIOUS COALITION PLANS GAY RIGHTS STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ An unusual coalition of religious
groups representing Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jews, Mormons and
Muslims is trying to forge a major public voice in support of gay
rights to counter the efforts of religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the groups _ some of them caucuses working within
denominations, others not recognized by officials in their faiths _
gathered Monday morning for the first of two days of strategy
sessions in a downtown hotel, to discuss how and when their
coalition, the National Religious Leadership Roundtable, should
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the battle against us is religiously based,'' said
Robert Miailovich, president of Dignity USA, an organization that
supports gay Catholics. Miailovich, one of about three dozen
participants at the meeting, added that there was ``a great deal of
religious response to the religious attacks; you don't have to be
an atheist to respond to the religious right.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where polls regularly show religious faith to be
widely held, the potential for religious leaders to influence
public opinion on gay rights is great, and it is an important theme
at this meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Montgomery Rutt, national organizer of Equal Partners in
Faith, a liberal religious organization that helped found the round
table, cited the support of liberal religious leaders for the civil
rights movement in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious support for civil rights in any kind of movement
is crucial,'' Ms. Rutt said.
</P>
<P>
   In a session at the meeting that focused on same-sex marriage,
Evan Wolfson, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, said he expected the Hawaii Supreme Court to decide soon
whether homosexuals should be allowed the right to civil marriage
there.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said that religious groups that support gay rights
needed to educate the public and also help ``beat back the
backlash'' of political measures at the state level that bar
same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The round table, which includes representatives from People for
the American Way and a few other secular liberal organizations, was
organized in July 1998 as a project of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force's policy institute and Equal Partners in Faith. The
policy institute's director, Urvashi Vaid, said the organization
reflected a recognition that there was ``this whole pro-gay
religious movement in every denomination, in every faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the period since its formation has not been a happy
one for those who favor a greater role for gay and lesbian
worshippers in organized religion. In August 1998, bishops
representing the communion of Anglican churches worldwide, which
includes the Episcopal Church, passed a resolution strongly
critical of homosexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in March, the Rev. Greg Dell, a United Methodist minister
in Chicago, was suspended after an ecclesiastical court convicted
him of violating his denomination's rules by officiating at a
same-sex union. And in July, the Vatican ordered the Rev. Robert
Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick, a priest and a nun who had long
worked with gay and lesbian Catholics, to end their ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, participants at the meeting, which is being
held at the Antlers Adams Mark Hotel, said they were not
discouraged by those events.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stand up, you run the risk of being fired on,'' said
the Rev. Patti Ackerman, an Episcopal priest in Patterson, N.Y.,
who is also a spokeswoman for Integrity, an organization for gay
and lesbian Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., she
added, ``We have excellent role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman also mentioned the murders of two gay men, Matthew
Shepard in Wyoming last October and Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama
in February. But ``God has given us the courage of strength,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of the discussion Monday morning turned on basic questions
like how far the interfaith group should go in responding to an
event in a particular denomination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, several participants said that while the round
table would have been right to voice general support for the Rev.
Jimmy Creech, a Methodist minister in Omaha, Neb., put on trial in
1998 for officiating at a same-sex union, it should steer clear of
debating internal Methodist politics and rules.
</P>
<P>
   Creech, who was narrowly acquitted in that trial but whose
bishop declined to reappoint him as a pastor, is a guest at the
meeting, one of six speakers at a public event Monday night, a
panel discussion on the theme of sexuality and spirituality.

ARTS PROPOSALS UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mayor Paul Schell rode into office as the arts mayor,
heavily backed by the city's arts groups. In a press conference
Tuesday morning he plans to earn the title, unveiling a series of
proposals to revitalize the city's now creaky commitment to the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   Among his proposals will be a new director for the Seattle Arts
Commission. Present director Wendy Ceccherelli is moving to a newly
created job of chief arts strategist for the Seattle Parks
Department, focusing on the arts uses for the 151-acres of
Sandpoint Park, now being developed as an addition to Magnuson Park
on Sandpoint Way N.E. The new space could house low-cost artist
studios as well as performing arts spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Schell will ask the city council for an additional $250,000 for
arts from the general fund of next year's budget and increase the
One Percent for Art attached to city construction projects to 1.5
Percent for Art.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he said, he's doubling the Percent for Arts Program,
because he's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to
utilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside
but owned by the city. The additional money will go not just to
visual artists' projects but to projects in a range of disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000 will help implement the mayor's small, concrete
proposals to help bring the arts to the city's citizens. He has a
new slogan he'll try out Tuesday: ``Arts Every Day for Everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   These ideas include making Sandpoint available for smaller
performance arts groups for specific dates, renovating the 600-seat
theater on the site.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth floor of Seattle Center's Center House will be
what the major calls a ``black box'' room or theater space also
available to arts groups seeking performance venues. Such groups
will also be able to book dates at the Museum of History and
Industry and the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Bathhouse Theater at Green Lake will reopen for multiple
arts uses, and an study will identity the economic gain provided to
the city by individual artists and small arts groups, similar to
the one the Allen Foundation funded last year through the Corporate
Council for the Arts to study the economic impact of larger arts
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Schell also has big ideas for high tech arts access, hiring a
so-called web-master to link arts groups with the schools and
empower neighborhoods to continue to create their own arts
identities. The Seattle Public Library system will serve as focal
point for information about the city's arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's proposals come in response to the recommendations of
the Seattle Arts Task Force Report delivered to the mayor in June.
The 21 artists, arts administrators and community activists who
made up the the task force were chosen by Schell and City Council
member Nick Licata nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schell's proposals fall short financially of the task
force's recommendations, task force members contacted Monday were
pleased by the mayor's annoucements.
</P>
<P>
   Licata, who was out of town, issued a statement saying he was
heartened by the mayor's proposals and he views them as a crucial
first step.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, saying that without adequate funding, the arts can't
flourish, the task force asked the city to establish a $200 million
public endowment for the arts, raising roughly $15.5 million per
year for 10 years, eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts
Commission. In the meantime, the task force recommended that the
city set side 1 percent of the general fund to support the arts
commission, and that the commission become a city department: the
city's centralized art source.
</P>
<P>
   Schell plans to study and refine the $200 million idea but nixed
the other two suggestions, saying the general fund's support for
the arts is already more than 1 percent, closer to 1.5 percent, but
it's spread over a variety of city agencies instead of centralized
in the arts commission.
</P>
<P>
   He's against centralization, as it turns out, preferring to
continue to distribute arts funding not only through the commission
but through community parks, libraries, community centers and the
Neighborhood Matching Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Centralizing information about the arts is another matter.
Schell wants the libraries to eliminate all red tape and give
citizens specifics about the arts in a clean and direct fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Jodee Fenton, library coordinator for fine and performing arts,
says the library is already providing art access information, but
not enough people know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do the best job on face of the earth, if nobody knows
about it, what difference does it make?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the library provides music listening stations, a
piano for practice, and a large collection of scores and recordings
for public use, as well as an arts information line, 206-386-4612.
Arts information is also available through the library online:
spl.org.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the mayor wants the library to provide exhibition
spaces in neighborhood libraries for neighborhood artists; a music
ensemble/theater arts room to try out new work, with video
equipment available as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Another information source will be a revitalized ``Seattle
Arts'' program on TVSEA, showcasing the Seattle Arts
Commission-funded artists and arts organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the possibility of studios for artists at Sandpoint,
Schell is hosting a live/work forum for artists on Oct. 29. (For
more information, call Amy Painter at the Seattle Arts Commision,
206-684-7306.)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, artist and task force member Barbara Thomas said that
however modest people may think the mayor's prospals are, they are
specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give us a map of what he's thinking,'' she said. ``The
city's commitment to arts was stalled. The mayor is laying out
where he plans to make his mark. Some of his ideas are quite bold,
like the increasing the One Percent for Arts.''

3,000 `CELEBRATE' PERROT'S LIFE AT HOUSTON MEMORIAL SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By W.H. STICKNEY JR. 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Monday was a ``Celebration of Life'' for Kim Perrot,
the diminutive Houston Comets point guard with a warrior's spirit
who died of lung cancer last week .
</P>
<P>
   For the approximately 3,000 people who attended a memorial
service at Second Baptist Church in west Houston, it was a
celebration that featured equal parts smiles and tears.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Young, pastor of the church, described it as graduation day,
``and we think she graduated top of the class, Phi Beta Kappa,
summa cum laude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of gal she was,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, who died Thursday at the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, will be buried Tuesday in her
hometown of Lafayette, La., in private services to be attended by
family, friends, her WNBA teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Her fans and local dignitaries, including Mayor Lee Brown,
gathered Monday for a memorial service that celebrated Perrot's
spirit and accomplishments and ``couldn't have been any more
perfect,'' said her coach, Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   A succession of Perrot's friends and loved ones made their way
up the stairs to the pulpit to offer remembrances of the player
with the warm smile and courageous heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Comet fans who have joined our team in celebrating
back-to-back world championships are now celebrating the life of
one of Houston's brightest stars, and a big, big reason for the
success of the WNBA,'' said Comets and Rockets owner Leslie
Alexander. ``Kim was special. To live her life with all her heart
and to succeed when the odds were against her, Kim used her gifts
to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, Kim would be on any all-heart basketball team. She
never gave up on her dreams or the people in her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's face and the words ``Celebrating the Life'' were
pictured on the sanctuary's giant video screens as family members,
teammates and coaches filed into the church to the strains of the
hymn ``Jesus, I'll Never Forget What You've Done for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   To the right of the base of the pulpit stood a floral spray of
white carnations with a huge red ``10,'' Perrot's jersey number, in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   When it was Chancellor's turn to speak, he fought back tears,
then moved listeners to laughter and tears of their own with his
memories of a player who became a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said he initially thought of Perrot as a ballplayer
who was ``too wild, too small and too everything,'' and it wasn't
until he got a letter from two disgruntled Comets fans that he
decided that the 5-5 Perrot would be his point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ```Point guards like her (Perrot) are hard to find, and we are
writing Les Alexander to say coaches like you are a dime a
dozen,''' Chancellor said, remembering the words of the letter. ``I
called Perrot in, said, `Kimbo, sit down. Read this. You're our
point guard, you've got the job, you're going to play, I don't care
what you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Coach, what I do is not my problem. My problem is
what Cynthia (Cooper), Sheryl (Swoopes) and Tina (Thompson) do.
Every time they do something wrong, you blame me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to develop a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning's most touching moment came when Cooper took over
from Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   She talked of how Perrot had changed and enriched her life,
making her a more complete person, and of how Perrot was ``someone
special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will ever understand what she actually gave me,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she read a poem titled ``He Only Takes the Best'':
</P>
<P>
   ``God saw she was getting tired, and a cure was not to be,''
Cooper read. ``So he put his arms around her, and whispered, `Come
with me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``With tear-filled eyes, we watched her suffer and fade away;
although we loved her deeply, we could not make her stay. A golden
heart stopped beating, hard-working hands put to rest. God broke
our hearts to prove to us he only takes the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot was the heart of the Comets' championship teams in the
first two seasons of the Women's National Basketball Association.
She was diagnosed in January as suffering from lung cancer that had
spread to her brain.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, who will wear white bands on their uniforms in
Perrot's honor, return to the court later this week in search of a
third WNBA championship. They will play either Los Angeles or
Sacramento in the Western Conference finals beginning Thursday.

CONGRESS LOOKING TO EXPAND SANCTIONS AGAINST INTERNATIONAL DRUG
TRAFFICKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colombia, Mexico, Fla., Ga.) (rk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON_ Congress is close to forcing a major expansion of
economic sanctions against international narcotics traffickers and
the businesses that work with them.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to impose such sanctions on drug criminals
throughout the world passed the Senate easily late last month.
After initially opposing the measures on both practical and foreign
policy grounds, administration officials have now begun to work
with legislators to fashion a bill that both the House and the
president could support.
</P>
<P>
   But while such measures have some support among businessmen and
government officials in Colombia _ the only country where the
United States has used them _ they are being strongly opposed by
the government of Mexico and a few of that country's biggest
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican government has repeatedly expressed profound
concern about the negative consequences that may arise from the
implementation of such a proposal,'' Mexico's ambassador to
Washington, Jesus Reyes Heroles, wrote on July 27 in a confidential
letter to the White House drug-policy director, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions would bar drug traffickers and their associates
from doing business in the United States, cut off their access to
American banks and freeze any assets they may have deposited here.
American firms that continue to work with companies linked to the
traffickers would be subject to civil and criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton first levied such penalties in 1995 against
the four main leaders of Colombia's Cali drug cartel. In a
subsequent letter to Congress, he promised, ``I shall continue to
exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions
against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their violent
and corrupting activities as long as these measures are
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Treasury Department, which administers the
sanctions, has built a list of almost 500 relatives, associates and
mostly Colombian companies linked to the traffickers. More than two
dozen of those companies have ended up liquidating their assets,
officials said, while others have had to reorganize or change their
names.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials have hesitated almost from
the start of the program to extend it to drug criminals in other
countries, and particularly to those in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In part, their concerns have been practical: Before acting
against the Cali cartel, U.S. officials had been able to analyze
reams of the group's secret business records that had been seized
in raids by Colombian police teams backed by the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the most powerful Mexican drug mafias are believed
to have hidden their wealth in mazes of front companies, aliases
and associates that the American authorities have not yet been able
to penetrate. One CIA effort to dig into the possible drug
connections of one of Mexico's most prominent business dynasties
ended after an intelligence agent in Mexico was threatened while
trying to search public records, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, perhaps, some senior administration officials
have also worried about the political and economic impact that the
sanctions might have on a country that is the United States'
second-most-important trading partner, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parts of this government that are very nervous about
doing anything like this with Mexico,'' one senior State Department
official said. ``There is no question that it will raise the
tension level some, and there are always some people who think it
may undermine confidence in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   If finally approved, the legislation that passed the Senate on
July 21 and a similar bill pending in the House would essentially
force the administration to do what it has done with Colombia on a
global scale.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, that action has been taken by executive order under the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that has been
used to freeze the assets of and stop Americans from doing business
with the governments of Gen. Manuel Noriega in Panama and the
Islamic revolutionaries who held Americans hostage in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 1, 2000, and by every year thereafter, the legislation
would require the secretary of the Treasury to submit a list of
major international drug traffickers after consulting with the CIA
and the departments of Justice, Defense and State.
</P>
<P>
   That list would then be vetted by the White House drug-policy
director and forwarded to the president. By March 1, the president
would have to produce a final list of traffickers to be sanctioned,
as well as a report to Congress explaining his reasons if he has
decided to leave off any of the accused traffickers suggested by
his aides.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would freeze the assets of the traffickers and
any companies that they may partly own or control and prohibit
American businesses from working with them. It would also cover the
American assets of any person or company that aids a trafficker's
illicit activities.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the annual publication of such lists
would probably only be the start of an elaborate process of
investigation, congressional and administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control now
has only about six or eight officials assigned full time to
implementing the sanctions. Even if new funds are appropriated to
pay for the collection of intelligence on the traffickers' business
assets and associates, it could take years to develop evidence
strong enough to withstand a challenge in court.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been very few such challenges from Colombia.
Two of the teenaged daughters of the Cali cartel chiefs, both of
them American citizens, fought successfully to be struck from the
list of the traffickers' known associates. About 10 others have
been removed from the list after severing their ties to the cartel
or establishing their innocence, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Colombian official who discussed the sanctions on the
condition he not be identified said that although the government of
President Andres Pastrana supported the American sanctions, it was
eager to be more involved in drawing up lists of the traffickers'
associates so as to ensure that innocent businesses were not hurt
by being linked to drug trafficking. Mexican officials and
businessmen said they were fighting the legislation in part on
similar grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a legitimate company and you're targeted, you should
have a way to defend yourself before you get on the list,'' said
Luis Calvillo, a spokesman for one of Mexico's biggest
international transportation companies, Transportacion Maritima
Mexicana, or TMM.
</P>
<P>
   Both TMM and the Mexican Embassy in Washington have been
campaigning strongly for detailed amendments to the legislation,
with lobbyists for TMM working to organize a coalition of
like-minded American businesses. The Mexican firm, one of Latin
America's largest shipping companies, has complained that it has
been unfairly linked to drug trafficking by U.S. intelligence
documents in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, two Republican sponsors of the sanctions
legislation, Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia and Rep. Porter Goss of
Florida, said they would readily consider changes to strengthen the
safeguards for law-abiding companies. But they added that they were
confident that the legislation now has enough bipartisan support to
win approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have suggested for a long time that this be used,'' said
Goss, who, like Coverdell, will likely be among the legislators who
reconcile the Senate and House bills. ``The administration would go
a little way but they didn't want to go too far. We got tired of
waiting for them.''

3,000 `CELEBRATE' PERROT'S LIFE AT HOUSTON MEMORIAL SERVICE

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Monday was a ``Celebration of Life'' for Kim Perrot,
the diminutive Houston Comets point guard with a warrior's spirit
who died of lung cancer last week .
</P>
<P>
   For the approximately 3,000 people who attended a memorial
service at Second Baptist Church in west Houston, it was a
celebration that featured equal parts smiles and tears.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Young, pastor of the church, described it as graduation day,
``and we think she graduated top of the class, Phi Beta Kappa,
summa cum laude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of gal she was,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, who died Thursday at the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, will be buried Tuesday in her
hometown of Lafayette, La., in private services to be attended by
family, friends, her WNBA teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Her fans and local dignitaries, including Mayor Lee Brown,
gathered Monday for a memorial service that celebrated Perrot's
spirit and accomplishments and ``couldn't have been any more
perfect,'' said her coach, Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   A succession of Perrot's friends and loved ones made their way
up the stairs to the pulpit to offer remembrances of the player
with the warm smile and courageous heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Comet fans who have joined our team in celebrating
back-to-back world championships are now celebrating the life of
one of Houston's brightest stars, and a big, big reason for the
success of the WNBA,'' said Comets and Rockets owner Leslie
Alexander. ``Kim was special. To live her life with all her heart
and to succeed when the odds were against her, Kim used her gifts
to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, Kim would be on any all-heart basketball team. She
never gave up on her dreams or the people in her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's face and the words ``Celebrating the Life'' were
pictured on the sanctuary's giant video screens as family members,
teammates and coaches filed into the church to the strains of the
hymn ``Jesus, I'll Never Forget What You've Done for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   To the right of the base of the pulpit stood a floral spray of
white carnations with a huge red ``10,'' Perrot's jersey number, in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   When it was Chancellor's turn to speak, he fought back tears,
then moved listeners to laughter and tears of their own with his
memories of a player who became a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said he initially thought of Perrot as a ballplayer
who was ``too wild, too small and too everything,'' and it wasn't
until he got a letter from two disgruntled Comets fans that he
decided that the 5-5 Perrot would be his point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ```Point guards like her (Perrot) are hard to find, and we are
writing Les Alexander to say coaches like you are a dime a
dozen,''' Chancellor said, remembering the words of the letter. ``I
called Perrot in, said, `Kimbo, sit down. Read this. You're our
point guard, you've got the job, you're going to play, I don't care
what you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Coach, what I do is not my problem. My problem is
what Cynthia (Cooper), Sheryl (Swoopes) and Tina (Thompson) do.
Every time they do something wrong, you blame me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to develop a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning's most touching moment came when Cooper took over
from Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   She talked of how Perrot had changed and enriched her life,
making her a more complete person, and of how Perrot was ``someone
special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will ever understand what she actually gave me,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she read a poem titled ``He Only Takes the Best'':
</P>
<P>
   ``God saw she was getting tired, and a cure was not to be,''
Cooper read. ``So he put his arms around her, and whispered, `Come
with me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``With tear-filled eyes, we watched her suffer and fade away;
although we loved her deeply, we could not make her stay. A golden
heart stopped beating, hard-working hands put to rest. God broke
our hearts to prove to us he only takes the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot was the heart of the Comets' championship teams in the
first two seasons of the Women's National Basketball Association.
She was diagnosed in January as suffering from lung cancer that had
spread to her brain.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, who will wear white bands on their uniforms in
Perrot's honor, return to the court later this week in search of a
third WNBA championship. They will play either Los Angeles or
Sacramento in the Western Conference finals beginning Thursday.

TREES HARDEST HIT BY HURRICANE BRET IN RURAL TEXAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARITA, Texas _ If there is such a thing as a perfect spot for a
hurricane to come ashore, Kenedy County might be it. The flat,
green pastures are filled with wild oaks and mesquite instead of
shopping centers and subdivisions. There is not a store, restaurant
or gas station in this county called home by only 460 people.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are one of those 460, perfect is not the right word
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all make jokes about it,'' J.A. Garcia, a county judge,
said inside the darkened county courthouse as a thunderstorm
crackled overhead Monday afternoon. ``There are people who are
living here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Hurricane Bret slowly pushed ashore onto the
South Texas coastline, people awoke to find most buildings still
standing and lives spared; not a single fatality or serious injury
was reported. Initially compared in its potential for destruction
to Hurricane Andrew, this storm picked a path as if it were trying
to avoid people, grinding steadily through the vast ranch lands
halfway between Brownsville and Corpus Christi as it was downgraded
to a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials were still cautioning Monday that flooding
was possible as the storm moved inland and stalled near Laredo,
dumping heavy amounts of rain. Federal officials closed the three
bridges over the Rio Grande as a precautionary measure, blocking
traffic on both sides of the border. Sporadic flooding was reported
in some Laredo neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm moving well inland from the South Texas coast,
city officials in Corpus Christi began allowing evacuated residents
to return home late Monday. About 30 miles to the south, more than
16,000 people remained without power, many of them in Kingsville,
as utility workers struggled to restore electricity. Yet for a
region that has not endured a major hurricane in more than 20
years, the fears that prompted thousands of people to evacuate the
coast were replaced by relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky, man,'' said Sam Delarosa, the kitchen manager
of Snoopy's Cafi, located on Padre Island, the barrier island
stretching down the coast. ``Very, very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials had warned that a tidal surge of 12 feet could cause
flooding inland as well as tremendous damage to the low-lying
barrier islands. But the tidal surge apparently never happened.
From Port Aransas as far south as Malaquite Beach on the Padre
Island National Seashore, the damage was light. ``That tide hasn't
gone up more than a foot or two, and the wind must have just blown
all that water back out into the Gulf,'' Delarosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind his desk inside the Kenedy County Courthouse,
Sheriff Rafael M. Cuellar Jr. offered his own theory of why the
storm weakened as it came inland: trees. With nearly 1 million
acres of pasture land, much of it divided between the Kenedy Ranch
and the King Ranch, the two largest ranches in Texas, Kenedy County
is covered in oaks and mesquite and cactus. The terrain is so
desolate, and so stultifying in the summer, that illegal immigrants
walking through the pastures north toward Houston often succumb to
the elements in Kenedy County. Last month, Cuellar said the bodies
of four illegal immigrants were found in the brush dead from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The isolation infuses every aspect of life in Kenedy County.
With the closest convenience store a 5-mile drive from Sarita, the
county seat, the sheriff said people become accustomed to living
apart from the modern world. ``Anybody who wants a Coke has to come
up here and get it from the courthouse,'' the sheriff said, noting
toward the drink machine.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But when people learned of the approaching storm, many of them
sought shelter. Most of Sarita's 200 residents gathered in the
local Catholic church or schoolhouse. In the early hours Monday
morning, the storm's worst winds tore through Sarita and
Falfurrias, about 25 miles to the west, uprooting trees and downing
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad,'' said Cuellar, who keeps a package of chewing
tobacco and three bottles of hot pepper sauce on his desk. He said
everyone in the shelters got along. ``They all knew each other,''
he said. ``More than half of them are related. You don't have
problems like in big cities where they don't want to be close to
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Genho, vice president for livestock for the King Ranch,
said the 825,000-acre ranch lost about 25,000 acres of cotton and
suffered extensive damage to trees and various buildings and
windmills. He said the Norias division in the Ranch, which is
Kenedy County, absorbed the full brunt of the southern eye of the
storm. ``We were extremely blessed,'' Genho said. ``I have been in
a lot of hurricanes having lived in Florida most of my life. When
you get a Class 4 hurricane, that's scary anywhere. There's a lot
of potential for damage.''
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse in the afternoon, sheriff's deputies returned
after canvassing the county for damages. They had seen many downed
trees, but everyone agreed it could have been far worse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All of that was good news for Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need most is to go to sleep because I haven't slept in
two nights,'' he said.

PRESIDENT HITS THE GOLF COURSE, AND THE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Under a cloudless azure sky, President
Clinton took to the golf course Monday, attended a fund-raiser for
a local hospital on Monday night and dined again with friends. But
the real news from his vacation compound was the release of the
list of books that the president is delving into.
</P>
<P>
   A voracious and eclectic reader, Clinton has made the release of
his summer reading list something of an annual rite. It provides a
glimpse into what the first reader is thinking about, and it is one
of the few nuggets of news that reporters covering him can count
on, since most of his vacation activities are screened from public
view.
</P>
<P>
   The president has no fewer than 12 titles on this year's list
for his 10 days on Martha's Vineyard. They include a book on the
right-wing media, an exploration of risk, and a novel about two
bright young couples who form a lifelong friendship.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many of the books the president will read
from cover to cover, but the presidential endorsement is becoming a
coveted status symbol among authors, who can see their book sales
soar, particularly among those who might encounter the president
during vacation and want to share his interests.
</P>
<P>
   Giving out the list was the main point of Monday's 21-minute
briefing held here by Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Other topics included a question on whether Clinton's fund
raising for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and her expected
Senate campaign, might interfere with his fund-raising obligations
to Vice President Gore, who is seeking to succeed him. Some in
Gore's camp have expressed concern that Clinton's time and energy
will be funneled into Mrs. Clinton's campaign, leaving less for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he sees these things as mutually exclusive, and
he looks forward to helping all Democrats,'' Lockhart said. But he
also said that after Labor Day, the president's fund raising for
Mrs. Clinton would probably subside.
</P>
<P>
   As Lockhart spoke, Clinton was out on the links at the Farm Neck
Golf Club. He took a mulligan on his first shot, which veered off
course. ``Oh, I killed it,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   He was playing with Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., whose pending
retirement has fueled concern in the party that he could be
replaced by a Republican, Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey. This
could seriously weaken the Democratic ranks in the Senate. But
Lockhart said Monday that he thought any pleas to Lautenberg to
reconsider had ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, was at home. Clinton said Monday night
at the hospital fund-raiser, which was held conveniently at the
golf course, that his wife was ``a little under the weather,'' but
he did not elaborate. ``I want her to get well because she has a
rigorous schedule ahead of her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Between his golf and his many social soirees _ he has dined out
every night since he arrived and has attended two fund-raisers for
his wife _ Clinton appears to be devoting much of his time to
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the usual briefing books and assorted mysteries are three
eye-catching titles. Perhaps the most controversial is ``Waves of
Rancor: Tuning in the Radical Right,'' by Robert Hillard and
Michael Keith (M.E. Sharpe, 1999). The book has a giant swastika on
the cover. Studs Terkel, reviewing the book, said it revealed the
``hate-mongering'' of the extreme right wing, which has disguised
itself in the form of talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Another on the list is ``Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story
of Risk,'' by Peter L. Bernstein (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1998). A
synopsis by the publisher says the author ``explains the origin of
risk management _ the basics of probability, sampling, regression
to the mean, game theory, and rational versus irrational
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list is a 1991 novel by Wallace Stegner called
``Crossing to Safety,'' about two couples who meet during the
Depression and remain friends for life. A synopsis on Amazon.com
calls it ``the poignant story of two couples who form a lifelong
friendship, and the loyalties, celebrations, tragedies, and
conflicts that afflict them as individuals and as families.''
</P>
<P>
   The other books on Clinton's list are ``A Clearing in the
Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the Nineteenth
Century,'' by Witold Rybczynski (1999); ``Cold Hit,'' a thriller by
Linda A. Fairstein (1999); ``Dark Lady,'' a suspense novel by
Richard North Patterson (1999); ``The Diving Bell and the
Butterfly: A Memoir of Life and Death,'' by Jean-Dominique Bauby
(1998); ``Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies,'' by
Jared Diamond (1999); ``Just Revenge,'' by Alan Dershowitz (1999);
``The Last Patrician: Bobby Kennedy and the End of American
Aristocracy,'' by Michael Knox Beran (1998); ``Memoirs of
Hadrian,'' by Marguerite Yourcenar (1951); and ``Prayers for
Rain,'' by Dennis Lehane (1999).

PROSECUTOR TELLS LOCKERBIE RELATIVES HE'LL KEEP TRIAL NONPOLITICAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Scotland, the Netherlands, Md., N.J., Va.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About 200 relatives of people killed in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland nearly 11 years ago were assured
Monday by Scottish officials that the two suspects would be
prosecuted vigorously and without regard to political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The assurances, by Scotland's senior law officer, Lord Hardie,
came at a meeting arranged by the Justice Department to brief the
relatives on the case. The two suspects, both Libyan intelligence
officers, are to go on trial in February in the Netherlands. The
bombing, on Dec. 21, 1988, killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've assured the family members that there have been no
deals,'' Lord Hardie said. But several relatives of victims were
skeptical. ``I'll be convinced of that when I see it in court,''
said Rosemary Wolfe of Alexandria, Va., whose stepdaughter, Miriam
Wolfe, died on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying that the prosecutors are totally independent,''
said Kathleen Flynn of Montville, N.J. She and her husband, John,
lost a son when the Boeing 747 blew up over Scotland, killing the
259 people on board and 11 others in Lockerbie village.
</P>
<P>
   No relatives questioned the seriousness or integrity of Lord
Hardie or the prosecutors. But some said their feelings had been
hardened by more than a decade of grief, followed by what they see
as official foot-dragging. They also suspect that there is a desire
by some countries to let the atrocity fade into the past so
business as usual can resume with Libya, which is rich in oil.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, are to be tried under Scottish law at Camp Zeist, 30 miles
southeast of Amsterdam. The pair were accused in an indictment
returned in U.S. Federal Court in November 1991. The dead included
189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators concluded that the two men had arranged to have a
bomb, concealed in a portable cassette player, put aboard a plane
in Malta and eventually transferred to the 747 in London just
before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States agreed to a trial in the
Netherlands, under Scottish law, in part to get the Libyan leader,
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, to turn over the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has continued to impose sanctions on Libya and
regards it as an outlaw country. The United Nations recently
suspended its sanctions and is weighing whether to lift them
permanently. And Britain announced recently that it was resuming
normal relations with Libya now that the two suspects are to face
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Bernstein of Bethesda, Md., whose husband, Michael,
died on Flight 103, said she was ``somewhat reassured'' by Lord
Hardie. But Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose
daughter, Theodora, was killed, said Monday's session ``has done
nothing to sweep away my concerns.'' She said she still wonders
what prosecutors will do if the evidence points much higher than
the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gadhafi is thriving at the end of this, I don't consider it
justice,'' she said.

ECUADOR PLANS TO RENEGOTIATE ITS FOREIGN DEBT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Russia)   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Grappling with the worst national
economic crisis in 70 years, Ecuador plans to renegotiate its
foreign debt when a payment falls due next week but does not intend
to default, the Latin American country said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief news release issued in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital,
Minister of Finance Ana Lucia Armijo said the government of
President Jamil Mahuad ``will propose a coordinated restructuring,
using market mechanisms'' of the $6 billion in so-called Brady
bonds the country owes. But she added that the government ``will
not in any way declare a unilateral moratorium regarding the
payment of external debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount due at the end of this month is only $94 million, but
fears of an Ecuadorean default have contributed to market
instability throughout Latin America in the past week, even in much
larger and more diversified economies such as Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   No country has ever defaulted on Brady bonds, not even Russia at
the height of its financial crisis last year. There is fear that a
suspension of payment by Ecuador would deeply hurt the psychology
of the market and lead to a withdrawal of foreign investment from
Latin American countries. Such a withdrawal could create a new
round of market instability and raise the cost of borrowing for all
so-called emerging markets, damaging them further.
</P>
<P>
   Brady bonds, named for Nicholas Brady, who was secretary of the
Treasury in the Bush administration, were created in response to
the debt crisis that Mexico and other Latin American countries
faced in the late 1980s. They allowed 18 developing countries to
package defaulted loans into new bonds that are backed by U.S.
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The jitters about Ecuador's ability to pay its debts have been
building for weeks but they grew acute on Thursday, when Ecuadorean
officials suggested they might be forced to seek a ``deferral'' of
the payment due Aug. 31. Under the terms of a Brady bond deal
negotiated in 1994, Ecuador has a 30-day grace period before it
would formally be declared in default.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that under current circumstances it is not easy to
pay our external debt, as we also have an internal debt,'' Modesto
Correa, acting president of Ecuador's central bank, said Friday.
``It's up to the finance minister to see whether we pay, not pay or
defer our debt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address to the nation and in other
statements made over the weekend, Mahuad also sent mixed signals.
While he emphasized that ``Ecuador is not considering avoiding its
commitments,'' he also said that he was ``working so that Ecuador
can pay what debt it can, as much as its economy can permit,''
through ``market mechanisms that permit paying less for the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   A delegation from the International Monetary Fund flew to Quito
last this weekend to meet with Mahaud and other officials.
Negotiations have been under way for a $400 million loan to help
cover the country's credit needs over the next 18 months, but have
been slowed by the unwillingness of Ecuadorean congress, which is
dominated by the opposition, to take action on matters such as tax
reform, banking and government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, bond, stock and currency markets in Latin
America and New York all rose following Ms. Armijo's statement.
While Ecuador's own currency fell, the Brazilian currency, the
real, recovered to 1.88 per dollar, compared to a low of 1.99 on
Friday, and the Mexican and Argentine stock markets each rose by
more than 2 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors can see there are clear and distinct difference
between countries,'' Argentina's deputy finance minister, Miguel
Kiguel, said in Buenos Aires. He acknowledged the Ecuadorean crisis
``will have a short-term effect'' on other countries, but argued
that the country's small size and unusual circumstances should
prevent the kind of panicky market selloff that might come if a
larger country were to default.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's total public debt is about $13 billion, or more than
100 percent of the annual gross domestic product of the small
Andean nation of 12 million people. Interest payments due in 1999
are estimated at $280 million, or 42 percent of the government
budget. Foreign reserves were just under $1.3 billion as of Friday,
down 30 percent from a year ago, but cannot be used to pay foreign
debts because of a provision in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's crisis is partly rooted in longstanding problems that
are beyond its control, notably the damage caused by El Nino last
year and low prices for its main exports. The Ecuadorean economy is
expected to contract by 7 percent this year, and inflation is
expected to reach 55 percent or more, the highest in Latin America.

BRET CAUSES LITTLE DAMAGE AS STORM BREEZES INTO TEXAS

<P>
   Hurricane Bret proved more bluster than bite Monday as the
largest hurricane to hit Texas in 20 years weakened into a tropical
storm that so far has caused no reported deaths, major injuries or
extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its early designation Sunday as a ``major disaster''
area, the seven-county region sustained relatively minor damage,
with costs expected mostly from clearing debris and organizing
widespread evacuations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, emergency preparedness officials had agreed
to reduce the number of Texas National Guardsmen on alert from
1,600 to 450.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, local officials took the unusual step of declaring a
state of emergency in anticipation of imminent danger, requiring
businesses to shut their doors by 6 p.m. CDT and closing roads and
three international bridges, said Jack Colley, assistant director
of the emergency management division of the Texas Department of
Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do the reasonable and smart thing and that's
prepare for it,'' said Colley, noting that heavy rains remained
likely for the town on the banks of the Rio Grande. ``It's the
right thing to do. Laredo's flood-prone because it's very, very
flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears of devastating flooding in South Texas, however, had
already begun to subside as the eye of the storm headed northwest
between Laredo and Eagle Pass en route to Mexico, according to the
National Weather Service regional office in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday or Thursday, the service predicted, the system
could wind its way into the Big Bend area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that prevented the storm from causing
significant damage was it moved onshore over the least populated
county along the coast, Kenedy County, '' said meteorologist
Constantine Pashos.
</P>
<P>
   Had Sunday's storm struck just 40 miles north in Corpus Christi
or at the Brownsville-Harlingen area 50 to 60 miles south,
consequences could have been considerably more severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a little bit of heavy rain and gusty winds, but as
of now, no serious flooding,'' Pashos said of the storm's progress
as it pushed northwestward Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get some showers and bands of rain and thunderstorms
tonight and tomorrow,'' Pashos said of the Laredo area. ``Nothing
out of the ordinary in respect to tropical systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, against predictions of destruction Sunday when the
powerful hurricane appeared heading for Corpus Christi, President
Clinton declared the seven-county South Texas area a ``major
disaster'' after Texas Gov. George W. Bush appealed for federal
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very fortunate in Texas that Hurricane Bret did not
directly hit a major population area, and that so far, no deaths or
serious injuries have been reported,'' Bush said. ``The damage
could have been much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the storm still posed a threat as night fell, however,
Bush warned ``all Texans in the affected areas to take the threat
of flooding seriously, to continue to pay close attention to this
storm, and to follow the advice and directions of local
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Health Commissioner William ``Reyn'' Archer III warned
that an outbreak of mosquito-carry dengue fever, causing severe
flulike symptoms that has struck 16 in South Texas so far, posed a
major health threat. He urged cleanup crews to watch for containers
with standing water, perfect breeding grounds for the
disease-carrying insects.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi emerged virtually unscathed, but before leaving
the Coastal Bend, as if in a last gasp, Hurricane Bret backhanded
the city with a band of heavy rain and gusting winds early Monday
morning, snapping branches, uprooting trees and flooding city
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of low-lying neighborhoods who chose to wait out the
storm may have gone to sleep believing the worst had passed, but
awoke to find streets flooded with several inches of water.
</P>
<P>
   But in all, the floodwaters were little more than an
inconvenience. By 9 a.m., evacuees, primarily those with beachfront
homes on north Padre Island, were urged to return home. By noon
Monday, the city had closed its emergency operations center and
little remained to remind residents that a Category 4 hurricane,
packing 140 mph winds, had threatened their homes and community 24
hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated damages at only $100,000, and the storm
caused no major structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate that the eye passed 50 miles south of here,
but it was also fortunate that we trained and prepared as much as
we do,'' said Corpus Christi City Manager David Garcia. ``It's easy
to be lucky when you're prepared and trained.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people, including most of the
island's 15,000 residents, evacuated the city Saturday and early
Sunday, clogging Interstate 37 as they headed for high ground
elsewhere. An estimated 7,000 residents went to Red Cross shelters
in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Rebekah Smith, 18, and her family, opted to stay in
Corpus Christi. On Monday, Smith and her cousins were sweeping and
bagging leaves off the sidewalk and street in front of their
grandmother's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kinda worried, but it took a turn and there was nothing
to worry about any more,'' Smith said, adding that she was thankful
she was sweeping leaves rather than splintered pieces of her
grandmother's home.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, most floodwaters had receded and sporadic
power outages had been restored. Central, Power and Light, which
provides the city electrical power, received 3,900 calls by 8 p.m.
Sunday from customers who had lost power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of power lines down, we had power interrupted to
our waste water treatment plant, we had some emergency back up
generators damaged, but we were able to repair all that and as of
noon today everything is up and operating,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Nueces County, where Corpus Christi is located, is one of the
counties Bush asked to be declared a disaster area for federal
relief. Though the city incurred little damage, Garcia said he
hopes some relief is offered to offset the cost of responding to
the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major emergency, we mobilized a lot of resources to
deal with it, and the storm was clearly a threat and a hazard to
the community and the public safety,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On gulf shores, it was hard to find any sign a major storm had
passed near by.
</P>
<P>
   The string of hotels along North Padre Island were untouched,
with the exception of a few overturned trash cans and patio
furniture blown across parking lots. There was no visible beach
erosion along the North Padre sea wall, with wooden steps leading
down to the beach still firmly in place and even metal trash cans
still standing on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate,'' said Jim Urban, a 43-year-old civil
engineer and developer who arrived early Monday to begin removing
boards from his harbor-front home in Port Aransas. ``I drove around
town and I saw a few signs down. We're real lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother-in-law stayed here all last night and the tides
never got as high as the winter tides that cover our pier,'' Urban
said.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly hauled a ``Jolly Rogers'' pirate flag up the mast of
his ``Cajun Queen,'' a 38-foot Louisiana oyster boat converted into
a party skiff that floated unscathed behind his home. In the
adjacent slip, Urban's 34-foot offshore power boat sat securely on
hoists, untouched as was virtually every other boat in Port
Aransas' large harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my biggest concern, the storm surge bringing the boat
up on the docks and through the house,'' Urban said, gesturing to
his three-story home behind the pier. ``They kept saying a 15-foot
storm surge and we got a 15-inch tide, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban weathered the storm in Corpus Christi, a decision he made
due to his previous hurricane experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in school in Corpus Christi during hurricane Celia and
stayed there and watched the house crumble around us, and I vowed
never to stay again.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of streets, intersections and yards were flooded in
Port Aransas early Monday, but City Manager Tom Brooks said there
was no damage to the town of 3,000 full-time residents. Police were
stationed at the entrance to the town, allowing only residents to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a single report of anything, and positively no
flooding of businesses or residences. The only damage I'm aware of
is the roof over the cafeteria portion of the high school collapsed
at 2:30 yesterday (Sunday),'' due to heavy rains, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say overall we came out better than expected.''

BODIES POSE NO DANGER OF DISEASE, DOCTORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thousands of unburied corpses in Turkey's earthquake zone
may be traumatic for the survivors but they do not pose any danger
of an epidemic of infectious diseases, public health experts said
Monday. Nor is there any evidence of increased disease in the past
week, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead bodies do not create diseases among survivors,'' Dr.
Michel Thieren, a medical officer in the World Health
Organization's department of emergency and humanitarian action,
said in a telephone interview. ``Natural disasters do not import
diseases that are not already present in the affected area.''
</P>
<P>
   WHO, a unit of the United Nations, is speaking out to correct
misinformation about the health hazards of disasters ``because
myths are about to create panic in the field and divert the
resources and the assistance to those who really need them,''
Thieren said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said, ``Perhaps the
greatest problem now facing us is that of epidemics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thieren's comments disputing this were echoed by other
health officials, who said Turkey's greatest public health needs
were to monitor the incidence of infectious diseases and restore
basic water and sanitation services.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen M. Ostroff, the acting deputy director of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency in
Atlanta, said, ``There are a lot of good reasons for not leaving
bodies sitting there, but the highest priority is try to keep the
living as healthy as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Serge Manoncourt, a medical adviser to Doctors Without
Borders, said that the threat of epidemics ``was in people's
imagination'' and that epidemics ``almost never occurred unless
there was massive water and food contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Haroutune Armenian, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health who has dealt with disasters in Lebanon,
said, ``There is no evidence that bodies in an environment like
this would cause any disease on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts said they knew of no published articles documenting
the hazards of dead bodies. ``It is information that is passed from
one generation to another, just as the misconceptions about health
hazards from disasters are passed from disaster to disaster,''
Armenian said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Noji, an expert for the United Nations who has been
reporting to WHO from Turkey for the last four days, told the
agency that sporadic cases of illness are occurring now as they did
before the earthquake, Thieren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not correlate occurrence of sporadic cases to the
natural disaster which has occurred,'' Thieren said. ``But it seems
that if you have a case of dysentery now, it will be immediately
reported as being an epidemic, which is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey also needs to resume standard immunization programs for
children, but vaccine programs against diseases like cholera are
not necessary because no cholera has been reported in Turkey in the
past two years, Thieren said.
</P>
<P>
   If there had been many cases of cholera in the quake area, or
many bodies floating in water, then a potential epidemic of cholera
would be a concern. ``Those are exceptional situations that are
definitely not present in the earthquake in Turkey,'' Thieren said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you overimmunize, people develop a false sense of
security and believe they are totally protected when they are not.
To organize a massive immunization campaign against cholera and
things like that would be public health malpractice.''

COMPANY TO PRODUCE FILM FOR INTERNET RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a sign of growing interest in the Internet as a
way of distributing movies, the company that produced ``What Dreams
May Come'' has agreed to produce a film that will be initially
released through the Web, executives said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While many films are available on the Internet, backers of this
project said it represented one of the first times that a movie by
an established filmmaker was being made specifically for initial
Internet distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is being made by Metafilmics, a four-year-old company
that specializes in entertainment with spiritual themes. Its first
theatrical movie, last year's ``What Dreams May Come,'' starred
Robin Williams and won an Academy Award for best visual effects.
The Internet movie, called ``The Quantum Project,'' will be about a
physicist who has a mystical experience and will be directed by
Francis Glebas, the director of ``Fantasia 2000,'' a forthcoming
movie from Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Barnet Bain, a co-founder of Metafilmics, said the company was
interested in the new artistic possibilities presented by the
Internet and by the chance to be its own distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the most glorious opportunity to have an extremely
new canvas and be among the first to do it,'' Bain said. But he
conceded that the company was hedging its bets: The $3 million
budget is tiny by Hollywood standards. ``It's important that we
stretch ourselves but not sink the ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be distributed by Sightsound.com, a Web site that
will charge a fee to people who want to download the movie,
probably a few dollars for someone who wants access to the movie
for, say, one to five days. An actual purchase would be more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quantum Project'' is scheduled to be available next May
and will rely heavily on computer-generated animation, even though
it will be a live-action film. It will be more than 40 minutes long
but perhaps not as long as a full-length feature to minimize
downloading time, Bain said. He said the company hoped it Could
still show the movie in theaters even after its debut on the Web,
perhaps by adding more visual effects for the theater version. The
movie would also be available for television and home video.
</P>
<P>
   Sightsound.com is one of several start-ups trying to offer
movies over the Internet and generating interest in the movie
business.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Atomfilms, which specializes in short films,
has attracted investments from Warner Brothers, Allen &AMP; Co., the
media industry investment banking company, and Frank Biondi, the
former chief executive of Universal Studios. Atomfilms, based in
Seattle, announced agreements Monday to distribute some of its
films through Warner Brothers Online, NBC's Snap.com and Real
Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, full-length movies take hours, even more than a day,
to download using a conventional modem. The picture can be jerky
and is confined to a small box on the screen. This is hardly a
match for a movie theater or even a videocassette seen on a
television.
</P>
<P>
   But as high-speed Internet connections grow more common, those
barriers are expected to fall. Hollywood studios are watching
warily, anxious to make sure they do not lose control of
distribution, as record companies have to some extent. Indeed,
pirated films like the recent ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace'' are now available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, most of the movies legally available online
tend to be older movies, or B movies, or those made by small
filmmakers who lack other means of distribution. The mainstream
Hollywood studios have used the Internet to publicize films, not to
distribute them. The value of the Internet for publicity was made
clear with the runaway success of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a
small-budget picture that has become a smash hit because of
excitement built up through a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the new agreement seems to indicate growing interest in the
Internet by filmmakers who can get their fare into theaters. ``It's
easy to get B, campy horror movies for Internet distribution,''
said Scott Sander, president of Sightsound.com, which is based in
Mt. Lebanon, Pa. ``It's nice to get something that's uplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   SightSound.com earlier this year offered on its site the movie
``Pi,'' which had been in theaters. But Scott Sander, the president
of the company, said it had been difficult so far to attract
mainstream movies. Its Web site now offers ten films with titles
like ``DOA,'' ``Troma Toxic Container'' and ``Reefer Madness.''

CHINA URGED TO FREE AMERICAN HURT FLEEING POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is pressing China for
the immediate release of an American who was reported to have
suffered serious spinal injuries after he jumped or fell from a
third-floor window in a confrontation with the Chinese police.
</P>
<P>
   China has said that the 29-year-old American, Daja Mizu Meston,
a Tibetan linguist from Newton, Mass., was injured while trying to
escape police officers in a region of western China where the
government is carrying out a population resettlement project
opposed by human rights groups and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Monday that it had no evidence to
contradict the Chinese account that Meston, who is now in a
hospital under police guard, jumped or fell in his escape attempt
on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But a department spokesman, James Foley, said, ``We're not
drawing any definitive conclusions about the circumstances of his
injury until we've had an opportunity really to explore the matter
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that as soon as his medical condition permits, the
Chinese authorities conclude their actions against him and indeed
release him and allow him to leave the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that although Meston was apparently not paralyzed, he
had suffered ``serious back injuries'' and was in urgent need of
specialized spinal treatment outside China.
</P>
<P>
   China has said that the police were seeking to question Meston
and an Australian colleague about their activities in a remote area
of Qinghai province, which is geographically part of the Tibetan
Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is considering a proposal to offer $40 million in
loans to what the Chinese government describes as an anti-poverty
project in the province. The project involves the construction of a
dam and irrigation works, and calls for the relocation of 58,000
impoverished farmers from eastern Qinghai, mostly Han Chinese and
Hui Muslims, to an area farther west in the province populated
largely by ethnic Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists and environmental groups have charged
that the project is an effort by Beijing to dilute the Tibetan
population in the region and undermine Tibetan culture, and the
World Bank has held off on final approval of the loans in the face
of criticism from the United States and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian, Gabriel Lafitte, was allowed to leave China last
weekend after the intervention of the Australian government. In
interviews since returning home to Australia, he has expressed fear
for the lives of Meston and a local translator who worked with
them.

 &HT;    Pennant race a novelty among Braves players
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chipper Jones has been a world champion but has never
been part of a real pennant race. Andruw Jones has never known a
big-league season that didn't carry past the 162nd game. Ryan
Klesko was a September call-up when last September mattered around
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear people say that we've never been in a pennant race,''
Tom Glavine said, and those people are correct. Most of these
Braves haven't, at least not as Braves. Not since 1993 has this
franchise played a truly significant regular-season game after
school re-opens. Not since 1993 have the cold fingers of pressure
been felt before October.
</P>
<P>
   A strike halted the 1994 season on Aug. 12. Over the next four
seasons the Braves were as dominant as a latter-day baseball team
can be. From 1995 through 1998, their average lead on Aug. 23 was
11 games. Not once in four Augusts or Septembers has this team come
to work knowing that tomorrow could find it in second place.
</P>
<P>
   But Aug. 23, 1999, was different. The Braves began the day
leading the Mets by a half-game in the NL East, two games ahead of
Cincinnati in the wild-card standings. The Reds were in town for
the first of three games. The Mets were playing Houston, which
stood a half-game ahead of Cincy in the Central. In the course of
three days a flurry of shuffling could be done. Or everything could
stay status quo. In a pennant race you never know, which is why
pennant races are both hated and loved by those involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fun as long as they end good,'' said Glavine, who
hasn't been through one that didn't. In 1991 the Braves chased the
Dodgers for two months and pulled ahead to stay on the final
weekend, clinching the West on the season's penultimate day. In
1993 it took longer still, the Braves having to beat Colorado in
the 162nd game _ Glavine was the winning pitcher _ and wait to see
if the Giants would lose to L.A. They did.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it's hard to say which chase was sweeter. ``Ninety-one
was totally unexpected, an electrifying year,'' Glavine said. ``But
'93, coming from 14 games behind'' _ actually only 10; see how
races blur into legend? _ ``was gratifying, too.'' And those
pursuits, lest we forget, came without a safety net. There were no
wild cards then, another indication of how long ago it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to win our division those years,'' Glavine said. In '93
the Braves and Giants finished with the two best records in
baseball, yet only Atlanta qualified for postseason. This time
there are four teams tracking three spots. This time one runner-up
will advance. This time the scoreboard-watching will be
three-pronged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the Mets first,'' Glavine said. ``Our primary focus
is still to win the division. But then you look at Houston and
Cincinnati, and you're constantly trying to figure out what we
want: Is it better if Houston wins and Cincinnati loses? It gets
kind of confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uncertainty comes this bit of clarity: Pennant races
are never boring. No Brave will be pushing the snooze button on
this September. ``You'd like to win by a comfortable margin,''
Glavine said, ``but this has added some excitement. And that's not
a bad thing around here.''

TREES HARDEST HIT BY HURRICANE BRET IN RURAL TEXAS

   SARITA, Texas _ If there is such a thing as a perfect spot for a
hurricane to come ashore, Kenedy County might be it. The flat,
green pastures are filled with wild oaks and mesquite instead of
shopping centers and subdivisions. There is not a store, restaurant
or gas station in this county called home by only 460 people.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are one of those 460, perfect is not the right word
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all make jokes about it,'' J.A. Garcia, a county judge,
said inside the darkened county courthouse as a thunderstorm
crackled overhead Monday afternoon. ``There are people who are
living here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Hurricane Bret slowly pushed ashore onto the
South Texas coastline, people awoke to find most buildings still
standing and lives spared; not a single fatality or serious injury
was reported. Initially compared in its potential for destruction
to Hurricane Andrew, this storm picked a path as if it were trying
to avoid people, grinding steadily through the vast ranch lands
halfway between Brownsville and Corpus Christi as it was downgraded
to a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials were still cautioning Monday that flooding
was possible as the storm moved inland and stalled near Laredo,
dumping heavy amounts of rain. Federal officials closed the three
bridges over the Rio Grande as a precautionary measure, blocking
traffic on both sides of the border. Sporadic flooding was reported
in some Laredo neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm moving well inland from the South Texas coast,
city officials in Corpus Christi began allowing evacuated residents
to return home late Monday. About 30 miles to the south, more than
16,000 people remained without power, many of them in Kingsville,
as utility workers struggled to restore electricity. Yet for a
region that has not endured a major hurricane in more than 20
years, the fears that prompted thousands of people to evacuate the
coast were replaced by relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky, man,'' said Sam Delarosa, the kitchen manager
of Snoopy's Cafe, located on Padre Island, the barrier island
stretching down the coast. ``Very, very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials had warned that a tidal surge of 12 feet could cause
flooding inland as well as tremendous damage to the low-lying
barrier islands. But the tidal surge apparently never happened.
From Port Aransas as far south as Malaquite Beach on the Padre
Island National Seashore, the damage was light. ``That tide hasn't
gone up more than a foot or two, and the wind must have just blown
all that water back out into the Gulf,'' Delarosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind his desk inside the Kenedy County Courthouse,
Sheriff Rafael M. Cuellar Jr. offered his own theory of why the
storm weakened as it came inland: trees. With nearly 1 million
acres of pasture land, much of it divided between the Kenedy Ranch
and the King Ranch, the two largest ranches in Texas, Kenedy County
is covered in oaks and mesquite and cactus. The terrain is so
desolate, and so stultifying in the summer, that illegal immigrants
walking through the pastures north toward Houston often succumb to
the elements in Kenedy County. Last month, Cuellar said the bodies
of four illegal immigrants were found in the brush dead from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The isolation infuses every aspect of life in Kenedy County.
With the closest convenience store a 5-mile drive from Sarita, the
county seat, the sheriff said people become accustomed to living
apart from the modern world. ``Anybody who wants a Coke has to come
up here and get it from the courthouse,'' the sheriff said, noting
toward the drink machine.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But when people learned of the approaching storm, many of them
sought shelter. Most of Sarita's 200 residents gathered in the
local Catholic church or schoolhouse. In the early hours Monday
morning, the storm's worst winds tore through Sarita and
Falfurrias, about 25 miles to the west, uprooting trees and downing
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad,'' said Cuellar, who keeps a package of chewing
tobacco and three bottles of hot pepper sauce on his desk. He said
everyone in the shelters got along. ``They all knew each other,''
he said. ``More than half of them are related. You don't have
problems like in big cities where they don't want to be close to
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Genho, vice president for livestock for the King Ranch,
said the 825,000-acre ranch lost about 25,000 acres of cotton and
suffered extensive damage to trees and various buildings and
windmills. He said the Norias division in the Ranch, which is
Kenedy County, absorbed the full brunt of the southern eye of the
storm. ``We were extremely blessed,'' Genho said. ``I have been in
a lot of hurricanes having lived in Florida most of my life. When
you get a Class 4 hurricane, that's scary anywhere. There's a lot
of potential for damage.''
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse in the afternoon, sheriff's deputies returned
after canvassing the county for damages. They had seen many downed
trees, but everyone agreed it could have been far worse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All of that was good news for Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need most is to go to sleep because I haven't slept in
two nights,'' he said.

ANNAN SAYS IRAQ NOT DOING ENOUGH FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Iraqi
government Monday that it could be doing more to help mothers and
children under the program that allows Iraq to export oil to raise
money for food, medicine and other essential goods.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council on the program, Annan also
asked that the council's sanctions committee stop blocking the
export to Iraq of goods like water and sanitation equipment which
would also contribute to better health. Most of the holds put on
contracts in the committee come from representatives of the United
States or, occasionally Britain, the countries that take the
hardest line against Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program was started in 1996 to ease civilian
suffering under economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's report precedes a debate to resume next month about how
to deal with Iraq now that it has effectively ended arms
inspections _ which would have allowed sanctions to be lifted once
questions on nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programs had
been answered. As the debate nears, the Iraqis, faced with mounting
evidence that they have significantly stalled at least parts of a
relief program, still face these questions. Even so, they continue
to accuse the United States of being entirely responsible for the
deaths of thousands of Iraqis under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   As officials of the oil-for-food program explained Monday,
Iraq's revenues from oil exports have risen sharply in recent
months with higher world oil prices. But the government has
actually been spending less on nutritionally enhanced food products
that would benefit women and children in central and southern Iraq,
where Hussein's government is in control and where 85 percent of
the Iraqi people live.
</P>
<P>
   At current oil price levels, Iraq stands to make as much as $6.3
billion in oil sales in the six-month period ending in November,
Annan said in the report. Officials here said that Iraq had so far
budgeted only $6.6 million in nutritional supplements for mothers
and small children, down from $15 million when the program began in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, program officials said, the United Nations and
local Kurdish officials decide what to buy. More money is allocated
there for foods like high-protein biscuits and milk fortified with
nutrients to build up malnourished children.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's report echoes and broadens findings of a report released
two weeks ago by UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund, which surveyed
the health of Iraqi children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   Benon Sevan, director of the U.N. Iraq program, said Monday that
the Iraqis had not heeded earlier recommendations to increase
orders of special nutritional products.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the light of the UNICEF survey,'' Sevan said in an
interview, ``there should be serious attention given to targeted
feeding programs in order to achieve immediate benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's report, which Sevan will discuss with
the Security Council on Thursday, faulted Iraq for other omissions
in its civilian aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   It said that working and living conditions for Iraqis and United
Nations-appointed foreign experts at Mina al Bakr, where a large
part of Iraqi oil exports are loaded, were unhygienic and unsafe.
The port of Um Qasr, through which imports pass, is also
deteriorating, slowing inspections and quality testing as goods
arrive. Both are under Iraqi government control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The quality testing is in itself a problem, the report noted. It
cited four-month delays in examinations of tuberculosis and
diphtheria vaccines intended for Kurdish regions, where 13 percent
of oil earnings must be spent, according to the Security Council
resolution setting up the program.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the Iraqis have also been ordering less
essential food for the general public _ among these cheese, milk
and lentils or beans _ which has lowered the number of calories
provided in monthly food rations to Iraqis in government-controlled
areas. In Kurdish areas, calories are higher. Sevan said children
in Kurdish areas look healthier every time he visits.
</P>
<P>
   Although holds have been put on contracts for needed water and
sanitation supplies, those goods that do arrive in Iraq do not
always get distributed quickly, according to the report. ``Large
quantities of essential materials remain in storage,'' it read. A
drought in Iraq has worsened water problems.
</P>
<P>
   There have been persistent Iraqi complaints about the quality of
goods imported under the oil-for-food program _ the explanation
Iraq gave for sending a ship carrying baby products and cottonseed
back to Dubai last week. The secretary-general said in his report
that the Iraqi government, which chooses the suppliers, should
``procure better quality commodities through more reliable and
reputable contractors.''

ARTS PROPOSALS UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mayor Paul Schell rode into office as the arts mayor,
heavily backed by the city's arts groups. In a press conference
Tuesday morning he plans to earn the title, unveiling a series of
proposals to revitalize the city's now creaky commitment to the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   Among his proposals will be a new director for the Seattle Arts
Commission. Present director Wendy Ceccherelli is moving to a newly
created job of chief arts strategist for the Seattle Parks
Department, focusing on the arts uses for the 151-acres of
Sandpoint Park, now being developed as an addition to Magnuson Park
on Sandpoint Way N.E. The new space could house low-cost artist
studios as well as performing arts spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Schell will ask the city council for an additional $250,000 for
arts from the general fund of next year's budget and increase the
One Percent for Art attached to city construction projects to 1.5
Percent for Art.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he said, he's doubling the Percent for Arts Program,
because he's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to
utilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside
but owned by the city. The additional money will go not just to
visual artists' projects but to projects in a range of disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000 will help implement the mayor's small, concrete
proposals to help bring the arts to the city's citizens. He has a
new slogan he'll try out Tuesday: ``Arts Every Day for Everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   These ideas include making Sandpoint available for smaller
performance arts groups for specific dates, renovating the 600-seat
theater on the site.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth floor of Seattle Center's Center House will be
what the major calls a ``black box'' room or theater space also
available to arts groups seeking performance venues. Such groups
will also be able to book dates at the Museum of History and
Industry and the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Bathhouse Theater at Green Lake will reopen for multiple
arts uses, and an study will identity the economic gain provided to
the city by individual artists and small arts groups, similar to
the one the Allen Foundation funded last year through the Corporate
Council for the Arts to study the economic impact of larger arts
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Schell also has big ideas for high tech arts access, hiring a
so-called web-master to link arts groups with the schools and
empower neighborhoods to continue to create their own arts
identities. The Seattle Public Library system will serve as focal
point for information about the city's arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's proposals come in response to the recommendations of
the Seattle Arts Task Force Report delivered to the mayor in June.
The 21 artists, arts administrators and community activists who
made up the the task force were chosen by Schell and City Council
member Nick Licata nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schell's proposals fall short financially of the task
force's recommendations, task force members contacted Monday were
pleased by the mayor's annoucements.
</P>
<P>
   Licata, who was out of town, issued a statement saying he was
heartened by the mayor's proposals and he views them as a crucial
first step.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, saying that without adequate funding, the arts can't
flourish, the task force asked the city to establish a $200 million
public endowment for the arts, raising roughly $15.5 million per
year for 10 years, eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts
Commission. In the meantime, the task force recommended that the
city set side 1 percent of the general fund to support the arts
commission, and that the commission become a city department: the
city's centralized art source.
</P>
<P>
   Schell plans to study and refine the $200 million idea but nixed
the other two suggestions, saying the general fund's support for
the arts is already more than 1 percent, closer to 1.5 percent, but
it's spread over a variety of city agencies instead of centralized
in the arts commission.
</P>
<P>
   He's against centralization, as it turns out, preferring to
continue to distribute arts funding not only through the commission
but through community parks, libraries, community centers and the
Neighborhood Matching Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Centralizing information about the arts is another matter.
Schell wants the libraries to eliminate all red tape and give
citizens specifics about the arts in a clean and direct fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Jodee Fenton, library coordinator for fine and performing arts,
says the library is already providing art access information, but
not enough people know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do the best job on face of the earth, if nobody knows
about it, what difference does it make?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the library provides music listening stations, a
piano for practice, and a large collection of scores and recordings
for public use, as well as an arts information line, 206-386-4612.
Arts information is also available through the library online:
spl.org.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the mayor wants the library to provide exhibition
spaces in neighborhood libraries for neighborhood artists; a music
ensemble/theater arts room to try out new work, with video
equipment available as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Another information source will be a revitalized ``Seattle
Arts'' program on TVSEA, showcasing the Seattle Arts
Commission-funded artists and arts organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the possibility of studios for artists at Sandpoint,
Schell is hosting a live/work forum for artists on Oct. 29. (For
more information, call Amy Painter at the Seattle Arts Commision,
206-684-7306.)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, artist and task force member Barbara Thomas said that
however modest people may think the mayor's prospals are, they are
specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give us a map of what he's thinking,'' she said. ``The
city's commitment to arts was stalled. The mayor is laying out
where he plans to make his mark. Some of his ideas are quite bold,
like the increasing the One Percent for Arts.''

IT'S ALL EGO: IN BACK SEAT, OR UP FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Follow this trek.
</P>
<P>
   You grow up a budding star, a gleam in your sport. Little League
coaches insure you are at practices and games and, if necessary,
they transport you daily. Later, while you're still young, fans are
stumbling over one another for your autograph. You are always news
in the local papers and sometimes in national ones.
</P>
<P>
   And you have yet to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Similar patterns continue throughout college. You are the big
star on campus. The spotlight glares. Your ego is fed full. Back
home, by now, you may even have a street in your name. You are hot
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And then, one day, you make the pros. The biggest of times.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? You suddenly become just a player. Only a piece
of the puzzle, because now you are in a stratosphere where a star
of all stars reigns on your team.
</P>
<P>
   Take a back seat. Swallow that ego. Know your place. Contribute,
but do it quietly.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most difficult transitions in sports: taking
``superstars'' and developing them into, basically, role players.
Getting an athlete who is used to being pampered to accept and then
to flourish under the hammer of a teammate who is the ultimate
superstar, whose light is blinding.
</P>
<P>
   This comes to mind with Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares anything about the rest of the Cardinals and the Cubs,
respectively? For the last two seasons now, McGwire and Sosa have
been the show, and everyone else on their teams has taken a back
seat. Swallowed his ego. This can be very tiring. Imagine everyone
always asking about the other guy's performances and not yours.
Does this have anything to do with both teams' being total flops
this year?
</P>
<P>
   Some players accept the quieter role.
</P>
<P>
   Others do grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   Some never do.
</P>
<P>
   I remember talking with players under Bo Schembechler, then the
Michigan football coach, about how he did not want a team of stars.
Players said he would check their numbers on offense, and if
something was ``getting out of hand'' then the ball would begin to
be spread around. Schembechler believed that a star player treated
as bigger than the team would ruin the team. Thus, his chant, his
foundation was always: ``The team! The team! The team!''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Braman, the former Philadelphia Eagles owner, once told
me that he left pro football in part because he could not see
success in wide-sweeping free agency, paying one player $200,000
and then expecting from him effort, work and production equal to
that of a guy standing next to him earning $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Ball, now a defensive lineman for the Cleveland Browns,
said that when he played for Detroit, Barry Sanders ``then and now
was bigger than the Detroit Lions tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball continued: ``He is one of the few athletes who around the
world you can say `Barry' and people would respond with his last
name. I don't know if the Lions ever understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the Lions players did.
</P>
<P>
   And some of them, privately, are not sad that Sanders left. They
want some of the spotlight that he, without demanding, totally
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Philadelphia 76ers feel that way about Allen Iverson. Some
San Francisco 49ers in past years felt that way about Jerry Rice.
Wonder if any of the Washington Mystics players are a touch bemused
at the mountain of attention awarded the rookie Chamique Holdsclaw?
</P>
<P>
   An essence of pro coaching today is selecting players who are
confident enough in their own stature to take a back seat to
superstars who engulf them. A compelling trait of the best coaches
in the next century will be those who can milk and massage the egos
and confidence of the ``minor players,'' while creating room for
the superstar to be a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   No small task in an industry where egos rule.
</P>
<P>
   Pro athletes today think of themselves as entertainers, and love
aligning themselves with the music and movie industries. Glamour
people all. For some, the brighter the lights, the better. Players
now compete with one another for the best contracts and for the
biggest stature as much as they do for championships.
</P>
<P>
   Where is that fine line where it ruins the team?
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and their organizations have to look under the surface
and find it. It is each player's job, too.
</P>
<P>
   And for many marginal athletes, the origin is not hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   What they envy, they once were.

For years, members of Congress have slipped millions of dollars
into spending bills to build dams and highways back home.
Increasingly, the money is going to academic studies. Defenders of
earmarking, like John Silber, chancellor of Boston University, one
of the largest beneficiaries of such money, say it merely allows
academics to appeal directly to the source of financing. Silber

TEX BANWELL DEAD AT 80; BRITISH WARTIME ESCAPE ARTIST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Deamer (Tex) Banwell, a British army World War II escape
artist whose many exploits included serving as a double for Field
Marshal Montgomery and twice facing a Gestapo firing squad and
living to tell about it, died on July 25 in a hospital in North
London. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   His death was reported in London on Monday by The Daily
Telegraph and confirmed by Geoffrey Picot, a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Banwell's death-defying exploits _ some of which were recounted
by Leo Heaps in his book ``The Grey Goose of Arnhem'' (Weidenfeld &AMP;
Nicolson, 1977) _ began in 1942. He was captured during a British
raid on Tobruk, Libya. British forces there were seeking to
dislodge Field Marshal Rommel, who was shoring up Mussolini's
crumbling North African empire.
</P>
<P>
   With a friend, Banwell managed to steal a German vehicle and
return to the safety of British lines. On a subsequent raid on
Crete, he told friends, he was taken prisoner at Candia, also known
as Iraklion.
</P>
<P>
   He was put under the personal supervision of Max Schmeling, the
1930s world heavyweight champion, who was serving in the Wehrmacht.
</P>
<P>
   Banwell and a few of his comrades managed to slip away from
their captors and steal an assault landing craft. With the help of
Cretan fishermen, they made their getaway. But the craft ran out of
fuel and drifted for nine days before reaching the North African
coast.
</P>
<P>
   It took Banwell 12 weeks in a British hospital to recover fully.
When he had done so, someone noticed that he bore a striking
resemblance to Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   So Banwell was sent to Cairo to meet him. Given the appropriate
clothing, insignia and general's badges, he was then sent on trips
around the Middle East to confuse enemy spies.
</P>
<P>
   However, since Banwell was taller than Montgomery, he was told
that he must never leave the field marshal's car. No assignment
could have been less congenial for Banwell, and he was soon back in
the infantry.
</P>
<P>
   There he was introduced to parachuting and joined a parachute
regiment. He kept in shape with regimental boxing and cross-country
running.
</P>
<P>
   The events leading up to his encounters with the Gestapo began
in September 1944, when Banwell and several other paratroopers were
dropped near Arnhem in the Netherlands. In a well-known fiasco,
American forces failed to come to their aid as planned and they
were captured en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Banwell was wounded and taken prisoner. He later escaped by
jumping from a moving train as it entered Germany. He then joined
the Dutch Resistance, adopting the code name Tex, which he used for
the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while escorting a party of escaping prisoners, he was
again captured by the Germans. Since he was not in uniform, his
captors said he had forfeited his military status and, after a
speedy court martial, he was sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   He was told, however, that if he disclosed the names of his
Resistance contacts the sentence would not be carried out. When
Banwell refused, he was placed in front of a firing squad, which
was given all the orders except the one to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Banwell was sent back to his cell until the next morning, when
he was told that this time he really would be shot unless he gave
the information.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the ritual was again enacted, this time with the
squad firing blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Banwell was taken to Auschwitz. In an effort to make
him tell what he knew, his captors confined him in a 6-foot-square
cage and denied him food. When the Russians liberated the camp,
Banwell rejoined a British paratroop unit.
</P>
<P>
   On one jump, he later told friends, he was knocked unconscious,
declared dead, and taken to the morgue. There, an attendant noticed
a flutter in one of his eyelids, and he revived.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Deamer Banwell was born on Oct. 8, 1918, and began his
military career in 1936 in the elite Coldstream Guards.
</P>
<P>
   Banwell, whose highest rank was sergeant, was awarded a British
Empire Medal in 1969, and in 1992 the Netherlands Silver Cross for
his services to the Dutch Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he worked for the British postal service, but he
continued to tempt death. In 1984, he made his 1,000th jump at
Arnhem on the 40th anniversary of the battle. He went on to jump
again, when in his mid-70s, on the 50th anniversary in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Banwell is survived by his wife, Anne, of London, and three
children from a previous marriage, Ian, Linda and Avril, all of
Hartfordshire.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of World War II, Banwell was asked to fill out an
army questionnaire. One question asked how military training could
be improved. Banwell wrote: ``More street and woodland fighting.''

 &HT;    Massacre survivors adapt to new family
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He sits in the living room of his grandmother's
apartment watching a celebrity game show on TV with his father, his
younger sister and a family friend. Occasionally, the boy, with the
cast and metal pins in his right arm, turns to hisfather and they
share a smile or tease each other about the score.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in new blue jeans, a dark red T-shirt and new sneakers,
he is the picture of the average 12-year-old boy sharing a light
moment with his family after the first day of middle school.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen of the northeast Atlanta home, his grandmother
sits before a huge bowl, mixing and mashing giant sweet potatoes
and sugar for a pie. Ribs, collard greens and potato salad are also
on the menu in celebration of the first day of classes for the boy
and his 10-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
   But at night, when the TV is turned off and the dishes are
washed and put away and the little apartment is dark and quiet,
Santonio Lucas cries.
</P>
<P>
   For his mother. His aunt. His brothers and sisters. The family
he lost in a mass murder-suicide on a sweltering July day.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon, Santonio, his sister Jalisa and their father
David Lucas, sit together talking about their lives and how they
came together.
</P>
<P>
   The boy places his chin on a table and gazes impassively at a
smaller TV set up in his grandmother's bedroom. Jalisa, a dynamo
who loves math and science, talks non-stop with a visitor about her
first day at elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Jalisa did not witness the horrible event that unfolded at her
home in southwest Atlanta earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Santonio did.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12 just before sunup, Santonio was forced to watch as
Cyrano Marks, his mother's live-in boyfriend, shot and killed
Santonio's mother, his aunt and four of his siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Santonio survived only after he faked his death when Marks
cornered him in a hallway closet and shot him in the arm. Though
Marks put a bullet through his own head minutes later, the
terrified youngster crouched in the closet for eight hours before
running to a neighbor's house to call police.
</P>
<P>
   Jalisa, little-girl innocent with a plethora of braids and an
infectious smile, was saved from the horror because she stayed over
at an aunt's house to play with cousins the night before her family
was executed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the murders, Santonio lived at Hughes
Spalding Children Hospital. He celebrated his 12th birthday there
on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cried like a baby all that day. It was the toughest day,''
Lucas said Monday. ``It was his birthday and he wanted his mother.
They were close.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightmares about the shootings also haunted Santonio's time at
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The bad dreams are gone now, his father said, but the tears
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cries almost every night,'' Lucas said gazing fondly at his
son. ``He and his sister have gotten very close. They're even
closer to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas divorced Santonio's mother Delean Briskey years ago. But
the couple had four children and Lucas often visited his kids on
weekends at Briskey's house.
</P>
<P>
   Though united by tragedy, Lucas is happy his two youngest
children are with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they want to go everywhere I go,'' Lucas said. ``I'm the
only parent they have left and they want to be with me all the
time. I feel good about it. We talk. We cry. We laugh. We watch TV
and we go to the movies whenever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Life also has changed for Santonio's grandmother Cynthia Lucas
Waller. She used to live comfortably in the apartment with her
second husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two children and a 37-year-old son later, Waller has no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why these children are here is sad,'' Waller said
Monday. ``I've opened my heart and given them my understanding and
my love. As I see it, they lost one family and gained another.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at both Santonio's and Jalisa's schools also made
sure the children were given emotional support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been preparing for Jalisa's arrival for the last month,
talking to her new teacher and a school counsleor about the
situation,'' said Gwendolyn Mayfield, principal at Miles Elementary
in southwest Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children in her fifth-grade class were encouraged to talk
about what happened to her family so that she'll feel it's alright
to talk about it. Her new teacher is looking forward to spending
time with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Santonio's seventh-grade classmates at Usher Middle School
welcomed him back with pats on the back and boyish conversation,
said principal Geraldine Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep it as ordinary as possible for Santonio the
first few days he's here,'' Williams said. ``Later on we're
planning to have an assembly just to welcome him back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently unemployed because of a back injury, Lucas spends his
days ferrying Santonio and Jalisa to their counselling sessions and
Santonio's doctor. The boy's cast will be removed in about two
months and he looks forward to playing football and baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   But the child's arm is the least of his father's worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santonio and his sister talk about their mama all the time you
know,'' Lucas, 37, said. ``They'll say, 'You know this is how mama
did this or this is how mama did that.' And I'll look at them and
smile.
</P>
<P>
   `` I know my son will never get over this. It will be with him
forever. But every night I pray he'll make it alright.''

SCHROEDER _ AND GERMANY'S CENTER OF GRAVITY _ MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Almost a decade after the fall of the wall that divided
Germany and Europe, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder took up residence
here on Monday, inaugurating the first Berlin-based government to
rule the country since Hitler's collapsed at the end of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Because the enormous new chancellery opposite the Reichstag is
not yet ready, Schroeder was obliged to move into the refurbished
former office of Erich Honecker, the East German leader, a curious
twist on which he chose not to dwell Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's arrival was a low-key occasion. There was no
ceremony at the Brandenburg Gate, no political rally, no pomp and
circumstance _ as befits a shift of which most Germans are proud
but whose historical symbolism remains too charged for broad public
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   As Schroeder began governing from Honecker's former office,
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer moved into a remodeled building
next door that once housed Hitler's Reichsbank. After protracted
discussions over the last decade, Germany has decided that some
former Nazi buildings will be used as ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy has won and therefore these memories are not
threatening,'' said Franz Muentefering, the transport minister, who
has organized much of the 375-mile move eastward from Bonn. ``On
the contrary, it is useful to be aware of them and not to try to
run from history by destroying the buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Eberhard Diepgen, the Christian Democratic mayor of Berlin,
welcomed the Social Democratic chancellor in a small ceremony
during which Schroeder cut a cake decorated with bears _ the symbol
of Berlin. He said the city would become ``one of the great world
metropolises _ if it is not one already.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor appeared to be indulging in a little diplomatic
hyperbole, for much of Berlin remains a building site, the hum of
economic activity is not yet widely discernible, chic streets
number one or two at most, and the city does not yet offer direct
flights to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Berlin has something else _ a sense of being wide open, of
beginning life again _ that perhaps no other European city offers
to the same degree. Few would argue with its potential.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder added that the arrival of the government was a
``historic moment'' _ the completion of a decade-long transition
during which Germany had undergone ``a peaceful and successful
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace has indeed prevailed since the Berlin wall fell in
November 1989, but the integration of east and west has not been as
smooth or as successful as Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor,
predicted at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schroeder's failure since taking office last year to
make any dent in high unemployment, particularly in the eastern
part of the country, has been a major reason for a sharp plunge in
his popularity. Recent opinion polls have shown that only 23
percent of the electorate approves of the way he has governed.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he has had trouble stamping his authority on Germany.
One television station, RTL, is now preparing a soap opera based on
the chancellor and his life called ``Wie war ich, Doris?'' or ``How
was I, Doris?'' after the reported propensity of Schroeder to ask
his wife, a former journalist, how he has fared in public
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for the soap opera have outraged Schroeder, who
canceled an interview with RTL this week, but it appeared to
reflect some of his difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In the new capital, the chancellor is clearly hoping to turn the
corner. He has never concealed his mild contempt for Bonn and his
strong desire to be in Berlin, and he has suggested repeatedly that
the new ``Berlin Republic'' should provide a catalyst for the
reconciliation of east and west that has proved so elusive up to
now.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But whatever the symbolism of Berlin, the economic and political
reality facing Schroeder is harsh. As five important state
elections loom in the next two months, he is trying to move his
Social Democratic Party sharply toward fiscal conservatism against
resistance from many party members and from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   His finance minister, Hans Eichel, has proposed budget cuts of
over $15 billion, including a two-year freeze on pensions, and
Schroeder has resisted repeated calls for a tax on large fortunes
that was promised during his election campaign. Those policies,
welcomed by big business, have drawn fire from the chancellor's
party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during a quick visit to the western town of
Saarbruecken, where political resistance to his ideas has been
particularly intense, Schroeder made it clear that he would not
waver and said he planned to revise his party's 40-year-old
manifesto before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to look afresh at how the basic values of this party _
which in themselves are not in doubt _ can be achieved,'' Schroeder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is expected to govern from his temporary offices for
at least a year. The new chancellery was enlarged after Kohl
insisted that it should be as tall as the Reichstag to symbolize a
balance between the executive and Parliament. As a result, the
project was delayed and the cost has increased by 15 percent, to
about $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor has recently expressed a personal view that the
building is rather large. It is in fact about three times the size
of the former chancellery in Bonn.

AILING FILENE'S BASEMENT FILES FOR PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In what may be the beginning of the end for a Boston
institution _ or the chance for a fresh start _ beleaguered
Filene's Basement filed for bankruptcy protection Monday amid
mounting losses and fierce competition from rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement has been an enduring city attraction. ``It's
one of our landmarks, something everyone who comes to our city
wants to visit,'' said Mayor Thomas M. Menino, reacting to the
bankrupcty filing, which came a week after the company announced
another quarter of anemic earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But if Filene's Basement is a favorite tourist stop, it is also
a business in trouble, a retail throwback hurt by larger companies,
outlet chains, and a change in the way that time-harried consumers
shop in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   It may be premature to write off the Basement just yet. For the
91-year-old company, bankruptcy isn't necessarily a final chapter
but perhaps the first chapter of a comeback story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a knockdown to one knee, but it's not a knockout,'' said
Basement chairman Sam Gerson, citing an inventory shortage brought
on by credit problems as the immediate reason for the decision to
seek so-called Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ``The Basement is
still one damn terrific company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gray day,'' Gerson added. ``But it's also a new
beginning.'' Gerson gave no timetable for when the chain might
emerge from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's flagship Boston store and 54 stores spread across
the Northeast and Midwest will continue to be open for business,
and customers should see no changes, at least in the short term,
according to company officials. By filing for bankruptcy, the
company will be able to obtain additional credit from its lenders
to pay for new shipments of fall merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it recently eliminated nearly 40 of about 230
jobs at its Wellesley headquarters, with some of the cuts coming
through attrition. The chain employs about 3,800 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often use Chapter 11 to close unprofitable stores.
Some analysts believe that Filene's Basement, which has faced
criticism that it expanded too rapidly and strayed too far from its
base, will follow that strategy. Gerson declined to say how many
stores might be closed.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, a retailer in bankruptcy is similar to a
hospital patient with a serious illness. The illness can be fatal,
but a full recovery is also possible. So is survival in some
diminished form, perhaps the likeliest outcome for Filene's
Basement.
</P>
<P>
   For Caldor Corp., bankruptcy presaged doom. Unable to fix its
problems, the chain went out of business this year. But for
Bradlees Inc., Chapter 11 was part of a long, painful healing that
saw the Braintree, Mass. company emerge from bankruptcy six months
ago. During its 3 1/2 years in Chapter 11, Bradlees closed roughly
33 of 136 stores and shed about 6,000 jobs, including the job of a
former chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been some upside to all that pain. Last week
Bradlees reported a modest quarterly profit.
</P>
<P>
   Filing for bankruptcy can give a troubled retailer some
``breathing space as it attempts to reorganize,'' said Christopher
J. Panos, a Boston lawyer who heads up the Boston Bar Association's
bankruptcy law section.
</P>
<P>
   The Basement's most pressing problem was that it had lost the
faith of its vendors. Afraid they wouldn't be paid, some stopped
shipping goods, and the Basement's sales were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was shipping because their credit was bad,'' said Gary
Wassner, president of Hilldun Corp., a New York firm that provides
financing to vendors.
</P>
<P>
   In Chapter 11, a retailer can usually obtain more flexible
financing to ease short-term cash-flow problems. Bankruptcy
protection can also make it easier to close underperforming stores
because a retailer is shielded from many of the economic
consequences of breaking a store lease at unprofitable sites.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Filene's Basement said it had received a commitment from
its lenders, General Electric Capital Corp. and Paragon Capital
LLC, for a $135 million in special financing. That financing could
be approved Tuesday when the US District Court in Boston is set to
hear Filene's Basement's request to seek Chapter 11 protection, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, Filene's Basement listed assets of more than $200
million and debts of nearly $149 million, according to the
company's public relation's firm.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Basement's greatest challenge has been to
import the magic of its downtown store to other locations.
</P>
<P>
   As the Basement struggled to replicate itself, TJX Cos. of
Framingham, Mass. came up with its T.J. Maxx retail format. T.J.
Maxx never had the cachet of the Basement's flagship, but it has
been able to clone its T.J. Maxx model hundreds of times.
</P>
<P>
   Today TJX is a phenomenal success. With nearly $8 billion in
sales last year, it has far eclipsed Filene's Basement in the world
of off-price retail, and it has emerged as a formidable competitor.
By comparison, Filene's Basement had about $588.5 million in sales
last year.
</P>
<P>
   While a legend in the Boston area, Filene's Basement has never
been as big a draw outside of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Loehmann's Inc., a New York off-price retail chain that filed
for bankruptcy protection in May, faces a similar problem.
</P>
<P>
   The farther the Basement and Loehmann's strayed from their
hometowns, the more they struggled to give faraway consumers a
compelling reason to shop at unfamiliar stores, said John Macht of
the Macht Group, a Boston retail consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908 when Filene's Basement first opened its doors, nobody
had seen anything quite like it. For tonier department stores, the
Basement solved a problem; it was a place where they could unload
merchandise they couldn't sell at full price.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers who didn't mind shopping in a no-frills bargain
basement, the payoff was the chance of finding a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was a smash, and generations of Bostonians and
tourists thronged the Basement's Downtown Crossing store. In the
late 1970s, the Basement began opening suburban stores, later
expanding to other cities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last decade, the retail landscape has changed. After
a period of consolidation, many department stores began offering
more and more promotional sales.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of selling slow-moving goods to off-price retailers such
as Filene's Basement, department stores decided either to discount
and sell the goods themselves or to open their own outlet stores
that would be stocked with excess merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes made it harder for the Basement to find the quality
merchandise that had made it famous.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumers were changing their shopping habits.
Landing a bargain at Filene's Basement can be labor intensive, and
today's busy lifestyles leave consumers less time and energy to
rummage through bins in search of the elusive bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The Basement recently launched a new chain called Aisle 3,
designed to serve consumers the way they shop now. These warehouse
stores are open for business only on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's first four stores are ``showing strong signs of
success,'' Gerson said, and four other stores are about to open.
</P>
<P>
   If other retail bankruptcies are any guide, the company may
expand Aisle 3 and close many outlying Filene's Basement stores.
Also expect the Basement to offer a bonus retention package to
discourage top executives from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Following the announcement of its intention to file for
bankruptcy, trading in shares of Basement stock was halted Monday
at 29/32. Shareholders usually lose out when a company files for
bankruptcy. According to Bloomberg News, Fidelity Investments was
the largest investor in Filene's Basement at the end of June. At
the time, Fidelity owned just over 1.9 million shares.

BASEBALL COLUMN: NATIONAL LEAGUE PLAYOFF CONTENDERS FACE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months ago, the Cincinnati Reds were in the midst of
establishing a major league record by winning 10 consecutive games
against first-place teams, Arizona and Houston. Monday night the
Mets began a 10-day stretch against those same teams, but they will
not match the streak that catapulted the Reds into the National
League Central and wild-card races.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets can't tie the Reds' record because they play the
first-place Astros and Diamondbacks only nine times, but the games
will nevertheless have an impact on their position in the NL East
and wild-card races.
</P>
<P>
   Division championship, wild card; wild card, division
championship. What's a team to do? Focus on one and if it achieves
the other, fine? How is a team supposed to view other series its
competitors play?
</P>
<P>
   On the very three days the Mets are playing the Astros at Shea
Stadium, the Reds are playing the Braves in Atlanta. The Mets
entered Monday night's series opener half a game behind the Braves
in the East; the Reds began their series half a game behind the
Astros in the Central. The Mets were a game and a half ahead of the
Reds in the wild-card standing.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Mets haven't played a post-season game since
1988, shouldn't they be satisfied to get in through the wild-card
door? They do, after all, have six games with the Braves in a
nine-game stretch in the last two weeks of the season, and they
know how tough the Braves can be in those circumstances, wounded or
not. (For the latest evidence, see the last three games of last
season, when the Braves won all three and dumped the Mets out of
the wild-card slot.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Mets should pull for the Braves to knock off the
Reds and shove them further back in the wild-card standing, putting
the Mets in a stronger position to claim that fourth playoff spot.
That would be the conservative approach to the playoffs, maybe the
safer route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing is to get in,'' Mets catcher Mike
Piazza said Monday when asked about his rooting interest in the
series in Atlanta. ``It's not a situation where we can be choosy.''
</P>
<P>
   But would a Reds sweep or a Braves sweep be better for the Mets?
``Who knows, man?'' Piazza responded. ``I just know it's important
to continue to go out and win as many games as you can. Hopefully,
we'll get in somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco was asked the same thing. ``That's a good
question,'' said Franco, the Mets' pinch-hitter deluxe. ``I would
take a Cincinnati sweep definitely. Nah, I don't know. I guess
whatever happens, happens. We're rooting for Cincinnati to beat
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets are thinking more first place than wild card, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Franco said, ``although I guess if Atlanta swept
Cincinnati, it wouldn't be terrible. I don't know. It's a good a
question. I want to win the division, so I'm rooting for Cincinnati
to beat Atlanta. But if Atlanta were to sweep Cincinnati, I guess
it wouldn't be all that terrible either.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton called it a ``kind of Catch 22,'' though he sort
of changed his thinking in midthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the division, obviously we want the Braves to
lose,'' Hamilton, the Mets center fielder, said. ``But there's
always the backdrop for us with the wild card. I think we're going
for our division. To be honest, we want to get in there and win the
division, so we're pulling for Cincinnati for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Rickey Henderson began by saying, ``It doesn't
matter.'' But then he said, ``We'd rather win our division, so we'd
rather have Cincinnati win.'' And then he said: ``It's really a
tossup. If Atlanta wins and Cincinnati loses and we win, then we
still have to face each other.'' And finally he said, ``It would
help both ways.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, trying to put the simultaneous series in some
perspective, said it was more important for the Mets to win each
series they play than to pay attention to what was happening
elsewhere. The Mets have won 11 of the 12 series they have played
since the All-Star Game break. The Reds have won 10 of 12,
including the last 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to win each series,'' Hamilton said, ``we'll
have a good feeling about going to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The four contenders will repeat their ambiguity next week, the
Mets playing in Houston, the Braves in Cincinnati, each series
scheduled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Franco saw one benefit
to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier looking up on the scoreboard,'' he said.
``You only have to look one place.'' &QL;

MARINO TESTIFIES IN TRIAL OF TEAMMATE  

</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There was drama Monday in the federal money laundering
trial of Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tony Martin, with a teammate,
Dan Marino, and a former teammate, Nat Moore, testifying on
Martin's behalf and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron DeWaard delivering
his final argument to the jury. DeWaard contended that Martin could
not use ignorance as a defense for illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance in court by Marino, Moore and another Dolphin,
O.J. McDuffie, who did not testify, came one day before the case
will go to the jury after final arguments by Martin's lead defense
attorney, Howard Srebnick.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the jurors heard DeWaard tell them that ``Tony Martin
can't stick his head in the sand. He can't close his eyes to the
obvious. With all the money involved and all the shady
transactions, he had to know something wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jurors also heard Marino and Moore speak up for Martin,
who was signed to a four-year, $14.2 million contract in April by
the Dolphins after starting for two Super Bowl teams in the last
five seasons but who could face three to five years in prison if
convicted. Martin is accused of being a money laundering front for
Rickey Brownlee, who has twice been convicted of drug dealing and
who is currently on trial on drug-trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Tony to be someone that would willingly commit
a crime,'' Marino said. The veteran quarterback added that Martin,
whom Marino said he has known since 1989, had been in his home and
met his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good person,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a Dolphin for 13 years, said that he helped Martin make
the transition from college quarterback to National Football League
wide receiver. Moreover, Moore has used Martin in some of his youth
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that we try not to do in the camps is bring in guys
that aren't appropriate, guys that get in trouble,'' Moore said.
``We invited Tony because we always saw him as a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say Martin, 33, assisted Brownlee, whom he has
known since high school, in the leasing of three luxury cars and in
trying to pay a $175,000 fee to a lawyer for Brownlee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who played in Saturday night's exhibition game against
San Diego, catching 3 passes for 32 yards, sat slumped in his chair
through much of DeWaard's description of his activities with
Brownlee.

JONES MISSES THE GOLD AND THE CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ At first glance, the story of the women's long
jump Monday night was that Marion Jones did not win it and that a
Spaniard named Niurka Montalvo did. But as can sometimes be the
case in the narrow confines of the hit-or-miss domain in which long
jumpers ply their trade, it was quite a bit more complicated than
that.
</P>
<P>
   There was an ultimately unsuccessful protest from the Italian
federation over Montalvo's winning jump on the final round; tears
of frustration from the Italian silver medalist Fiona May, who had
been in the lead throughout the competition.
</P>
<P>
   What is beyond dispute is that Jones will have to wait for next
year's Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, to win the 100 meters,
the 200 meters and the long jump in the same major meet. She had
wanted an unprecedented four gold medals at this world
championship, but after finishing third Monday night with a leap of
22 feet 5 inches, the planet's most prominent female track and
field athlete will now have to scale back her aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a very unexpected decision to run both relays on the
final Sunday, the most events that Jones can win in Seville is
three: the 100 meters that she won already Sunday; the 200 on
Friday and a relay of her choice next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no excuses,'' Jones said. ``I said wanted to come here
and win every event I entered. It didn't happen. But I think I can
sleep well tonight knowing I left it all out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jones, who rarely competed seriously in the event as
a teen-ager, jumped 23 feet-11} inches. This year, she has yet to
get past 23 and has lost her last three competitions. Monday night,
she was again unable to translate her unparalleled speed into
unparalleled length. Her landings were often awkward; her energy
often wasted in the humid Andalusian air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stand here all day and talk about technique,'' she
said. ``I'll be the first one to tell you I need to work on my
technique. As you all know, my specialty is running. As you all
know, that's what I'm good at. It's very difficult to teach someone
speed, and I think it can be a bit easier to teach someone
technique. I have the speed.''
</P>
<P>
   She might still have managed to win if she had not fouled by a
slim margin on her sixth and final jump. Her leap appeared to be
her longest of the evening, slightly past 23 feet, but the Spanish
official Salvio Felipe Somohano Garcia, who was tending the takeoff
board, put his red flag in the air. And after Jones smiled and blew
a kiss to the crowd, she walked back to examine the plasticene
strip that indicates whether competitors have stepped past the
line. She did not argue.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia would soon create plenty of debate. The next jumper
was Montalvo, a 31-year-old who fled her native Cuba and became a
Spanish citizen only late last year. In 1995, at the world
championship in Goteborg, Sweden, she had won a silver medal for
Cuba, finishing second to the British-born May.
</P>
<P>
   May was leading again Monday night, but this time, there would
be a reversal of fortune. Montalvo started her approach, a roar of
local support coursing through the stadium, and as she took off and
landed past the 23-foot mark, the roar got louder. Garcia held up
the white flag, indicating a legal jump, and Montalvo was soon in
the lead with a leap of 23-2, better than May's best effort.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the video replay clearly showed the tip of
her toe extending over the line in front of the plasticene strip on
her takeoff. On television, it looked very much like she had
overshot by the same slight margin as Jones. But the jump stood,
and when May came high-stepping down the runway for the final time,
the roar was nearly as loud and not nearly as supportive. She flew
only 22-9\, good enough for the silver, and Montalvo was soon
taking a victory lap and shaking a lot of happy Spaniards' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Though May gave her a congratulatory kiss, the Italian
federation was soon filing a protest that the International Amateur
Athletic Federation rejected shortly before midnight. The
conclusion was that unlike Jones, Montalvo had not touched the
plasticene on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time a local hero had caused a controversy
in the long jump. In the 1987 world championship in Rome, Italian
officials rigged the measuring system so Italy's Giovanni
Evangelisti would win the bronze medal, a plot that was soon
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF spokesman, Giorgio Reineri, said that in this case, the
protest committee had carefully examined the video and heard from
Garcia and the supervisory judge Egil Gulliksen, a Norwegian,
before rendering its decision. The relevant IAAF rule, No. 173,
does not indicate that a competitors' foot cannot extend beyond the
takeoff line; only that he may not ``touch the ground beyond the
takeoff line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no mark, there is no foul,'' Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that Fiona cannot accept the defeat,'' said
Montalvo, who deemed her jump ``clearly valid'' and added that ``if
it had been me, I would not have protested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say I'm happy, and I don't want to be unsporting but
everybody saw what happened in Montalvo's last jump,'' May said
after seeing the replay.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who declined to speculate on the legality of Montalvo's
jump and complimented the Spaniard on her fine effort, has no such
plans to stop. ``As you know, I set my goals very high, and bronze
is not going to cut it for me; just not going to,'' she said, her
tone not as sharp as her words. ``It tells me I need to get back to
the drawing board for next year. It's as simple as that.''  &QL;

YELLOW CARDS DEAL ZENGA A SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga is suspended for
Wednesday's game against the MetroStars at Giants Stadium because
of an accumulation of yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga was cautioned for the fifth time this season while
protesting to referee Ali Saheli after a penalty kick was awarded
during the Revolution's 2-1 loss at San Jose Saturday night. Ronald
Cerritos converted the penalty for the first goal of the game. Late
in the half, defender Mario Gori was ejected for a tackle from
behind on Cerritos and will also be suspended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have a seven-game losing streak and are in danger
of failing to qualify for the playoffs, but things could be worse,
according to assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, we lost the first five games of the season when I was
playing for Padova,'' Galderisi said. ``There, you have a lot of
people covering the team and you get a lot of criticism. We
couldn't even go out to a bar or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we stayed together, fought together, and ended up having a
good season. It is times like this that can bring a team together.
You have to fight for you teammates, and if you fight together, you
become stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution have committed costly errors that have
subverted any galvanizing effects of team togetherness. Defender
Brian Dunseth lost possession just outside the penalty area,
leading to the deciding goal in San Jose. The Revolution had been
attempting to compensate for the loss of Gori and seemed capable of
keeping the score tied before Alejandro Sequeira's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the team has to believe in each other, sacrifice,
and eliminate those errors,'' said Galderisi. ``We have to unite
and become a team. It's easy to talk, and a lot of people are doing
that now. But we have to continue to work hard, play every game
like it is the final of the Champions League, and we will arrive at
our goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we do, we will remember this as a time which made us
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defender Dan Calichman, out since July 31 with a groin strain,
will return for the game . . . The Boston Bulldogs purchased
striker Elias Montes from Alianza FC in El Salvador. Montes, 25,
has scored seven goals in five games while playing on loan and will
be in the lineup against the Staten Island Vipers Wednesday.

SOX SEND ROSE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Red Sox picked a strange way to prepare for
the September wild-card chase. They optioned second-year man Brian
Rose to Pawtucket and put veteran Bret Saberhagen on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Those were just two in a series of moves designed to save a
season that seems to be slipping away. As they opened a three-game
series against the Twins, the Sox had lost four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams insists that the Red Sox are not in a
state of panic. Rose (6-5, 4.98 ERA) has not won in six starts
since July 20 and is clearly tired. Saberhagen was already
scheduled to miss a start because of a sore right shoulder. Two
hours before the game, he was still planning to throw on the
sidelines, but Williams effectively took any decision out of
Saberhagen's hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand plan, it stands to work to the Red Sox' advantage,
as players on the 15-day disabled list Sept. 1 are eligible for
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the roster spots, the Sox promoted righthander Tomokazu
Ohka from Pawtucket and activated outfielder Damon Buford off the
DL. Buford was eligible to come off Saturday but the Sox had no
place for him. Ohka, who went 0-2 with an 14.29 ERA in his first
tour of duty with Boston in early July, will work out of the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation right now is down to Pat Rapp, Pedro Martinez, Mark
Portugal, and Tim Wakefield, but there is an off day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams let first Rose and then Saberhagen know of the moves in
closed-door meetings Monday. He had some regrets about the decision
on Rose, but given his overall state, it was a good move for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that we did last year _ and this year, too _ is
to first and foremost protect our pitchers,'' said Williams. ``The
kid didn't pitch much last year. He came back and didn't miss a
start all year. Does it take its toll when you keep bringing a kid
back over a certain period of time? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did when he came here was no fluke. This kid pitched.
But the ability that he showed then may not be there right now like
it was. There is a possibly that we will back off a little bit in
Pawtucket and put him on a program where we would let him miss a
start and rest his arm. It might be the right thing to do in his
case, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing one game might not provide enough time for Saberhagen to
return as strong as he'd like to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this guy,'' said Williams, ``and not for just one
start. It's my decision to give him a chance to pitch 5-6 starts
and do it by resting him X number of days. I think it's best for
our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't panic here. He knows how to pitch and knows how to
win. He has that unique ability. He's always had it since he was a
kid. If things are right physically he's going to give us a chance
to win that game. We've had to do this all year with our
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka is 6-0 with a 1.79 ERA at Pawtucket. He was 8-0 at Trenton
and considered one of the team's top prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me he's pitched very well,'' said Williams. ``That's
what I go by.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox contingent didn't arrive to their hotel here until 6
a.m. After losing, 6-0, to the Rangers in Arlington, Texas, Sunday
night, the team went to the airport only to find that their plane
had a flat tire that took four hours to repair.

COASTAL TEXAS DODGES BULLET AS MONSTER STORM MISSES URBAN AREAS

And JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALFURRIAS, Texas _ Armando Regallado was sitting in his living
room watching the Weather Channel when Hurricane Bret paid a rude
house call, ripping the roof off the mobile home like one pulls the
lid off a can of Spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I could see the stars,'' Regallado said. Asked if he was
scared, the 35-year-old construction worker replied: ``Tell me
about it. I saw it. I saw it. I couldn't believe it, then I ran
into another room and it struck there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Regallado, who considers himself lucky to be intact,
was cleaning out debris like thousands of other Texans along the
southern coast and several inland counties.
</P>
<P>
   Officials throughout the region marveled how south coastal Texas
had dodged the bullet, experiencing little property damage from a
storm many had predicted would be as destructive as Hurricane
Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   In Corpus Christi, the region's largest city, qbout 65 miles
northeast of Falfurrias, residents were permitted to return to
North Padre Island, which had been under a mandatory evacuation
order. Utility crews had spread out to restore electricity and
telephone service while city workers removed debris from storm
drains that had contributed to flooding in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   Although residents of the coastal counties were cleaning up and
assessing damage on Monday, the danger was just beginning for some
parts of South Texas where the remnants of the hurricane were
dumping up to a foot of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo residents braced for flooding on the Rio Grande, and
about 3,500 people on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border left
their homes for higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most Laredo businesses closed at 6 p.m., Laredo International
Airport and all three bridges linking the city to Mexico were shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush said state teams ``switched from hurricane
response mode to flood response mode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge all Texans in the affected areas to take the threat of
flooding seriously, to continue to pay close attention to this
storm, and to follow the advice and direction of local officials,''
Bush said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Seven South Texas counties already have been declared disaster
areas by President Clinton, and more counties were being hit by
torrential rains as the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm as
it moved slowly toward Laredo and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials were helping local authorities
determine the extent of the damage, and could recommend that
additional counties be added to the list, said Dave Bary, a
spokesman for the state emergency operations center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be extensive flooding, and after the
floodwaters recede there will be a significant amount of debris,''
he said. ``It's possible, given the amount of rain, that additional
counties could be added to the declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   Falfurrias, about 40 miles from the coast and in the direct path
of the storm as it moved ashore midway between Corpus Christi and
Brownsville across sparsely populated Kenedy County, damage was
evident.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gardendale neighborhood, children took advantage of
closed schools and knee-deep water to bike and run their dogs
through the flooded streets. Their parents picked up fallen
branches and urged passing trucks to go slow as their wake pushed
water too close to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses had reopened by lunch time yesterday, causing
some continued discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's dying,'' city employee Rudy Valverde said,
referring to a colleague on cleanup detail as they pulled into the
lot of a closed Whataburger. ``He needs a taco, quick.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bret's winds were below 40 mph Monday afternoon, officials
continued to worry about heavy rain. The cotton fields and pastures
from Robstown to Falfurrias are sodden or resemble little lakes,
prompting warnings of possible flash floods.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller towns near the coast, there was measurable
consternation about media reports, both on Corpus Christi radio
stations and national television networks, that stated that Corpus
Christi had escaped the brunt of the storm and only areas with few
people were hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard on the Weather Channel this guy say, `It's OK, there's
no population there,''' said Brooks County Sheriff Balde Lozano.
``I live here. I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, nobody lives here. We're not populated,'' Mary Ann
Williams said without prompting, voicing what apparently was a
common gripe on Monday in Falfurrias.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 34, said she hid in a closet during the worst of Bret,
as did Ovidio Saenz. Saenz, a 59-year-old truck driver, said he
spent nearly an hour in a closet with his girlfriend, trying but
failing to keep her calm in the pale light of a single candle.
</P>
<P>
   The storm felled scores of trees, which in turn knocked out 90
percent of the town's electrical service and much of its telephone
service. Possible contamination of the water supply led to a
citywide cutoff until laboratory tests prove the water was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falfurrias was among the areas hardest hit, property
damage was slight: gas station canopies collapsed all over town and
the El Cid Motel, along with a third of its roof, lost a crucial
letter in the storm and was involuntarily renamed the El id.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Regallado's personal loss. Destruction of his
manufactured house leaves him homeless as he fights a custody
struggle with his ex-wife, said the uninsured construction worker,
cataloging his woes, both man-made and act of God.
</P>
<P>
   But Regallado said he is fortunate to have escaped unharmed,
doubly so since his girlfriend and her brother warned him to seek
safer shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it's going to hit,'' said Damacio Villarreal, the
girlfriend's brother. ``So I said, `Hasta la vista, baby!' And
cleared out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not all doom and gloom in Falfurrias, even during the
storm. Aldalberto ``Tuffy'' Cruz, 62, said he participated in a
series of all-male kamikaze hurricane parties, where beer flowed
and chests were bared as the well-potted participants ran outside
and let themselves be lashed by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no fun staying inside,'' he said.

OFFICIAL WHO LED INQUIRY INTO CHINA'S REPUTED THEFT OF NUCLEAR
SECRETS QUITS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Notra Trulock, the Energy Department official who
led the initial inquiry into China's apparent theft of U.S. nuclear
secrets, said he resigned Monday in protest of what he described as
a long series of roadblocks from Clinton administration
policy-makers and other government officials to his pursuit of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Trulock, the Energy Department's acting deputy
chief of intelligence, complained Monday that he had been squeezed
out of the ongoing investigation of the case, code-named ``Kindred
Spirit,'' and that he was no longer allowed to participate in any
other significant work in the department's intelligence office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have moved me out from any participation in the Kindred
Spirit case, and from any other aspect of the management of
intelligence activities within the department,'' Trulock said.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock added that he had been thinking about resigning for
months because of what he said was political interference in the
espionage investigation. But he said he finally decided to quit
after the release earlier this month of a report by the Energy
Department's inspector general concerning the department's handling
of the spy case.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report found no conclusive evidence to
support Trulock's assertions that he had been temporarily blocked
from briefing Congress on the spy case in 1998. ``The IG report was
the last straw,'' Trulock said.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock has become a highly controversial figure within the
government because of his central role in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FBI started a criminal investigation into evidence
that China had stolen data about America's most advanced nuclear
warhead three years ago, no arrests have been made, and the
handling of the case by officials from the Energy Department, the
FBI and the Justice Department has become fodder for a series of
special inquiries by both Congress and the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock served as the catalyst for the public furor over the
government's handling of the case in part because of his decision
to become a secret witness late last year for a congressional panel
that investigated the allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock's charges that the government's investigation had been
slowed by interference from senior officials at the Energy
Department, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the White House
quickly became enmeshed in the national debate over the proper
course of U.S. policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
   But his accusations, strongly denied by the White House and
Energy Department, also prompted strong criticism of his own
handling of the case by current and former government officials. In
June, Trulock's criticism of a report issued by the president's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board on the spy investigation led to
a stinging response from Warren Rudman, the former senator who is
chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman wrote that Trulock was guilty of having ``misread
professional disagreements as personal affronts,'' and that he had
``misconstrued your obligation to be candid as a license for
calumny.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the former chief of counterintelligence at Los
Alamos, who himself has been disciplined for mishandling the
investigation, charged that Trulock and others had been responsible
for botching the case because they unfairly focused their attention
on a Chinese-American scientist from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock has denied that race was a factor in the decision to
investigate Wen Ho Lee, the Chinese-American scientist who was
fired from his job at Los Alamos in March for security violations.
Lee has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trulock has also had a mixed relationship with Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson. In May, Richardson gave him a special $10,000
award for having raised the alarm within the government about
China's theft of nuclear secrets, and praised Trulock for
persisting in the inquiry despite bureaucratic roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Trulock lost his job as chief of intelligence at
the Energy Department, and was demoted to acting deputy chief.
Richardson declined to respond to Trulock's written request earlier
this year to be reinstated as intelligence chief, and Trulock was
told this summer that he would also not be named permanent deputy
intelligence chief.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Richardson said Monday that ``he is disappointed
with Trulock's decision to leave the department.'' Richardson added
that he ``believes that Trulock performed valuable work,'' but that
he ``supports the inspector general's conclusions'' that angered
Trulock.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sanchez, the current chief of intelligence at the Energy
Department, said Monday that he had repeatedly offered to make
Trulock the permanent deputy of intelligence, but that Trulock had
declined to accept the post. And he added that Richardson declined
to make Trulock the chief of intelligence because that would have
meant firing Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been his protector, ensuring that his message was
continually being carried and ensuring that he was at every
congressional hearing on the case that he should have been at,''
Sanchez said. ``He was not actively being cut out of things. I knew
he was going to leave anyway, and we knew he was actively seeking
another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Trulock, who is taking a private sector job, said that he was
particularly angry that the Energy Department's inspector general
report stated that there was no conclusive evidence to prove that
Elizabeth Moler, then acting energy secretary, blocked Trulock from
briefing the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about
the nuclear spy case.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock had charged that Ms. Moler prevented him from briefing
the panel, and told him that congressional Republicans would only
use the information to attack President Clinton's China policies.
Ms. Moler has repeatedly denied Trulock's allegations, and Trulock
later did brief a special congressional panel that investigated the
nuclear theft.

IN NEW YORK, SOUP ISN'T SO HOT ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First there was ``Seinfeld,'' which, with one famous
episode, made it hip to stand in line for a $7 container of tomato
bisque.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the sandwich was passe. Office workers were tossing
off demands for midday mulligatawny. Little vellum bags filled with
cookie crumbs, and the occasional bruised banana, littered midtown
garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with shocking pink purses and pashmina shawls, food
trends, too, usually lose their steam. While there are still plenty
of places to buy a bowl of designer soup at noon, many who in
recent years chose soup as their business are falling on tough
times. Some have closed up entirely; others have scaled back their
growth plans. Most of the stronger players are learning that they
cannot live on soup alone, and are quickly moving to add other
items to their menus.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the classic retail foul-up _ overambition ignited
by early success _ has been their downfall. Daily Soup, for
example, one of the largest and best-known of the soup stands,
admits to opening too many stores too fast, losing control of some
of them and opening a few clunkers in bad locations.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is Soup Nutsy. Souperman closed its second location.
Souperdog just became Wrapsody, a wrap sandwich shop. Zoop Soup is
adding a deli, and Daily Soup and other stores are rethinking their
business plans.
</P>
<P>
   What soup sellers all realized is that soup is a very difficult
food to make money on. It is highly seasonal _ how much chicken
soup can a city eat in July? _ and most people are not willing to
eat it every day, even in the dead of winter. However high your
prices, you have to shovel a lot of split pea to pay the rent;
volume during the high season is essential to cover the hot months,
when the rent remains the same but sales dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered that the soup fad is fading,'' said Roger
Fields, who owns Wrapsody nee Souperdog. ``And when there is warm
weather, no one will eat it, which is very limiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Stands selling soup and soup alone as a meal _ save a piece of
fruit and a little confection _ was a New York trendlette, food
experts note. Daily Soup appeared to have mastered the concept, but
did not invent it. It all began with one Al Yeganeh, who has been
selling fancy soups for years from Soup Kitchen International, his
stand on West 55th Street. His churlish demands (customers must
move like lightning to the left after ordering or incur bitter
wrath) was parodied in a 1995 episode of ``Seinfeld,'' titled
``Soup Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode courted the ire of Yeganeh, but made his yummy soups
even more popular. And soon, copycats abounded.
</P>
<P>
   The most high-profile of soup-only stores is Daily Soup, which
started in 1995 with one store and now runs 10. At first, lines
formed out the door. People could not get enough of mushroom
barley, vegetable gumbo, Mexican cheese. The chain started to open
more stores at a breakneck speed. But problems ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we expanded too quickly,'' said Robert Spiegel, a part
owner and the chief executive of Daily Soup, where he said eight of
the stores make a profit. ``We are not in the red now, but we are
undercapitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the need to have high volume, problems associated
with overexpansion surfaced, he said. Managers did not inspect the
fruit that comes with a soup lunch, and often it was damaged.
Employees started to slice the bread too thick, cutting away at the
bottom line with every piece. The delivery area was over too many
blocks, so people across the street from the store were waiting a
half hour for orders. These problems have been addressed, Spiegel
said, and by ``going back to basics'' he expects to help the
company perform better now that the busy season is upon it.
</P>
<P>
   But many people in the food business say that soup as a
stand-alone lunch concept is perhaps ill conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soup is a great idea,'' said George Naddaff, chairman of
Franchise Concepts, which runs Ranch 1 chicken stores and aborted
its plans to acquire Soup Nutsy two years ago. ``But it cannot
stand on its own. There need to be other legs on the stool.'`
</P>
<P>
   Even soup fanatics concur. ``Even with 15 varieties, I can't eat
it all the time,'' said Michele Kreolin, an interior decorator, who
often goes to Hale and Hearty Soups. ``In the summer, I can't eat
it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, soup shops are finding the need to become, well,
sandwich shops. Mr. Soup, a store at One New York Plaza, sells
sandwiches and salads. Zoop Soup is opening an attached deli. And
Hale and Hearty Soups, a chain with eight locations, is quickly
adding other lunch items. ``If you don't evolve and hear what the
market is saying, you can't survive,'' said Andrew Schnipper,
president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Daily Soup is experimenting with a tossed salad station in one
of its stores, and is also going into the wholesale business with
dreams of selling fresh soup to gourmet stores.
</P>
<P>
   But competition awaits. ``It is a pretty crowded marketplace,''
said John Gottfried, a part owner of Gourmet Garage, an upscale
market with four Manhattan locations. ``We are always being
approached'' by potential suppliers. But soup stand prices _ which
can be prohibitive _ will not hold up in retail stores, he warned.
``In the retail setting, if we start trying to charge $6 for a pint
of soup it better have truffles in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeganeh, reached in Europe where he is on vacation, mocked the
troubles and strategies of others. ``I will never add anything!
Nothing! Not even a drink,'' he said. ``I charge high prices and I
am the original one. I was the best 10 years ago, before that clown
Seinfeld.'' Indeed, he fetches $25 for a quart of seafood bisque.
</P>
<P>
   Daily Soup charges anywhere from $5.50 for a 12-ounce container
of gazpacho, to close to $9 for a 16-ounce bowl of Tuscan shrimp
with white bean. It has a daily blue plate special that is cheaper,
and it now plans to discount its soups heavily after 4 p.m. But
high prices reign in the soup business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who don't understand why we charge
$7 for soup,'' sighed Dominque Drevet, co-owner of Souperman, which
sells soups around Wall Street. ``But we use fresh ingredients, we
go to the fish market, et cetera. But when people think soup, they
think cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Souperman has moved into sandwiches, and Drevet said that he
sells about 100 daily sandwich-soup combinations, which has helped
the business a lot. Still, Drevet, whose partner is the chef
Johannes Sanzin, said the two are already looking for their next
hot concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the end of the fashionable soup,'' he said.
``We are putting our minds to something else. Maybe breakfast.''

 &HT;    Sophomore QB to get start in OSU opener
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ For weeks now, Ohio State coaches have kept
copious statistics on their top two quarterbacks, Austin Moherman
and Steve Bellisari. They've charted every pass, every decision,
every mistake.
</P>
<P>
   When they added it all up this past weekend, Moherman, a
third-year sophomore from southern California, came out on top. He
will be the starter for the Buckeyes' season opener Sunday against
12th-ranked Miami (Fla.) in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real close but Austin has graded out ahead of Steve,
particularly in the last couple of scrimmages we've had in the
stadium,'' OSU coach John Cooper said. ``We think he deserves to
start in this first ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision brings to an end _ at least temporarily _ the
guessing-game of who will immediately replace record-breaking
quarterback Joe Germaine, now in the NFL. Bellisari will get his
turn, Cooper said, but it won't be a series-to-series job share
like Germaine and Stanley Jackson had two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going into this ballgame saying, 'Austin, you're
going to play the first two series, then Steve, you're going in,'
'' Cooper said. ``But I can tell you there's probably a good chance
that somewhere during the game Steve will go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Moherman (pronounced Mock-er-man), who last started a football
game as a senior at Capistrano Valley High School in 1996, learned
he'd be the No. 1 guy during a quarterbacks meeting Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprised would not be a word I would use,'' he said,
describing his reaction. ``But I felt happy with the decision,
obviously. I was pleased. I just have to go out there and do it on
the field now.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks coach Tim Salem said Moherman, 6-5, 215 pounds, won
the job because of his poise under pressure during practices and
scrimmages. His reads of the defense, his accurate throws, his
``poise in the pocket'' were what separated him from Bellisari,
Salem said. Everything else was close between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Moherman said he felt good after last Friday's scrimmage but
didn't know the coaches were leaning toward him. Bellisari, who
played on special teams as a true freshman last year, was surprised
the decision came this soon. He expected it later in the week, even
on game-day.
</P>
<P>
   But Salem said there was no need to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't many major mountains this week to evaluate them
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salem said he'll continue to treat both players like starters,
prepping them to be ready to enter the game at any time. He said
Bellisari will likely get his chance late in the first quarter or
early in the second on Sunday. If Moherman struggles significantly
before then, it could be sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not playing that good, then Steve deserves a chance to
play,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bellisari: ``I wanted to be the starter but I'll live. I
know I'm going to play in the game sooner or later. I just have to
be ready.''

   NEW YORK _ The batik boy left his favorite toys _ scuba gear,
golf clubs, even the trusty tennis racquet that helped him win the
last two U.S. Opens _ back home in Bermuda Monday. Plagued at just
the wrong time by chronic tendinitis in his serving shoulder,
Patrick Rafter was forced to use his left arm for all his heavy
lifting this week.
</P>
<P>
   After jetting to Manhattan for a day trip that fulfilled a
commitment to Reebok, the sponsor that dresses him like a surfer,
and pleased a few hundred shrieking girls at a Macy's autograph
session, Rafter said he still hoped to raise his racket next week
in time to successfully defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   Aching or not, the upbeat Australian promised he'd be back at
Arthur Ashe Stadium, site of his only two Grand Slam championships,
to try to become the first man since Ivan Lendl (1985-87) to win
three straight Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Will he play? No question. Can he win again? He has his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing best-of-5 sets, it's got to be pretty much 100
percent, or 90 percent anyway,'' Rafter said of his suspect
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder also pained him at the start of the 1997 Open.
``But I didn't feel it then after the second week,'' he said. He
feels it now, even when he sleeps, but ``even if it's worse than
this, I'll be playing the Open: I mean, that's too big a priority
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Rafter's possessiveness about this title, there's the
iron man streak of 26 consecutive Grand Slam events that he has
been compiling since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to miss this one,'' said Rafter, who failed to
pass the Open's third round on his first four visits to Flushing
Meadows. ``It would have been third on my list in terms of Slam
expectations. Sort of freaky to have won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter silenced his critics, notably John McEnroe and Pete
Sampras, by defying a one-Slam-wonder label and winning the Open a
second time last year despite entering it unconvinced of his
ability to defend his title. ``Last year, I would have said,
`Please don't put any money on me to repeat; there's no bloody
way,''' he said. ``But this year, I came in thinking I could win it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sampras, a four-time Open champion, and Andre Agassi, who
won his only Open in 1994, have put on a summer hardcourts clinic,
Rafter can't be counted out.
</P>
<P>
   After a sluggish start in 1999, Rafter reached the Italian Open
final on clay and went 10-1 on grass. His semifinal finish at
Wimbledon was his best ever, and he proceeded from there to a 10-2
summer hardcourts record that included Australia's dismissal of the
United States in the Davis Cup quarterfinals in Boston last month.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since Sampras burned a serve right through his racquet
strings during the first-set tie breaker of their Aug. 15 final at
Cincinnati, a 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 Sampras victory, Rafter's shoulder
hasn't stopped complaining. He tried to play in Indianapolis last
week but pulled out after the quarterfinals, then canceled this
week's title defense at the Hamlet Cup on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter said the week he spent at No. 1 at the end of July made
him hunger for more time at the top, a space Sampras has occupied
for a record 274 weeks. Rafter also said that knocking Sampras out
of last year's Open was among the most satisfying victories of his
career, but one he felt Sampras diminished by claiming a hamstring
pull.
</P>
<P>
   After sniping at each other in the news media, a feud began last
summer when Sampras disparaged Rafter's Grand Slam production after
losing to him at Cincinnati. And it escalated to the point where
headlines claimed they hated each other. Then last month, Rafter
put in a conciliatory call to Sampras. ``I don't like to be enemies
with anyone,'' he explained, adding that he was relieved when
Sampras responded in kind. ``I was sitting there sweating bullets
that he'd chew my head off.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rafter doesn't even hold a grudge against the 130 MPH. Sampras
serve that hurt his shoulder, shaking it off as an occupational
hazard _ one he'd prefer to avoid at the Open. ``Pete's probably
the No. 1 guy to beat,'' he said. ``But I'll be one of 128 guys
that says he's the one to beat. There are plenty out there to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   And that includes the ponytailed two-time defending champion.
Rafter commuted back to Bermuda Monday with his trainer in tow but
vowed to resurface at the National Tennis Center on Friday, three
days before the hunt for his title begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``To defend it, to try to do it three times in a row, that's
exciting,'' he said.

 &HT;    Packages to convicts won't get new limits for now
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Families and friends of Ohio convicts won at
least a temporary victory Monday, as state prison officials hit a
roadblock in their proposal to put new limits on packages that
inmates can get from home.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials agreed to go back to the drawing board after
the legislative Joint Committee on Agency Review expressed concerns
about the plan, which would reduce the allowable number of packages
from the outside world and could eventually eliminate such packages
and require inmates to order sundry items from a state-approved
vendor's catalog. The goal is to cut down on contraband smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only humane that they should be able to receive
things from home,'' said Brenda Hopfer, of Centerville, one of
several prisoner advocates who testified before the committee. She
and her husband, Kenneth, who also testified, are the parents of
Rebecca Hopfer, who is serving 15 years to life in the Ohio
Reformatory for Women in Marysville for killing her newborn baby in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates currently are allowed to receive four packages of
sundries, such as extra clothing items, and two packages of food
per year from approved visitors, such as family and friends. The
proposal would allow one to four packages a year, depending on an
inmate's security level. In-person visits and unlimited letters
would not be affected by the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermaximum-security'' inmates aren't allowed any packages,
and that wouldn't change.
</P>
<P>
   J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton, chairman of the committee,
said the committee balked because prison officials didn't analyze
the financial impact of the change on the prisons or inmate family
members. The committee also felt the proposed rule gave prison
officials too much latitude to set policy without legislative
review.
</P>
<P>
   James Guy, staff counsel for the Ohio Department of
Rehabilitation and Correction, said he believes officials will be
able to redraft the proposal to satisfy the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say the change is aimed at reducing the amount
of contraband such as drugs, weapons and gang-related clothing that
gets into Ohio prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to provide a safe and secure environment for not only
the inmates, but any visitors and for the prison staff,'' Guy said
before the committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They also say it would give officials the flexibility to change
the kinds of sundries allowed, or go to an all-catalog system.
Under such a system, families would send money and inmates would
order approved items from a catalog vendor specializing in prison
work. Several Ohio prisons are trying a no-packages-from-home
policy on a pilot basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're going to stop packages (from home) from
coming in, but it gives us the option of doing that,'' said
department spokesman Joe Andrews. He said ``we've seen people who
have ingenious ways'' of doctoring packages to smuggle contraband
past prison officials who fluoroscope, open and inspect them.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the proposal would unfairly punish all inmates for
the violations of a few, sever important family ties and cause
hardships on family members, who would no longer be able to shop
for bargains. They also say it would cause accounting nightmares,
and they dispute prison officials' position that no new staff would
be needed to implement the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broader concern is, this is part of a pattern of taking
more and more and more privileges away,'' said prisoner advocate
Jana Schroeder, of the American Friends Service Committee of
Dayton, a Quaker peace and justice group. She said the rule could
contribute to prison unrest.

A MISSION FOR TIBET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Qinghai poverty reduction plan would move 57,000 desperately
poor people from one of the most barren areas of China to a more
fertile area to the west. Viewed in strictly economic terms, as the
World Bank is doing, it makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   Daja Meston of Newton, Mass., and a companion traveled to China
earlier this month to encourage a broader examination of the
project in the context of China's campaign to eradicate Tibet as an
independent culture and replace it with dominance from Beijing.
Meston was seriously injured after being detained by police in
Qinghai Province last week. He should be released from China for
medical treatment, and his case ought to prompt renewed examination
of the Chinese threat to Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
   Qinghai, once called Amdo, was the northeasternmost province of
independent Tibet until Mao Zedong's Red Army conquered it in 1949.
Mao's troops completed their seizure of Tibet two years later, and
Tibetans have suffered ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Meston and his Australian companion, Gabriel Lafitte, were
accused of taking photos of a prison camp in Qinghai's Dulan
County, where the resettlement project would be located. These
camps are part of a network set up in China's arid west and north
to house those who did not fit into the society being constructed
by Mao's Communists. They are visible proof of Beijing's continuing
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   While the World Bank approved the Qinghai project in June, it
promised to release none of the $40 million until an inspection
team examines the impact on the environment and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bank said it is constrained by its charter,
which states that its purpose is the reduction of poverty. But
politics and poverty are often intertwined. Tibet has suffered
horribly under the Chinese, and so have the border lands, since Mao
treated the national economy as if it were a mad scientist's
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Meston has endured much. So, in all probability, have his
Tibetan guides, and without the help of foreign diplomats, their
fate may be far worse. They have raised a question that the World
Bank should not duck: Is it sensible policy to subsidize a campaign
that has resulted in the subjugation of the Tibetan people?

INNOVATION THROUGH INTEGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Integration: Does America need it? Looked at in strictly racial
terms, the integration struggle has produced some progress and lots
of battle fatigue. But seen in its fullest context, integration is
still a rich source of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A signal of complacency comes from a new survey on racial
attitudes. One question posits: ``It's OK if the races are
basically separate from one another as long as everyone has equal
opportunities.'' Agreeing with this statement were 52 percent of
white respondents and 40 percent of black ones. These weren't
prune-faced contrarians at the Bitter Waters Nursing Home but
rather 1,001 randomly selected 18- to 29-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's sponsors _ the NAACP and Hamilton College _ are
concerned that Americans seem too comfortable with segregation.
Current events are also damning. School desegregation has become a
limping cause. Integration's reach seems limited. It's fine to
prosecute discrimination, but who wants to be forced to go a party
where he or she hates the music and knows only two people?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, integration need not stand solely on the hazy _
and, to some, outdated _ assertion that it's good for us. Other
forces are at work. Integration is also a byproduct of the global
economy, the Internet, and increasingly sophisticated social
policies. Busing, for example, left Boston scarred. But Boston's
response to crime has shown that an integrated police force can get
along better with residents, and the streets can be safer.
</P>
<P>
   Racial segregation is easy to see. Behind it lurk less visible
forms of exclusion. Money matters far more than it should. Rural
areas are often ignored. Vulnerable neighborhoods are hurt by
poverty but also by segregation among and between city, state, and
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to settle, to cushion the status quo with good if
unfulfilled intentions. But integration _ building relationships,
projects, or mere conversations where they haven't been before _
yields great innovations.

   The three largest political parties have scheduled their first
presidential primary elections for this fall. Members of the
center-right National Action Party will pick their nominee on Sept.
12, even though only one candidate has registered for the
balloting: the Guanajuato governor, Vicente Fox. The center-left
Party of the Democratic Revolution has scheduled its vote for Oct.

   Six people were hurt when students supporting the 4-month-old

CROP BUSTERS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a big difference between caution and hysteria. Galloping
scientific progress demands that society exercise the first, but no
one is served by the second.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental extremists who destroy genetically altered crops,
supposedly to save the world, are not only breaking the law, as
they did last week at the University of Maine, but are stopping the
very research that can tell people about the risks of growing such
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that I find that farmers shouldn't be using this
crop,'' says John Jemison, water quality specialist at the
University of Maine's cooperative extension service. ``But I won't
know until I study it. The people responsible for this didn't even
want me to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Jemison's half-acre of corn, which was being tested in a weed
control project on university land in Old Town, Maine, was slashed
to the ground last week, and a group calling itself ``Seeds of
Resistance'' has claimed credit for the vandalism through a posting
on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The posting is full of misguided bravado, promising that the
Maine attack ``is the first in a series of actions'' and announcing
that ``there is absolutely no benefit to humanity'' in Jemison's
project.
</P>
<P>
   But Jemison was testing corn with a resistance to the herbicide
Roundup, which does not leach into ground water, soil, or plant
tissue as much as other weed killers do. The project, funded
primarily by university money _ the seeds were donated by a
subsidiary of Monsanto Corp. _ would have told farmers what sort of
yield they could expect.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the zealots, Jemison will have to start over next
spring. Such misdirected fear is prompting similar crop vandalism
in Europe, particularly in Britain, where protesters equate
genetically altered crops with mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with peaceful protest or with insisting
that troubling eco-questions be answered. But slashing an
experiment and attempting to stop science is the height of
ignorance.

LESLIE HAS PROVIDED THE SPARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The pressure and the expectations were there
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Los Angeles Sparks were convinced they
received the cornerstone of a successful WNBA franchise when Lisa
Leslie was assigned to them. Who better to take the team on title
runs than a former Olympian, All-American and national player of
the year?
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened, although it would be hard to blame Leslie.
She produced, but her team didn't: 14-14 in the innaugural season
and 12-18 last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to cause the 6-foot-5 center to question her
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating because I know that we had the
potential to do that on paper. It's just that we never played
together,'' Leslie said. ``It's different when you don't have the
talent, but we had talent and we had beaten everybody in the WNBA
both years, except last year we didn't beat Houston. It makes you
kind of question yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   After two coaching changes, the firing of a general manager and
the installation of a new defense, Leslie and the Sparks finally
are in the playoffs. They finished second in the Western Conference
and face the Sacramento Monarchs in a single-elimination game
tonight at 6 at the Forum. If they win, they will host two-time
defending champion Houston in the first of a three-game series
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While her numbers are down by almost four points and two
rebounds a game, Leslie's effectiveness is up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year my role has changed somewhat, but it's been a lot
happier than the last years,'' said Leslie, who's averaging 15.7
points and 7.9 rebounds, compared to 19.6 and 9.5 last season.
``It's a lot easier than feeling like I just have to score every
shot and force shots when I'm doubled and tripled in order for us
to get points.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams couldn't focus solely on Leslie because of former ABL
players DeLisha Milton (first-round draft pick) and La'Keisha Frett
(fourth round).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very tough, because being a marquee player, a lot is
expected of you,'' Milton said. ``She's criticized and always put
under a microscope. She's scrutinized for every little thing. I
think it takes one heck of a person or individual who can withstand
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Leslie's improved stats is 3-point shooting. This year,
she's 20 of 48 (42 percent). The past two years, she was a combined
30 percent (21 of 69).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely feeling more confident about that shot this
year, and I think not having to be the one to get all the rebounds
with DeLisha down there, I can afford to take that shot,'' Leslie
said.
</P>
<P>
   She has taken and made that shot much more since winning the
Most Valuable Player award at the inaugural WNBA All-Star Game on
July 14. The Sparks went on a six-game win streak, Leslie averaging
19.6 points during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised how you'd go to an All-Star Game and win
the Most Valuable Player award, what that does,'' Sparks coach
Orlando Woolridge said. ``It gives you a shot in the arm. I could
see it in her face. She came back with so much confidence after
that. Since that All-Star Game, it's like she has a new shot of
energy. There's no question about it. When she goes, so do we go.''

   NEW YORK _ A few years ago, in his office at 550 Seventh Avenue
_ amid the book-lined shelves, the bound volumes of Vogue and
Harper's Bazaar from the 1950s, the portraits of Diana Vreeland and
Marlene Dietrich, the bibelots, the awards and the beat and hum of
the midtown traffic _ Bill Blass was at his desk scanning another
magazine article about himself.
</P>
<P>
   He looked remarkably well-preserved considering that he was then
facing 75 and had spent a lifetime standing in Park Avenue drawing
rooms with his hands in his pockets, his jacket hooked up over
them, a cigarette dangling from his bored lips. Somewhere in his
impressionable Midwestern youth, he had acquired, along with the
rich tone of a foreign-service officer (Cary Grant in
``Charade''?), the habit of calling women ``babe'' or ``kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he could growl ``babe'' before telling a woman to do
something with her hair _ well, it had a curious effect. It added
to his sexual appeal, for one thing. There is no telling how many
men and women, especially women, have fallen in love with him, and
even harbored vain hopes of matrimony. But that is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Up in his office, Blass _ whose friends call him Blass or Willie
B. or, as the late designer Jacques Tiffeau did, ``Bilbo'' _ was
looking over the article with faint interest. It had a couple of
paragraphs about his Indiana childhood, how he went to the movies a
lot, followed by his senatorial thoughts on style. It seemed a
press agent's dream.
</P>
<P>
   He snapped the magazine shut and sent it skidding across the
desk. The most famous American designer of them all _ the first to
market his name in a big way, the first to break out of the old
Seventh Avenue formula, the first to see that style plus money
equaled a new kind of excitement _ turned out to be no open book at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he said, breaking into a boyish grin, adding that
he had been saying all that ``for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime fairly soon, Blass expects to sell his
$700-million-a-year company with its constellation of 40 licenses.
With such a deal, he would no longer be involved in the day-to-day
operations of the company, which he has owned exclusively since
1970, when he bought out his former partners at Maurice Rentner,
the dress house that had employed him beginning in the 1950s, and
formed Bill Blass Ltd. Blass, who has spoken often of retiring _ he
turned 77 in June _ said he expected to play a consulting role,
overseeing collections and making personal appearances to promote
the brand and its perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are eager for him to. ``We have trunk shows with Bill
in New York where he breaks $1 million in sales,'' said Philip
Miller, the president of Saks Fifth Avenue. Saks said that last
week in California, following Blass' 30th-anniversary benefit show
at Lake Tahoe, where the suntanned crowd included many San
Francisco clients and one lady who arrived by seaplane, Saks sold
$700,000 of his fall and resort clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill elects to stay in the game, we will have a big
business with him as far as I can see,'' Miller said, hoping to
avoid what happened after Adolfo shut his doors. ``We had a
wonderful, big-time business with him, but that business just went
away, and we were not able to capture the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, aside from the simple irony that it was Bill Blass who
helped put Adolfo into business with $10,000 of his own money, it
should be obvious to almost anybody that no designer has more
profoundly influenced American life. More than Ralph Lauren, more
than Calvin Klein or anyone else who came along later, he changed
the status of designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you've got to thank Bill Blass for making American
fashion respectable,'' said John Fairchild, the former chairman of
Women's Wear Daily. ``In the old days, the fashion designers were
chained to their back desks on Seventh Avenue. They never came out,
never were seen or heard from. They were just little characters who
did the work. And Bill made them respectable and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the era Fairchild was describing, the 1940s and 50s, Seventh
Avenue was a venal place. At some firms designers weren't allowed
to ride in the same elevator with their bosses. Blass started
changing things.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he had come back from the war, where he had served in
Europe with the 603rd Engineer Camouflage Battalion, an outfit that
also included the artist Ellsworth Kelly and George Diestal, the
Hollywood set designer, and whose job was to obscure the movements
of other troops by using decoys like inflatable rubber tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still very thin and blond and in my uniform,'' Blass
said of his return to New York. ``There was a whole cafe society
that was in its full glory. You went from El Morocco to the Blue
Angel to Monte Carlo to the 1-2-3. Nothing seemed to cost much in
those days.''
</P>
<P>
   But if New York was a swinging place, the upper reaches were
hardly open-minded toward dress designers _ even a good-looking one
with perfect manners and a posh accent. He rarely told people what
he did. ``If it came up,'' Blass recalled, ``I'd say something
offhand, like I worked in advertising.'' He added: ``I was always
much more comfortable in a heterosexual world than a homosexual
one. That in itself may have set me apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he met people like Missy Bancroft, a post-debutante
who modeled on Seventh Avenue; Chessy Rayner, then an editor at
Glamour, and Nicolas de Gunzburg, a socially-connected editor who
brought him to the attention of Mrs. Vreeland.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before she died last year, Mrs. Rayner said:
``He really got on the bandwagon early, by getting a certain woman
to wear his clothes. I'm not saying he went after them, but if they
came to him, he opened the door. Not just a crack, but all the way.
So he really got everyone in town wearing those dresses. The effect
was that people out in the sticks were dying to wear them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mrs. Vreeland went barreling into Maurice Rentner,
demanding to be taken into the back room to meet the young
blue-eyed Englishman she had heard so much about, Bill Blass had
already crossed that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if you want to talk about Claire McCardell or Bonnie
Cashin _ fine,'' Fairchild said, citing the obvious examples of
American ingenuity. ``But they never really caught on the way Bill
did. He did create American style. Norman Norell was a copy of
Chanel or Saint Laurent, and Galanos was pure European copy. But
Bill absolutely created a look that was strictly American.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other designers have done things that are more daring than
putting a camel's hair polo coat over a sequined dress, or a
cashmere twin set with a taffeta ball gown. A lot have made more
money. But no designer has spent his career working entirely within
an American ethos. It's as if everything Blass has done over the
last 50 years has been run through the same exquisite filter.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't confined to making clothes or useful connections with
socialites. You can see it in his homes, too, in the almost
ruthless way he has pared down his New York apartment and house in
Connecticut. Every piece is exceptional. ``But not one thing in a
room ever jumps out at you,'' his friend Nancy Kissinger said.
``It's an incredible feeling of calm.''
</P>
<P>
   One can think of any number of designers _ Ralph Lauren _ who
have influenced the field. But how many have done so purely on the
basis of their personal style? ``The important thing about Bill,''
the decorator Stephen Sills said, ``is that he is the only American
designer who has an original point of view about his interiors. He
isn't copying anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He started designing men's wear in the mid-1960s and made a
huge, splashy success of it. But the thing that really put Bill
Blass over was that he took his clothes on the road. He got to know
the social life of cities like Denver and Phoenix. ``Bill is a cult
figure,'' Nan Kempner said. ``There is the cult of Bill Blass from
one end of this country to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, he knew about Saturday night in America. He knew
about East Coast taste, the right plate and so forth. He knew about
the business of Seventh Avenue, the raving egos, but above all, how
much money could be made. Bill Blass wasn't at the intersection of
American fashion and society. He was the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet, hardly anyone has been able to do much more than describe
the parts. ``I can tell you that Bill has suffered his whole
life,'' said Tom Fallon, who worked for him for more than 20 years.
``He's been a great social success in New York. His success in the
fashion establishment has been a more tenuous affair.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Blass was up for a lifetime achievement
award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a group of
editors opposed him, arguing that he wasn't creative enough. But
Perry Ellis, who was then the organization's president, insisted,
Fallon recalled. Such slights were wounding, he added, but perhaps
none more so than the perception that Mrs. Vreeland, whom Blass
often escorted, had favored others over him in Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Bill took everything in stride,'' Fallon said. ``He
would give you the impression that a lot of the detail didn't
matter. It all mattered to him. And he could make you crazy
because, in the beginning, you thought he didn't care about these
little things. But he recorded everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Blass is someone whose savoir-faire and good looks, combined
with a dry wit, have helped to deflect attention away from himself.
Very few of his friends know, for instance, about his childhood _
his father's suicide when he was 5 _ or how the war years seemed to
liberate everything in him. When asked if she had ever asked Blass
about his Indiana years, Marguerite Littman, a friend in London,
laughed and said: ``Childhoods bore me. We're very close without
asking personal questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the American designers, Oscar de la Renta has had the
closest friendship with Blass, and he said: ``Bill is sort of a
silent friend. You know he is always there. In that sense, he is
one of the most solid people I know.'' But he added, ``If you want
to get something out of Bill, you have to fish very, very deeply.''
He could never learn, for instance, why Blass abruptly broke off
his friendship with Slim Keith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you Bill's personal life is practically verboten,''
Fairchild said. ``I think he's terrified of getting involved with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Blass, sitting one afternoon in his Connecticut house, laughed
when told of something Mrs. Rayner had said about his decorating
style. She said: ``It's not the most comfortable house in the
world. I mean, we've all discussed it. He gets a few comfortable
chairs and then the dogs sit in them.'' Asked to interpret, she
replied, ``I guess it says he doesn't like having too many people
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Blass smiled. ``Absolutely true,'' he said. ``Bravo for her to
have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   He did speak of what it meant to grow up in a small town, at the
height of the Depression, when things were left unspoken. ``There
was always a sense of something hidden,'' he said. ``And I've found
that this is certainly the guide to my own adulthood, my own life.
Really my own inability to relate to people in a very, very
personal level, and rarely do I.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, one got a picture of a good-looking man, just shy
of his 80th birthday, leaving all that behind and going East. He'd
probably laugh at that and say, ``It sounds like a million kids out
of Indiana, babe.'' Still, something set him apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of living is the talent to survive, and this guy is a
survivor,'' Tom Fallon said. ``You could go down the list of those
big talents _ whatever happened to ... ? And Bill Blass, Bill
Blass, Bill Blass has stayed.''

AN OLD-FASHIONED BRAWL AMONG OPTIONS EXCHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Facing new challenges from electronic trading systems
and regulatory inquiries into anticompetitive practices, the
nation's leading options exchanges opted Monday for an
old-fashioned market brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange fired the opening salvo Monday morning by listing options
of Dell Computer Corp., which for years had been traded exclusively
on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The two won huge market share
on the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange struck back by listing options
in Johnson &AMP; Johnson, IBM, Coca-Cola and Apple Computer _ stock
options that traded primarily or exclusively on the Chicago and
American exchanges. The Philex, as it is known, won back some
market share.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of options trading, the cross-listing battle
promises to shake up the nation's leading exchanges and prepare
them for competition from low-cost electronic trading systems that
some fear may steal away significant market share.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday the main exchanges said they were pleased with the
new competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new era in the options business,'' said William
Brodsky, the chairman and chief executive of the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, the world's largest options exchange. ``The
competitive juices are flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Chicago exchange that made the first move last week
by announcing that it would break the Philadelphia exchange's
stranglehold on Dell, one of the most popular options listings. A
day later, the American Stock Exchange, the No. 2 player in
options, said it, too, would list options in Dell.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, on the first day of trading, officials at the Chicago
exchange said it traded more than 59,000 contracts, about 37
percent of the market; they said Philadelphia traded 68,000, or
about 43 percent of the market, and the American Stock Exchange
traded 31,000, or 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trading in Dell was far higher than normal, officials at the
Chicago and Philadelphia exchanges said, but they attributed it in
part to increased competition and a strong earnings report from
Dell last week.
</P>
<P>
   There were rumblings, however, from traders in Philadelphia that
the Chicago traders were illegally ``painting the tape'' _ or
inflating volume by trading among themselves _ but officials at the
Chicago Exchange dismissed such notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because there's increased volume doesn't mean they're
painting the tape,''said Lynne Howard, a spokeswoman at the Chicago
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer Frucher, the chief executive at the Philadelphia exchange,
said that despite losing market share in Dell, the exchange had
kept its volume high and proved that its trading technology was
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Frucher said that Dell options had been shifted to the American
exchange's floor, but after a planned merger between the two broke
down, the options were returned to Philadelphia. He said Chicago
officials were trying to steal market share away because some
feared technology weakness in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks didn't send their order flow here because they
were worried about the technology,'' he said. ``That question was
answered Monday. For us it was a very successful day.''
</P>
<P>
   Frucher also said they won small market share gains in Apple,
IBM and Coke and gained a 50 percent share of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, a
smaller Chicago listing.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were brought about, in part, because of concerns
about the International Securities Exchange, an electronic trading
system that plans to trade in the 500 most active options beginning
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a year ago, I rallied the troops and said, `Do you
want someone to determine your future or do you want to act?'''
Brodsky said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the Justice Department has also been looking
into anticompetitive pricing on the exchanges, another factor that
seems to have pushed the exchanges into a more competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though Philadelphia has the most to lose because Dell options
make up about 30 percent of its business, Frucher said he was
confident. ``In the long run, Philadelphia will be stronger in a
multilisted trading environment,'' he said.

   ``SELECTED NON-FICTIONS'' &QL; 
By Jorge Luis Borges (Viking, $40) &QL; 
``The angels are two days and two nights older than we: The Lord
created them on the fourth day, and from their high balcony between
the recently invented sun and the first moon, they scanned the
infant earth, barely more than a few wheat fields and some orchards
beside the waters.'' With his essay ``A History of'' ``Angels,''
written in 1926, Borges rescues us from the tripe written on the
subject in recent years and leaves us to wonder whether Wim Wenders
read this before he made his haunting film about angels, ``Wings f
Desire.'' ``I always imagine them at nightfall,'' Borges writes,
``in the dusk of a slum or a vacant lot, in that long, quiet moment
when things are gradually left alone, with their backs to the
sunset, and when colors are like memories or premonitions of other
colors. We must not be too prodigal with our angels; they are the
last divinities we harbor, and they might fly away.'' This is the
third volume in Viking's centenary edition of Borges' work in
English, coming after ``Collected Fictions'' and ``Selected
Poems.'' Borges wrote thousands of pages of non-fiction _ essays,
book and film reviews, lectures, encyclopedia entries, historical
surveys and notes on politics and culture, and from them, editor
Eliot Weinberger chose 161 pieces. Most appear in English for the
first time. The rest were newly translated for this edition. Among
the films reviewed (albeit briefly _ as Weinberger notes, Borges
never wrote anything long) are ``King Kong'' and ``The Petrified
Forest.'' Among the books: William Faulkner's ``Absalom! Absalom!''
and Ellery Queen's ``The Door Between.'' It's a marvelous
collection, published to celebrate what would have been Borges'
100th birthday in late August. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HEARTWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By James Lee Burke &QL; 
(Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this novel is a bit busy _ to say that it's complex is to
give it too much credit _ but Burke is so much better than other
crime writers that he pulls it off anyway. From the first pages,
we're aware of his virtuosity, although that seems like an odd word
to apply to a man whose characters are world-weary moralists and
vicious schemers and whose setting in this new series (in wake of
his books about Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux) is a Texas hill town
called Deaf Smith. The hero is Billy Bob Holland, the former police
officer/Texas Ranger-turned-defense attorney, last seen in
``Cimarron Rose.'' In the early pages, Billy Bob suffers the return
to town of a rich man named Earl Deitrich, who long ago wooed and
married Peggy Jean Murphy, the local beauty who was Billy Bob's
high-school lover. Billy Bob is still hung up on Peggy Jean, and
she is still hung up on a boy who died in Vietnam _ both obsessions
that are difficult to believe as the book progresses. Their
attraction is further complicated because the cowboy Billy Bob
takes on as a client is accused of stealing $300,000 in bonds from
Peggy Jean's husband. More plot description would merely make you
dizzy _ suffice it to say that Burke makes all of his characters,
even the odd ones, as real as a Texas moon, and his setting becomes
a character in itself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING ON THE WIND: &QL; 
ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE &QL; 
WITH MIGRATORY BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Weidensaul &QL; 
(North Point, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thre are some shorebirds that fly non-stop from the southern tip
of South America to the coast of New Jersey _ a trip that takes 10
days, an astonishing 240 hours of uninterrupted flight. And there
are Arctic terns that each autumn fly across the Atlantic to
Europe, then south along Africa to recross the Atlantic toward
South America, finally wintering off of Antarctica. In spring,
writes the author, ``they reverse course, moving up southern Africa
and lancing back to Canada _ a figure eight inscribed on half the
globe, a track that returns them, often as not, to precisely the
same sheltered nook where they nested the summer before.'' Is there
anything more miraculous, more ethereal, more mysterious than the
epic migrations of birds? Weidensaul explores the process with
eloquence, meticulous research and considerable reverence _ and it
does not hurt that his subject is rife with fantastic facts. Did
you know that there are hummingbirds that cross the Gulf of Mexico
twice each year and tiny warblers that fly non-stop from New
England to South America? Did you know that albatrosses leaving the
nest might pass the next four years without touching land?
Weidensaul spent more than six years researching his book,
traveling 70,000 miles by plane, car, boat, horse and foot _ and
yet, he says, he covered fewer miles than a sandpiper would in its
short lifetime, propelled only by muscle and the instinct to trace
those invisible pathways in the sky. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DAYS OF INFAMY &QL; 
By Michael Coffey  &QL; 
(Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A companion volume to the History Channel's documentary
``Military Blunders,'' this is a survey of mistakes that had
terrible consequences. If the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's chauffeur
had asked directions in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, he would not
have taken the wrong turn that led to the archduke's assassination.
If the captain of the Lusitania had steered in a zig-zag pattern as
advised, he might have avoided the torpedo that sank the ship and
drew America into World War I. If naval commanders had not
underestimated the threat of air power, the British would not have
suffered the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse, two of their
finest ships. If German fliers attempting to destroy oil tanks on
the English coast had not lost their way and bombed the outskirts
of London instead, orders (on both sides) to avoid populated areas
might have stood, saving civilian lives during World War II. You
like war stories? Coffey has war stories, and they prove just how
slender the thread of fate can be. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A Cabinet minister asserted Monday that the
government's response to last week's earthquake was ``a declaration
of bankruptcy for the Turkish political and economic system.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu was a sharp
departure from the defensive tone that officials had been using.
His comments, and others Monday, suggested that at least some
senior political leaders share the bitterness and anger felt by
many earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``All ideological arguments were flattened by the earthquake,''
Mumcu said in a speech in Ankara. ``Lying under the ruins is the
Turkish political and administrative system.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Parliament from a district near the earthquake zone,
Ibrahim Yasar, was equally forceful in expressing frustration with
the government's response to the quake, which has been widely
criticized as slow and disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying that the civil defense organization
collapsed,'' Yasar said. ``It did not exist. I saw that there was
not the slightest bit of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even President Suleyman Demirel, who telephoned a newspaper
editor during the weekend to complain about what he said was
negative coverage of the government's relief effort, seemed
chastened Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell my people that there will be better
coordination among state institutions,'' a grim-looking Demirel
said after emerging from a meeting with seismologists in Istanbul.
``Foundations of buildings will be reviewed. We will follow
movements under the earth more carefully. We will build structures
that can resist earthquakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirel rarely apologizes for anything, and usually portrays the
Turkish state as sacred and all but infallible. His customary
attitude reflects a widespread sense among Turks that attacking
government institutions is dangerous and unwise. Among political
and military leaders in general, self-criticism is an exceedingly
rare quality.
</P>
<P>
   The government's faltering response to the quake has infuriated
many Turks. More than a few victims seem to have lost much of their
respect for the ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I have seen such rage against the state
and politicians,'' one news commentator wrote in a column Monday.
Another wrote: ``It is very clear that after this earthquake,
Turkey will never again be the same. The millennium came to Turkey
a year before other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all government officials have softened their views.
Health Minister Osman Durmus has ridiculed those who have called
for his resignation because of positions he has taken in the days
since the earthquake last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Durmus, a member of the right-wing Nationalist Action Party, has
asserted that Turkey does not need medical aid from the United
States, that Turks should not accept blood donated by Greeks, that
sending portable toilets to the earthquake zone was unnecessary
because there were sanitary facilities in many mosques and that
foreigners should not be allowed to deliver relief aid because they
``do not suit our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He also scorned Turkish volunteer groups that appeared in
devastated towns long before government workers, saying they were
``putting on a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with growing calls for his resignation, including one in a
newspaper editorial headlined ``Shut Up and Go,'' Durmus replied at
a news conference Monday, ``I take being called ignorant and racist
as a compliment, and thank them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest death toll from the quake, reported Monday by the
official crisis center, was 12,148. One U.N. official in Geneva
said he had received a message from the Turkish government on
Sunday night asking for help in obtaining 45,000 body bags,
suggesting that officials fear the toll could rise much higher.

   In what some relief workers described as a near-miracle, Turkish
and Israeli teams found a 4-year-old boy Monday beneath the
wreckage of his home in the hard-hit town of Cinarcik. He was
rescued at midmorning after having survived for six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Turkish team discovered him, and they screamed for us to
come and help,'' one of the Israeli rescuers, Noam Amit, said in an
interview with Israel Radio. ``We heard the baby calling out, and
then we called back through a hole in the rubble. The Turkish team
called out to him in Turkish to come closer to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The child, identified by the Israeli army as Ismail Cimen, was
rushed to a hospital in Istanbul and was expected to survive.
Rescue specialists said small children can sometimes survive under
rubble longer than adults because they dehydrate less quickly and
need less air and space.

</P>
<P>
   The Turkish military, which has been criticized for reacting too
slowly to the quake, continued to expand its role Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hayri Kivrikoglu, a senior commander assigned to help
direct military operations in the disaster area, said troops would
set up 500 tents in the devastated area each day for the next 10
days. He said every site would be equipped with running water,
toilets, electricity and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large extent, the search and rescue operations have now
ceased,'' Kivrikoglu said. ``There are cases of theft, but we have
increased guard and patrol duties. We are not allowing people to
wander the streets after midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain fell on parts of the earthquake zone Monday, creating
new health problems in towns where sewage systems have been
destroyed. Doctors and medical technicians were told to watch for
signs of epidemic disease, but have found none yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The correct response is the provision of clean water,'' said
Erik Noji, an official of the World Health Organization, ``and
there is plenty of clean water there.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that Aug. 30, a national holiday that
celebrates a key victory in Turkey's independence war, would be
celebrated this year as a day of commemoration for earthquake
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The interior ministry ordered night clubs to control the volume
of their music for the next 45 days, and to avoid creating ``the
image that there is a great deal of enjoyment or entertainment.''

SEMTECH UPBEAT ON EARNINGS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Nearly a year after the Asian crisis battered
semiconductor maker Semtech Corp., the firm based in Newbury Park,
40 miles northwest of Los Angeles,is on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it expects to beat analysts' projections in
its earnings report for the quarter that ended Aug. 1, which will
be released after the close of markets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. is 31
cents per share. Last year, the company reported second quarter
earnings of 24 cents a share on revenues of $24.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has already experienced a stunning
turnaround, rising from a low of around $10.375 last year to a high
of $70.75 this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've come back quite nicely since the correction of 1998,''
said Arun Veerappan, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan said Semtech has benefited from the booming demand for
switches and regulators for under-$1,000 computers, where the firm
has a relatively high market share, and for voltage suppression
products that protect circuits from voltage surges.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan estimated the company would announce earnings of 31
cents a share for the second quarter on revenues of $35.7 million.
For the year ending in January 2000, he estimated earnings of $1.29
a share on revenues of $149 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced July 28 that it would beat analysts'
forecasts for the quarter ending Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Semtech shares closed at $68 Monday, up 50 cents on
lower-than-average trading volume.

STORM PULLED ITS PUNCH, AS IT MOVED INLAND IN RURAL TEXAS  
(DW)

   SARITA, Texas _ If there is such a thing as a perfect spot for a
hurricane to come ashore, Kenedy County might be it. The flat,
green pastures are filled with wild oaks and mesquite instead of
shopping centers and subdivisions. There is not a store, restaurant
or gas station in this county called home by only 460 people.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are one of those 460, perfect is not the right word
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all make jokes about it,'' J.A. Garcia, a county judge,
said inside the darkened county courthouse as a thunderstorm
crackled overhead Monday afternoon. ``There are people who are
living here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Hurricane Bret slowly pushed ashore onto the
South Texas coastline, people awoke to find most buildings still
standing and lives spared; not a single fatality or serious injury
was reported. Initially compared in its potential for destruction
to Hurricane Andrew, this storm picked a path as if it were trying
to avoid people, grinding steadily through the vast ranch lands
halfway between Brownsville and Corpus Christi as it was downgraded
to a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials were still cautioning Monday that flooding
was possible as the storm moved inland and stalled near Laredo,
dumping heavy amounts of rain. Federal officials closed the three
bridges over the Rio Grande as a precautionary measure, blocking
traffic on both sides of the border. Sporadic flooding was reported
in some Laredo neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm moving well inland from the South Texas coast,
city officials in Corpus Christi began allowing evacuated residents
to return home late Monday. About 30 miles to the south, more than
16,000 people remained without power, many of them in Kingsville,
as utility workers struggled to restore electricity. Yet for a
region that has not endured a major hurricane in more than 20
years, the fears that prompted thousands of people to evacuate the
coast were replaced by relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky, man,'' said Sam Delarosa, the kitchen manager
of Snoopy's Cafe, located on Padre Island, the barrier island
stretching down the coast. ``Very, very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials had warned that a tidal surge of 12 feet could cause
flooding inland as well as tremendous damage to the low-lying
barrier islands. But the tidal surge apparently never happened.
From Port Aransas as far south as Malaquite Beach on the Padre
Island National Seashore, the damage was light. ``That tide hasn't
gone up more than a foot or two, and the wind must have just blown
all that water back out into the Gulf,'' Delarosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind his desk inside the Kenedy County Courthouse,
Sheriff Rafael M. Cuellar Jr. offered his own theory of why the
storm weakened as it came inland: trees. Kenedy County _ which has
nearly a million acres of pasture land, much of it divided between
the Kenedy Ranch and the King Ranch, the two largest ranches in
Texas _ is covered in oaks, mesquite and cactus, which, the sheriff
said, absorbed the storm's power like a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   The terrain is so desolate, and so stultifying in the summer,
that illegal immigrants walking through the pastures north toward
Houston often succumb to the elements in Kenedy County. Last month,
Cuellar said the bodies of four illegal immigrants were found in
the brush dead from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The isolation infuses every aspect of life in Kenedy County.
With the closest convenience store a 5-mile drive from Sarita, the
county seat, the sheriff said people become accustomed to living
apart from the modern world. ``Anybody who wants a Coke has to come
up here and get it from the courthouse,'' the sheriff said, nodding
toward the drink machine.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But when people learned of the approaching storm, many of them
sought shelter. Most of Sarita's 200 residents gathered in the
local Roman Catholic church or schoolhouse. In the early hours
Monday morning, the storm's worst winds tore through Sarita and
Falfurrias, about 25 miles to the west, uprooting trees and downing
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad,'' said Cuellar, although he noted everyone in the
shelters got along. ``They all knew each other,'' he said. ``More
than half of them are related. You don't have problems like in big
cities where they don't want to be close to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Genho, vice president for livestock for the King Ranch,
said the 825,000-acre ranch lost about 25,000 acres of cotton and
suffered extensive damage to trees and various buildings and
windmills. He said the Norias division in the Ranch in Kenedy
County, absorbed the full brunt of the southern eye of the storm.
``We were extremely blessed,'' Genho said. ``I have been in a lot
of hurricanes having lived in Florida most of my life. When you get
a Class 4 hurricane, that's scary anywhere. There's a lot of
potential for damage.''
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse in the afternoon, sheriff's deputies returned
after canvassing the county for damages. They had seen many downed
trees, but everyone agreed it could have been far worse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All of that was good news for Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need most is to go to sleep because I haven't slept in
two nights,'' he said.

DISNEY SETTLES BENEFITS DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co., averting a potentially
embarrassing legal spat with 3,800 longtime employees, has agreed
to settle a dispute over medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal ends a five-year fight that began when the
entertainment giant decided to change its policy that gave 20-year
employees free medical coverage for life once they reached the age
of 62. In March, a federal judge in Los Angeles gave class-action
status to a lawsuit accusing Disney of illegally charging for
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a very good settlement, especially
considering that many other companies are eliminating these kinds
of benefits,'' plaintiff's attorney William T. Payne said Monday.
``We had a meeting of plaintiffs in Florida this morning, and
people seemed to be very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said lawyers for both sides expect to file a joint
settlement motion next month in federal court. ``The judgment could
be effective in February if everything goes smoothly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was sparked by a 1994 decision by Disney to boost the
age eligibility for free coverage to 65; in 1995, it began charging
premiums unless the employees and retirees joined a health
maintenance organization. Payne said changes in the medical plans
led to a typical couple paying $1,023 in annual premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Disney contended its contracts allowed it to impose charges when
the costs of coverage increased, but the employees insisted Disney
managers had been explicit in their pledge of free coverage for any
employee meeting three conditions _ 62 years of age, 20 years of
service and 30,000 hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and the plaintiffs reached a tentative settlement on the
suit in late 1997 but that deal collapsed amid accusations Disney
had planned to make additional changes not specified in the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said the new settlement calls for reducing the annual
premium for a typical couple to $102 and returning premiums paid
since the plans were changed. Maximum out-of-pocket expense for a
family was boosted from $1,500 to $2,100 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also covers employees who had worked for 20 years
for Disney but had not retired when the changes were made. That
group will be paid $4,500 each and have company-paid Medicare
supplemental insurance for five years.

 &HT;    Bret dwindles to tropical storm after leaving surprisingly
little aftermath
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thousands of people along the Texas coastline
were forced to find shelter inland. Still more in a vast area of
South Texas lost electrical power. Laredo had to shut down three
international bridges and its airport. And runoff could spread an
outbreak of dengue fever, a tropical disease carried by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Hurricane Bret and its progeny, Tropical Storm
Bret, had caused surprisingly little damage to life and property by
Monday evening. Relief was palpable, from the state's emergency
operations center 40 feet underground in North Austin to the
wide-open brush country south of Corpus Christi and north of
Brownsville where the storm swept in from the Gulf of Mexico on
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Bret kicked a field goal. It went right between
Brownsville and Kingsville where there is plenty of open space,''
said Kingsville Mayor Phil Esquivel.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries or deaths. The storm tore off
some roofs in Falfurrias and caused minor flooding along the Nueces
River north of Corpus Christi. It threatened to cause more serious
flooding Monday evening and this morning as it drove west toward
the Rio Grande at Laredo. Up to 12 inches of rain was expected to
fall between Laredo and Eagle Pass. As much as 24 inches fell in a
24-hour period in a narrow band of ranch country along U.S. 77 in
Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
   Bret turned out to have more feather and less whip for several
reasons. Foremost was its fortuitous landfall, at perhaps the most
lightly populated stretch of coastline anywhere in the nation, said
Tom Millwee, director of emergency management for Texas. Fewer than
500 people live in Kenedy County, where Bret drove ashore after
first touching down on Padre Island, a barrier island with little
development in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bret was rather compressed as hurricanes go,
meaning that its high-velocity winds did not stretch too far from
the eye. Also, Bret lost horsepower abruptly just before and after
landfall, quickly dropping to 80 miles per hour from a peak of 140
mph. And prompt warnings by the National Weather Service, coupled
with evacuations organized by local and state officials, ensured
that many people got out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these were factors that worked in our favor,'' said
Brad Gair, the coordinating officer assigned to Bret by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in response to a request by Gov. George W.
Bush, declared seven coastal counties eligible for limited federal
disaster assistance. Under Clinton's declaration, the federal
government will pay 75 percent of the cost of debris removal and
emergency protective services incurred by state and local officials
in Aransas, San Patricio, Nueces, Kenedy, Kleberg, Cameron and
Willacy counties.
</P>
<P>
   State officials were still hoping for an additional declaration
from the White House that would provide assistance to individuals,
including temporary housing, replacement of appliances and
out-of-pocket expenses. Federal officials said Monday that damages
were still being assessed and that no overall dollar estimate of
damages had been calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Bret, downgraded from hurricane to tropical storm at 8 a.m.
Monday, now poses primarily a flooding hazard, said Jack Colley,
the state's assistant director of emergency management. Swift-water
rescue teams, high-clearance vehicles and rescue aircraft were
being stationed in Laredo and other South Texas cities in
anticipation of floodwaters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop a storm, but at least you can lessen the
impact,'' Colley said during a briefing at the emergency center at
Texas Department of Public Safety headquarters in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   It could be days before electrical power is fully restored.
Three of four major power lines serving the lower Rio Grande Valley
were knocked out of service. Central Power &AMP; Light Co. estimated
that as many as 60,000 customers lost power in scattered areas,
including Corpus Christi, Kingsville, Falfurrias, Port Aransas,
Rockport, McAllen, Mission, Edinburg and Weslaco. By 5 p.m. Monday,
the damaged main lines had been repaired and power was restored to
all but about 10,000 customers, said Jessica Mahaffey, a
spokeswoman for the utility. Crews were working house by house to
repair transformers and power lines in numerous neighborhoods, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials worried that rain and flooding could cause additional
power outages as the storm moves west toward Laredo, Eagle Pass and
Del Rio. It was in Del Rio on Aug. 23 and 24 of last year that 18
inches of rain caused deadly flooding and extensive property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bret's damage, at least so far, has been fairly minor.
</P>
<P>
   The King Ranch in Kenedy County reported downed trees but no
livestock losses on one of the country's largest cattle operations,
founded in 1853 by riverboat captain Richard King. Ranch President
Jack Hunt said all 300 people who live and work on 825,000 acres
tending 60,000 head of cattle were evacuated before the storm hit.
The cattle were left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``About all you can do is open the gates and make sure the
cattle can go where they need to go,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   In Port Aransas, a vacation community, Francis Stokes used a
squeegee to push about two inches of water out of the Value Bank
Texas branch Monday morning. The bank, in a strip center on Tarpon
Street, was dark and without power. Most of the 3,000 residents of
Port Aransas had evacuated Saturday night or early Sunday,
including Stokes, who stayed with friends in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too bad. We just got some water inside,'' said
Stokes, sweating through a brown T-shirt and gray shorts.
``Everyone's breathing a sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, the seat of Duval County, Ruben Valadez saw an
example of Bret's power. High winds scraped the tin roof off the
Plaza Alcala, the festival grounds across the road from his uncle
and aunt's house on Garcia Street. The sheet metal smashed against
the house and the one next door and hung like crumpled tinfoil onto
the eaves. The flying debris split a wooden power pole and tipped
it into the roof, poking a hole that leaked rain into the living
room of his uncle and aunt's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky the damn thing didn't go in and knock the house
down,'' Valadez said. ``Thank God they were in the back of the
house.''

WILY, PATIENT DEFENSE WINS FIRST GAME OF CHESS MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT BYRNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first game of the International Chess Federation's world
championship match on Sunday night, Alexander Khalifman defeated
Vladimir Akopian in a slow, tense demonstration of ingenious
defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Akopian went for a breakthrough and saw it powerfully
countered, he evidently despaired of pulling out the game by normal
means and gave up a knight for two pawns to make winning difficult
for his opponent. But Khalifman painstakingly broke down his
resistance with fine technique and won after a marathon of almost
six hours.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 3{ points to decide this six-game series at Caesar's
Palace in Las Vegas, so any loss has to be taken as a serious
setback. Akopian is aware that his opponent could possibly become
champion with a skein of draws.
</P>
<P>
   In a hypermodern English Opening, Akopian staked a claim to
queenside space with 3 b4 but delayed direct contact with the
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Unhindered, Khalifman seized central terrain with 6 ... e5 and
after 7 d3 cleared his king knight out of the way with 7 ... Nh5,
preparing to seize more kingside space with 8 ... f5. His plan was
to attack the white king as soon as it castled kingside.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 e4, it was too early for Khalifman to begin kingside
operations with 11 ... f4 because Akopian could have countered with
12 d4. Instead, he gave himself queenside space with 11 ... c5, to
anticipate his opponent's maneuvers there.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian pounced on that by opening lines with 12 bc bc, hoping
to damage the black queenside pawn structure with 13 c5, the point
being that taking the pawn with 13 ... dc? lets White get in 14 Na4
with a double attack on the c5 and e5 pawns. If 14 ... Qc7, then
comes 15 Nc5 and Akopian is sitting pretty with an advanced knight
outpost at c5 and a target in the isolated c6 pawn.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian must have underestimated Khalifman's counterthrust with
13 ... d5! 14 ed cd 15 Qb3 e4! Perhaps Akopian was hoping for 15
... Be6?, which was to be hit by 16 Ng5. Instead, he was staring at
16 de fe 17 Nd2 Ba6 18 Re1 Rb8 19 Qa3 Bd3 and feared Khalifman's
aggressive center. So, with 17 Ne4 Bb2 18 Qb2 de 19 Ng5 Bf5 20 Ne4
Rb8 21 Qc3 Nd5 22 Qa3, he chose to put up a battle with only two
pawns for a knight.
</P>
<P>
   But after 26 c6, he made a brave fight of it with his advanced
c6 pawn, which tied the black forces to defense. His bishop was
able to give the pawn long-distance support and held Khalifman's
knights at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in the unwinding process was the firm blockade
with 29 ... Rc7. The second step was to exchange rooks with 35 ...
Rf6 36 Rf6 Nf6. The third step was to play 44 ... Qd6, threatening
to break into the white king position with 45 ... Qf4 and thus
forcing the exchange of queens with 45 Qa3 Qa3 46 Ra3.
</P>
<P>
   Once Khalifman's king and knights got into the battle with 52
... Nd4, Akopian could no longer offer serious resistance. When the
c6 pawn fell to 54 ... Nec6, his situation further deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   After 57 ... Nc2, Akopian gave up in the face of 58 g5 Kf7 59
Re4 Ne3 60 Kf2 Nf1 61 Kf1 Ra3 62 Re2 Nd5 63 Rf2 Ra4, winning one
pawn after another.

 SUEZ LYONNAISE TO BUY U.S. WATER-MANAGEMENT BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A brawl between two giant French utilities for a piece
of the fast-growing U. S. water-treatment market intensified Monday
when Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux SA agreed to buy a leading American
water-management business for $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Suez's deal for United Water Resources Inc. is the latest in a
spree of American purchases by the French company and strengthened
its hand against Vivendi SA of France, Suez's main rival.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes at a time of rapid change in the water-management
business in the United States, where towns and cities are now
contracting out what were formerly municipal water services to
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is an emerging market for water, and that's
great'' for companies like Suez, said David Marcus, an asset
manager at Franklin Mutual Advisers, a large mutual fund company
that holds shares in Suez.
</P>
<P>
   The French company had owned 33 percent of United Water
Resources, and under terms of the acquisition announced Monday it
will acquire the rest for $1 billion, or about $35 a share. Suez
will also assume $800 million in United Water Resources debt.
</P>
<P>
   United Water Resources shares rose $2.4375, or 7.8 percent, to
$33.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on news of the deal. Suez
shares fell 1.8 percent to 154.1 euros, in Paris, while Vivendi
rose 1.5 percent, to 70.7 euros.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Suez acquired Nalco Chemical Co., water treatment
specialists in Naperville, Ill., for $4.1 billion. Earlier, Suez
acquired Calgon Corp., a Pittsburgh water company.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said Suez paid a ``very full price'' for United Water
Resources but commended the purchase, saying it would make Suez's
corporate structure easier to understand by consolidating its
ownership of affiliates. Suez has been moving quickly to acquire
all the shares of companies it had partly owned, in an effort to
attract investors by simplifying its balance sheet. Earlier this
month, Suez paid almost $9 billion to acquire shares it did not
hold in Tractebel SA, Belgium's largest utility, and Sita SA,
Europe's largest waste-management group.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Mestrallet, Suez's chief executive, said that combined
with the acquisition of Nalco and Calgon, Suez's move Monday
``further strengthens its position in the U.S. industrial and
municipal water-services market.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would enable Suez to ``grow more efficiently and more
rapidly'' in the United States, which he described as ``the
fastest-growing market in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Suez's existing stake in United Water Resources is rooted in a
large share it had held in General Water Works, which merged in
1994 with Hackensack Water Co. to form United Water. The company,
based in Harrington Park, N.J., provides water- and waste-treatment
services to 7.5 million people in 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Correll, United Water's chief executive, said Monday's
deal would have ``no immediate impact on rates'' for water
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   United Water has enjoyed major successes over the last year or
so, signing waste-water treatment contracts with the cities of
Milwaukee and Indianapolis last year. This year it reached an
agreement with Atlanta to operate the city's entire water system,
including water treatment and distribution and waste-water
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But most of this activity has come in the nonregulated rate
market, which is increasingly attractive to private companies.
Correll said consolidation was coming rapidly among the 58,000
water systems in the United States, but that the market was growing
``very competitive.'' The Suez deal, he said, would afford United
Water ``the financial firepower'' for further moves.
</P>
<P>
   Correll said that 85 percent of the U.S. population continued to
be served by municipal water companies, and roughly 95 percent of
waste-water treatment remained in municipal hands, and that many of
those services would be transferred to private contractors in
coming years. Last year, United Water's revenue in the nonregulated
rate market totaled $101 million, roughly double the amount the
year before, and next year, the company's revenue in this category
is expected to reach $160 million. ``We are growing far in excess
of the market,'' Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   Mestrallet has been under pressure to bring growth to Suez,
which was formed in 1997 by the merger of Compagnie de Suez and
Lyonnaise des Eaux. Back then Mestrallet pledged to build up Suez's
energy-, water- and waste-management businesses, and United Water
has become the vehicle for growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mestrallet's drive has been in response to an enormous offensive
by the French market leader, Vivendi, and its chief executive,
Jean-Marie Messier. Earlier this year, Vivendi, which was formerly
known as Compagnie Generale des Eaux, made a major move into the U.
S. water market, acquiring the U.S. Filter Corp. in a deal worth
$7.9 billion.

 &HT;    Old rut for big road machine
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The wild-card contending Cincinnati Reds, who are
baring down on the Houston Astros in the NL Central with the best
road record in the majors, have stalled out at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves beat the so-called big road machine 6-2 Monday night
in the opener of a three-game series, dropping the Reds to 0-4 this
season at Turner Field and 2-11 since it opened in 1997. The Reds
will have to win the next two to take their first series in Atlanta
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have been a much better team since getting swept here
in late April and early May, but the Braves wouldn't let them show
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stole a season-high seven bases, Brian Jordan
collected his 100th RBI, Andruw Jones extended his hitting streak
to 11 games and Chipper Jones took care of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones put on an early offensive exhibition against the
struggling Brett Tomko, hitting his 33rd home run on an
opposite-field drive to left in the first inning, then pulling a
double past first base in the third as he drove in three of the
Braves' first four runs on the way to an early 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves swept three games from the Padres over the weekend
without a ball leaving the yard. Chipper Jones took care of that
34-inning homerless stretch, which matched the Braves' longest of
the season, with his two-run shot in the first inning, giving the
Braves a 2-1 lead. That brought him to the brink of his career high
in home runs, set last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone set Jones up by reaching base twice in his first two
at-bats on a hit and an error, and scored two runs against his
former team in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood (14-7) went heavy on the fastball and had it
working well enough for his second win in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   He used a couple nice plays by Andruw Jones to survive a rocky
first inning in which he fell behind 1-0, and after that settled in
nicely. He allowed only an infield hit to Barry Larkin on a
grounder bobbled by Chipper Jones over the next four innings before
Michael Tucker cut the lead to 4-2 on a home run. That's five
consecutive starts in which Millwood has surrendered a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko, the Reds' opening-day starter and a minor-league pitcher
a month later, is back on the big-league job barely, with Steve
Parris ready to come off the disabled list and make a claim for his
spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko walked five and allowed six runs, giving him 19 runs
allowed in his last 23 1/3 innings.

 &HT;    Turkish earthquake: Surviving family members and lost kin flown
homeBy Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Friends and loved ones will say good-bye Friday to the
four young victims from Marietta, Ga., who perished in last week's
Turkish earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for the four Kilic children _ Jeffrey, 6;
Jennifer, 5; David, 2; and Katie, 9 months _ will be held at noon
at Mount Vernon Baptist Church, where the family worships.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Kilic, the children's grandfather, also died in the quake.
His wife, Turkan, clung to life Monday at WellStar-Kennestone
Hospital, said her son, Timur, a physician at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if she'll live,'' Timur Kilic said. ``It's just a
day-to-day thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkan Kilic has double pneumonia and suffered a stroke that has
left her left side paralyzed, Timur Kilic said. She is on a
ventilator in the fourth-floor intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother, Jan, survived the earthquake, as did a
daughter, 3-year-old Natalie.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic was in good condition at WellStar-Kennestone,
recovering from injuries to her head, neck and lower back. She is
expected to be discharged this week, Timur Kilic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, she's very with it,'' Timur Kilic said. ``She's very
positive. She knows exactly what happened, but she's very positive
because of her faith: This is God's plan and they've gone to a
better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan and Turkan Kilic arrived at the hospital in the early
morning hours Monday after a 13-hour trip aboard an airplane
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the five victims returned to the Atlanta area
Sunday night on a Delta Air Lines jet, accompanied by the
children's father, Babur Kilic, his brothers, Timur and Cengiz, and
an older sister, Zehra. Natalie, who is staying with Timur Kilic,
also was on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie only suffered a black eye that is now barely visible and
is ``doing great,'' her uncle said Monday night. The child was
trapped for 36 hours underneath rubble from the collapsed
five-story building in which the Kilics were staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``All she knows is she was sleeping and all she remembers is
that somebody put her underneath a rock,'' Timur Kilic said.
</P>
<P>
   No funeral arrangements have been made for Nizam Kilic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go ahead and bring some closure to this,'' said
maternal grandfather William Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   The children's father, Babur, is doing as well as can be
imagined, his older brother said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hanging in there,'' Timur Kilic said. ``He's getting a
lot of support from the family. He's kind of numb from the whole
thing. I'm sure he's hoping this is a nightmare he can wake up
from.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy started during an idyllic vacation for Jan Kilic and
her five children, who were staying with her in-laws at their
summer home in the Turkish seaside resort of Yalova. Her husband
Babur, a physician, was supposed to join them this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and his two brothers caught a Lufthansa flight to
Turkey on Wednesday, hours after being told the horrible news.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Turkey, they checked on Jan and Turkan Kilic
and then began searching for their missing family members. They
found them at a make-shift morgue at a factory's refrigeration
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing my nieces and nephews was pretty hard,'' Timur Kilic
said. ``But also finding my father, that was pretty tough stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned with getting their loved ones back to Georgia as soon
as possible, the Kilic brothers tried to obtain help from U.S.
officials in Turkey. That went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Georgia, Jan's parents, other Kilic family
members and medical colleagues started to see what they could do.
Discussion with State Department officials in Washington proved
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Delta offered to fly them home.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Tom Hurd, head doctor at Georgia
Anesthesiologists, the group to which the three Kilic brothers
belong, hired MedJet International Inc., an air ambulance company
out of Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim was concerned about his mom, getting her straight back to
the United States,'' Hurd said. ``They thought one transport was
all she could really handle.''
</P>
<P>
   MedJet brought a plane up from Miami on Friday, picked up a
doctor, nurse and respiratory technician in Birmingham, Ala., and
flew on to Vienna, Austria, stopping to refuel along the way in
Canada and to switch pilot crews in Iceland, said the company's
vice president, Stan Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   After a federally mandated 18-hour stop in Vienna so the crew
could rest, the MedJet flight continued to Istanbul. The plane
arrived early Sunday afternoon, picked up the two patients and
started back.
</P>
<P>
   About 13 hours later, after another crew switch in Iceland, the
plane touched down in Atlanta about 1:30 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,211-mile round trip cost about $64,000, most of which
insurance will pay, Timur Kilic said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said the family was grateful to have the women home but was
still bitter over the State Department's inability to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're angry. We're still angry,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, meanwhile, has begun the hard road to physical
recovery. She will need physical therapy, Timur Kilic said, and a
deep gash on her forehead likely will require reconstructive
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a long time,'' said Kemp.

SITE GIVES SPORTS FANS THE BUSINESS LOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it was reported in this newspaper on how the Texas Rangers
baseball club was marketing postseason tickets, it was exactly the
type of news that Howard Bloom was waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   In case you ask ... no, Bloom is not some Rangers fan from
Pantego, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   From his vantage in Ottawa, Bloom tracks the sports business
world and posts daily updates at his site, Sportsbusinessnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's updates might range from simple attendance figures and
money leaders to commentary on escalating players' salaries or
stadium funding issues. Or, as he did with the Rangers' ticket
news, he might add some perspective on a current topic.
</P>
<P>
   On his site, Bloom observed that the Rangers are offering fans
who aren't current season-ticket or mini-season ticket holders an
opportunity to buy postseason tickets as long as they commit to
purchasing a mini-season (11-game plan) for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom advocated the plan: ``It's a reward and sends a strong
message about customer loyalty to the business community and to
your fan base,'' Bloom wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of approach that sets his site apart from the
others, Bloom said. Anyone can collect news from the multitude of
sources on the Internet; it requires effort to make sense of the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a very tough look at sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom, who has worked with several Canadian-based amateur sports
programs, launched the site May 24, 1998. He gave his site one year
to establish credibility before he began expanding his efforts to
turn it into a serious venture.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is for the site to evolve into a sports version of the
Drudge Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I think that Matt Drudge is any kind of role model,
but that's what we want to become,'' said Bloom, a part-time
weekend host on Ottawa Sports Radio.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, Bloom has assembled a staff of
correspondents who will provide in-depth commentary. He said he
also plans to create an audio version of his site for sports talk
radio or other sports sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said it's important that sports fans on the Internet be
able to get everything they want from one site. It doesn't always
have to be routine news, but an understanding of the issues, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's more important to know what's going on off the
field than on the field,'' Bloom said. ``The business of sports
really is as important as winning or losing.''
</P>
<P>
   GOT AN EXTRA MILLION? A week ago, New York Jets fans John Crotty
and Peter Lyons launched Buythejets.com with the idea to pool
enough cash, via the Internet, to come together to submit a united
bid to become majority owners of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to collect at least $180 million, enough to become a
majority owner. No fan will be allowed to purchase more than $5,000
worth of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones wannabes should know this: According to the
frequently asked questions section, if you become a minority owner,
you will not be able to play quarterback for the team.
</P>
<P>
   TOUR DE JERSEY: The selling off of Lance Armstrong continues on
the Internet. The Tour de France winner from Austin already has
sold one of his autographed bikes for $5,500 to Larry Latham of
Austin on the Internet. Now until Sept. 10, Armstrong will make his
yellow race-leader jersey _ worn during the Tour de France _
available for auction on Active USA and SportingAuction. Proceeds
benefit the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which is dedicated to
fighting cancer through awareness, education and research.
</P>
<P>
   POINT AND SERVE: In case it's hard to keep track with pencil and
paper, the official U.S. Open site (www.usopen.org) plans to have a
detailed statistics section for this year's event, which opens
Monday in Armonk, N.Y. The Event Stats section features data on tie
breaks, first points won, server points and return games won, aces
and double faults from all main match courts. The site has
scheduled a live cybercast of the draw ceremony at 9:30 a.m.
tomorrow. When the tournament begins, fans can capture their own
view via three robotic cameras, download real-time match scores,
chat with players and purchase official merchandise.

A WALKOUT BY UMPIRES IS POSSIBLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the threat of a strike serving as an undercurrent, the
division among umpires along league lines grew wider Monday. At
least 8 of the 13 new umpires the National League has hired have
joined the umpires' union, a person close to the union said, but
none of the American League's 12 new umpires have applied for
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two umpires, 13 from the NL and nine from the AL, face
the loss of their jobs Sept. 2 following the leagues' acceptance of
their resignations. The union has tried to salvage their jobs both
in talks with the league presidents and through unfair labor
practice charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   But the 42 umpires who have continued to support the union's
position in the dispute have discussed the possibility of staging a
walkout as another way of trying to resolve the jobs issue. One of
the 24 umpires whom the union has labeled dissidents said he has
heard of two dates for a possible strike _ next Monday and Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the union's chief negotiator, declined to
comment on the likelihood of a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My entire focus is on achieving a peaceful resolution of this
dispute,'' he said. ``I'd rather not comment on the possibility of
an unfair labor practice strike if we're not successful in
achieving a peaceful resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' labor agreement with the leagues bars them from
striking. However, employees covered by such a provision can
nevertheless strike if the employer has committed unfair labor
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The labor board is not expected to have a decision on the
umpires' charges by any time next week. The absence of a ruling,
therefore, would make an unfair labor practice strike next week
highly risky for the umpires. If the board subsequently were to
find no validity in the union's charges, the umpires would be in
violation of the contract and could lose their jobs. The leagues
would have the right to permanently replace the 20 other union
supporters who have retained their jobs after initially submitting
letters of resignation. Thirty-three of 36 NL umpires have
continued to side with the union position. Only 9 of 30 AL umpires
who are union members have joined them. The leaders of the
dissident umpires are both AL umpires, John Hirschbeck and Joe
Brinkman.
</P>
<P>
   It probably is not surprising, then, that a similar division
appears to be in the process of being established among the minor
league umpires whom the leagues hired shortly after the union
adopted its mass resignation strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The person who told of the development with the new NL umpires
said eight have joined the union with the possibility of another
two or more joining. But he said none of the 12 new AL umpires have
contacted the union about membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks more and more every day,'' the person said, ``like
it's evolving into the National Leaguers having one position and
the American Leaguers having another position.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 44-page brief filed with the labor board last week, the
union argued that the leagues had ``no immediate economic need'' to
hire replacement umpires when they did.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' mass resignation was ``protected activity'' under
labor law, the union contended. The leagues, on the other hand, it
said, acted improperly by accepting the withdrawal of some
resignations and not others.

ADVERTISING: BRUT CAMPAIGN IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT, ON PURPOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new Brut man, and _ to borrow a phrase from the
brand's glory days of the 1970s _ he's a male chauvinist pig.
</P>
<P>
   The new $12 million campaign for the Brut toiletries brand,
introduced last week in print and some outdoor ads, features
headlines like ``You're welcome to throw your clothes on the floor,
too'' and ``Actually, yes. That outfit does make you look fat.''
Other ads go further in references to sex and other personal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, from Ammirati Puris Lintas, New York, part of
Interpublic Group of Cos., are aimed at men from 18 to 34 and are
politically incorrect on purpose. They are tapping into an emerging
'90s-style men-behaving-badly ethos that is seen in the success of
things like Maxim magazine, a Playboy-like publication, and
television shows like ``The Man Show'' on Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   To Brut's owner, Unilever, the British-Dutch conglomerate, the
trend is a perfect fit for Brut, which was a huge success when it
was introduced some 30 years ago with macho, tongue-in-cheek TV
spots featuring the football great Joe Namath. But the brand has
been slipping in the last decade and is now ranked third in the
$521 million mass-market fragrance business behind Stetson and Old
Spice, and it badly needs a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign tries to keep Brut's manly image, popularized
by Namath and other sports celebrity ads, said Rob Feakins of
Ammirati, one of the campaign's two creative directors, but it also
aims to update the image with a bit of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads reflect the style of how these young guys feel
today,'' Feakins said. ``It accepts it and speaks in their language
that it's good to be Neanderthal again.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's research, which included some 30 focus groups of
men and women of all ages, showed that the new Brut man is accepted
as a postfeminist guy whose crassness is apparently a joke among
many young people of both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings were the same everywhere we went,'' said Jim
Allman, chairman of Ammirati New York. ``People are very
comfortable with themselves and the opposite sex, and can even poke
fun at what would've been once considered misogynist behavior. The
women were just as comfortable with this kind of edgy, macho
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, said Roger Bentley, the other co-creative
director for the campaign, the ads reach an audience that just
doesn't believe the babes-come-running and sports-hero advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads come off as very honest to our target audience _ we
hear all the time people are tired of being told what they should
be like,'' Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign features bold white headlines on a background of
emerald green _ Brut's signature color _ and the tag line ``Inside
every man is a guy.'' The product is not seen in the ads, nor do
you see an actual Brut man. TV ads, now in production, will run
later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The print campaign, which is running in men's magazines like
Maxim and in outdoor ads in seven cities, also includes posters at
construction sites. Brut will also get so-called urinal
advertising, ads positioned at eye level above urinals, mostly in
bars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several other companies are picking up on the postfeminist guy
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold Brewing Co. is now selling its signature beer as the
brew ``for the few real men still left.'' Wendy's International
also has a campaign aimed at young men, with lines like ``This is a
burger town, pretty boy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Brut ads may say things that would have been
unacceptable even five years ago, the ads pale in comparison with
some recent films and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candor in the media, certainly on the editorial side, is
something that seems to be manifesting itself more actively _
witness Monica,'' said Stephen Greyser, a professor of
communications and marketing at Harvard Business School, referring
to the explicit discussions of the Monica Lewinsky debacle. ``I
couldn't say they are breaking new ground. Advertising reflects
changes in society over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever can risk such ``candid guy talk,'' he said, because the
advertising pinpoints a very specific audience in very specific
media outlets, which is unlikely to reach _ and potentially annoy _
the general population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alan Jope, a Unilever vice president for marketing,
noted that Brut's racier ads will run above urinals and in men's
publications but not in more public locations. And while the TV
spots will maintain the spirit of the print ads, Jope said, they
won't be as ``out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely do not want to be offensive to people,'' Jope
said. ``However, we're not afraid of talking to different target
markets in a tone they find relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jope said the ``emerging guy phenomenon'' allows Brut to talk to
men in ways beyond the typical male hero stereotype because the
trend tells Unilever that men and women have loosened up about
politically correct roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the 1970s, it was expected that men were male chauvinist
pigs,'' he said. ``Then came the era of new male sensitivity for 20
years. Finally young men have grown up now, and are able to have
multiple roles. They can be full equal co-workers, good fathers and
one of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is the latest effort by Brut to reclaim its status
as a premiere mass brand. As men's roles have changed, the brand
has tried several approaches, from the sexy actress Kelly LeBrock
talking about relationships in the early '90s to a ``men are back''
campaign that blended swagger and sensitivity. In 1997, it returned
to sports celebrities with the Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy
Aikman as the Brut man.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign is a first step toward positioning Brut as a
stronger player in the $1.68 billion anti-perspirant category,
which is much larger than the fragrance market, Jope said. Brut,
with a 2 percent share, is sixth in men's anti-perspirants. The
leader, Right Guard by Gillette, has a 9.8 percent share, according
to A.C. Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   Brut has a tough job ahead mostly because it is always tough to
revive a brand, said Allan Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a
beauty industry trade publication. Mottus said it made sense to
focus on the larger anti-perspirant market, but to succeed Brut
will have to establish a benefit for the product beyond smelling
good. To that end, Unilever will promote Brut's new dryness
ingredient _ trimax _ in its TV campaign, Jope said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new, supermacho print campaign, Mottus said he was
not in the target audience, which may be why he just doesn't get
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like they're trying to be cute,'' he said. ``And
sweat ain't cute.''

SPARKS TO FACE SHORT-HANDED MONARCHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ What could have been a matchup of league MVP
candidates has turned into a decided advantage for the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   They begin the WNBA playoffs today against the Sacramento
Monarchs in a single-elimination first-round game at 6 p.m. at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie will be ready to play, having helped the Sparks
(20-12) finish second in the Western Conference with the league's
second-best record.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said for Sacramento's top player, 6-foot-3
center Yolanda Griffith, who suffered a season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith's absence could have a major affect on the matchup. She
averaged 21.8 points and 9.8 rebounds in the four-game,
regular-season series, which was split 2-2. Tangela Smith takes
over for Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge is not counting on Sacramento
(19-13) having a big letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they are a very capable team, even without Yolanda
Griffith,'' Woolridge said. ``We're going to go about our
preparation as if she was there. When I look at Tangela Smith,
particularly the last two games, she's been very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will be matched up against Leslie, who is averaging 15.6
points and 7.8 rebounds. Leslie is a dominant post player but has
become an outside threat with her 22 3-pointers and 42-percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who averages 8.3 points and 3.8 boards, is more of a
small forward but is quick and runs the floor well.
</P>
<P>
   First-year coach Sonny Allen Smith has been impressed with
Tangela Smith's play of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really stepped up. She had a double-double against
Houston,'' he said. ``I knew she had talent, but she really
surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably one of the most physical and aggressive matchups in the
paint will feature the Sparks' 6-1 DeLisha Milton against the
Monarchs' 5-11 LaTasha Byears. With her wide wingspan, Milton (9.9
points, 5.5 rebounds) has established herself as a defensive power.
She'll get a workout against the tireless and relentless Byears
(9.2 points, 5.3 rebounds), who has the offensive abilities,
especially with Griffith out.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs have a three-guard lineup with Ticha Penicheiro,
Ruthie Bolton-Holifield and Kedra Holland-Corn.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks can have La'Keisha Frett or Mwadi Mabika cover
Penicheiro and Bolton-Holifield. Frett (6.1 points, 3.0 rebounds)
has been a pleasant surprise since earning a starting spot midway
through the season. Penicheiro leads the league with assists (7.1).

GUY DUROSIER, HAITIAN SINGER AND COMPOSER, DIES AT 68  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., France, Haiti, Canada)   By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guy Durosier, a versatile Haitian singer and organist whom Edith
Piaf once called ``the living breath of Haiti,'' died on Thursday
at his home in Bothell, a suburb of Seattle. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from pulmonary cancer, said his son
Robert.
</P>
<P>
   In a career more than 50 years long, Durosier also played the
saxophone and composed music. Like most Haitian musicians, he had
an eclectic style, ranging from big band sounds to Cuban music of
the 50's.
</P>
<P>
   His genre reached even those who left Haiti too young to have
known his music firsthand and those who were born in the United
States to Haitian parents. His cross-generational appeal was
evident when Durosier received a standing ovation after performing
at Lincoln Center in June 1998 during a fund-raiser for the
Haitian-American Alliance, a community group based in Brooklyn.
Reviewers said Durosier outshone younger and more popular Haitian
musicians like the singer Emeline Michel and the guitarist Beethova
Oba.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Port-au-Prince, the capital, Durosier started performing
at age 14. In 1947 he began playing the clarinet with the school
band at St. Louis de Gonzague School in Port-au-Prince. A few years
later, he began to play professionally when he caught the attention
of Issa Saieh, the maestro of the most famous orchestra in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Durosier settled in Paris and was a regular
performer at the jazz club Mars, playing the saxophone, and was at
the center of a growing intellectual and artistic Haitian community
in Paris. After Paris, Durosier lived in Asia, then spent 15 years
in Canada before settling in the United States a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote scores of songs and many, like ``Her Name Is
Michaelle'' and ``My Brunette,'' became hits. However, his image
suffered from his close alliance with Haitian dictators Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier, who ruled from 1957 to 1986, when the younger Duvalier
fled to exile in France.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Durosier gave a special tribute at the elder Duvalier's
funeral. ``We thank thee Francois Duvalier for having given so much
to us,'' Durosier sang. ``You are great and beautiful and just. Up
there in the skies you will watch over our Fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in November with the magazine Haitiens
Aujourd'hui, Durosier said that singing at the funeral was a matter
of chance. A few days after Durosier was invited to Haiti along
with other celebrities like Pele and Muhammad Ali, he recounted,
Duvalier died and he was asked to sing at the funeral. Officials
imposed the text of his song, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I have no regrets,'' he said in the interview. ``I have
one wish: That my musical legacy continue to rehabilitate Haitian
music in the world. I would like to leave something valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Durosier is survived by his wife, Marianne, and four children. A
memorial will be held in Bothell Wednesday. A concert tribute to
Durosier will be held at Brooklyn College in New York on Sunday.
The tribute will bring together musicians of his era like Joe
Trouillot, Michel Pressoir, Egner Guinard and Raoul Guillaume.

JONES ON THIRD-BEST LONG JUMPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones already has proven she is the
fastest woman in the world. Yet she concedes she is far from the
world's greatest long jumper.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent Monday after Jones finished third in the long
jump in the World Championships to end her bid for an unprecedented
four gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Niurka Montalvo of Spain won the competition with a final leap
of 23 feet, 2 inches to upset 1995 world champion Fiona May of
Italy. May was second at 22-9{ and Jones was third at 22-5. Dawn
Burrell, who defeated Jones in the U.S. championships to hand the
Thousand Oaks High graduate her first loss to an American in two
years, was sixth at 22-1{.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stand here all day and talk about technique,'' Jones
said. ``I'll be the first one to tell you I need to work on my
technique. My specialty is running until I have a little bit of
time to work on technique. I have a lot of speed. It is a lot
easier to work on technique than to find speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who set a 100-meter championship record of 10.70 seconds
Saturday to record the fastest time ever at sea level, will attempt
to rebound in the 200-meter preliminaries, which begin today. She
also will compete in either the 400- or 1,600-meter relay in these
World Championships, which run through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There also was disappointment Monday for Mark Crear of Valencia,
who was disqualified after two false starts in the 110-meter high
hurdle quarterfinals. Crear, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist in
the 110 high hurdles and the world-leader at 12.98 seconds, won his
first-round race easily in 13.30.
</P>
<P>
   Crear said he was merely trying to react to the gun and wasn't
trying to catch a flyer on his second false start, especially in a
second-round race. Crear, in lane 5, said Sweden's Robert Kronberg
in lane 1 pulled him off on the first false start.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team has lodged a protest for the Jury of Appeals to
review videotape. An analysis of reaction times indicate that in
Crear's quarterfinal, which was restarted five times, there were 13
reaction times under the allowable time. Both of Crear's marks were
coincidentally the same to a thousandth of a second, .057. Yet
Crear was the lone athlete disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trained all year ... but I never prepared myself for this,''
Crear said. ``Somehow, I'm going to have to pick up the broken
pieces and salvage the rest of the season. You win like a man, you
lose like a man. It's one of those unfortunate situations that you
don't want to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of celebration for UCLA's Seilala Sua in the
women's discus final. Sua, at 21 the youngest competitor in the
field, finished sixth with a throw of 209-1, the highest finish
ever by an American. Franka Diestzsch of Germany won with a throw
of 223-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy about making history but I am a bit upset with my
performance,'' said Sua, the 1999 NCAA and U.S. champion, who has
thrown 212-10. ``I was the youngest ... but I am going to use it to
my advantage in my next competition. They're fading out and I'm
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100, 200 and long jump
in 1998, also hopes to bounce back after her long jump performance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' best effort of 22-5 came in the fifth round but was far
off her personal-best 23-11}. On her sixth and final attempt, Jones
appeared to surpass the 23-foot mark, but the jump was ruled foul.
</P>
<P>
   It was the next jumper, Montalvo, who stole the spotlight. She
jumped 22-7 in the fourth round to trail May by two inches but
responded with her winning jump. Montalvo's foot was on the edge of
the board and it took several moments before the judges ruled the
jump fair to send the primarily Spanish crowd of 37,815 into a
boisterous and raucous celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was going to be a little doubt from many people
that thought it was a foul,'' Jones said. ``It says a lot about her
character that she can come back on her last jump and produce one
like that. I'll give it to her. She was the best jumper today.
There are no excuses for me. I think I can sleep well tonight
knowing I left it all out there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry and steamy night, with temperatures in the high 80s
and 40 percent humidity, Jones was second after the first round
with a leap of 22-3{, a quarter of an inch behind Montalvo. In the
third round, May responded with her best effort of 22-9\ to bump
Jones to third.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones captures gold medals in the 200 meters and a relay, she
would join Carl Lewis (1983 and 1987) and East Germany's Marita
Koch (1983) as the only athletes to claim three gold medals in the
same World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   That would do little, however, to console Jones after her
setback in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   `` I set my goals very high. Bronze is not going to cut it for
me,'' Jones said. ``It blows my mind that people can't understand
that people want me to say I'll settle for three golds and a
bronze. Of course, I am going to want to win every event I am in. I
put pressure on myself saying I want to win four golds but I would
not change anything.''

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones already has proven she is the
fastest woman in the world. Yet she concedes she is far from the
world's greatest long jumper.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent Monday after Jones finished third in the long
jump in the World Championships to end her bid for an unprecedented
four gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Niurka Montalvo of Spain won the competition with a final leap
of 23 feet, 2 inches to upset 1995 world champion Fiona May of
Italy. May was second at 22-9{ and Jones was third at 22-5. Dawn
Burrell, who defeated Jones in the U.S. championships to hand the
Thousand Oaks High graduate her first loss to an American in two
years, was sixth at 22-1{.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stand here all day and talk about technique,'' Jones
said. ``I'll be the first one to tell you I need to work on my
technique. My specialty is running until I have a little bit of
time to work on technique. I have a lot of speed. It is a lot
easier to work on technique than to find speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who set a 100-meter championship record of 10.70 seconds
Saturday to record the fastest time ever at sea level, will attempt
to rebound in the 200-meter preliminaries, which begin today. She
also will compete in either the 400- or 1,600-meter relay in these
World Championships, which run through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There also was disappointment Monday for Mark Crear of Valencia,
who was disqualified after two false starts in the 110-meter high
hurdle quarterfinals. Crear, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist in
the 110 high hurdles and the world-leader at 12.98 seconds, won his
first-round race easily in 13.30.
</P>
<P>
   Crear said he was merely trying to react to the gun and wasn't
trying to catch a flyer on his second false start, especially in a
second-round race. Crear, in lane 5, said Sweden's Robert Kronberg
in lane 1 pulled him off on the first false start.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team has lodged a protest for the Jury of Appeals to
review videotape. An analysis of reaction times indicate that in
Crear's quarterfinal, which was restarted five times, there were 13
reaction times under the allowable time. Both of Crear's marks were
coincidentally the same to a thousandth of a second, .057. Yet
Crear was the lone athlete disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trained all year ... but I never prepared myself for this,''
Crear said. ``Somehow, I'm going to have to pick up the broken
pieces and salvage the rest of the season. You win like a man, you
lose like a man. It's one of those unfortunate situations that you
don't want to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of celebration for UCLA's Seilala Sua in the
women's discus final. Sua, at 21 the youngest competitor in the
field, finished sixth with a throw of 209-1, the highest finish
ever by an American. Franka Diestzsch of Germany won with a throw
of 223-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy about making history but I am a bit upset with my
performance,'' said Sua, the 1999 NCAA and U.S. champion, who has
thrown 212-10. ``I was the youngest ... but I am going to use it to
my advantage in my next competition. They're fading out and I'm
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100, 200 and long jump
in 1998, also hopes to bounce back after her long jump performance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' best effort of 22-5 came in the fifth round but was far
off her personal-best 23-11}. On her sixth and final attempt, Jones
appeared to surpass the 23-foot mark, but the jump was ruled foul.
</P>
<P>
   It was the next jumper, Montalvo, who stole the spotlight. She
jumped 22-7 in the fourth round to trail May by two inches but
responded with her winning jump. Montalvo's foot was on the edge of
the board and it took several moments before the judges ruled the
jump fair to send the primarily Spanish crowd of 37,815 into a
boisterous and raucous celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was going to be a little doubt from many people
that thought it was a foul,'' Jones said. ``It says a lot about her
character that she can come back on her last jump and produce one
like that. I'll give it to her. She was the best jumper today.
There are no excuses for me. I think I can sleep well tonight
knowing I left it all out there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry and steamy night, with temperatures in the high 80s
and 40 percent humidity, Jones was second after the first round
with a leap of 22-3{, a quarter of an inch behind Montalvo. In the
third round, May responded with her best effort of 22-9\ to bump
Jones to third.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones captures gold medals in the 200 meters and a relay, she
would join Carl Lewis (1983 and 1987) and East Germany's Marita
Koch (1983) as the only athletes to claim three gold medals in the
same World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   That would do little, however, to console Jones after her
setback in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   `` I set my goals very high. Bronze is not going to cut it for
me,'' Jones said. ``It blows my mind that people can't understand
that people want me to say I'll settle for three golds and a
bronze. Of course, I am going to want to win every event I am in. I
put pressure on myself saying I want to win four golds but I would
not change anything.''

BRADLEY GOES TO HARLEM TO SPEAK ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In some of his most detailed remarks about race
relations and the plight of urban America to date, Bill Bradley
told a Harlem audience Monday night that he would use the power of
the presidency to push for universal health care, end child
poverty, abolish mandatory sentencing of criminals and end racial
profiling by police.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour appearance before more than 500 people at the
National Action Network, a group led by the Rev. Al Sharpton,
Bradley said that the desire to improve race relations was a major
reason he first became interested in Democratic Party politics some
35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is that racial unity is not a political
position,'' he said. ``It is who I am. It's what I believe. It's
what I care most about. It's one of the main motivations for my
being in politics in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bradley, the former U.S. senator from New Jersey,
has been telling audiences that he considers race relations a
``defining issue'' in American politics today. But in appearing
before Sharpton's group, he made it clear that he is willing to
work closely with the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party, at
least on issues concerning race and urban poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appearance also provided a political boost for
Sharpton, who at times has been ostracized by some Democratic Party
officials, but whose standing within the party seems to have risen,
partly because of public outcry against police brutality in New
York City and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Though he declined to say whether he would endorse Bradley,
Sharpton praised the former senator for being, he said, the first
presidential candidate since Robert Kennedy in 1968 to campaign in
Harlem. And he called on the other candidates to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not continue an illicit affair where people have fun
with us in private but don't want to deal with us and our issues in
public,'' Sharpton said to much laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has described his campaign as being in a phase where he
outlines general positions without getting into policy details. For
that, he has been criticized as overly vague by supporters of Vice
President Al Gore, who is generally viewed as the front-runner for
the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, during a speech he gave from notes as well as
in answers to questions from the crowd afterward, Bradley did not
shy away from taking clear and strong positions on a number of
major issues. And more often than not, his remarks drew warm
applause from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how he would help the urban poor, Bradley said he
would institute policies intended to end discriminatory lending
practices by banks, press for tax cuts specifically aimed at
helping middle-class and low-income people, raise the minimum wage
and push for legislation that would make it easier for workers to
join labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he would veto a $792 billion tax cut recently
approved by Congress ``in a nanosecond,'' Bradley also said he
would use the federal surplus to extend health insurance to all
Americans and to reduce childhood poverty. But he did not offer
specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know that because of what we did over four or
eight years that every child in America has a chance to realize his
or her potential,'' he said. ``There are still 14 million children
today who live in poverty. There are still 45 million people in
America without health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   As he often does in his speeches on race, Bradley, a former New
York Knick, recalled his experiences playing alongside blacks on
athletic teams. In his hometown of Crystal City, Mo., he said, the
Little League baseball team was integrated ahead of other town
institutions. And he recounted being forced to stay in ``third-rate
hotels'' and being denied service in segregated restaurants while
traveling with the Little League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked out of more than one restaurant in our time,'' he
said to applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who received a standing ovation when he finished, also
asserted that he had made it a point to speak forcefully about race
relations on the floor of the Senate. He recounted a floor speech
he gave after the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police
officers in March 1991, when he pounded the lectern 56 times in two
minutes to dramatize the number of times the police hit King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to show that a white face could talk about race
without vaporizing before your eyes,'' Bradley said. ``I'm still
here.''

SUN MICROSYSTEMS TO BUY FORTE IN $540 MILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems Inc. said Monday that it had
agreed to buy Forte Software Inc., which produces programming tools
for developing Internet applications, for $540 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is valued at $22.275 a share, represents a 31
percent premium to Forte's closing price of $17 a share on Friday.
Shares of Forte rose $4.125 Monday, to $21.125, while Sun rose
56.25 cents, to $74.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's server computers and related software run many Web sites
and electronic commerce businesses. Acquiring Forte helps extend
Sun's reach to sites using IBM's System 390 mainframe computer
systems and Microsoft's Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Companies use Forte's software tools to better integrate
applications like sales-force automation and call-center
management, so-called front-office applications. All of these
programs used to run on companies' own computer systems, but they
are increasingly moving to servers running on the Internet or
private intranets, allowing companies, their suppliers and their
customers to handle sales, service, support and buying processes
from a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies across the globe are dot-coming their businesses at
an incredible pace _ by extending legacy applications to run across
the Internet and by creating new applications to run across all
platforms,'' Ed Zander, Sun's president and chief operating
officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome Forte's team, solutions and expertise to our line
of Internet development and deployment products and are looking
forward to working with Forte's customers on multiple platforms,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forte has had growing revenue but erratic profitability. In the
quarter ended June 30, Forte reported a loss of $487,000 compared
with a loss of $2.3 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue
grew 22 percent, to $22.2 million from $18.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1991, Forte is one of a group of companies focused on
so-called middleware, which seeks to help companies integrate all
their enterprise applications, which help manage operations like
accounting, personnel and manufacturing. Because most corporations
have completed the deployment of big back-office programs, like
SAP, Oracle applications and Peoplesoft, and are now in the midst
of rolling out front-office applications from the likes of Siebel
Systems, Ariba and Remedy, there is an opening for companies that
can help link these different products.

JOHN GOTTSCHALK, FORMER DIRECTOR OF U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE,
DIES AT 86  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ind., N.J., Wash.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John S. Gottschalk, a director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in the 1960s who oversaw developments like the first
endangered species act, the banning of the pesticide DDT and the
comeback of the whooping crane, died on Aug. 13 at his home in
Arlington, Va. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, from 1964 to 1970, Gottschalk helped to start
several urban wildlife programs and add more than 500,000 acres to
the national wildlife refuge system.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, when he was a regional director in the
service, Gottschalk played an important role in the Interior
Department's takeover of the Great Swamp in Morris County, N.J. In
the early 1960s, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had
considered using the area, now called the Great Swamp Wildlife
Preserve, for an airport.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the service, Gottschalk was assistant to the
director of the National Marine Fisheries Service and then was an
executive vice president and counsel of the International
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. He retired in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   John Simison Gottschalk was born on Sept. 27, 1912, in Berne,
Ind. He graduated from Earlham College, in Richmond, Ind., and
received a master's degree from Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in the 1930s and early 40s as a park ranger,
park naturalist and fisheries superintendent with the Indiana
Conservation Department. He joined the Fish and Wildlife Service in
Montana, and in 1951 he became the first director of the sport
fisheries division of the agency. In 1959, he went to Boston as
director of the service's 11-state northeast region.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as president of the American Fisheries Society
and as a board member of the National Wildlife Federation and the
Audubon Naturalist Society, a conservation group for the Washington
metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   Gottschalk is survived by his wife of 62 years, Edith
Gottschalk, of Arlington; a son, Thomas, of Washington; a daughter,
Sara Nell Davis of Seabeck, Wash.; five grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.

NBC NAMES EX-ABC EXECUTIVE TO HEAD TV PRODUCTION UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC on Monday named Ted Harbert, the former top
entertainment executive at ABC, to be the new president of its
in-house television production unit, NBC Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The move underscores the increasing emphasis that networks are
placing on producing their own programming to take advantage of
potential profits from hit entertainment shows.
</P>
<P>
   Harbert had a 20-year career at ABC that ended in 1997, when he
stepped down as chairman of ABC Entertainment. He subsequently
joined the television division of the Dreamworks studio as a
producer and worked on comedies including ``Arsenio'' and the
current ``It's Like, You Know.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, a four-year deal, was made by Scott Sassa, the
president of NBC's West Coast division. Harbert will be in charge
of all of the operations under NBC Studios, including its
late-night, daytime and Saturday morning shows. He will report to
Sassa.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of such a high-profile executive as Harbert was
widely interpreted in the television industry as evidence of NBC's
commitment to upgrade its studio as a supplier of programs for its
network. Last year NBC Studios turned out the network's two most
successful new shows, ``Will and Grace'' and ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, Walt Disney Co., parent of ABC, moved to
incorporate all its entertainment operations, including its studio,
under three ABC executives. Harbert said Monday that NBC would not
emulate that model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking at the ABC model to see how it will
work,'' he said. He said he would act as an advocate at the network
for the shows developed by the studio but would expect Sassa and
his top entertainment executive, Garth Ancier, ``to throw me out of
the room'' when they made their final program choices. At ABC, the
executives scheduling the shows will be the same executives who are
developing the network's in-house programs.
</P>
<P>
   Harbert said NBC would still seek to acquire the best shows from
other studios, even as it tried to increase its own in-house
production. NBC Studios will also sell shows to other networks when
suitable, but Harbert said that was clearly not his first priority.
</P>
<P>
   Because NBC is not aligned with a big Hollywood studio as are
both ABC and Fox, there has been frequent speculation that the
network would eventually seek an alliance with a studio like
Columbia or Warner Brothers. Harbert said his appointment, as well
as the money NBC is committing to build its studio, are indications
that NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., is willing to go
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``With GE behind it, NBC can be as big as anybody,'' Harbert
said.

POLICE VICTIMS OF BOMBING FIGHT CLEMENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officer Rocco Pascarella lost part of his left leg
when a bomb planted by Puerto Rican nationalists outside Police
Headquarters in Manhattan exploded on New Year's Eve in 1982. Later
that night, Detective Richard Pastorella lost five fingers and was
left blind after he tried to disarm a bomb across the street; his
partner, Detective Anthony Senft, lost an eye.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group,
the Armed Forces of National Liberation, better known by its
Spanish initials, FALN, claimed responsibility for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the three retired officers returned to 1 Police Plaza to
join Police Commissioner Howard Safir and police union officials in
calling on President Clinton to withdraw a clemency offer that he
made to 16 jailed members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Pastorella, who now wears dark glasses, was led to a lectern in
front of reporters. ``Go ahead,'' Thomas J. Scotto, the president
of the Detectives Endowment Association, whispered as he reached
the lectern. ``The mike is right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The retired detective told the group that he thought the
president was making a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I tell you what the psychological effect was to my
family, to my children, to my wife?'' he said. ``Certainly, it took
me fully two years to physically recover. But the emotional
injuries remain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up with nightmares at night and cold sweats,'' he
said. ``It never leaves. It never goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered conditional clemency to the 16 members of the
FALN on Aug. 11. Most of them were convicted of crimes like
seditious conspiracy or possession of an unregistered firearm, and
Clinton administration officials said none of them directly caused
any deaths or injuries. The officials added that the president felt
that their long prison terms _ one was sentenced to 90 years _ were
excessive. Under the offer, the prisoners must renounce the use of
violence and agree to comply with parole requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The president's clemency offer came after a number of
politicians, human rights advocates and church leaders, including
former President Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu and John Cardinal
O'Connor, lent their names to a high-profile campaign calling for
their release.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir denounced the president's offer, saying the FALN was
responsible for more than 130 bomb attacks between 1974 and 1983
that killed six people and injured more than 70. ``This type of
action will encourage terrorism worldwide,'' Safir said of the
clemency offer. ``We should never make deals with terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastorella and the relatives of other bombing victims suggested
that Clinton's clemency offer was a politically inspired move
intended to drum up Puerto Rican support for Hillary Rodham Clinton
as she weighs a run in New York for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says to me, at least, that this is really and truly
pandering to the Hispanic community, to the Latino community, for
their vote when Mrs. Clinton runs for the vacated seat of Patrick
Moynihan in New York state,'' Pastorella said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has denied the assertion that the offer is
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ Mrs. Clinton's likely
opponent in the Senate race _ opposes the clemency offer but did
not want to be accused of trying to use the issue for political
gain. ``The only reason the mayor is not here is because he doesn't
want to politicize this issue,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who was in Rochester Monday, said he did not have
enough information to judge the merits of the decision to offer
clemency, and he repeated calls that he had made earlier this month
for the Justice Department to release its reports recommending
clemency for the 16 prisoners. But he questioned their reluctance
to sign documents renouncing the use of violence in the future, a
condition of their release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the failure of the people involved to quickly
renounce violence gives you a sense that this was a mistake,'' he
said.

WESTERN CONFERENCE NO. 1 HOUSTON COMETS Western Conference Finals
vs. L.A./Sacramento winner beginning at 7:00 p.m Thursday on ESPN
1999 Record: 26-6 Inside the Numbers: 9-0: Houston's record when
scoring 80 or more points. 1999 vs. Los Angeles/Sacramento: 2-2/3-1
Who to Watch: G Cynthia Cooper 22.1 ppg., 5.2 rpg., two-time WNBA

Thompson 12.2 ppg, 6.4 rpg.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why They'll Win the Title: The Comets have arguably the top trio
in the league and an invincibility about them. They force opponents
to adjust their game to match Houston, and few can do it beyond 20
or 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Why They Won't: The Comets don't have a deep bench, but the
psychological effect of Kim Perrot's death will probably be this
team's biggest problem. The guard's death has stung the team's
emotions and overcoming such an obstacle is the hardest thing the
Comets have had to do in three years. Odds to Win Title: 2-1
NO. 3 SACRAMENTO (19-13) at NO. 2 LOS ANGELES (20-12) Series
begins: 8 p.m., Tuesday, ESPN Season series: 2-2 Inside the
Numbers: 1-10: L.A.'s record when opponents score 80 or more
points. 16/27: Times injured Monarchs center Yolanda Griffith led
the team in scoring and rebounding, respectively. Best matchups:
L.A. C Lisa Leslie (15.6 ppg., 7.8 rpg.) vs. C Tangela Smith (8.3
ppg., 3.8 rpg.)
</P>
<P>
   When Griffith suffered a knee injury recently, this became a
cavernous hole for the Monarchs and one L.A. should take full
advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. G Gordana Grubin (8.9 ppg., 2.8 apg.) vs. G Ticha
Penicheiro (7.3 ppg., 7.1 apg.) If Sacramento is to win, Penicheiro
must dominate this matchup and keep turnovers to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Why L.A. Will Win: Leslie and DeLisha Milton averaged a combined
26 points and 12.3 rebounds in the series and that was against
Griffith. Leslie is the game's best offensive rebounder and without
having to play against Griffith, she should take charge.
</P>
<P>
   Why Sacramento Will Win: With Penicheiro and Ruthie
Bolton-Holifield, the Monarchs' backcourt is one of the league's
best. If those two are hitting their jumpers, Sacramento could pull
the upset. L.A. Odds to Win Title: 9-1 Sacramento Odds to Win
Title: 14-1
EASTERN CONFERENCE NO. 1 NEW YORK LIBERTY Eastern Conference Finals
vs. Charlotte/Detroit winner beginning at 7:00 p.m. Friday on
Lifetime 1999 Record: 18-14 Inside the Numbers: 3-10: New York's
record when trailing at the half. 1999 vs.
Detroit/Charlotte:2-2/2-2 Who to Watch: F Vickie Johnson 13.3 ppg.,
4.4 rpg.; C Sue Wicks 7.0 rpg.; F Crystal Robinson 11.7 ppg. Why
They'll Win the Title: The Liberty likely will win the East for the
second time in three years. It has the frontcourt scoring in
Johnson and Wicks and a competent ball handler in Teresa
Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Why They Won't: The Liberty was one of six teams to defeat
Houston this season and could win the first game of the finals if
they face the Comets. However, Weatherspoon is not the player she
was three years ago and New York doesn't have the perimeter
quickness that the Western Conference playoff teams have. Odds to
Win Title: 14-1
NO. 3 DETROIT SHOCK (15-17) at NO. 2 CHARLOTTE STING (15-17) Series
begins: 6 p.m., Tuesday, ESPN Season Series: 2-2 Inside the
Numbers: .657: Detroit's free-throw percentage in the season-series
against the Sting. 3-7: Charlotte's record over the past 10 games.
Best Matchups: Detroit G Jennifer Azzi (10.8 ppg., 3.8 apg.) vs. G
Dawn Staley (11.5 ppg,. 5.5 apg.)
</P>
<P>
   Of all the first-round matchups, this might be the best. Staley
is one of the best at taking defenders off the dribble and Azzi is
one of the league's top 3-point shooters. As good and durable as
Azzi is, she can't keep up with Staley for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit C Val Whiting (6.5 ppg., 6.7 rpg.) vs. C Rhonda Mapp
(9.5 ppg., 6.4 rpg.)
</P>
<P>
   Mapp can dominate the game and, if Detroit is winning, Mapp is
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Why Detroit Will Win: Since being traded from Utah, F Wendy
Palmer has been a catalyst for Detroit. She's averaged 9.9 points
and 6.4 rebounds and if she starts scoring early from the baseline
and Mapp is rebounding, Charlotte doesn't have the post defense to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Why Charlotte Will Win: The Sting have the homecourt advantage
but they are just 8-8 at home. If the interior defense can harass
the Shock's post players into poor shooting and the Staley-Andrea
Stinson combination is on, the Sting can win. Detroit Odds to Win
Title: 50-1 Charlotte Odds to Win Title: 50-1 nn

DESPITE ALL THE GREAT PLANS, IT'S STILL THE COMETS AND EVERYBODY
ELSE

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just think about the announcers gushing with hyperbole ...
``Lisa Leslie passes around to DeLisha Milton who gives it to
Michael Cooper down to Orlando Woolridge who slams it in the face
of Cynthia Cooper. Orlando says not in my house Ms. Two-Time MVP
... and the Sparks trail Houston by 12 points.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has a chance of removing the Houston Comets from atop
the WNBA's nest, it's Woolridge and the Los Angeles Sparks.
Woolridge played for 13 seasons in the NBA. His teammate and
assistant, Michael Cooper, played for 11 seasons in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The male coaches obviously will not be allowed to play in the
1999 WNBA playoffs. With Woolridge and Cooper, someone other than
the Comets had a chance of winning the title. Without them, The
Comet Chase, Part III continues with the excitement and
anticipation of a ``Shaft/ rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am bringing to the table is the type of playoff
mentality,'' said Woolridge, who is in his first season as L.A.'s
head coach. ``When I was with the Lakers, Bulls and Pistons I saw
the type of commitment and mentality everyone made to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But who cares about mentality? Bring your jumper and first-step
and then talk, because babbling about mentality is for the American
Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, this was supposed to be the year that the
infusion of ABL talent plus expansion meant a new WNBA champion.
That planned worked as well as New Coke. Houston posted the
league's best record for the third consecutive season and has won
79 percent of its games and is a virtual lock for a third
consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   In a league with players and teams still trying to get know
themselves, Houston kept its core of Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes, Tina
Thompson and coach Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Until this group is broken up, any talk about a New York or Los
Angeles championship is as likely as Buffalo winning the Super Bowl
... or a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the league really wants parity, it would allow the
former NBA legends to suit up for their respective teams. If the
WNBA is lucky, maybe Magic Johnson will pull another Ali and
unretire for the millionth time.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, scrap that. Let's keep the men on the
sidelines. nn

COMETS SET SIGHTS ON THIRD CONSECUTIVE TITLE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three years ago, Louisiana Tech women's basketball
coach Leon Barmore was asked to coach the Houston Comets of the
WNBA. He passed.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they had enough good players,'' Barmore told
then Mississippi coach Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor agreed with Barmore, but then decided to play
Mississippi Gambler and accepted the job.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, former Texas Tech star Sheryl Swoopes was
appointed to the franchise. An unknown guard _ Cynthia Cooper _
returned from the European leagues to play for Houston at the age
of 34. And Tina Thompson was selected by the Comets in the league's
first draft.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, Cooper and Thompson have since combined to put the
Comets on the verge of a trilogy as dominant as ``Star Wars.'' The
Shooting Comets combine to average 48.7 points, 14.5 rebounds and
8.2 assists per game. One of the three has led the team in scoring
86 of 90 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston could represent the United States in the Olympics and
possibly win a gold medal,'' Detroit coach Nancy Lieberman-Cline
said. ``They have set the standards by which everyone tries to
measure themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the Olympics, but five teams will try to measure up
against the Comets as the WNBA playoffs begin in two cities Tuesday
night. Houston's postseason begins on Thursday in the Western
Conference finals against the winner of the Los Angeles-Sacramento
game.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past two seasons when Houston won by the combined
average of 16.1 points, the Comets don't appear to be as dominant;
they won by an average of less than 10 points this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Houston dominance is in the eye of the titleholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I see nothing but a three-peat,'' Comets center Kara
Wolters said.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets have a three-year winning clip of 79 percent, have
never lost more than two consecutive games, have outscored their
opponents by an average of 13.9 points, have a playoff record of
6-1, have a two-time league MVP in Cooper and a two-time coach of
the year in Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   However, as with any team that dominates, the seat on the throne
isn't eternal.
</P>
<P>
   With the tragic death of former teammate Kim Perrot last week,
the Comets might be more susceptible to defeat now than at any time
during their run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things could happen,'' Los Angeles coach Orlando Woolridge
said. ``They could be a little flat and vulnerable from the
emotional stress they are under. But, the flip side to that is that
is they could be very focused. I know when I was with the (NBA's)
Pistons and Lakers they lost some of that hunger after two titles.
But when you get a team like that that has something to rally
behind, it makes them more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Perrot's death, the toughest obstacle Houston had to
overcome was the league adding four teams since 1997. That, plus
the addition of the American Basketball League players, was thought
to narrow the gap between the also-rans and the Comets this season.
</P>
<P>
   The gap did close, just not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we can keep it going for as long as we can but the
competition level is so much better,'' Swoopes said. ``I am sure
the league doesn't want one team to dominate and that it's not good
for the sport. I think the league would love to see someone else
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Great, but who? The Comets have a winning record against every
team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The best candidates appear to be Los Angeles or Sacramento,
which both defeated Houston during the season. The top challenger
out of the Eastern Conference appears to be New York, the only
Eastern team to defeat Houston this season, and the East's only
team with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte and Detroit, which both finished 15-17, were a
combined 0-4 against the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is going to stop or not,'' Cooper said of
the Comets' title run. ``If I wasn't a Comet, yeah, it would better
for the league if in three different years there would be three
different championship teams. If that's not good for the league ...
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Barmore.

MISSOURI RESURGENCE NOW IN HANDS OF YOUNG PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 12 PREVIEW-MISSOURI-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Missouri football media guide boldly proclaims, ``It's a
great time to be a Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   At quick glance, that slogan would appear to be one of those
things that make you go hmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is coming off consecutive winning seasons for the first
time since 1982-83 and back-to-back bowl appearances for the first
time since 1980-81. So indeed, the past two seasons have been great
times to be a Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few of the players who contributed mightily to the
recent good times are now part of recent history _ players such as
quarterback Corby Jones, tailback Devin West, offensive guard Craig
Heimberger, defensive lineman Justin Wyatt, cornerback Wade Perkins
and safeties Harold Piersey and Caldrinoff Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a big challenge coming off two winning
seasons and an (Insight.com) bowl victory,'' coach Larry Smith
said. ``We return the least amount of experience over the last
three or four years, but the most talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith still can count on proven players such as All-Big 12
senior center Rob Riti and sophomore defensive end Justin Smith, a
first-team freshman All-American who might become the featured
player on a highly regarded defense. But much of the talent that
Smith sees is young and inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be scary when almost half of your top 44 are either
sophomores or redshirt freshmen,'' Smith conceded.''But we have a
stellar class of seniors, though not a whole lot of starters
(seven). The key is how they provide leadership to go with our good
young talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Riti knows what Smith is talking about. He's the only returning
starter on the offensive line. And now that returning fullback Rob
West is likely out for the first two games with a hairline fracture
in his left foot, Riti is one of only three senior starters on the
offensive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of questions are being asked _ specifically on offense _
and I don't blame people for asking,'' said Riti, who has received
considerable preseason All-America mention. ``We've seen a lot of
new faces over the winter and spring. But the developing players
are very talented, and all they lack is game experience, and that's
something I feel will come together the first two games of the
season (Alabama-Birmingham, Western Michigan).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys we have right now are very young. But they
were not with the program when we were losers, so to speak. And the
older guys have a real desire to be successful because of our
humble beginnings. We're used to winning now, and winning becomes
perpetual. You don't get used to it, but it becomes easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense is suspect. And after a week at Camp Wentworth,
where the Tigers go for two-a-days, one thing became readily
apparent. Either the offense is indeed a long way from putting it
together, or the Tigers' defense is as formidable as Smith and
others believe it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our marquee players are on our defense, which could
give us a chance to be outstanding,'' Smith said. ``We've got
talent, speed and maturity on defense. We feel like our defense is
going to have to carry us early to give the offense time to
mature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost some talent on offense, but we have to move on,'' said
corner Carlos Posey, one of defensive leaders. ``I feel like our
offense is going to be really good. But until then, our defense
just has to keep on doing what it's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   So it will still be a good time to be a Tigers defender,
provided too much isn't required of a good thing. nn

   Coach: Larry Smith (136-111 overall in 22 seasons, 26-31-1 at
Missouri in five seasons).
</P>
<P>
   1998: 8-4 overall, 5-3, third in North Division.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters: 5 on offense, 5 on defense.
</P>
<P>
   What has to go right: Either sophomore quarterback Jim Dougherty
or redshirt freshman Kirk Farmer must seize control of the offense,
or Smith is going to have to count on a system that utilizes the
talents of each in a manner that doesn't detract from the offensive
flow.
</P>
<P>
   What can't go wrong: Though inexperience is rampant, the Tigers
might survive wholesale losses in the offensive line _ which was a
major team strength last season _ unless injuries hit. Then, a
serious lack of depth will rear its ugly head.
</P>
<P>
   Update: The offense suffered recent unexpected losses when
sophomore offensive guard Jeff Hellerstedt, who started six games
last season, quit the team; junior wide receiver John Dausman was
lost for the season with a knee injury and West was lost for at
least the first two games with a hairline fracture in his left
foot. ... Dausman's loss leaves Mizzou with only two proven
receivers: senior Kent Layman (26 catches, 495 yards) and senior
Kareem Wise (9-143). ... Senior DeVaughn Black is listed as the No.
1 tailback to succeed Devin West (1,601 yards, 17 TDs), but
observers like the breakaway speed of sophomore backup Zain
Gilmore. ... Smith says that though neither of his two young
quarterbacks have the running ability of Corby Jones, both might
naturally be a little more adept at running a balanced passing
game.

EDITORIAL: SMALLER CLASSES, BETTER SCORES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Summer school this year was no picnic. New York City's hottest
July ever saw 37,000 children from grades three, six and eight
traipsing into schools with no air-conditioning. Teachers told of
having to buy their own course materials and of bringing fans from
home. Still, for some 60 percent of those students, the extra sweat
and effort were apparently worth it. They passed the tests that
allow them to go on to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   The testing data may still be ``pretty raw,'' as one school aide
describes the early results, but school officials are already
drawing an age-old lesson from their summer experiment. To make
progress on the basics of reading, math and English, most students
need small classes. This summer, most classes had only 10 students.
</P>
<P>
   The students forced to attend this summer's sessions had failed
achievement tests last spring. About 14,000 of them, according to
early estimates, failed the tests a second time this summer and
will stay back this fall. That is a disturbingly high failure rate,
but given that the summer session lasts only five or six weeks, it
seems fitting to celebrate the even higher success rate.
</P>
<P>
   Those students who remain behind are expected to study in
smaller classes than last year. Those who move ahead, however, will
return to classrooms where teachers manage an average of 25 to 29
students at a time. Many of those who passed the test this summer
should be given some additional attention this year so that they
will not slip below par again in the examinations next spring.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's mixed success should also sound an alarm about
next year's session. Because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Chancellor
Rudy Crew have decided to end social promotion in all grades, as
many as 300,000 students are expected to attend summer school in
2000, straining the system to the breaking point. The schools will
need air-conditioning and supplies, of course. Even more crucial,
however, will be the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   At present, educators are hired for summer sessions at an
average hourly pay rate that is lower, in most cases, than their
winter salaries. A special summer teachers' bonus should not be
beyond the reach of city officials. The school system will pay
bonuses this regular school year to teachers in the system's worst
40 schools. When summer school becomes the last chance for many
students to move up a grade, the chancellor should be able to offer
a similar sweetener to teachers to save the system's failing
students.

SEARS DROPS ITS TOO SUCCESSFUL `SOFTER SIDE OF SEARS' CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the death of a sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Come September, the successful ``Softer Side of Sears'' campaign
joins other memorable ones such as ``Good to the Last Drop'' and
``Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz, Oh What a Relief It Is'' in the graveyard
of slogans.
</P>
<P>
   For Sears, it was a situation of the softer side campaign,
designed to put some sizzle in its name, being too successful.
Sears wasn't able to deliver on the pizazz promised by the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign cleverly juxtaposed things such as hammers,
batteries and tires vs. items such as satiny robes, strappy black
dresses and sexy shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to get women between the ages of 25 and 54 into the
stores. That group controls at least 70 percent of all dollars
spent at Sears.
</P>
<P>
   In one ad a woman said, ``I came in for a DieHard _ and I left
with something drop dead,'' showing the model in a sexy black
dress.
</P>
<P>
   Sears' advertising agency was able to tweak the idea to cover
dozens of categories. Eventually, it evolved the tag line into
``Come See the Many Sides of Sears.'' The campaign had great legs.
</P>
<P>
   When it made its debut in 1993, Sears' Chairman Arthur Martinez
elaborated on the goal of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've listened carefully to the women who shop at Sears for
their families and homes and we know that they want affordable,
fashionable apparel for themselves,'' Martinez said. ``We want the
campaign to disarm the skeptics and pleasantly surprise our
customers and feature the kind of merchandise that's on our sales
floor right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone forgot to tell Sears' merchandising staff. The women
came in droves, but they didn't find the merchandise shown in the
ads. In the end, the empty promises turned off the customers Sears
was courting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sears has seen its sales slide. Sears finished 1998
with five consecutive months of same-store sales declines. This
year hasn't been much better.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the company has decided to do an about-face and
focus less on image and more on price.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mark Cohen, Sears' executive vice president of
marketing, elaborated in an Associated Press story on the
turnabout: ``Whether we like it or not, we're in a price-game war,
a value shootout with all our competition. With the Softer Side
campaign, the customer feedback has been, `We love the commercials,
imagery and models, but we don't find those goods at Sears.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, why not deliver on the softer side promise and make sure the
goods were there?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that we didn't have the merchandise featured, it was
that maybe we didn't have enough,'' said Sears' spokeswoman Lee
Antonio. ``If women came in three days after they saw the ad, the
merchandise featured might already be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   David Farmer, head of creative at Barkley Evergreen &AMP; Partners
in Kansas City, Mo., is a fan of the softer side campaign but
thinks Sears was faced with a tough choice.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer could have taken the campaign off the air while it
fixed the merchandising problem. Or it could start from scratch,
which is the route Sears has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of clients that say it's more important to
roll the dice and drive traffic to the stores, like Sears did, and
hope the brand experience lives up to the promise,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sears' new campaign will begin next month, dubbed
``The Good Life at a Great Price. Guaranteed. Sears.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio said it spoke for the whole house of Sears: ``This
covers everything from batteries to appliances to apparel. It's a
jungle out there, and we need to continue to be competitive on
pricing, but we've never shouted that and this campaign does
that.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but the aforementioned tag line could apply to any of a
dozen different retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very good measure of how well your campaign is connected to
your brand is if you put a competitor's logo at the end of it and
it works,'' Farmer said. ``If it does, then you haven't done your
job.''

 SGI Chief Belluzzo Resigns
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Henry Norr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Silicon Graphics Inc. CEO Richard Belluzzo resigned abruptly
yesterday, just 18 months after taking the job and less than two
weeks after announcing his latest plan to turn around the troubled
company.
</P>
<P>
   SGI, which made its name building high-powered graphics
workstations for engineers and for Hollywood special effects,
immediately announced the appointment of Robert Bishop to replace
Belluzzo as chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo, 45, had been frustrated in his efforts to restore the
Mountain View company to health. ``More and more, it's become clear
that this thing wasn't headed in the right direction,'' said
analyst Kimball Brown of Dataquest. ``I think he just got tired of
trying to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, 56, was a high-ranking sales executive at SGI between
1986 and 1995. Although not directly involved in the company's
management since then, he's been a member of its board of directors
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo's decision to resign was entirely his own, company
officials said in a telephone news conference yesterday. ``This was
a surprise to the company,'' said Bill Kelly, SGI senior vice
president and board secretary. ``It was certainly not
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Belluzzo would take a ``non-CEO'' job at a company
that does not compete with SGI but declined to provide further
details. Belluzzo could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1999 fiscal year, which ended June 30, SGI recorded a net
loss of $115 million, excluding proceeds from the sale of part of
its interest in MIPS Technologies, a subsidiary that designs
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, the company achieved a net profit of
$158 million, or $22 million excluding the MIPS sale, but Belluzzo
warned at the time that a return to sustained profitability was not
assured.
</P>
<P>
   On August 10, the company announced a massive restructuring,
including layoffs of between 1,000 and 1,500 of its 9,000
employees. Under that plan, SGI would sell off not only the Cray
supercomputer division, which it acquired in 1996, but also its
line of low-cost workstations based on Intel chips and Microsoft
Windows NT, which it introduced with great fanfare earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NT plan was a lot of what Belluzzo was betting on,''
Dataquest's Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, SGI will refocus on selling Unix-based
graphics workstations and Internet servers, especially for machines
serving up digital audio and video to customers with high-speed
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of SGI's board, Bishop was involved in development
of the latest plan, and he said yesterday that he fully supports
it. He added, though, that the company's key challenge now is
execution, and ``that's where we have some room for involvement or
fine-tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also reaffirmed the previously announced goal of returning to
profitability in the December quarter. Kelly said the restructuring
is proceeding ``acceptably.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the board decided not to conduct a search for a
new leader, Kelly said, ``We felt that with the amount of change
and work we have in front of us ... the company could not afford an
extended period of interim leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   SGI announced the change at the top after the close of trading
yesterday. Earlier, the stock rose 31 cents to close at $12.44.

   ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT EDITORS:
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, no one had a video collection. No one
bought laserdiscs or DVDs _ these words did not exist. If someone
asked, ``What should we rent?'' he was talking about a car.
</P>
<P>
   Today 80 percent of the people who own color televisions also
own VCRs. Video has changed our entire relationship with film and
moving images onscreen _ and important aspects of our
off-the-screen lives as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a package of stories on ``25 Years of Video,'' The San
Francisco Chronicle examines the video age, assesses its influence
on our lives, looks ahead to the future of home viewing and
celebrates some of the best and worst movies available on tape. All
stories will move in the ``e'' entertainment category:

 _ SF CHRON  
 Sun to Pony Up $540 Million for Forte Software
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Steve Ginsberg &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Sun Microsystems Inc. said yesterday that it is buying Forte
Software Inc. of Oakland in a $540 million stock deal that will
give Sun a broader range of software for electronic commerce
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Forte makes software tools and applications that run on a wide
range of computing platforms, including Sun's Java.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers use Forte's tools to customize software for
corporate networks. Its clients include MCI WorldCom, American
Airlines and Marriott International Corp., which uses its software
in online reservations system. Telecommunications companies are
using Forte's tools and software to develop their automated call
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Sun chief executive Scott McNealy has positioned his company to
be the leader in e-commerce, and that has meant diversifying
quickly into tools and software applications that let Sun's
computer servers be used for Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has made other four other acquisitions since October, but
the Forte deal is a sign that Sun is willing to spend heavily to
acquire software that will run on hardware from companies such as
Hewlett-Packard and IBM, as well as Sun's Java.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge for a hardware company is to become a
complete supplier of systems of hardware, software and development
tools. What Sun must do is buy the parts they don't have,'' said
John Jones Jr., technology analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. With
the market moving at Internet speed, buying rather than building is
the best strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun will exchange 0.3 share of its stock for every Forte share.
That values Forte at $22.43 per share, based on Sun's closing price
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Forte's shares soared $4.13 _ about 24 percent _ to $21.13
yesterday, while Sun's shares closed at $74.81, up 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Forte's stock traded as high as $80 two years ago, but the
company's original technology didn't change quickly enough, and
Forte, until recently, didn't have enough other products to
maintain profitability. Forte lost $1.2 million on sales of $79.5
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, by comparison, earned $1.15 billion on revenues of $11.7
billion in fiscal 1999, which ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected that Forte eventually would sell out but
thought that it would fetch at least $40 a share. They said Forte
wasn't far along in its turnaround to get the higher price
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Forte chief executive Marty Sprintzen defended the deal in a
teleconference, saying the chance to merge with Sun, a leader in
e-commerce, might not be available later and would add value for
shareholders over time.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Forte's headquarters will remain in Oakland and will continue to
be led by Sprintzen. The company will keep its 49 offices and will
add to its 400 employees, Sprintzen said.
</P>
<P>
   Security analysts said Sun is buying Forte at six times
revenues, a reasonable price compared with some software deals that
are well over 10 times revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Sun's acquisitions could be accelerating. Cnet
reported on Friday that Sun has agreed to acquire Star Division, a
German software-maker whose lead product is comparable to Microsoft
Office. Cnet said the deal was signed August 11 and is expected to
be announced August 31.
</P>
<P>
   Zander would not comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is consummated, it would push Sun into direct
software competition with Microsoft.

   ``SELECTED NON-FICTIONS'' &QL; 
By Jorge Luis Borges (Viking, $40) &QL; 
``The angels are two days and two nights older than we: The Lord
created them on the fourth day, and from their high balcony between
the recently invented sun and the first moon, they scanned the
infant earth, barely more than a few wheat fields and some orchards
beside the waters.'' With his essay ``A History of'' ``Angels,''
written in 1926, Borges rescues us from the tripe written on the
subject in recent years and leaves us to wonder whether Wim Wenders
read this before he made his haunting film about angels, ``Wings f
Desire.'' ``I always imagine them at nightfall,'' Borges writes,
``in the dusk of a slum or a vacant lot, in that long, quiet moment
when things are gradually left alone, with their backs to the
sunset, and when colors are like memories or premonitions of other
colors. We must not be too prodigal with our angels; they are the
last divinities we harbor, and they might fly away.'' This is the
third volume in Viking's centenary edition of Borges' work in
English, coming after ``Collected Fictions'' and ``Selected
Poems.'' Borges wrote thousands of pages of non-fiction _ essays,
book and film reviews, lectures, encyclopedia entries, historical
surveys and notes on politics and culture, and from them, editor
Eliot Weinberger chose 161 pieces. Most appear in English for the
first time. The rest were newly translated for this edition. Among
the films reviewed (albeit briefly _ as Weinberger notes, Borges
never wrote anything long) are ``King Kong'' and ``The Petrified
Forest.'' Among the books: William Faulkner's ``Absalom! Absalom!''
and Ellery Queen's ``The Door Between.'' It's a marvelous
collection, published to celebrate what would have been Borges'
100th birthday in late August. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HEARTWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By James Lee Burke &QL; 
(Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this novel is a bit busy _ to say that it's complex is to
give it too much credit _ but Burke is so much better than other
crime writers that he pulls it off anyway. From the first pages,
we're aware of his virtuosity, although that seems like an odd word
to apply to a man whose characters are world-weary moralists and
vicious schemers and whose setting in this new series (in wake of
his books about Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux) is a Texas hill town
called Deaf Smith. The hero is Billy Bob Holland, the former police
officer/Texas Ranger-turned-defense attorney, last seen in
``Cimarron Rose.'' In the early pages, Billy Bob suffers the return
to town of a rich man named Earl Deitrich, who long ago wooed and
married Peggy Jean Murphy, the local beauty who was Billy Bob's
high-school lover. Billy Bob is still hung up on Peggy Jean, and
she is still hung up on a boy who died in Vietnam _ both obsessions
that are difficult to believe as the book progresses. Their
attraction is further complicated because the cowboy Billy Bob
takes on as a client is accused of stealing $300,000 in bonds from
Peggy Jean's husband. More plot description would merely make you
dizzy _ suffice it to say that Burke makes all of his characters,
even the odd ones, as real as a Texas moon, and his setting becomes
a character in itself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING ON THE WIND: &QL; 
ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE &QL; 
WITH MIGRATORY BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Weidensaul &QL; 
(North Point, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thre are some shorebirds that fly non-stop from the southern tip
of South America to the coast of New Jersey _ a trip that takes 10
days, an astonishing 240 hours of uninterrupted flight. And there
are Arctic terns that each autumn fly across the Atlantic to
Europe, then south along Africa to recross the Atlantic toward
South America, finally wintering off of Antarctica. In spring,
writes the author, ``they reverse course, moving up southern Africa
and lancing back to Canada _ a figure eight inscribed on half the
globe, a track that returns them, often as not, to precisely the
same sheltered nook where they nested the summer before.'' Is there
anything more miraculous, more ethereal, more mysterious than the
epic migrations of birds? Weidensaul explores the process with
eloquence, meticulous research and considerable reverence _ and it
does not hurt that his subject is rife with fantastic facts. Did
you know that there are hummingbirds that cross the Gulf of Mexico
twice each year and tiny warblers that fly non-stop from New
England to South America? Did you know that albatrosses leaving the
nest might pass the next four years without touching land?
Weidensaul spent more than six years researching his book,
traveling 70,000 miles by plane, car, boat, horse and foot _ and
yet, he says, he covered fewer miles than a sandpiper would in its
short lifetime, propelled only by muscle and the instinct to trace
those invisible pathways in the sky. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DAYS OF INFAMY &QL; 
By Michael Coffey  &QL; 
(Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A companion volume to the History Channel's documentary
``Military Blunders,'' this is a survey of mistakes that had
terrible consequences. If the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's chauffeur
had asked directions in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, he would not
have taken the wrong turn that led to the archduke's assassination.
If the captain of the Lusitania had steered in a zig-zag pattern as
advised, he might have avoided the torpedo that sank the ship and
drew America into World War I. If naval commanders had not
underestimated the threat of air power, the British would not have
suffered the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse, two of their
finest ships. If German fliers attempting to destroy oil tanks on
the English coast had not lost their way and bombed the outskirts
of London instead, orders (on both sides) to avoid populated areas
might have stood, saving civilian lives during World War II. You
like war stories? Coffey has war stories, and they prove just how
slender the thread of fate can be. &QL;

25 YEARS OF VIDEO: HOW IT CHANGED OUR LIVES AND THE WAY WE SEE  THE
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICK LaSALLE  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, no one had a video collection. No one
bought laserdiscs or DVDs _ these words did not exist. No one said,
``Let's watch a video,'' and if someone asked, ``What should we
rent?'' she was talking about a car.
</P>
<P>
   Today, video has permeated every aspect of our lives, not just
in the affluent United States but all over the world. Twenty-five
years after the first videotapes were manufactured in this country,
it's a good time to take a look at the changes and influences of
video on our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, video was on the way for a long time before it
actually arrived. As early as 1970, Life magazine ran a big feature
on the coming revolution, ``cassette TV,'' which discussed possible
formats, none of which caught on. In one, the cassettes weren't
videos at all. They had film inside.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the first Betamaxes became available. They cost $2,295
and few people bought them _ few even knew about them. Video didn't
really take off until 1980, when the price of a recorder in the VHS
format dropped to $800.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us at that time, our first encounter with video
remains our most profound experience of technology _ just as
television was for our parents. In December 1979, a friend took me
into his room to show me this big contraption he had gotten for
Christmas. The whole room smelled like the VCR _ that warm,
new-appliance smell. My friend pressed a button and the top sprang
open. He pulled the videotape out. It looked like an audiocassette
on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the future _ it actually seemed like that in the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, every time I saw a movie I loved, there was an
accompanying pain. I'd wait for it to be revived at a theater and
be thrilled when I'd see the listing. I'd check TV Guide every week
and do a double-take when it was finally there. I'd set my alarm
clock for 3 in the morning and watch it on the ``Late Late Late
Show.'' When it was over I'd feel sad because I never knew how long
I'd have to wait to see it again.
</P>
<P>
   Days of deprivation have a way of turning romantic when
remembered in days of plenty. Movies meant more to us before the
video revolution for the simple reason that we had no control over
when we got to see them. At the same time, I can't forget the sheer
thrill of seeing that video recorder for the first time, knowing
that from then on, things would be different.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us realized (set ital)how(end ital) different. Today 80
percent of the people who own color televisions also own VCRs, and
that's worldwide. Video has changed our entire relationship with
film and moving images onscreen _ and important aspects of our
off-the-screen lives as well. Here are a few of the ways:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Video Changed Our Relationship to Movie Stars: &LR;  Newspapers
and magazines make a big fuss over the fact that these days movie
and television stars cross over, whereas before there was a
dividing line between the two media. But nobody has pointed out
that the reason for this is video. (set ital)All(end ital) movie
stars are also TV stars. They are shrunk to fit a TV screen and can
be easily manipulated with a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Video Changed the Way We Watch Movies: &LR;  The first time I hit
rewind and made Marlene Dietrich walk backward across a room, I
felt as if I'd violated her. Before video, viewers didn't blink
during close-ups. Today, people blink ... and then rewind. We watch
movies the way we read books. We put them down and pick them up at
will, and we skim over the boring parts.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Video Created a Two-Tiered Hierarchy: &LR;  I don't quite
understand the concept of waiting until a film comes out on video
to see it for the first time if it's considered a subpar movie. If
a movie is bad, there's no reason to see it _ ever. But the concept
of ``wait for video'' is pervasive. Thanks to video, people end up
seeing more mediocre movies than they ever would have previously.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Fans Don't Have to Chase Movies to the Suburbs: &LR;  Before
video, if you missed a movie the first time around, or loved one
and wanted to keep seeing it, you had to follow it to the
third-string theaters. Then it would disappear for a year before
appearing on network television in edited form. Today, a fan can
wait a few months and buy the video.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; Video Influences Box Office: &LR;  The last ``Austin Powers''
movie made only about $50 million at the box office, but it became
such a hit on video that everyone knew that the sequel, ``The Spy
Who Shagged Me,'' would be huge. And it was.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Video Keeps Film Historians Honest: &LR;  In the 1960s and '70s,
film historians could write anything. They relied on their memories
or the memories of others, and the result was mistake after
mistake. It's not just that they didn't have video recorders. They
knew readers didn't have them. Film historians today have to know
what they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Video Has Changed Courtship Patterns: &LR;  In modern America, the
first sex date is often a video date. Men used to say, ``Would you
like to see my etchings?'' Now they say, ``How about if I make
dinner and we rent a movie?'' Sinatra on the phonograph has been
replaced by Harrison Ford on the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Video Changed Our Relationship With the Present: &LR;  People
videotape their weddings and then forget the actual wedding and
remember only the video. They pay money to go on vacation to a
foreign country and see it through the lens of a camcorder. In one
of the few light moments in the horror film ``The Sixth Sense,'' a
children's play begins and an entire audience of parents begins
videotaping the performance.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Video Changed Our Relationship With the Past: &LR;  One of the
heartaches unique to the 20th century is being able to see
cherished past events and even dead loved ones come alive again
