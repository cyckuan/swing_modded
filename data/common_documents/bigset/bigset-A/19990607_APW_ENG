<HEADLINE>  Is Pope Making Final Visit Home? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GDANSK, Poland (AP) -- Agnieszka Kaliszewska was born the same  
year that Karol Wojtyla became the first Polish pope. In a devout 
Roman Catholic country, her faith has been shaped and inspired by 
the personal connection Poles feel with their beloved ``papa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 21-year-old economics student is wondering if the  
elderly pope she waited more than six hours to see is making his 
final visit home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the only pope we've known,'' she said amid 700,000 other  
believers at a huge outdoor Mass. ``We've gotten used to the fact 
that the pope is Polish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Poles of all ages, John Paul represents the light at the end  
of a century of mostly darkness -- two world wars, Nazi and Soviet 
domination, communist oppression. His papacy raised Poland's status 
in the world and helped create the Solidarity movement that toppled 
communist rule in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people identify with soccer teams. We identify with the  
pope,'' Jola Lopaciuk, 45, explained at a Sunday morning Mass in 
the northern town of Pelplin. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 79, John Paul is visibly weakened, walking slowly and  
stiffly with a cane. His left hand shakes noticeably and his speech 
sometimes slurs, raising suspicions of Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	No one wants to call the 13-day pilgrimage that began Saturday  
in this Baltic coast city their last chance to see him, but the 
question inevitably enters any discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this is his last visit,'' Lopaciuk says. ``He's  
so beautiful and smiles so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Teresa Rosinska, 60, traveled more than 180 miles from  
Wroclaw to see the pope Sunday partly because of her concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is probably his last visit because of health reasons, and  
that's why this Mass has a special dimension for us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Kaliszewska arrived at the horse track in Gdansk at  
10 a.m. to get a good spot near the front for the Mass that began 
at 5:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Her boyfriend, Pawel Maciejewski, 26, said he feared the worst  
when John Paul visited Poland in 1997, his infirmities more evident 
than on previous trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking that might be the last time,'' he recalled.  
``(Now) my fears have gone away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, a new pope should mean little change for Poland,  
according to Maciejewski. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pope is the deputy or substitute of Christ in the world,  
and Christ is always the same,'' he said. ``It will certainly 
affect Poland in some way, perhaps in a political dimension. But in 
a religious dimension, it will have no effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaliszewska isn't worried that the church's influence will  
disappear with Poland's pope. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our task, that we convey it to the next generation,''  
she said, smiling. ``We are young and we have to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Gates Tape Played for Bristol Jurors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates  
answered questions in an antitrust case filed by a tiny Danbury 
software firm, he was less combative than he had been when 
government lawyers grilled him in the larger antitrust case filed 
by the U.S. Justice Department and 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gates' message was the same. He said Microsoft had not tried  
to squash its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a videotaped deposition played for jurors in U.S. District  
Court Monday, Gates denied Microsoft had tried to freeze out 
Bristol Technology Inc. of Danbury after initially giving it access 
to Windows programming code. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for Bristol peppered Gates with questions on an  
e-mail message in which he wrote that Microsoft was choosing 
Bristol's main competitor, Mainsoft Inc., as its partner, and 
``revving up their activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, who appeared combative and forgetful during a lengthy  
deposition last year for the antitrust case being heard in 
Washington, D.C., was generally congenial and relaxed during the 
deposition for the Bristol case. 
</P>
<P>
	During his deposition for the Justice Department case, Gates  
appeared so evasive in interviews with government lawyers that the 
judge laughed and shook his head while watching the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs  
that were written for Windows to run on computers with different 
operating systems, such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Microsoft signed a three-year contract with Bristol  
giving the company access to programming code -- the software 
blueprints -- for Windows NT 3.0, a version of its operating system 
designed to work with powerful corporate computers. 
</P>
<P>
	When the contract expired in 1997, the two companies could not  
come to an agreement. Bristol claims Microsoft promised to make the 
code available into the future. Microsoft says Bristol is trying to 
get more favorable licensing terms for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Bristol's lawyers questioned Gates about a  
September 1997 e-mail he sent to several Microsoft employees. In 
it, Gates lists eight actions Microsoft was taking, including 
choosing Mainsoft as a partner in its cross-platform program, 
called the Windows Interface Source Environment, or WISE. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol had also been a WISE partner with Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now what did you mean -- if you didn't mean to exclude Bristol  
from the WISE program -- then what did you mean by picking Mainsoft 
as your partner?'' Bristol attorney Patrick Lynch asked Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean anything about whether it was Mainsoft or  
Bristol, I'm just talking about the things we're doing, so for 
total completeness, maybe I should have listed Bristol,'' Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, and you didn't mean to tell your people that for some  
reason you had decided to freeze Bristol out of the WISE program?'' 
Lynch asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Gates replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury appeared alternately amused and bored by Gates'  
testimony. At one point, several jurors chuckled when Gates became 
animated about the competitive threat posed by Netscape -- an issue 
in the case brought by the Justice Department case and 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the government contends that Microsoft illegally  
wielded monopoly power from its dominant Windows product to expand 
into new markets, such as Internet software, and thus crush 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Netscape stated very clearly that their goal was to put  
Windows out of business, to make it obsolete and useless, and that 
Microsoft would go bankrupt based on their activities,'' Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that caused you to believe that it was a serious  
competitive threat?'' asked Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, when people say those things, it gets my  
attention,'' Gates said.

	U.N. Resolution Negotiations Stall  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and  
foreign ministers negotiating Balkan peace failed to agree today on 
a U.N. resolution critical to ending the Kosovo crisis. The impasse 
came after the Russian delegation contested three key points and 
requested time to consult with Moscow. Despite the stalemate, 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic offered assurances that he 
intends to carry out a peace agreement, a U.S. official said. 
Western officials indicated that the talks were stalled on NATO's 
insistence that it be at the core of a peace force. Discussions are 
to resume tomorrow.

	East Simmers in Hot, Humid Weather  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Temperatures soared into the 90s today across  
much of the East, making it hot and sticky early in the season. 
Readings rose past the 90-degree mark by early afternoon from the 
Mississippi Valley to the East Coast, and all the way north to New 
England, where Portland, Maine, topped out at 95, a full 10 degrees 
over today's record and the hottest day there since July 1995. In 
North Carolina, a section of Business Interstate 40 was closed at 
Winston-Salem because the pavement buckled in the heat.

	Study of Mentally Ill Proposed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress today to  
ensure that Americans with mental illness get the same benefits 
they have for a broken leg or an asthma attack. Without proper 
treatment, he told a White House conference, ``the loss of human 
potential is staggering.'' The conference was led by Tipper Gore, 
who recently disclosed she suffered clinical depression after her 
son was hit by a car 10 years ago. The conference focused on making 
people understand that mental illness is a sickness much like any 
other and that no one should feel shame or suffer discrimination 
for getting treatment.

	Clinton Signs Letter for Gore

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After acknowledging concerns about the slow  
start of Al Gore's campaign, President Clinton lent a hand by 
signing a fund-raising letter mailed to 750,000 Democrats by Gore's 
team. Clinton's letter includes a swipe at unidentified ``powerful 
forces'' -- a clear reference to congressional Republicans. ``They 
continue to resist change -- trying, over and over again, to return 
our country to the policies that have failed,'' Clinton wrote. 
Clinton has said he will formally endorse Gore once the vice 
president officially declares his candidacy.

	Study Dispels Doubts on Heart Pills  
</P>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The second large-scale study of beta  
blockers found they should be prescribed to more heart failure 
patients, researchers said today. The findings, to be published in 
Saturday's British journal Lancet, ought to dissolve lingering 
questions about the drug, the study's chairman said. Beta blockers 
have been used since the 1960s to treat high blood pressure and 
certain heart conditions. Doctors initially doubted they also could 
help congestive heart failure patients, and worried the drugs 
instead could do harm. But in recent years, scientists have found 
that beta blockers, which work by reducing the heart's workload, 
can help heart failure patients.

<HEADLINE> Charles Kuralt's Secret Life Emerges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA CITY, Mont. (AP) -- Charles Kuralt, CBS's folksy ``On  
the Road'' correspondent, spent years exploring America's 
out-of-the-way places in search of oddball stories. But the best 
story may have been the one he never told. 
</P>
<P>
	For 29 years, until his death in 1997, he kept a mistress and  
maintained a second family. The celebrated journalist was, in 
effect, husband and father to them, as well as breadwinner, friend 
and hero. 
</P>
<P>
	While his wife remained at their home in the concrete canyons of  
New York City, he nurtured his secret life along a rushing trout 
stream in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this would come out, however, until after his death,  
when his mistress, Patricia Elizabeth Shannon, sued to get a 
Montana retreat he promised her. Montana's Supreme Court ruled last 
month that the woman is entitled to a trial on her claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuralt was TV's rumpled Everyman, a bald, pudgy figure renowned  
for his sonorous voice and eloquent commentary. He died at 62 of 
complications from lupus on July 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He met the woman he once said ``enriched my life beyond all my  
dreams'' the year after he started his ``On the Road'' travels. At 
33, he already was acclaimed for ferreting out quirky vignettes of 
Americana. He was also six years into his second marriage, to 
Suzanna ``Petie'' Flosom Baird, and had two daughters, both from 
his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shannon was a divorced, 34-year-old social activist and  
mother of three. She declined to be interviewed, but court 
documents tell much of their story. 
</P>
<P>
	They met in 1968 in Reno, Nev., where Ms. Shannon was leading an  
effort to build a park in a black neighborhood. Tensions were high 
following the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert 
F. Kennedy. It was a natural Kuralt story. 
</P>
<P>
	He did his reporting job, then asked her to dinner, showing up  
with three dozen long-stemmed roses. They spent the night sitting 
and talking in the lounge of Reno's Holiday Motel. 
</P>
<P>
	She knew he was married. But with the freedom his travels gave  
him, Kuralt called her frequently. He visited for two or three days 
every few weeks. He doted on her, sending gifts and money. He was 
there for family gatherings, football games, holidays and 
graduations. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in New York, Mrs. Kuralt was aware her husband had a  
fishing place in Montana. But according to court files, she had no 
inkling of his second family. She has declined all interview 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shannon estimated Kuralt sent $600,000 during the first  
decade, when their romance was the most intense and they saw each 
other often. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles always said, his refrain through all of his life,  
`Don't worry, we're rich,' he would say. ... He was the breadwinner 
of the family,'' Ms. Shannon recalled. ``Charles took care of all 
my needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He provided Ms. Shannon and her children with a succession of  
homes in San Francisco. He spent as much as $400,000 to help her 
start a small business that eventually failed and paid for her to 
study landscaping in London. 
</P>
<P>
	He paid for her son, J.R., to attend college in Arizona and put  
Ms. Shannon's elder daughter, Kathleen Baker, through law school. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought Ms. Shannon a $50,000 cottage in Ireland and purchased  
20 acres along the banks of the Big Hole River in Montana. They 
built a cabin there. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuralt bought an additional 90 acres abutting the land and moved  
an old schoolhouse to a bluff overlooking the river. He spent 
$180,000 to renovate the school into an office where he planned to 
write after his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The few letters from Kuralt to Ms. Shannon that are in the court  
file contain little romance. However, a handwritten, undated 
Christmas poem comes close. 
</P>
<P>
	Titled ``What I Will Give You (A Christmas IOU),'' the verse  
promised: ``A string of pearls, a suit and sweater, a Rubens print, 
a holly tree, and me. A mixing bowl, a sofa and chair, a set of 
china, a butcher's knife. My life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuralt also inscribed Ms. Shannon's copy of his 1995 book  
``Charles Kuralt's America'' this way: ``To Pat, who enriched my 
life beyond all my dreams. Love, Charles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuralt sometimes signed notes to Kathleen and J.R. as ``Pop.''  
In a 1995 letter to J.R., Kuralt enclosed money and wrote: ``I love 
you like a son, even though I have been an often-distracted 
father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles was basically a father to me,'' Kathleen said at a  
court hearing. ``He gave me some of my first driving lessons. He 
was there at all the holidays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the relationship wore on, Ms. Shannon became increasingly  
frustrated with Kuralt's unwillingness to leave his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought he would get a divorce at some point,'' she  
said in a deposition. ``I went through bouts of despair and there 
were arguments, but we never directly talked about -- about his life 
in New York. I knew it existed. ... I did not inquire into it and 
he didn't discuss it with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation worsened after Kuralt's ``On the Road'' assignment  
ended in 1980, when he became host of CBS's ``Sunday Morning.'' His 
schedule less flexible, he traveled less and spent more time in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they would usually rendezvous for three weeks each  
September. They backpacked the mountains. He loved to flyfish 
meandering creeks; she would sit on the banks nearby and read. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months before he died, Kuralt orchestrated a mock sale to  
hide the fact he was giving Ms. Shannon the original Montana 
property. He sent her $80,000; she used it to buy the 20 acres and 
the cabin they had built. 
</P>
<P>
	The court fight is over the other land and schoolhouse, valued  
at $600,000. Kuralt's will, written in 1994, left the property to 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shannon contends his last letter to her, two weeks before  
his death, conveyed their Montana home to her. It read: ``I'll have 
the lawyer visit the hospital to be sure you inherit the rest of 
the place in MT, if it comes to that.''

<HEADLINE> Monday's Supreme Court Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Limited, by a 6-3 vote in an Illinois case, state prison  
inmates' access to federal courts by ruling that federal appeals 
cannot raise claims omitted from appeals to their state's highest 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled by a 7-1 vote in a Colorado case that billions of dollars  
worth of methane gas found with coal under federal land is not 
owned by the government and can be claimed by companies that

to racketeering.

<HEADLINE> UAW Pleads for Buick City Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Union leaders made a last-ditch plea to  
General Motors Corp. management Monday to replace the aged Buick 
City car assembly plant in Flint, Mich., after it closes next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	But with declining demand for large cars, it remains unlikely  
the plant will be replaced, GM President G. Richard Wagoner Jr. 
said at the company's annual meeting. GM has been plagued for years 
with too many car plants as more consumers have shifted to light 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Art McGee, president of United Auto Workers Local 599 in Flint,  
noted that the plant recently earned the top award for initial 
vehicle quality from J.D. Power and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee urged management to keep the work force intact to take  
advantage of the teamwork that resulted in the award. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they can make money if they put another plant at that  
facility,'' McGee said later. ``We're telling them something that's 
good for the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner said the Buick City workers were being offered jobs at  
other GM plants and that the automaker ``will continue to pursue 
opportunities'' for other investments in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Until two weeks ago, the plant made the Buick LeSabre and  
Pontiac Bonneville; pending its closure July 2, the plant is only 
producing Bonnevilles. Production of both full-size sedans is 
shifting to two plants near Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Though UAW headquarters in Detroit will not make Buick City an  
issue in this year's national contract talks with GM, McGee said 
the local will continue pressing GM to replace the plant, even 
after its closure. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner said after the meeting that he expected GM's U.S. market  
share to go up, but that the company won't spend much more in the 
form of discounts to buy share. GM has been struggling since last 
year's devastating parts plant strikes in Flint to get its share 
back above 30 percent, the level at which its North American 
operations are designed to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	GM chairman Jack Smith said little about the pending contract  
talks, which officially get under way next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're focused on a good working relationship,'' he said.  
``We're putting a lot of effort into it. The union leadership is as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his speech to shareholders, Smith said GM will introduce  
14 new vehicles in the U.S. market this year -- about half of which 
``will be innovative concepts aimed at redefining product segments 
and creating new segments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM has long been criticized for a lack of leadership in styling  
and innovation. At this year's Detroit auto show, GM showed off 
some small ``crossover'' concept vehicles that combine features of 
cars and sport utility vehicles

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 57.30 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today as corporate mergers helped  
distract investors from lingering concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
57.30 at 10,857.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 3.29 at 1,331.04, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 25.78 at 2,504.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was light as traders already began looking ahead to  
Friday, when the government's producer price index is expected to 
offer signals about inflation and perhaps an indication of whether 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to keep the economy 
from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have slipped in the weeks since the Fed warned it might  
raise rates, and volume has been lower than normal as Wall Street 
weighs the impact of a possible increase. On Friday, the Dow made 
one of its strongest rallies in weeks, gaining 136.15 to close at 
10,799.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Major corporate mergers stimulated trading today. AlliedSignal  
rose 4 1/2 to 62 7/8 and Honeywell rose 7 13/16 to 112 13/16 after the 
companies announced they will merge, creating an aerospace 
parts-and-electronics conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Salt Lake City banks, First Security Corp. and Zions  
Bancorp, will merge in a deal worth $5.9 billion. First Security 
rose 6 to 24 5/8, and Zions fell 6 1/8 to 59 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express rose 1 3/4 to 127 after Prudential Securities  
raised its rating on the stock. Prudential cited rising credit card 
use in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad base of good corporate news heartened Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those sessions where all is right with the  
world,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 285.1 million 
shares, well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.77 to 635.29, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.74 at 777.24.

<HEADLINE> Honeywell Has Diverse History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- During the Vietnam war, protesters regularly  
circled Honeywell Inc. headquarters and chained themselves near the 
entrance to condemn the manufacture of a shrapnel-producing bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Police with gas masks used billy clubs and Mace to clear  
protesters gathered outside the 1970 annual meeting as the smell of 
marijuana hung in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Those days are gone. Honeywell spun off its bomb business in  
1990. After ventures into mainframe computers and 
telecommunications, Honeywell went back to what it did best, making 
control systems for buildings, industry and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the company best known for its trademark round  
thermostats is a beloved corporate citizen with roots deep in the 
city's center and deep pockets for funding community projects. 
</P>
<P>
	At Honeywell's annual meeting in April, there was not a single  
question or comment from shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	So community leaders were staggered Monday when Honeywell  
announced it would be acquired by AlliedSignal Inc. and give up its 
Minneapolis headquarters. The combined company will keep the 
Honeywell name, but it will be based at Allied's home of 
Morristown, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton was shocked and said  
there was no opportunity for officials to try to change Honeywell's 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell, with its headquarters building in the middle of a  
decaying part of the city's near south side that is known as the 
Phillips neighborhood, has been working with other Minneapolis 
companies to revitalize the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what people are most worried about,'' Sayles Belton  
said. ``You have people in the Phillips neighborhood moving from 
poverty to self-sufficiency because of the efforts of Honeywell ... 
and will that stop? That can't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bonsignore -- Honeywell's chief executive, who will lead  
the combined company -- immediately gave assurance that Honeywell 
will not diminish its community and philanthropic support of $7 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a wide-ranging patronage.  
</P>
<P>
	Under a five-year program that began in 1995, Honeywell is  
providing Habitat for Humanity with 4,000 employee volunteers and 
10,000 energy-saving home thermostats, plus annual donations of 
more than $100,000 for construction material. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell also houses New Vistas High School within its  
corporate headquarters, giving pregnant and teen-age mothers the 
chance to continue their education. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Honeywell is among companies that support the  
Success by Six program that helps children from infancy to age six, 
and it backs Minnesota HEALS (Hope, Education And Law &AMP; Safety), a 
public-private collaboration that implements crime prevention 
strategies in troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	While the merger is expected to eliminate 1,500 jobs in and  
around Minneapolis, the announcement comes at a time when 
Minnesota's unemployment rate is at a record low 2.1 percent and as 
other companies are begging for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately today's business climate is such that many of  
Minnesota's very successful businesses need to grow in order to 
remain competitive in a global economy,'' said Gov. Jesse Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often the way to grow is to consolidate or merge with similar  
companies,'' Ventura added. ``Given these circumstances, we are 
fortunate that Honeywell has found a continued path of success and 
will be part of our state for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell traces its roots to 1885, when Al Butz invented a  
device in his Minneapolis workshop that used electrical signals to 
adjust the damper of a coal furnace in an attempt to regulate 
heating and make Minnesota winters more livable. 
</P>
<P>
	His Damper Flapper became the foundation of an international  
controls business that had $8.43 billion in sales last year and 
57,500 employees in 95 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 percent of Honeywell's sales still come from home and  
building controls. Industrial controls make up an almost a third of 
its sales and space and aviation controls account for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The company didn't take on the Honeywell name until 1927, when  
Minneapolis Heat Regulator Co. merged with Mark Honeywell Heating 
Specialties Co., of Wabash, Ind., to become Minneapolis-Honeywell 
Regulator Co. The next year, the company went public. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, Honeywell introduced the Honeywell Round thermostat.  
The design later was registered as a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's name was officially changed to Honeywell Inc. in  
1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell worked with the military during World War II to design  
instruments and control systems for bombers as it was expanding its 
product line. It entered the computer business through acquisitions 
in the 1970s, but fled the field by the early 1990s. In 1990, 
Honeywell renamed its defense and marine systems holdings Alliant 
Techsystems Inc., then shed that business. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1990s Honeywell has been refocusing on its core  
business of controls and growing through acquisitions in both the 
United States and overseas. In 1995, Honeywell built its first 
manufacturing plant in China to produce heating controls for 
apartment and commercial buildings.

<HEADLINE>  NATO To Intensify Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TABANOVCE, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO threatened to intensify its  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia after talks on implementing a Kosovo 
peace plan collapsed early today, putting the entire settlement in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the talks' failure -- which U.N. and NATO  
officials blamed on Belgrade -- Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright arrived in Bonn, Germany, for talks today with foreign 
ministers from Russia and the other members of the Group of Eight, 
which drew up the principles of the Kosovo peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also will meet separately with Russian Foreign Minister  
Igor Ivanov. A Russian envoy pressed Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to accept the peace deal, but since then Russian leaders 
have bristled at its provisions for a NATO-led peacekeeping force 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the Yugoslav troop  
withdrawal would be brought up at the G-8 meeting, which aims to 
draw up a U.N. resolution endorsing the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to reach agreement after two days of NATO-Yugoslav  
talks threatens the entire Kosovo settlement. NATO and Yugoslav 
officials held low-level ``liaison talks'' in Macedonia today. But 
little was expected from them. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement calls for the complete withdrawal of Yugoslav  
forces from Kosovo and the deployment of international peacekeepers 
to protect more than 855,000 ethnic Albanian refugees when they are 
repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance has ``no alternative but to continue and intensify  
the air campaign until such time as the Yugoslavs are prepared to 
implement the agreement fully and without ambiguity,'' said Lt. 
Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of NATO troops in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, a NATO spokesman said the alliance's  
attacks were ``accelerating towards their prior intensity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorties by allied jets had fallen to below 500 a day -- down from  
nearly 700 at the height of the bombing -- after Milosevic agreed to 
the peace plan on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said the Yugoslavs had put forward an  
unacceptable plan for the troop withdrawal during talks at an air 
base at Kumanovo, Macedonia, that began late Sunday and lasted 
until the early hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the Yugoslav proposals ``failed  
to guarantee the safe return of the refugees ... and the withdrawal 
of all Yugoslav forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Jackson was ready to reopen talks ``at any time.''  
Soon afterwards, the liaison talks -- designed primarily to keep 
communication channels open and not to make any decisions -- began 
at Tabanovce on the Yugoslav-Macedonia border. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic, who took  
part in the failed meeting, said Belgrade was ready to continue the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	British leaders said the Yugoslav proposals aimed to keep a  
significant military presence in Kosovo and they accused Belgrade 
of stalling in the pullback to eliminate evidence of war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been reports that behind this foot-dragging is a  
drive to destroy the evidence of their ethnic cleansing before the 
Serb troops depart,'' Defense Secretary George Robertson told a 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reports of burning of bodies are all too credible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC television the Yugoslav  
generals wanted to keep ``peacetime levels'' of troops in Kosovo -- 
possibly up to 15,000 soldiers. ``Well, that's a nonstarter,'' he 
said. NATO has said only hundreds of Yugoslav policemen could 
return into the province after the peacekeepers were in place. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Bacon said another sticking point was a timetable  
for the withdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Serb army and special 
police forces in Kosovo. He said the Yugoslav proposal would have 
``caused a delay in the entrance'' of the NATO-led peacekeeping 
force into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other problems for NATO. Greece refused permission  
today for 2,200 U.S. Marines to pass through its territory en route 
to Macedonia -- fearing an escalation of anti-NATO protests. The 
Marines were being sent to help set up a possible peacekeeping 
mission in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Air raid sirens sounded early today in Belgrade, the capital,  
for the first time in two days. Alerts were also sounded in Pancevo 
and Novi Sad to the north. But most major attacks were reported in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said this morning that over the past 24 hours its planes  
hit four tanks, 20 artillery pieces and 17 armored personnel 
carriers in attacks against Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Two waves of NATO jets attacked the Podujevo area, north of  
Kosovo's capital Pristina, early today, the state-run Tanjug news 
agency reported. Attacks were reported in six other Kosovo towns 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug said alliance aircraft launched more than 100 pieces of  
ordnance on targets throughout Kosovo over the last 24 hours. It 
said one person was killed and another wounded Sunday when NATO 
planes struck Donja Budriga village near Gnjilane, southeast of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacks late Sunday also targeted Yugoslav troops near the  
Albanian border fighting guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, 
but Yugoslav artillery continued to fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is the southernmost province of Serbia, the dominant  
republic in Yugoslavia. NATO's 11-week bombardment was designed to 
get President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace deal for Kosovo.

return into the province after the peacekeepers were in place. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Bacon said another sticking point was a timetable  
for the withdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Serb army and special 
police forces in Kosovo. He said the Yugoslav proposal would have 
``caused a delay in the entrance'' of the NATO-led peacekeeping 
force into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other problems for NATO. Greece refused permission  
today for 2,200 U.S. Marines to pass through its territory en route 
to Macedonia -- fearing an escalation of anti-NATO protests. The 
Marines were being sent to help set up a possible peacekeeping 
mission in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Air raid sirens sounded early today in Belgrade, the capital,  
for the first time in two days. Alerts were also sounded in Pancevo 
and Novi Sad to the north. But most major attacks were reported in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said this morning that over the past 24 hours its planes  
hit four tanks, 20 artillery pieces and 17 armored personnel 
carriers in attacks against Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Two waves of NATO jets attacked the Podujevo area, north of  
Kosovo's capital Pristina, early today, the state-run Tanjug news 
agency reported. Attacks were reported in six other Kosovo towns 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug said alliance aircraft launched more than 100 pieces of  
ordnance on targets throughout Kosovo over the last 24 hours. It 
said one person was killed and another wounded Sunday when NATO 
planes struck Donja Budriga village near Gnjilane, southeast of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacks late Sunday also targeted Yugoslav troops near the  
Albanian border fighting guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, 
but Yugoslav artillery continued to fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is the southernmost province of Serbia, the dominant  
republic in Yugoslavia. NATO's 11-week bombardment was designed to 
get President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace deal for Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Suspect Accused of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man accused of gunning down four people in a  
supermarket also raped an escort service employee an hour before 
the rampage and told her he planned to kill the first 19 people he 
saw, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zane Floyd, 23, was to be arraigned Monday on four counts of  
murder and one count of attempted murder, but prosecutor Bill Koot 
asked for a delay until Wednesday to allow for time to add sexual 
assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five people were in an Albertsons supermarket on Thursday  
when Floyd allegedly entered with a pump-action shotgun. 
Investigators said he gunned down some victims as he came upon 
them, and chased others down. Four employees were killed and one 
seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were still trying to determine the motive.  
</P>
<P>
	Koot said the 20-year-old escort service employee was told by  
her assailant that he had 19 rounds of ammunition and planned to 
kill the first 19 people he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some unexplained reason, he let her go rather than killing  
her,'' Koot said. ``He threatened to kill her, and he was going to 
kill her, but then he let her go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court Monday, Floyd showed no emotion. He was ordered held  
without bond, and a public defender was appointed for him.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against most other major  
currencies in European trading Monday -- and the battered euro fell 
to a new record low before staging a modest recovery. Gold prices 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0293, down from $1.0318 Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	But the currency of 11 European Union countries was up from  
$1.0260 that it hit soon after trading started with more bad news 
for the euro -- the breakdown of talks on a Serb withdrawal from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Friday: 120.91 Japanese  
yen, down from 121.84; 1.5403 Swiss francs, down from 1.5409; 
1.4712 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4715.

while the euro was worth $1.0282 and the British pound was worth 
$1.6002. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no

<HEADLINE> Lollobrigida a Guest at New Musical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- An older Esmerelda has welcomed the new.  
</P>
<P>
	Gina Lollobrigida, who played the gypsy Esmerelda in a 1956 film  
version of ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' got a standing ovation 
at the world premiere of a new version -- a stage musical by Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian actress was guest of honor at the brand-new,  
sold-out theater Saturday night for the unveiling of the adaptation 
of Victor Hugo's classic French novel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broadway-style show, produced at a cost of more than $25  
million, marks the first time Disney has put on a new show outside 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the creative team, including Academy Award-winning  
composer Alan Menken and Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning director 
James Lapine, is American, the show was translated during 
rehearsals into German. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening night audience, full of local celebrities, gave it  
wild cheers and a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Musical heaven,'' said Helmut Koprian, who came to the  
premiere from Hamburg with his wife. 
</P>

	Disney has said it would wait to see how the show does in Berlin  
before deciding whether to stage a production in the United States.

<HEADLINE> PBS Documentary Studies Free Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In ``Free Speech for Sale,'' Bill Moyers'  
disturbing documentary airing Tuesday, we glimpse a cartoon made 
for NBC's ``Saturday Night Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The animated satire, titled ``Media-opoly,'' razzes  
multinational conglomerates -- including NBC owner General Electric 
-- for using their media outlets to dominate and distort public 
discourse. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can use them to say whatever they please,'' croons the  
accompanying jingle, ``and put down the opinions of anyone who 
disagrees!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amusing and apt, the cartoon appeared on ``Saturday Night Live''  
in March 1998. But when that week's show was repeated last June -- 
whoops! -- the cartoon was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it worked comedically,'' explained ``SNL''  
executive producer Lorne Michaels, who scoffed at suspicions that 
the segment's dig at General Electric led to its disappearing act. 
</P>
<P>
	With his disclaimer, Michaels insulted our intelligence (though,  
as ``SNL'' viewers can attest, not for the first time). Veteran 
journalist Moyers doesn't. Airing on PBS Tuesday at 9 p.m. EDT, ``A 
Bill Moyers Special: Free Speech for Sale'' is truly must-see TV. 
</P>
<P>
	He begins with this stark assessment of the First Amendment at  
the turn of century: ``You can say anything you want to say. But if 
you really want to be heard today, we're talking big money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy that follows is in three acts.  
</P>
<P>
	First is the case of Cindy Watson, a North Carolina state  
legislator who was targeted by the state's powerful hog industry 
for her pro-environmental stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the cover of a group benignly dubbed Farmers for Fairness,  
a hog-industry consortium waged a massive advertising campaign 
against Watson. In her small rural district, she was helpless to 
raise money to respond in kind. Drowned out by her corporate 
opposition, she went down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, Moyers examines how the tobacco industry last year poured  
$40 million into a misleading ad campaign meant to derail the 
popular McCain Tobacco Bill. Big tobacco's strategy: Shift the 
debate from the health issues promoted by the bill, to the bill 
itself, which was demonized as a tool of big government. The bill 
died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the program looks at how media outlets that stood to  
gain from the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did scant reporting on 
its legislation -- especially provisions for which broadcasters had 
fiercely lobbied, such as further deregulation and the gift of 
public airwaves estimated to be worth $70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media did not want to discuss what it was doing,'' says  
Charles Lewis, director of the Center for Public Integrity. ``It 
would be like a bank robber saying ..., `Let's have a press 
conference in front of the bank.'...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union in  
Washington, D.C., echoes Lewis with the flip-side scenario: ``When 
there are very few companies that control the most popular media 
outlets, and there's a policy issue that comes up that could hurt 
them financially, it is very unlikely we're going to get a full 
airing of that issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview, Moyers called ever-more-consolidated  
ownership of the media ``the central issue that faces us as a 
democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the growing interlocking concentration of media power,  
where the agenda is set by fewer and fewer corporations, you have 
the issue of political worth and net worth intruding into the whole 
question of who gets heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a news outlet is taken over by a corporation, he added, ``I  
think there's little sense of the public trust involved, and 
imminent danger of conflict of interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Moyers directed blame not so much at the moguls as at the  
politicians who have let us down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens have a right to expect their elected representatives  
to raise important political and social issues. And yet these 
representatives, as we try to make clear in the broadcast, have 
been bought off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What to do? For starters, Moyers said, the public should  
understand that despite the veneer of multiplying, diverse outlets, 
these owners are actually diminishing in number. Today, only six 
corporate behemoths play a major role in virtually everything we 
see on television, from the programs to the pipeline of cable or 
satellite delivery: CBS, News Corp., Time Warner, Viacom, The Walt 
Disney Co., and, of course, General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think most people know how most of the main media now  
fall under the control of a small number of giant corporations and 
extremely wealthy and willful people,'' Moyers said. ``I don't 
think they give much thought to how the so-called marketplace of 
ideas is increasingly a function not of what people need to know as 
citizens, but what they can be sold as consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be missed, Moyers' ``Free Speech for Sale'' warns all too  
convincingly that we're being sold out. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gaines To Coach San Diego's IBL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- David ``Smokey'' Gaines, who coached Tony Gwynn  
and Michael Cage at San Diego State, is set to return to the San 
Diego basketball scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines will be named coach of San Diego Stingrays of the new  
International Basketball League on Wednesday, a source close to the 
team said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines didn't immediately return a phone call.  
</P>
<P>
	Gaines coached at San Diego State from 1979-87, compiling a  
112-117 record. His 1984-85 team went 23-8 and gained the school's 
only NCAA tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was a star point guard from 1978-81 before starring with  
the San Diego Padres. He still holds San Diego State's assists 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Cage played for the Aztecs from 1981-84 and was a first-round  
draft pick of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines was fired as San Diego State's coach in 1987 and  
reassigned within the athletic department. After he left the school 
in 1989, he worked in private business and as a scout for the 
Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to San Diego State, Gaines coached for two seasons  
at the University of Detroit, going 47-10 and reaching the NCAAs 
once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stingrays begin play in November.  
</P>
<P>
	San Diego has had miserable luck with pro basketball. The NBA's  
Rockets moved to Houston in 1971 and the Clippers to Los Angeles in 
1984; the ABA's Conquistadors and Sails folded; and a CBA team that 
moved here from Mexico City folded halfway through the 1995-96 
season.

<HEADLINE>  Rivers Will Coach Magic As He Played </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Doc Rivers plans to coach the same way he  
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm up here giving you no promises, except for I'm going to  
work as hard as I can work to try to make this a success,'' the 
ex-point guard said today after being named coach of the Orlando 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something new. I'm not walking into this saying that I  
know how to do it, that I'll be perfect at it,'' Rivers added. 
``I'm not going to tell you that. What I'll tell you is I'll work 
at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than enough for the Magic, who aren't nervous about  
passing the reigns of the team from a Hall of Fame coach to one 
with no previous experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who played with four different teams during a 13-year  
career that ended in 1996, becomes the second-youngest coach in the 
league behind New York's Jeff Van Gundy, who's also 37. 
</P>
<P>
	He inherits a team that could be headed for a massive overhaul  
after overachieving during the lockout-shortened regular season 
only to stumble in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides losing former coach Chuck Daly, who retired May 24, the  
Magic face the prospect of starting next season without four-time 
All-Star Penny Hardaway, who has said he'll exercise an option in 
his contract to become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This process many times comes down to a gut feeling, a gut  
instinct of who the right person is,'' general manager John Gabriel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Chuck, we got up here and said he's a guy who's seen it  
all and done it all. Doc's not going to be able to say that. His 
last experience was as a player. So what we did was we researched 
him like a player, talking to trainers and coaches and ex-G.M.'s 
and teammates of his. The information that came back was very 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who also interviewed for the Washington Wizards'  
coaching vacancy, signed a four-year guaranteed contract worth just 
over $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1983 second-round draft pick of Atlanta played 13 seasons  
for the Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, New York Knicks and San 
Antonio Spurs before retiring in 1996. He's spent the last three 
years working as a television analyst for Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot people ask why. They say: `You're doing TV. You have  
five and 10 seconds to second-guess everyone. If you go to the 
other side, that's going to change ... It's a big risk,''' Rivers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My answer is I'm a risk taker. My answer is this is what I  
want to be. This is what I want to do. And who cares about the 
risk. Look at the reward if things pay off. I don't really worry 
about risks. I tend to look at how I can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers averaged 10.9 points, 5.7 assists and 3 rebounds per game  
as a player and his teams made the playoffs 10 times. He played for 
the first eight years of his career in Atlanta, was an All-Star in 
1988 and is the Hawks' all-time leader in assists with 3,866. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rivers has no previous coaching experience, he played  
for some of the league's best, including Pat Riley, Larry Brown and 
Mike Fratello. 
</P>
<P>
	His philosophy and style, Rivers said, probably will reflect  
things he's learned from each of those coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can take all their best attributes. But if I had  
to say one thing I can guarantee we'll do, it's play defense,'' he 
said. ``You look at the history of this league. You win by stopping 
people at the end of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his lack of experience, Rivers intends to hire a  
veteran as his top assistant. Three former NBA coaches -- Dave Wohl, 
Jim Cleamons and Johnny Davis -- reportedly are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more questions Monday, though, about how he might get  
along with Hardaway, who sulked at times about his relationship 
with Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers said he will relate to the players by simply ``telling  
them the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt that I'll be challenged at times. I'm new.  
When the substitute teacher comes, you challenge her or him ... I 
think I'm up to that,'' he said. ``I just think you have to sell 
what you're trying to do. And that's win. There's no agenda with 
me. It's only about winning. I want to get to that point as soon as 
possible.''

<HEADLINE> NRA Tries to Rally Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the wake of the school shootings this  
spring in Colorado, House Republican leaders discussed legislation 
Monday that would restrict youth access to video games, movies and 
other items containing violent as well as sexually explicit 
material, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would require the music industry to provide  
stores with copies of song lyrics as a means of allowing adults to 
keep questionable products from their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions were among several prepared by Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, for inclusion in 
legislation cracking down on juvenile crime. The measure is 
expected to reach the House floor by next week, and has become the 
focus for responding to the April shooting deaths at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, however, are attempting to force passage of gun  
control provisions that cleared the Senate, including a requirement 
for mandatory background checks for all gun show sales. The 
National Rifle Association has launched a fresh effort to derail 
that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have said for weeks that the shootings  
underscored the need for steps to crack down on the often-violent 
images that youngsters are exposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on its precise wording, the proposal circulated by  
Hyde could spark strong objections from civil libertarians, as well 
as from the manufacturers of video games and other popular consumer 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	A summary of Hyde's proposal, made available to The Associated  
Press, calls for prohibition of the sale or showing of ``explicit 
sexual or violent material which fails to qualify for First 
Amendment protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact would be to restrict explicitly violent images, much  
as sexually explicit material is now prohibited for minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment is not absolute and does not protect  
obscenity,'' the summary states. ``Furthermore, it is 
constitutionally permissible to accord minors under 17 a more 
restricted right'' to pornography than adults have. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Hyde's proposal, which relates to pictures, sculpture, video games, 
movies, books, magazines and other printed matter, were greeted 
enthusiastically by members of the Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The prohibition is aimed at ``the kind of violence that appeals  
to the prurient, morbid or shameful interest of children without 
social redeeming value for children,'' according to the summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions drafted by Hyde include the requirement for  
printed lyrics to accompany CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun issue has sparked a counteroffensive by the NRA, which  
is trying to persuade the House to reject a proposal that cleared 
the GOP-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue, expected on the House floor by midmonth, is ``the  
most critical gun vote in over five years,'' the NRA said in a 
recent mailing urging its members to contact their representatives 
at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would ``impose a cradle-to-grave massive federal  
regulatory scheme on gun owners throughout America -- and that's no 
exaggeration,'' said the mailing, which requested $35 to $85 for 
membership renewals. A copy was made available to the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal was crafted in the days after the proposal squeaked  
through the Senate on the strength of a tie-breaking vote cast by 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders have agreed to allow gun-control legislation  
to the floor next week. Aides said that no decision has been made 
whether to have the Judiciary Committee consider the issue before 
the full House votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control became a pressing political issue after the Colorado  
shootings in which two student gunmen killed 12 fellow students and 
a teacher before turning their weapons on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	With public polls indicating a surge in support for gun control,  
President Clinton responded with a call for fresh restrictions. In 
a political debacle for the majority Republicans, the Senate 
adopted some of them last month in broader legislation relating to 
juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed measure requires instant background checks for  
all gun-show purchases, closing what supporters said was a loophole 
that permitted some transactions to proceed without checks. In 
addition, it outlawed importation of large-capacity ammunition 
clips, required the sale of safety locks with handguns and barred 
juveniles with felony convictions from ever buying guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome in the House is unpredictable, aides in both parties  
said. While Republicans hold a 222-211 majority, with one 
Democratic-leaning independent, Democrats say an estimated two 
dozen to three dozen members of their rank and file, mostly those 
from rural areas, can be expected to oppose some gun-control 
proposals. Likewise, a similar number of Republicans, principally 
those from the Northeast, can be expected to embrace gun control.

<HEADLINE>  Rivers Will Coach Magic As He Played </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Doc Rivers plans to coach the same way he  
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm up here giving you no promises, except for I'm going to  
work as hard as I can work to try to make this a success,'' the 
ex-point guard said today after being named coach of the Orlando 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something new. I'm not walking into this saying that I  
know how to do it, that I'll be perfect at it,'' Rivers added. 
``I'm not going to tell you that. What I'll tell you is I'll work 
at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than enough for the Magic, who aren't nervous about  
passing the reigns of the team from a Hall of Fame coach to one 
with no previous experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who played with four different teams during a 13-year  
career that ended in 1996, becomes the second-youngest coach in the 
league behind New York's Jeff Van Gundy, who's also 37. 
</P>
<P>
	He inherits a team that could be headed for a massive overhaul  
after overachieving during the lockout-shortened regular season 
only to stumble in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides losing former coach Chuck Daly, who retired May 24, the  
Magic face the prospect of starting next season without four-time 
All-Star Penny Hardaway, who has said he'll exercise an option in 
his contract to become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This process many times comes down to a gut feeling, a gut  
instinct of who the right person is,'' general manager John Gabriel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Chuck, we got up here and said he's a guy who's seen it  
all and done it all. Doc's not going to be able to say that. His 
last experience was as a player. So what we did was we researched 
him like a player, talking to trainers and coaches and ex-G.M.'s 
and teammates of his. The information that came back was very 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who also interviewed for the Washington Wizards'  
coaching vacancy, signed a four-year guaranteed contract worth just 
over $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1983 second-round draft pick of Atlanta played 13 seasons  
for the Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, New York Knicks and San 
Antonio Spurs before retiring in 1996. He's spent the last three 
years working as a television analyst for Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot people ask why. They say: `You're doing TV. You have  
five and 10 seconds to second-guess everyone. If you go to the 
other side, that's going to change ... It's a big risk,''' Rivers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My answer is I'm a risk taker. My answer is this is what I  
want to be. This is what I want to do. And who cares about the 
risk. Look at the reward if things pay off. I don't really worry 
about risks. I tend to look at how I can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers averaged 10.9 points, 5.7 assists and 3 rebounds per game  
as a player and his teams made the playoffs 10 times. He played for 
the first eight years of his career in Atlanta, was an All-Star in 
1988 and is the Hawks' all-time leader in assists with 3,866. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rivers has no previous coaching experience, he played  
for some of the league's best, including Pat Riley, Larry Brown and 
Mike Fratello. 
</P>
<P>
	His philosophy and style, Rivers said, probably will reflect  
things he's learned from each of those coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can take all their best attributes. But if I had  
to say one thing I can guarantee we'll do, it's play defense,'' he 
said. ``You look at the history of this league. You win by stopping 
people at the end of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his lack of experience, Rivers intends to hire a  
veteran as his top assistant. Three former NBA coaches -- Dave Wohl, 
Jim Cleamons and Johnny Davis -- reportedly are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more questions Monday, though, about how he might get  
along with Hardaway, who sulked at times about his relationship 
with Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers said he will relate to the players by simply ``telling  
them the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt that I'll be challenged at times. I'm new.  
When the substitute teacher comes, you challenge her or him ... I 
think I'm up to that,'' he said. ``I just think you have to sell 
what you're trying to do. And that's win. There's no agenda with 
me. It's only about winning. I want to get to that point as soon as 
possible.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mob Lawyer To Become Vegas Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- When there's talk of a hit in Las Vegas these  
days, it's normally about slot machines, not the mob. 
</P>
<P>
	This booming city has come a long way since Bugsy Siegel moved  
the mob west with the opening of the Flamingo Hilton on the 
fledgling Las Vegas Strip in 1946. But now a man with ties to Las 
Vegas' checkered past is poised to become its next mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Flamboyant criminal defense attorney Oscar Goodman, who freely  
admits he was once the mouthpiece to the mob, is known for 
defending characters like Meyer Lansky and Anthony ``Tony the Ant'' 
Spilotro, who once reputedly placed a rival's head in a vise and 
squeezed his eyeballs out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just their attorney and their mouthpiece and  
spokesman,'' Goodman said last month. ``When the media took a whack 
at my clients, I would speak on their behalf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people just have the image of the mob lawyer  
things,'' he said. ``But I, honest to God, believe I'm going to be 
the best mayor Las Vegas ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's opponent, Arnie Adamsen, said a win by his opponent  
would lend a new mob aura to Las Vegas. ``His past will become our 
future,'' Adamsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't seemed to matter much to Las Vegas voters. Goodman,  
59, has emerged as a populist candidate, coming within 277 votes of 
winning the primary election outright in May. Recent polls show him 
coasting to victory in Tuesday's general election. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't so long ago that federal authorities and gambling  
regulators ran the mob out of Las Vegas, transforming the town into 
a top vacation destination where parents feel comfortable bringing 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
	But from 1971 to 1986, brash Chicago enforcer Spilotro ruled Las  
Vegas with Fat Herbie Blitzstein, his longtime pal, at his side. 
Spilotro's role was captured by actor Joe Pesci in the movie 
``Casino,'' and Goodman appeared as himself in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The mob's influence in Las Vegas waned when Spilotro, facing  
trial on racketeering charges in 1986, was buried alive in an 
Indiana cornfield at the behest of fearful Chicago mob bosses. 
Blitzstein went to prison that year on federal tax and credit fraud 
charges, and was killed in an alleged mob hit two years ago. The 
rest of Spilotro's crew eventually found their way to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Las Vegas is dominated by casino corporations, and the FBI  
says any mobsters left in town are low-level Mafia soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of old Italian mob activity going on,'' said  
Kevin Caudle, a FBI spokesman in Las Vegas. Goodman's election, he 
said, ``probably would not make it better or worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, Goodman has campaigned for mayor seeking  
to increase fees on developers to provide more money to refurbish 
older neighborhoods near downtown, and to help solve the city's 
traffic and air pollution woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm colorful, and that's what got me in the limelight,''  
Goodman told a reporter. ``If I were a podiatrist running for 
mayor, you wouldn't be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the mayor has only one of five votes on the City Council  
and doesn't represent the famed Strip or its glittering resorts, 
Goodman has promised to turn the job from one of cutting ribbons 
and settling neighborhood disputes into a position yielding real 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
	That could ``add some pizzazz to an otherwise boring job,'' said  
Lamond Mills, a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted ``Tony the 
Ant'' but supports Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to give the city a good shaking,'' Mills  
said. ``It's going to be refreshing.''

<HEADLINE> Two Students Die From Electrocution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAUMEE, Ohio (AP) -- Two college students working summer jobs  
died Monday when a football goal post they were moving touched a 
high-voltage electrical wire at a high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Dominic Hess and Wesley Shook, both 19, on the  
ground, with the post leaning against a 7,200-volt wire that was 
about 30 feet high. A third worker was dazed and suffered minor 
burns and cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In another electrocution, a man and his teen-age son were  
electrocuted Sunday in their backyard pool in Griffith, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Taylor was cleaning the pool with a power washer and  
investigators are not sure whether the appliance fell in while 
Taylor was in the water or whether it fell first and Taylor went in 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's 17-year-old son, Nick, apparently found his father in  
the pool and went in to help. He was also electrocuted.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Option Anderson to Toledo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Pitcher Matt Anderson, who jumped from Double-A  
to the majors with the Detroit Tigers last year, will get a taste 
of Triple-A after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, whose fastball has been clocked at 103 mph, was  
optioned to the club's International League team at Toledo after 
Monday night's 9-4 interleague win over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Cruz, who was recalled to fill Anderson's spot on the  
roster, will start Tuesday night in place of Justin Thompson, who 
complained of back spasms Monday. Thompson's condition was listed 
as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the No. 1 overall pick by the Tigers in the 1997  
draft, was sensational in his rookie season, going 5-1 with a 3.27 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he was 1-0 with a 2.18 ERA in his first 19  
appearances, striking out 22 batters on 20 2-3 innings. However, he 
allowed 11 runs in three innings over his final five outings before 
being optioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, making his second appearance on the Tigers' roster this  
season, has won seven of eight decisions at Toledo, compiling a 
2.73 ERA in 62 2-3 innings. Two of his four complete games for the 
Mud Hens were shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched in three games out of the bullpen for Detroit between  
May 4-11, then was returned to Toledo.

Chris Sexton to Triple-A Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott had been on the 15-day DL since May 23 with a strained

<HEADLINE> Dupont Cutting Polyester Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont Co. is slashing about 1,400  
positions from its troubled polyester division as a decline in 
demand for its products has forced the company to look for ways to 
reduce costs and restructure the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced Monday that 800 employees and 600  
contractors will be laid off. That accounts for about 14 percent of 
the polyester division's global workforce. About 80 percent of the 
positions are in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deep and prolonged decline in the global polyester market  
is driving fundamental structural change in the industry, making it 
imperative that we take additional steps now to strengthen our 
business,'' said George MacCormack, vice president for DuPont 
Polyester Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is expected to result in a pre-tax savings of $90  
million that will begin accruing in the fourth quarter. DuPont 
expects to take a nonrecurring charge in the second quarter of the 
year of four cents a share for employee separation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges related to asset write-offs are expected to cost an  
additional 2 cents to 4 cents a share as part of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont shares, a component of the Dow industrials, shot up 3.6  
percent following the announcement, rising $2.56 1/4 to close at 
$72.81 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, DuPont has planned several changes around its  
polyester business worldwide, particularly in the area of creating 
joint partnerships with other companies to manufacture and market 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilmington, Del.-based company has announced joint ventures  
with Alpek of Mexico and Teijin of Japan for polyester filament in 
the Americas, and with Sabanci of Turkey for polyester 
intermediates, resins and fibers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont-Akra Polyester, a joint venture with Alpek for polyester  
staple in the Americas, began operations on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes that its joint ventures will reduce the level  
of exposure it has in a changing market while increasing 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont said in a release today that its employees who have their  
positions terminated can get ``transition packages'' available in 
their country or region. For instance, the company said, U.S. 
employees leaving DuPont will receive a package including payments 
based on length of service, benefit assistance and educational 
assistance.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Merges With Honeywell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AlliedSignal and Honeywell have set an  
aggressive six-month timetable to merge their operations into a $24 
billion industrial powerhouse that makes everything from aircraft 
landing systems to home thermostats. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience may come in handy. Honeywell, as the combined  
company will be called, is looking for more acquisitions in areas 
as diverse as security access systems and pharmaceutical chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Honeywell's business areas ``represent an opportunity for  
growth through acquisition,'' said Michael Bonsignore, chairman and 
chief executive officer of Honeywell, who will lead the combined 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were quick to see the potential of the merger, bidding  
up shares of both companies in active trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Honeywell's shares rose $7 to $112, a new one-year high. 
AlliedSignal's stock, one of the components of the Dow industrials, 
jumped $4.43 1/2 to $62.81 1/4 and helped the Dow soar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since AlliedSignal is paying for Honeywell by issuing 236.3  
million shares of stock, the 7.6 percent rise AlliedSignal's shares 
increased the value of the deal by about $1 billion from when it 
was announced, to total $14.84 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But first things first. AlliedSignal and Honeywell have to close  
Honeywell's headquarters in Minneapolis and move it to Morristown, 
N.J., where AlliedSignal is based. They have to cut 4,500 jobs and 
combine their work forces of 120,000 people in more than 95 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger needs regulatory approval in Europe and America, and  
top executives still have to sort out their different opinions on 
rewarding shareholders with dividends. 
</P>
<P>
	Time is of the essence.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a clear pattern between companies that have moved  
through integration quickly, and the companies that have been 
successful,'' said John Harbison, a vice president for Booz-Allen 
Hamilton, who has written extensively on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal and Honeywell have already formed an integration  
team, which will spend the next three months creating a plan, and 
put it into action within three months after the deal closes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round of job cuts, Honeywell will lay off 1,000 of  
its headquarters staff, and the combined companies will eliminate 
another 1,000 positions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second round, an additional 2,500 positions will go.  
</P>
<P>
	The synergies will save the company $500 million a year starting  
in 2002. But workers like Mike Lawrow see the faces of their 
colleagues in that number. 
</P>
<P>
	After 20 years with Honeywell, the news of the impending layoffs  
hit him hard. Standing outside the company's headquarters, smoking 
a cigarette, Lawrow said, ``There are a few people who are going to 
gain from it. A lot of us are going to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mashing two corporate cultures together will force both company  
to make painful sacrifices. In exchange for keeping AlliedSignal's 
headquarters, for example, the company had to give up its name. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are expected to review the merger with a fine-tooth  
comb, but according to Bonsignore, AlliedSignal and Honeywell only 
overlap in two areas: collision avoidance systems and weather 
radar, which account for about $250 million in annual sales, or a 
little more than 1 percent of the combined business. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of both companies clearly support the deal, though  
the Honeywell and AlliedSignal have yet to work out their dividend 
policies. Lawrence Bossidy, chairman and chief executive officer of 
AlliedSignal, promised shareholders at the annual meeting in April 
that he would raise the dividend 15 percent next year. On Monday, 
he said, those plans are now up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	If the companies can combine their operations fast and  
effectively, the new Honeywell will be in a strong position to 
serve its largest clients, which include Boeing Co., Airbus 
Industrie and the U.S. military. One of the motives behind 
AlliedSignal's acquisition of Honeywell is that aircraft makers are 
reducing the number of parts suppliers they work with, and 
demanding those suppliers provide complete solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will have strategic influence to ... dominate in their  
core markets for the next decade, said Nick Haymen, an analyst at 
Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	While the aerospace business will account for 40 percent of the  
combined company's business, the merger also gives the new 
Honeywell a stronger position in several other industries -- 
including specialty chemicals and auto parts -- which will insulate 
the company from a downturn in any one market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosignore, who signed a five-year employment contract, plans to  
improve that level of protection by expanding in many areas. While 
he wouldn't name names, Haymen said, the new Honeywell ``can make 
$10 billion in acquisitions over the next three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors started placing their bets on the next target, which  
also may be in the cross hairs of another competitor trying to keep 
up with Honeywell. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, shares of Rockwell International Corp. rose $2 to  
$61, while Litton Industries Inc. saw its stock rise $3.87 1/2 to 
$73.87 1/2.

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire Approves King Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Martin Luther King III was 10 when his  
father was assassinated. He was 21 when New Hampshire lawmakers 
killed the state's first attempt to honor his father with a 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 41, he stood next to Gov. Jeanne Shaheen as she ended New  
Hampshire's distinction as the only state without a permanent 
holiday commemorating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day will be officially  
observed for the first time in New Hampshire on Jan. 17, 2000. The 
change, approved by the state House and Senate last month, ends two 
decades of attempts to add his name to Civil Rights Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents had argued that singling out King would detract from  
other American heroes such as George Washington and Abraham 
Lincoln, who are lumped together on Presidents Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony outside the Statehouse on Monday included a  
recording from a speech by the slain civil rights leader: ``Let 
freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of the hard work of all the men, women and young  
people of this state, all 50 states will be unanimously observing 
the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.,'' said his son. ``It's 
certainly appropriate as we go into the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 70 New Hampshire lawmakers who have long fought for  
the state holiday not only cheered, but rang bells. 
</P>
<P>
	King said it was fitting that Shaheen, New Hampshire's first  
woman governor, was the one to sign the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father believed that democracy ought to be inclusive of  
everyone, and I think your signature on this bill signifies the 
progress we've made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen, like her predecessor, had added King's name to New  
Hampshire's Civil Rights Day by proclamation each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words and deeds of Martin Luther King Jr. changed our  
nation for the better,'' she said. ``Martin Luther King Jr. was the 
greatest civil rights leader of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's son told the crowd the best way to honor his father ``is  
to do something to carry forward his unfinished work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said communities across the nation have embraced his father's  
teachings, but more work remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father never sought recognition for himself,'' he said,  
``but I think he'd be very happy this holiday has become a 
celebration of nonviolence and humanitarian service.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A judge on Monday acquitted three men accused of  
stealing $1.3 million in Port of Miami revenue and spending it on 
lingerie, vacations, bar tabs and Super Bowl tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants, who were also accused of giving $120,000 to the  
Democratic National Committee, were not guilty of misusing funds 
because the money never belonged to the government, U.S. District 
Judge Donald Middlebrooks ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in the middle of the trial of Carmen Lunetta,  
longtime director of the port, the nation's eighth largest in terms 
of cargo, and two others. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men were charged with misusing funds belonging to  
Miami-Dade County. But U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks 
agreed with the defense that until the money was turned over to 
Miami-Dade County, it still belonged to the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the judge wrote, ``The government has presented  
substantial evidence of greed and public corruption, the placement 
of private interests over those of the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The two other defendants were Calvin Grigsby, the owner of  
Fiscal Operations Inc., which operated cranes at the port; and Neal 
Harrington, a part-owner of a stevedoring company. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said stevedoring companies paid Fiscal Operations  
for crane time, and Fiscal Operations turned the money over to 
Miami-Dade County. However, Fiscal Operations first deducted 
$150,000 a year plus expenses. Prosecutors said those expenses were 
padded. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby faces trial next month on charges of arranging $350,000  
in kickbacks to two Miami-Dade executives in return for county bond 
business. He owned Grigsby Brandford &AMP; Co., the nation's largest 
minority-owned municipal bond underwriter until it closed in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Drug Ban Upheld for Irish Swimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic star Michelle Smith de  
Bruin lost her appeal today of a four-year drug ban, a ruling that 
could end the Irish swimmer's career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the decision by FINA,  
the sport's governing body. Smith was suspended on Aug. 6, 1998, 
after being found guilty of tampering with a urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, did not say if he will appeal. The  
CAS ruling is final and any appeal would have to be filed in civil 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon previously raised the possibility of taking the case to  
the European Court for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who won three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,  
is ineligible for the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2001 world 
championships. She is 29 years old and will be 33 when the ban 
expires in August 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said the samples were adulterated with alcohol, possibly  
masking the presence of banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member CAS panel rejected Smith's defense that the  
samples were not hers or that a third party manipulated the 
samples. The panel also dismissed her contention that the burden of 
proof was on FINA to eliminate all possibilities other than 
manipulation by the swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts of the case and the evidence before them,  
the arbitrators were of the opinion that FINA had convinced them 
that (Smith) was the only person who had the motive and opportunity 
to manipulate the sample,'' the CAS statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes 17 months after the disputed test.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time FINA has had a manipulation case,'' Gunnar  
Werner, FINA's honorary secretary, said by telephone from Sweden. 
``Manipulation is a bad crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more or less two abuses in one -- manipulating samples to  
cover up something else. Hopefully this will warn others not to try 
anything of the same kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon called the 35-page ruling ``fairly comprehensive'' and  
said he will have a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the  
stars of the 1996 Games, submitted to a surprise, 
out-of-competition drug test at her home in Kilkenny, Ireland, on 
Jan. 10, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA later reported the sample was contaminated with a  
concentration of alcohol so high it would have killed a person had 
it been a legitimate sample. Analysis of the backup sample at an 
IOC laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, confirmed the finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith denied any wrongdoing and appealed the ban. She appeared  
at a CAS hearing in Lausanne on May 3-4. Lennon maintained there 
were major flaws in the testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's spectacular results in Atlanta -- winning gold in the  
400-meter medley, 400 freestyle and 200 individual medley, and 
bronze in the 200 butterfly -- led to accusations she used 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith repeatedly denied doing so. She said she had been  
tested more often than her rivals and each time the result was 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicions were also fueled because of Smith's coach and  
husband. Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower and shot putter, was 
banned for four years after testing positive for excessive 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAS arbitration panel was led by Yves Fortier of Canada. The  
other arbitrators were lawyers Michael Beloff of Britain and Dennis 
Oswald of Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Remains From Vietnam are Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remains of two U.S. Marine aviators who  
were unaccounted for from the Vietnam War have been identified and 
will be returned to their families for burial in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Monday the positive identification of  
Marine Capt. Robert A. Holt, of Reading, Mass., and Marine Capt. 
John A. Lavoo, of Pueblo, Colo. They were flying a combat mission 
over Quang Binh Province, North Vietnam, on Sept. 19, 1968, when 
their F-4B Phantom jet crashed with no trace of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostile forces in the area precluded a search-and-rescue effort  
at the time. The remains were recovered in a series of excavations 
by a joint U.S.-Vietnamese team in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	With the accounting of these two men, there are now 2,061  
Americans listed by the Pentagon as unaccounted for from the 
Vietnam War.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's Acer Group and International  
Business Machines Corp. of the United States on Monday announced a 
seven-year, $8 billion procurement and technology alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Acer, Taiwan's largest computer maker, manufactures IBM personal  
computers under an existing multibillion dollar agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new pact, IBM will sell Acer hard disk drives,  
microelectronics, networking and display technologies, the 
companies said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acer has a close ongoing business relationship with IBM ...  
both as supplier and customer,'' said Stan Shih, Acer's chief 
executive. ``This new technology alliance will allow us to combine 
the resources and advantages of both companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' collaboration could include joint development of  
new chips for use in IBM's PowerPC, the statement said. They would 
have uses in future Internet appliances and Internet-related 
business, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM could also purchase liquid crystal displays from Acer, while  
Acer could improve its displays using technology licensed from IBM, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite closer cooperation, the two companies said they have no  
plans for an equity tie-up.

<TEXT>
<P>
	``Loud, Fast &AMP; Out of Control -- The Wild Sounds of '50s Rock''  
(Rhino) -- Various Artists 

</P>
<P>
	There was time when all of rock 'n' roll was regarded with the  
sort of dread now reserved for Marilyn Manson. It's hard to believe 
today, with rock songs being used to sell pickup trucks and tennis 
shoes, but in the 1950s the genre was considered downright 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	These songs show why. They're raw, brash, noisy, hilarious and  
just plain dumb fun. Rhino compiled 104 tunes from the '50s on four 
CDs, and most of the music is filled with a primal energy found 
today in rap but almost nowhere else on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhino excludes tame doo-wop and prom-rock tunes to focus on the  
revolution '50s rockers wrought. These are the songs loved by 
greasers who carried switchblades, not by the ``Happy Days'' crowd, 
and sound bites from hand-wringing adults bemoaning the popularity 
of the new music provide context for the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to include such monster hits as ``Jailhouse Rock,''  
``Johnny B. Goode'' and ``Good Golly, Miss Molly'' is questionable, 
because 40 years of heavy exposure has reduced them to lovable 
chestnuts. They sound out of place alongside such tunes as Wanda 
Jackson's politically incorrect ``Fujiyama Mama'' and The Phantom's 
breathless ``Love Me,'' too outrageous for radio even today. 
</P>
<P>
	But in sum, this time capsule re-creates a musical era with  
bracing accuracy. These songs were a cultural watershed, and 
Western Civilization hasn't been the same since. We should be 
grateful. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	``Hot Rod Guitar -- The Danny Gatton Anthology'' (Rhino) -- Danny  
Gatton 

</P>
<P>
	The photo on the back of the CD booklet in this anthology  
perfectly captures the accompanying music. It shows Danny Gatton 
playing the guitar, his face in sharp focus, his right hand a blur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hot Rod Guitar'' is a two-CD set showcasing a sadly obscure  
virtuoso. Gatton's musical vocabulary was encyclopedic, as the 27 
selections here attest. He played jazz, rockabilly, country and the 
blues with breathtaking speed and ease, but such versatility worked 
against him in the marketplace, where he never found a commercial 
niche. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatton spent much of his career relegated to playing bars in  
Washington, D.C. He was 44 before he signed a major-label contract 
and had only a small but devoted following when he committed 
suicide at 49 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatton was no showboat; sometimes, in fact, you wish he would  
hog the spotlight more. On ``Red Label,'' for example, he hangs 
back for the first three minutes before taking a solo that sends 
the tune soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a stylistic focus makes ``Hot Rod Guitar'' a bit  
scattershot, but there are plenty of performances to intimidate and 
inspire any fledgling guitarist. As Richard Harrington wrote in a 
terrific 1991 article included in the CD booklet, ``Danny Gatton 
can play anybody's music. No one can play his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening bars of ``Harlem Nocturne,'' a 1975 recording,  
quickly establish Gatton's rare and commanding talent. 
``Gearheads,'' ``Notchca Blues'' and a closing live medley are 
likewise dazzling, and it's hard to believe it all comes from the 
same fingers. Most of the set is devoted to instrumentals, and 
that's for the best, because Gatton's talent was beyond words.

<HEADLINE> Dr. 'Hannibal' Lecter Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Hannibal,'' the most anticipated book of the  
summer, arrives Tuesday, promising to chill readers with the return 
of the horrific Dr. Lecter. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Thomas Harris plans to promote this long-awaited literary  
event by doing -- absolutely nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	No interviews. No book-signings. No Oprah, no Rosie. No ``Good  
Morning America,'' no ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only place fans can hear Harris' voice is on the book's  
audiotape version: He reads his own work. 
</P>
<P>
	The mind behind Lecter, the erudite serial-killing menace, has  
turned down scads of interview requests in connection with his 
first book in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Carole Baron, former editor-in-chief at Harris' publisher  
Delacorte Press, asked him that question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that all he has to say is in his books,'' Baron said.  
</P>
<P>
	Harris' legendary reticence has done little to quell the  
public's demand for another visit from Hannibal Lecter, who enjoys 
a robust red wine and some fava beans with his -- well, maybe not 
HIS -- liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is THE hot summer read,'' said James Marcus, editor of  
literature and fiction at Amazon.com., which first started 
receiving online orders for the book in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harris is very publicity-shy,'' Marcus continued. ``But I  
think he's got a large and very loyal audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His publisher agrees. Delacorte has an initial printing of 1.2  
million for the book, which Harris delivered in March. Four days 
before its release, it was already the best-selling book at Amazon 
-- based strictly on orders. 
</P>
<P>
	At the author's request, no advance copies of the book were  
released, although some details are known. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannibal the cannibal, after mounting a grisly escape at the end  
of the first book, ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' has been enjoying 
his freedom the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his surviving victims, intent on luring Lecter out of  
hiding, kidnaps his ``Silence'' foil -- FBI agent Clarice Starling -- 
to use as bait. More bodies are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	That's it. Nothing more than that simple synopsis leaked out  
until this week, when the Internet magazine Salon reported that 
Lecter and Clarice wind up as a couple. 
</P>
<P>
	That lack of information is fine with Harris. Even the author's  
``Who's Who'' listing is minimalist: four lines, not even a full 
birthdate (b. 1940), a simple recitation of his career as a 
journalist at The Associated Press and his three previous novels. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris bolted the AP after 1975's ``Black Sunday,'' a  
collaboration with two fellow news agency workers. He followed that 
with 1981's ``Red Dragon,'' which introduced Lecter, and 1988's 
``Silence of the Lambs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contrast Harris' behavior with the fanfare that greeted last  
year's big book event, Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full.'' Wolfe, 
resplendent in his three-piece white suit, graciously sat for 
magazine, television and newspaper interviews. He invited 
questioners into his Upper East Side home. 
</P>
<P>
	He was, in short, ubiquitous. Harris, on the other hand, is  
invisible. Wolfe's book ended up beneath Christmas trees; Harris' 
tome is more likely headed for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	So is Harris. The author splits his time between homes in Long  
Island's Sag Harbor and Miami.

<HEADLINE> Phone, TV, Internet To Be Combined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's only one phone wire and one cable wire  
going into every home, so many companies that want to bundle 
telephone, TV and Internet services are banking on a new wireless 
technology as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	It bears the clunky and contradictory sounding name of ``fixed  
wireless'' and it may allow companies to reach places where 
telephone wires and cable aren't an attractive option. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom and Sprint, looking to bypass the cable and  
telephone wires controlled by a handful of competitors, have spent 
wildly on the cellular-like technology in recent months, gobbling 
up just about every purveyor of a fixed-wireless offering called 
Microwave Multipoint Distribution Services, or MMDS. 
</P>
<P>
	With that market practically cornered, attention is now turning  
to the next generation of fixed-wireless access, Local Multipoint 
Distribution Services. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Motorola and Cisco Systems announced a new  
partnership to develop LMDS network equipment. While Motorola is 
the lead partner in the venture, the move by Cisco, the top player 
in networking technology, shows the crucial role that fixed 
wireless has become in the race to provide a variety of high-speed 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cisco only partners with another company when it's to their  
advantage and very often only when they're lacking something,'' 
said Lisa Pierce, an industry analyst at Giga Information Group. 
</P>
<P>
	But while fixed-wireless technology is a cheaper and easier way  
to bypass cable and phone systems than digging up the ground for 
new fiber optic networks, consumers probably won't see the benefits 
any time soon. Instead, service providers will likely focus on 
big-spending business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If costs get low enough, fixed wireless could go into the  
home, but that's not the initial target,'' said Luke Szymczak, an 
industry analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A more viable wireless alternative for consumers may be  
satellite transmission to small dishes like those used by DirecTV 
television, but it will be several years before that type of 
service is available. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Electronics, the parent of DirecTV, and Lockheed Martin  
are both leading satellite initiatives, but don't expect to provide 
two-way, high-speed Internet access and telephone calls until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	And although LMDS can transmit up to 100 times faster than the  
cable TV connections and the phone-based service known as Digital 
Subscriber Line, or DSL, there are shortcomings to fixed-wireless 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the transmission towers used in fixed wireless  
need a direct line of sight to transmit to any customer. Bad 
weather can also be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do face challenges, particularly with the rain,'' said  
Pierce. ``You also have to convince the owner of a tall building to 
rent out space. Chances are that owners of those buildings are no 
dummies. They know what their real estate is worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola and Cisco said Monday they were acquiring the  
fixed-wireless assets of Bosch Telecom in Richardson, Texas, as the 
focal point of their new initiative, which they named SpectraPoint 
Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola will own 81 percent of the venture and Cisco will own  
19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, which said they expect to announce some major  
contracts shortly with customers who will use their technology to 
deploy combined phone, TV and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be competing with more established players in  
fixed-wireless technology like Lucent Technologies and Nortel 
Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cisco could quickly become a major player in LMDS because  
companies using its other top-selling network products ``may decide 
to standardize around Cisco,'' said Pierce.

<HEADLINE>  Bin Laden, Kopp on Most-Wanted List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI put alleged terrorist mastermind Osama  
Bin Laden and anti-abortion activist and accused doctor killer 
James Charles Kopp on the bureau's list of the Ten Most Wanted 
fugitives Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Director Louis Freeh said the U.S. government is offering a  
reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to the arrest 
and conviction of Bin Laden, indicted as the architect of the twin 
bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Aug. 7, 
1998, bombings killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. 
It is the largest reward the government has ever offered for a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of $650,000, meanwhile, is being offered for information  
leading to the arrest of Kopp, who is charged with gunning down Dr. 
Barnett Slepian last fall in his home in Buffalo, N.Y. Slepian 
provided legal abortions in western New York state. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard $50,000 reward for information leading to a listed  
fugitive's capture comes on top of a $500,000 reward announced 
earlier by Attorney General Janet Reno, plus a $100,000 award 
offered previously by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Bin Laden and Kopp have one thing in common: Each  
wrongly believes he is justified in using all means possible to 
achieve his goal. 
</P>
<P>
	They also have in common locations unknown to the authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	Freeh said Bin Laden may be hiding out in Afghanistan, which has  
been uncooperative in the case. Kopp, meanwhile, may have 
approached the border with Mexico, but it is unknown whether he 
crossed into that country, said Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp purports to be a devout Roman Catholic, and the majority of  
jobs he has held over the past 20 years have been related to the 
anti-abortion movement, the Justice Department said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department international security director Dave Carpenter  
said that placing Bin Laden on the most-wanted list ``underscores 
the unwavering commitment'' by the United States ``to fight 
terrorism.'' The FBI continues to receive threats from individuals 
and organizations with ties to Bin Laden, Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter said the U.S. government's counterterrorism program  
has paid out over $6 million in some 20 cases around the world for 
credible information. 
</P>
<P>
	On the FBI list, Bin Laden and Kopp replace two former Libyan  
intelligence agents charged in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 that killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground 
in Lockerbie, Scotland. The two were removed from the list after 
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed in April to hand them over for 
trial in the Netherlands, a neutral venue. Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and 
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are charged with murder, conspiracy to 
commit murder and violations of international aviation safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden and Kopp are the 455th and 456th persons to be placed  
on the FBI's most wanted list, which began in 1950. Since then, 427 
fugitives have been taken into custody or located, 133 of them as a 
result of citizen assistance, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six suspects in the Bin Laden investigation are known to be in  
custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. 
Another eight suspects, including Bin Laden, have been charged but 
not apprehended. Another suspect is awaiting extradition from 
Britain. The FBI says Bin Laden is the leader of a terrorist 
organization known as Al-Aqeda, ``The Base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp wears eyeglasses, walks with a slight limp, is 5 feet, 10  
inches tall and weighs 150 to 175 pounds. Slepian was killed by a 
single gunshot fired from a wooded area through a window of his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the Slepian's shooting, Kopp had traveled the country  
and world, authorities said. He has been arrested more than a dozen 
times during abortion protests in seven states and Italy, but has 
no felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	He has used 29 aliases, Freeh said.

<HEADLINE>  Collapse of Kosovo Talks May Be Ploy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The collapse of talks in Macedonia to  
implement the Kosovo peace plan is a move by Yugoslavia and Russia 
to play for time in hopes Russia can force changes in the agreement 
when it goes to the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy appears aimed at undercutting what Belgrade  
considers the most unpalatable part of the accord: the presence of 
U.S. and other NATO troops with sweeping authority to ensure the 
safety of returning ethnic Albanian refugees and effectively run 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade is also gambling that the United States and other NATO  
powers will be unable to escalate the air bombardment significantly 
because of growing opposition to the campaign, especially after the 
euphoria following President Slobodan Milosevic's surprise 
acceptance of the plan Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy became clear during today's meeting in Germany  
between foreign ministers of the world's seven leading industrial 
powers and Russia, who jointly put together the peace plan that 
Milosevic accepted. Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said today 
Milosevic assured him he still stands by the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting in Germany is to work on a resolution for the U.N.  
Security Council to authorize the peacekeeping force. British 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Russian 
delegation was objecting to language affirming that NATO would be 
at the core of a peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians were also objecting to an article in the resolution  
that would empower peacekeepers to take ``robust'' military 
measures to ensure peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Moscow fails to win agreement among the other members of  
the group of eight nations in the drafting stage, the Russians and 
the Chinese could block implementation once the 15-member Security 
Council begins consideration of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin played a key role in  
drafting the plan and selling it to Milosevic, Russian generals in 
his delegation spoke openly of their opposition to some of the 
terms, especially NATO's leading role in the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin also has not come to the defense  
of the plan hammered out by his hand-picked special envoy. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting Sunday in Macedonia was called for the Yugoslavs to  
sign off on a timetable for the complete withdrawal of all their 
soldiers, police, border guards and paramilitary forces from 
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the alliance verifies that a meaningful withdrawal is  
underway, NATO would suspend the bombing campaign and move in the 
vanguard of a 50,000-member peacekeeping force ``with NATO at its 
core.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all Yugoslav forces have gone and the air campaign  
terminated, ``hundreds but not thousands'' of Serb forces would be 
allowed back into Kosovo to protect religious shrines, clear 
minefields and other limited duties. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in effect, would remove Belgrade's control of a province  
which Serbs consider the heartland of their culture. The presence 
of thousands of NATO troops would represent a deep humiliation for 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a humiliation could lead to the collapse of the Milosevic  
regime, although removing the Yugoslav leader -- who has been 
indicted for war crimes -- was never a stated goal of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the protracted negotiations leading to the agreement,  
Belgrade had insisted it would accept only a lightly armed 
``international security presence'' under United Nations control. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia appeared to torpedo the talks to help its long-time  
Slavic ally. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first day of talks Saturday, NATO spokesmen spoke  
optimistically of progress -- but the Russian delegation did not 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, however, Russian Lt. Gen. Yevgeny Barmyantsev showed  
up three hours into the talks. According to the ITAR-Tass news 
agency, Barmyantsev said Moscow believed that a peacekeeping force 
could only be installed on the basis of a U.N. Security Council 
resolution. That could take weeks to hammer out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian agency said his remarks prompted NATO generals ``to  
ask for a `time-out' so they could hold private consultations.'' 
The talks were suspended 7 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About eight hours later, the NATO commander in Macedonia, Lt.  
Gen. Michael Jackson announced that the talks had broken down.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices rallied early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans up more than 8 
cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the market appeared to be reacting to reports of  
continued above-normal temperatures in the Midwest over the next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather could damage early planted crops, eventually  
resulting in smaller crops and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	While wheat futures also jumped, some say the rise might not  
hold since dry weather will aid in the harvest of winter wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, wheat for July delivery rose 4 cents to $2.60 3/4  
a bushel; July corn was up 3 3/4 cent to $2.24 1/2 a bushel; July oats 
rose 1 1/2 cents to $1.25 a bushel; and July soybeans surged 8 1/2 cents 
to $4.73 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meat and livestock futures were mixed in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .10 cent to 65 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .12 cents to 76.65 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .10 cent to 51.90 cents a pound; and July pork bellies fell 
.60 cent to 52.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> US Airways, Union Strike Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Nearly four years after the contract  
between US Airways and a mechanics' union came up for 
renegotiation, the two sides reached a tentative agreement, the 
airline said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with the International Association of Machinists and  
Aerospace Workers covers 7,000 workers in mechanical and related 
jobs. The agreement is subject to ratification by the union 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
	After settling a number of issues, US Airways and the union  
sought the National Mediation Board's help in resolving the 
remaining issues. US Airways spokesman Rick Weintraub refused to 
say what those issues were, and calls to the union offices in 
Washington, D.C., were not answered. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract came up for renegotiation on Oct. 1, 1995,  
Weintraub said, and employees have continued to work under the 
existing contract since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement was reached early Sunday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Provisions of the new agreement also will cover mechanical and  
related workers at the US Airways Shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet service employees at US Airways, who also are represented  
by the IAM, ratified their contract with the airline on April 1, 
1999.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 104.48 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today as corporate mergers helped  
distract investors from lingering concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 104.48 at 10,904.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 3.47 at 1,331.22, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 46.17 at 2,524.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was light as traders already began looking ahead to  
Friday, when the government's producer price index is expected to 
offer signals about inflation and perhaps an indication of whether 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to keep the economy 
from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have slipped in the weeks since the Fed warned it might  
raise rates, and volume has been lower than normal as Wall Street 
weighs the impact of a possible increase. On Friday, the Dow made 
one of its strongest rallies in weeks, gaining 136.15 to close at 
10,799.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Major corporate mergers stimulated trading today. AlliedSignal  
rose 5 1/4 to 63 5/8 and Honeywell rose 8 7/8 to 113 7/8 after the companies 
announced they will merge, creating an aerospace 
parts-and-electronics conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Salt Lake City banks, First Security Corp. and Zions  
Bancorp, will merge in a deal worth $5.9 billion. First Security 
rose 6 to 24 5/8, and Zions fell 6 1/8 to 59 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express rose 2 9/16 to 127 13/16 after Prudential  
Securities raised its rating on the stock. Prudential cited rising 
credit card use in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad base of good corporate news heartened Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those sessions where all is right with the  
world,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks couldn't keep up with the market's rally today.  
UAL Corp., the parent of United Air Lines, warned analysts late 
Friday that its second-quarter earnings will fall below well 
estimates. Its shares fell 1 11/16 to 64 1/8, and weighed down several 
other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 424.8 million 
shares, well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 2.67 to 637.19, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 5.37 at 775.61.

	AlliedSignal To Buy Honeywell  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AlliedSignal is buying Honeywell for $14.82  
billion in stock, strengthening its aerospace business with the 
addition of Honeywell's control systems. The new company will take 
the Honeywell name and the AlliedSignal headquarters in Morristown, 
N.J. Honeywell's headquarters in Minneapolis will be closed. The 
two companies will cut a total of 4,500 jobs, or 3.6 percent, of 
their combined work force. AlliedSignal makes equipment ranging 
from aircraft engines and collision early-warning systems, to 
wheels and brakes. Honeywell makes control systems for aircraft, 
homes and commercial buildings, such as automatic thermostats for 
heating. AlliedSignal stock rose 4 7/16 to 62 13/16 and Honeywell 
gained 7 to 112.

	IBM-Microsoft Relations Outlined  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An IBM manager accused Microsoft today of  
offering discounts worth tens of millions of dollars to IBM to 
sacrifice its rival computer operating system and to stop 
distributing software from key competitors. Garry Norris, a 
mid-level IBM executive, said Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was so 
angry about IBM's defiance that he overheard the billionaire 
screaming during a private phone call in July 1995 to another IBM 
executive in the room. Norris testified that IBM saw the total fees 
it pays to Microsoft rise from $40 million in 1996 to $440 million 
last year because it rejected Microsoft's alleged overtures not to 
compete. Microsoft shares closed at 80 1/4, up 11/16. IBM stock gained 
4 1/2 to 120 1/2.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose for a third straight session today

market that is again inching toward record heights. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed up 109.54 at 10,909.38. The Nasdaq 
composite rose 49.71 to 2,528.05. Trading got a boost today from 
the announcement of several mergers, particularly a $14.82 billion 
deal between AlliedSignal and Honeywell that creates an aerospace 
parts-and-electronics conglomerate. IBM's stock price rose past 120 
today after a J.P. Morgan analyst said IBM could reach 150 within 
the year, citing strong sales of its electronic business software.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oregon and New Hampshire enjoyed the fastest  
economic growth among the states in 1997. A Commerce Department 
report broke down the nation's gross domestic product, the total 
output of goods and services, to show the amount contributed by 
each state. The biggest state gains in economic output were enjoyed 
by residents of Oregon, where the economy expanded by 7.6 percent, 
and New Hampshire, with an increase 7.5 percent in current dollars. 
At the other end of the scale, Hawaii saw its economic output 
shrink in 1997, down 0.2 percent, as the state's economy was hit 
hard by fallout from the Asian currency crisis.

	UAW Pleads for Plant in Buick City

	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Union leaders made a plea to General  
Motors management today to replace the aged Buick City car assembly 
plant in Flint, Mich., after it closes next month. But with 
declining demand for large cars, it remains unlikely the plant will 
be replaced, GM President G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said. GM has been 
plagued for years with too many car plants as more consumers have 
shifted to light trucks. Art McGee, president of United Auto 
Workers Local 599 in Flint, noted that the plant recently earned 
the top award for initial vehicle quality from J.D. Power and 
Associates. McGee urged management to keep the work force intact to 
take advantage of the teamwork that resulted in the award. GM stock 
rose 3/4 to 69 1/8.

	Court Rules Feds Don't Own Gas  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billions of dollars worth of methane gas found  
with coal under federal land is not owned by the government and can 
be claimed by companies that purchase the right to drill for 
natural gas, the Supreme Court ruled today. The 7-1 decision 
resolved a big-stakes dispute between Amoco and an Indian tribe in 
Colorado. The court agreed with claims by Amoco Production Co., a 
subsidiary of BP Amoco, that its contractual right to take natural 
gas from the reservation land allows it to take the methane gas 
also. The justices ruled that coal bed methane found with coal 
under the Southern Ute Tribe's reservation should not be considered 
part of the coal the federal government owns in trust for the 
tribe.

The Advisory Center for WTO Law will provide legal advice on trade 
law to least-developed and developing countries at a much lower 
cost than the usual commercial rates. The center would be entirely 
independent of the WTO and would employ lawyers to help countries 
take cases through the organization's dispute settlement procedure. 
It would also provide training to help give countries the expertise

<HEADLINE> Bidding for Norway Oil Co. Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The bidding war for Norway's third largest  
oil company, Saga Petroleum ASA, heated up Monday when France's Elf 
Aquitaine raised its offer by more than 8 percent, while Norsk 
Hydro ASA mulled its next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf raised its takeover bid to $2.36 billion, up from $2.16  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, which is 51 percent owned by Norway's government,  
opened bidding for economically troubled Saga on May 10 with an 
offer to trade one of its shares for three of Saga's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro also made a deal with the Norwegian state oil  
company Statoil AS, which owns 20 percent of Saga, to split the 
smaller company's assets between them. Statoil would end up with 25 
percent of Saga, and Norsk Hydro would take the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 28, Elf, which has operated in Norway since 1965, made a  
cash offer to buy Saga, promising to let the smaller company 
continue operating under its own name. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saga news release said the company welcomed Elf's latest bid,  
and ``sees this as a positive development.'' It said the offer 
would be discussed at a board meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro did not immediately comment, or disclose whether it  
might make a counteroffer before Saga's board meets. News reports 
said a new Norsk Hydro bid was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, Saga announced austerity measures after posting  
losses for 1998. The company nevertheless is attractive as a 
takeover target because it controls vast oil and natural gas 
reserves of nearly 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, with petroleum, light metals and fertilizers  
divisions, is the largest company listed on the Oslo Stock 
Exchange. It employs about 40,000 people worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled more than half  
of its flights Monday as pilots called in sick ahead of a deadline 
for them to accept a pay cut or lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay bosses plan to meet again with the pilots union, but it  
was not clear when. Much of Hong Kong was shut down early Monday by 
a typhoon warning, so no session was expected before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides met Saturday and reported no progress, although  
the union has said it hopes for a negotiated settlement. The 
deadline for pilots to accept a pay cut is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting very near to the end of the week,'' said John  
Findlay, general secretary of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers 
Association. ``I don't think either party wants to see a worst case 
scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say they will call a strike vote if anybody is fired  
in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay canceled 62 of its 110 scheduled flights on Monday, but  
it beefed up its schedule by hiring other airlines to operate 36 
flights on a charter basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier also said it would accept new bookings on Tuesday  
for flights to Cebu in the Philippines; the Indonesian cities of 
Surabaya, Denpasar and Jakarta, and Tokyo, Seoul, Dubai and Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional routes will raise the number of destinations open  
for booking since Saturday to 13. Cathay halted bookings earlier in 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay is demanding that air crews give pay concessions  
averaging 7 percent over two years in exchange for stock options as 
it tries to cut costs and reverse losses brought on by Asia's 
financial crisis and Hong Kong's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cathay said on May 28 that pilots had two weeks to either  
take the offer, quit or be fired, the pilots began phoning in sick 
en masse. That has forced sharp reductions in Cathay's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said it did not organize the sickout but that pilots  
are not reporting because the layoff threats have made them too 
stressed to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	The typhoon passing near Hong Kong forced just one disruption to  
Cathay's schedule -- a flight from Vancouver got stuck in Taipei.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic OK After Leg Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sometimes fairy tales just don't work out.  
</P>
<P>
	The connections of Charismatic, a record crowd of 85,818 at  
Belmont Park and millions of TV viewers found out the hard way when 
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner took a bad step near the 
finish line and pulled up yards short of a Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The charts will show Charismatic finishing third Saturday behind  
long-shots Lemon Drop Kid and runner-up Vision and Verse, but 
somewhere before the finish line the former claimer turned champion 
fractured two bones in his left front ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he underwent successful surgery, in which four screws  
were inserted to align the broken bones in the ankle. His career as 
a racehorse is over, but the great-grandson of Secretariat can look 
forward to a career as a stallion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't always play out these Hollywood scripts like we want  
'em,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas said Sunday morning. ``Life isn't 
that way. You just can't plan it all out and have it fall into 
place. That isn't reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reality is that the Bob and Beverly Lewis-owned Charismatic  
finishes a befuddling career that saw him tossed into claiming 
races twice, and less than four months later emerge as the top 
3-year-old and on the brink of becoming the 12th Triple Crown 
winner and first since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would happen,'' Lukas said, ``I really did.''  
</P>
<P>
	What did happen was for the third straight year, and for the  
seventh time since '78, the Derby-Preakness winner failed in the 
1 1/2-mile Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	In '97, Silver Charm nearly gave the Lewises a Triple Crown, but  
their Bob Baffert-trained colt was beaten by 
three-quarters-of-a-length by Touch Gold. In '98, Baffert's Real 
Quiet was nosed out of the Triple Crown by Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew how hard it was,'' said Lukas, who has won 12 Triple  
Crown races in his Hall of Fame career, ``but we played two pretty 
good scripts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont, though, didn't go according to plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, Charismatic, ridden by jockey Chris Antley, chased  
the pace from the start, laying second behind Silverbulletday from 
the clubhouse turn until less than a half-mile remained. But 
Baffert's star filly tired in the stretch and finished seventh 
after being eased by jockey Jerry Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he ran away with her,'' Bailey said. ``It's  
tough to go head-and-head that far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, with Jose Santos aboard, was fourth with a  
quarter-mile to go, then was taken outside for his winning charge 
down the middle of the track. He took the lead from Charismatic 
with an eighth of a mile remaining and won in 2:27 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas was only mildly surprised Charismatic stuck with  
Silverbulletday, who had won 11 of 12 starts against her own sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was laying a lot closer than I thought, but the horse was  
full of run,'' Lukas said. ``You don't want to give up what comes 
easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was worried about Silverbulletday before the race,  
Lukas said, ``We never mentioned her, frankly. We just treated her 
like another horse in the race. We were worried more about the 
closers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, trained by Scotty Schulhofer, returned $61.50  
for a $2 bet -- the fourth largest payoff in 131 runnings of the 
Belmont. The winner paid $26 for place and $10.60 to show. 
Schulhofer returned to his home in Florida on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Randy, said Lemon Drop Kid was fine but tired, and will  
be pointed toward the Jim Dandy at Saratoga on Aug. 8, followed by 
the Travers on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse, trained by Bill Mott, paid $44.40 and $17,  
while Charismatic returned $3.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of Luck was fourth, followed by Stephen Got Even, Patience  
Game, Silverbulletday, Menifee, Pineaff, Prime Directive, Teletable 
and Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley, meanwhile, had tears streaming down his face as he  
dismounted just past the finish line and attended to Charismatic, 
gently lifting the colt's injured leg to keep pressure off the 
broken bones before being loaded into an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave everything he had and ran as hard as he could,''  
Antley said, ``but he couldn't give the people what they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has had several well-known horses retired due to injuries  
at the peak of their careers, including '94 Preakness and Belmont 
winner Tabasco Cat, '94 Juvenile Fillies champion Flanders, '95 
Derby and Belmont winner Thunder Gulch and '96 Derby winner 
Grindstone. During the '93 Preakness, Union City fractured a leg 
and did not survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain element of the public that just can't handle  
this part of the game,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic underwent 2 1/2 hours of surgery at Dr. Stephen  
Selway's clinic at Belmont Park. A cast was fitted to the leg and 
the colt will need a few days to rest before he is able to be 
shipped to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be just fine,'' Selway said. ``It was not the worst  
injury of this kind I've ever seen, but it was a nasty one. This 
horse had horrendous stress, but he was an ideal patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was in ideal health, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was absolutely a maintenance-free horse,'' Lukas said of  
the son of Summer Squall, who earned $2,038,064 in winning five of 
17 career starts. ``He's had one vitamin shot since I've been 
training him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The colt not only restored Lukas to his usual spot as the  
nation's top trainer in a year he will be inducted into racing's 
Hall of Fame, he also came along at the right time for Antley, who 
was out of racing for 18 months because of substance abuse and 
weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse picked him up, too,'' Lukas said. ``This was  
probably more therapy mentally for him than anybody could 
prescribe.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs Argue Over Withdrawals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Procedural talks on withdrawal of Serb  
troops from Kosovo are likely to resume, but Yugoslav commanders 
are refusing to draw down to the levels agreed to last week, a 
senior U.S. official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, even if some procedural issues are addressed in  
Macedonia there is no basis for assuring the safe return of ethnic 
Albanian refugees, said the official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Russian  
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and six other foreign ministers worked 
on the text of a U.N. resolution that State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said directs the Serbs to ``stop putting forward 
proposals that are inconsistent with the agreements they signed'' 
Thursday in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs say they are required to withdraw only to  
``peacetime'' levels, or about 15,000, the official said. The NATO 
allies, however, are demanding a total pullout, with a few hundred 
Serb troops then permitted to return as a symbolic sign of Serb 
sovereignty in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomacy continued, meanwhile, with Albright and the other  
foreign ministers from the G-8 grouping working paragraph by 
paragraph on a resolution that Rubin said would endorse having NATO 
at the core of the peacekeeping force that would help hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who helped reach the  
settlement in Belgrade, led the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need is a Security Council resolution that adopts  
arrangements that are necessary for implementation'' of the 
agreement, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The diplomats from eight nations also are working on a civilian  
administration for the beleaguered province. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright flew here from Washington for the sessions, and also to  
talk with three ethnic Albanian leaders. Rubin flatly blamed the 
Yugoslavs for the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in their talks in Macedonia, Yugoslav military  
leaders had failed to give NATO commanders an adequate plan for the 
withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo. Rubin said NATO's bombing 
campaign would continue until they did. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``We will continue to make diplomatic efforts with  
our G-8 colleagues towards a peaceful resolution of this 
conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participating with Albright and Ivanov in the talks are the  
foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and 
Japan. Albright scheduled a private session with Ivanov later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 meeting was delayed a day, apparently because of  
Russia's disapproval of the continued NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov, arriving for the talks, accused NATO of trying to settle  
``political issues of principle'' in the talks with the Yugoslav 
military, including ``the format of international forces in 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Only the U.N. Security Council has the prerogative to decide  
these issues,'' the Tass news agency quoted Ivanov as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said the  
sequence of the Serbs' withdrawal from Kosovo, including their 
demand to have a U.N. Security Council resolution before signing a 
peace plan, led to the collapse of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to fine-tune the sequence of events,'' Vedrine told  
France-2 TV, adding, ``We have to eliminate everything that can be 
used as a pretext.'' 
</P>
<P>
	En route to Germany, Rubin said only a few hundred Serb troops  
would be permitted to remain in Kosovo. He called it a symbolic 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said the settlement did not promise  
independence to the ethnic Albanians. Albright is likely to stress 
that point in her talks with the Albanian leaders, Ibrahim Rugova, 
Hashim Thaci and Rexhep Qosja. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 framed principles for a settlement. But the terms  
accepted by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic were tougher 
terms dictated by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the presence of Russian officials in G-8 meetings gives  
them an opportunity to play peacemaker and to seek conciliation for 
the Serbs, with whom they have historic ties.

<HEADLINE> Savings Likely if Kids Get Flu Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Vaccinating all schoolchildren against the flu  
would save hundreds of millions of dollars annually, mainly in lost 
work time of parents who stay home with sick youngsters and end up 
catching the virus themselves, researchers reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccination results in a net savings of $4 to $35 per child,  
according to an analysis published Monday in the journal 
Pediatrics. The savings depend on whether the child is taken to a 
doctor during work hours by a parent or gets immunized as part of a 
group, such as at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are efficient spreaders of the disease and a major  
factor in the introduction of influenza into households,'' the 
researchers noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used data on infection rates, wages of  
caretakers and costs of immunization to make their estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	If the estimates were applied to Census Bureau figures, which  
project about 51.8 million school-age children in 2000, the total 
savings could range from $207.2 million to $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, led by Terry White of Virginia Commonwealth  
University School of Medicine in Richmond, said that although 
serious complications from flu vaccine have occasionally occurred 
in adults, none have been reported in children.

	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission's recommendations  
include a moratorium on new lotteries and casinos, bans on gambling 
on the computer Internet and on college sports and increased help 
for problem gamblers. The report is scheduled to be presented to 
President Clinton, Congress, American Indian tribes and governors 
on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer, a former head of  
the conservative Family Research Council, has endorsed the 
recommendations. The Christian Coalition also is prepared to lobby 
on the issue, said the group's executive director, Randy Tate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gambling industry, which prefers the word ``gaming,'' is  
well-heeled and prepared to challenge its opponents. The American 
Gaming Association, a trade group, has taken top congressional 
Democrats and Republicans on behind-the-scenes tours of casino 
operations and held million-dollar fund-raisers for both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Congress right now it would be a struggle to get any  
anti-gaming thing passed,'' said William Thompson, a professor of 
public administration at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. 
``They've got the bucks and the opposition doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the industry's champions are Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., whose state is home to a growing casino industry, 
and House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, a home to 
riverboat gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott led a group of Senate Republicans in 1997 to the MGM Grand  
Hotel in Las Vegas, where they toured an employee training center 
before mingling with political donors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Gephardt and other top House Democrats toured the  
Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas before joining donors at a shrimp and 
lamb chop buffet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and the ranking Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways  
and Means Committee, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, returned last 
month to meet with Mirage Resorts chairman Steve Wynn and accept a 
$250,000 campaign contribution for House Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They acknowledge we're going to take the House back and  
they're hedging their bets because they know the odds are in our 
favor,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, chairman of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf, the gambling industry's chief lobbyist and a  
former Republican Party chairman, said touring casinos and mingling 
with their executives helps educate lawmakers so they will better 
understand the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., a former board chairwoman of the  
Nevada Hotel-Motel Association, also has urged the casino industry 
to bring her fellow freshmen to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gaming in Nevada is akin to cars in Detroit,'' she said. ``It  
is important for members to understand gaming is a business like 
any other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gaming Association's lobbying expenses increased  
from $760,000 in 1997 to $860,000 in 1998. Besides Fahrenkopf, the 
group's lobbyists include former Rep. Dennis Eckert, D-Ohio, and 
Kenneth Duberstein, White House chief of staff under President 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Since forming a political action committee in December 1995, the  
association has given $194,410 to federal candidates and political 
parties. Some of the individual casinos have given far more. 
Harrah's has contributed more than $1 million since 1995. Mirage 
boosted its giving from $159,800 in 1995-96 to $528,846 in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a right to be heard and represented in the halls of  
Congress,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``We want to be players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This increased financial support for congressional candidates is  
troubling to many religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more the parties become beholden to the gambling lobby,  
the more our families are at risk,'' the Christian Coalition's Tate 
said. ``We see this is as a disturbing trend. Gambling does nothing 
to enhance the local quality of life but does a lot to disrupt the 
family structure.''

<HEADLINE> 1,100-Pound Man Returns to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time in three years, a half-ton  
man who may be the world's heaviest person was removed by forklift 
through the picture window of his home and taken to the hospital, 
vowing this time to lose weight and keep it off. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 people watched workmen remove the glass, drive a lift  
up to the opening and load Michael Hebranko, 46, onto a wooden 
pallet for transfer to a special ``whale stretcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hebranko, swathed in bedding and wearing a breathing device, was  
then put into an ambulance by a team of burly attendants. He was 
driven with police escort to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, which 
has an obesity treatment unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am responsible for my life, the way everyone else is  
responsible for theirs,'' he said before being carried out of his 
modest bungalow in Brooklyn. ``I wouldn't be going to the hospital 
if I'd given up hope. I'm not going to die a heavy person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics estimated his weight Monday at 1,100 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of sad,'' said Steve Zakheim, owner of the ambulance  
company. ``He's a very sweet, caring fellow, and it's spooky how 
big he really is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the former pharmaceutical salesman entered the hospital  
weighing an estimated 800 pounds. He was placed on a 
1,600-calorie-a-day diet and fluid was drained from his body. He 
returned home two months later, about 400 pounds lighter, and 
promised to ``walk around the block.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he did take a few walks, he put back on the weight and  
more, mainly from a diet that included 24 hot dogs for breakfast, 
pounds of ham and cheese, loaves of bread and other large orders, 
almost all delivered by local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to do with genes,'' Hebranko said, lying in a bed that  
took up a sizeable part of his small living room. ``My body holds 
fat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He likened his eating habit to alcoholism: ``Once I start eating  
I cannot stop. It's a disease, it's an addiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hebranko got support from Hollywood fitness guru Richard  
Simmons, who once helped him lose 700 pounds, to a svelte 199 
pounds, and made him the poster boy for his Deal-a-Meal program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to die. I'm going to make sure of that,'' a  
tearful Simmons said in a telephone interview. He said he will 
visit Hebranko in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The record for heaviest human is held by a Seattle man who was  
estimated to have weighed more than 1,400 pounds in 1978, according 
to the Guinness Book of Records. He was 798 pounds when he died in 
1983.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Seek Way Out of 'Lease' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- It looks like a lease, acts like a lease and  
even is described as a ``lease'' 17 times in documents provided by 
the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	But the financially troubled team today asked a judge to  
reclassify its deal with sports facility manager SMG Inc. of 
Philadelphia as a $24 million loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reclassifying the lease potentially would reduce the amount SMG  
-- the Penguins' longtime landlord at the Civic Arena -- will be 
repaid when the team returns to normal business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz invalidated  
the lease, which was negotiated in 1991, renegotiated in 1994 and 
runs through 2007. It has been described in court as the worst 
lease in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	The rent has varied over the years with various payment factors  
such as SMG getting 10 to 14 percent of ticket revenue. SMG was 
paid $2.274 million by the Penguins in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	But before the deal was signed in 1991, Penguins owner Edward  
DeBartolo was paying $600,000 in annual rent to the Public 
Auditorium Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz's decision would allow for penalties to be paid to SMG  
if he decides the lease was really a lease and not a loan. If the 
judge decides the lease was substantially a loan, SMG could be 
lumped in with the businesses that have the least rights in the 
case -- the unsecured creditors, including the companies that supply 
the Penguins with pucks and towels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins asked Markovitz to rule that the multipart deal is  
not a lease. The judge gave no indication when he would make a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``At all times, these documents have been described as leases,  
signed as leases, recorded as leases and held out to various third 
parties that they are in fact leases,'' SMG attorney Daniel Shapira 
said. ``There is nothing to show that they are anything but 
leases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Penguins arranged for Antonio G. Tavares, the former SMG  
executive who is now president of the company that runs the Mighty 
Ducks and Anaheim Angels, to testify that the deal was unusual for 
a lease. 
</P>
<P>
	The $24 million up front was atypical for the industry, Tavares  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That money guaranteed SMG percentages of revenue from parking,  
jerseys, food and other items at the Civic Arena. Also, the 
Penguins had to repay SMG for expenses such as the Zamboni and the 
ticket office staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indications are that it doesn't look like a lease,''  
Tavares testified from suburban Los Angeles by a video connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease was valuable to the Penguins over the years. Team  
attorney Greg Cribbs said it was used as collateral to get loans 
from banks. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and NHL Hall of Fame member Mario Lemieux each have offered  
competing plans for running the team and are negotiating to try to 
resolve their differences. The Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh broadcast 
company is backing SMG's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL offered a backup plan that would shut the team down.  
League officials said they want Lemieux, who as the Penguins center 
led the team to two Stanley Cups in the early 1990s, to run the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Pittsburgh business leaders unveiled a marketing  
campaign aimed at helping the Penguins sell season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my 10th year here. Any time we've had some adversity,  
we've always come back stronger,'' Penguins general manager Craig 
Patrick said. ``This is the biggest hill we've had to climb. Once 
we get to the top, we'll be a really strong franchise.''

<HEADLINE> State Inmates' Court Access Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited federal court  
access for state prison inmates challenging their prosecutions. The 
6-3 decision was a defeat for an Illinois man who has spent his 
adult life behind bars for a rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled that state prisoners seeking a federal  
court's help generally cannot pursue claims that were not raised on 
direct appeal to their state's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling continued a decade-long trend in which the nation's  
highest court has narrowed state inmates' access to federal courts. 
Congress also has limited such access in a 1996 law aimed primarily 
at speeding up the executions of those convicted criminals 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	In other court action today, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled that billions of dollars worth of methane gas found with  
coal under federal land is not owned by the government and can be 
claimed by companies that purchase the right to drill for natural 
gas. The 7-1 decision resolved a big-stakes dispute between Amoco 
and an Indian tribe in Colorado. Amoco won. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away without comment an appeal from environmental groups  
that want the government to act more quickly to reduce noise from 
sightseeing planes flying over the Grand Canyon. The court turned 
away the groups' argument that the government has failed to meet 
the legally required deadlines for reducing such aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected an appeal by about 14,000 current and former federal  
law enforcement officers who say they improperly were denied 
overtime pay. The court, without comment, turned away the officers' 
effort to collect another four years' worth of overtime pay in 
addition to two years of pay they were granted in a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to let federal prosecutors use as evidence child  
pornography seized from a Georgia man's office in what lower courts 
called an illegal search. The court, without comment, rejected an 
appeal in which prosecutors argued that the constitutional 
protection against unreasonable searches does not apply to an area 
of someone's office outside their own work space. 
</P>
<P>
	In the state prisoner decision, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor  
wrote for the court that, ``State prisoners must give the state 
courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by 
invoking one complete round of the state's established appellate 
review process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted the ruling could increase the number of appeals to  
states' top courts, acknowledging, ``This increased burden may be 
unwelcome in some state courts.'' But O'Connor said today's ruling 
does not require inmates to pursue an appeal if higher state court 
review is not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means Darren Boerckel will not get a federal court  
hearing on part of his multifaceted challenge to his 1976 
convictions in the rape of an 87-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Boerckel, who as 17 when the crime occurred, contends his signed  
confession was unlawfully obtained by police in Montgomery County, 
Ill. He also says he was denied adequate legal help and contends 
that his trial was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Boerckel's convictions for rape, burglary and aggravated battery  
drew prison sentences of 20 to 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His first appeal, which raised seven issues, was rejected by a  
state appeals court. Because the Illinois Supreme Court discourages 
litigants from raising every conceivable claim in their appeals, 
Boerckel's ensuing appeal to that court raised only three of the 
seven issues. The state Supreme Court refused to review his case. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Boerckel filed an appeal in federal court. The  
so-called habeas corpus petition raised issues that had been 
included in his state appellate court case but had been left out 
when he sought the Illinois Supreme Court's help. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge refused to consider the merits of several  
issues raised in the appeal, ruling that they had not been 
``exhausted'' in state courts. The judge also denied Boerckel's 
remaining claims that had been raised before the state's top court. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Boerckel's  
federal appeal last year, sparking a Supreme Court appeal by state 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court today said the 7th Circuit court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor wrote that inmates like Boerckel must ``use the state's  
established appellate review procedures'' before presenting their 
claims to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Her opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and 
Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens, Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg dissented. Writing for the three, Stevens said the court 
requires inmates ``in states like Illinois to present to the state 
supreme court every federal issue that ... might possibly warrant 
some relief if brought in a future federal habeas petition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is O'Sullivan vs. Boerckel, 97-2048.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Opposes Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leading opponent of proposed campaign  
finance revisions asked the Supreme Court on Monday to declare 
unconstitutional the 25-year-old $1,000 limit on contributions to 
federal campaigns by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., argued in a friend-of-court brief  
that contribution limits, adopted by Congress after Watergate, have 
a ``severe adverse effect'' on the ability of candidates to raise 
the increasing amounts of cash needed to finance a run for federal 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's economy, the $1,000 is worth $302, according to the  
brief, filed as part of a Missouri campaign-finance dispute the 
high court will resolve next term. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted for inflation, the individual limit should be $3,306,  
the filing said. It would be $4,600 if adjusted both for inflation 
and increases in voting-age population. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial  
Committee, which raises money and recruits Republican Senate 
candidates, said ``broad agreement'' for higher contribution limits 
exists, including among many of those who want to change the 
system, such as President Clinton and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a 
2000 presidential hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that purchasing power has been eroded,''  
McConnell said at a news conference on the Supreme Court steps, 
across from the Capitol. ``Clearly this is a problem that everyone 
can agree needs to be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court upheld campaign contribution limits in 1976,  
two years after they were adopted by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend that higher contribution limits would pump even  
more money into federal campaigns, foster corruption and increase 
the influence of wealthy contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, however, blamed the 1974 limits for creating the  
``money chase,'' in which candidates spend large amounts of time on 
the fund-raising circuit. Higher limits would help them raise money 
from fewer sources, he said.

<HEADLINE> Julie Andrews Sings at Tony Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julie Andrews, appearing with Carol Burnett as a  
Tony Award presenter, proved true her prediction of last December 
that she would sing again. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Burnett traded phrases of several songs, and kidded  
around a bit Sunday. Burnett said, ``Don't you like these keys?'', 
since they weren't always singing in the same key. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews remarked that Burnett was singing a song she'd done in  
``Putting It Together,'' a review of Stephen Sondheim songs she'd 
appeared in off-Broadway. ``I'm taking it to Broadway,'' Burnett 
replied, ``but not until November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before it began to look like a TV special by the two women, they  
said, they would introduce the ``Sing, Sing, Sing'' number from 
``Fosse,'' a show nominated as best musical. It won. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, who had throat surgery two years ago to remove nodules,  
had been reported to be despondent because her singing career was 
over. She denied the reports and told the Mail in London in 
December, ``I will sing again.'' She said she'd been making ``a 
slow vocal recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews was last on Broadway in ``Victor/Victoria,'' which  
opened in October 1995 and earned her a Tony nomination.

<HEADLINE> Jones Becomes Undisputed Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- In boxing, there are more champions than  
there are titles. And that's why Roy Jones is so unique. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones pounded out a unanimous decision that left Reggie Johnson  
battered and bleeding and made Jones the first undisputed world's 
light heavyweight champion in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love championship belts,'' Jones said after adding his third  
one. ``I think there should always be an undisputed champion. That 
is something prestigious and made this fight interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones becomes only the third undisputed light heavyweight  
champion, joining Bob Foster and Michael Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' speed and quickness gave him a huge edge and an easy  
victory Saturday night. He won every round and every judge scored 
it 120-106 in favor of Jones, who added Johnson's IBF title to the 
WBA and WBC crowns he already had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've proven everything I had to prove,'' Jones said. ``After  
awhile, I was just having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who weighed 174 pounds, used a straight right 1:58 into  
the first round to knock down Johnson. The Houston fighter got up 
quickly, but was bleeding from his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third round, Jones countered a right from Johnson with a  
left-right combination that sent him to the canvas. Again Johnson 
got up quickly and the bell ended the round. By that time, blood 
was streaming from Johnson's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was only able to fight back in spurts by the fourth  
round. The rest of the time he was backing away or covering up. 
When he managed to get inside, Jones punished him with jabs and 
uppercuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the 12-round fight Johnson's face was swollen,  
his white trunks streaked with blood. But Johnson (39-6-1) kept 
answering the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy was real quick,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't have time to  
counter his punches. Coming into the fight, I knew I had to give a 
lot and take a lot of punches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones landed 273 punches to just 49 for Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, which included a big contingent from Jones' hometown  
of Pensacola, Fla., called for a knockout. There were some boos 
late in the fight when Jones didn't press his attack. Johnson did 
go down in the 12th after a solid right from Jones, but it was 
ruled a slip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have pressured him and knocked him out, but why would  
I take a chance on him getting a lucky punch and knocking me out?'' 
Jones said. ``That's not very businesslike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones was not completely businesslike.  
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't resist showboating when it became apparent how  
completely he was dominating the fight. At one point, he backed 
Johnson to the ropes, looked at Michael Jordan, who was seated 
ringside, and shouted, ``Watch this!'' before throwing a flurry of 
jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the best player ever in the building and, at the same  
time, we had the best boxer in the building,'' Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Dupont Cutting Polyester Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont Co. is slashing about 1,400  
positions from its troubled polyester division as a decline in 
demand for its products has forced the company to look for ways to 
reduce costs and restructure the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced Monday that 800 employees and 600  
contractors will be laid off. That accounts for about 14 percent of 
the polyester division's global workforce. About 80 percent of the 
positions are in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deep and prolonged decline in the global polyester market  
is driving fundamental structural change in the industry, making it 
imperative that we take additional steps now to strengthen our 
business,'' said George MacCormack, vice president for DuPont 
Polyester Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is expected to result in a pre-tax savings of $90  
million that will begin accruing in the fourth quarter. DuPont 
expects to take a nonrecurring charge in the second quarter of the 
year of four cents a share for employee separation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges related to asset write-offs are expected to cost an  
additional two cents to four cents a share as part of the 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, DuPont has planned several changes around its  
polyester business worldwide, particularly in the area of creating 
joint partnerships with other companies to manufacture and market 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilmington, Del.-based company has announced joint ventures  
with Alpek of Mexico and Teijin of Japan for polyester filament in 
the Americas, and with Sabanci of Turkey for polyester 
intermediates, resins and fibers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont-Akra Polyester, a joint venture with Alpek for polyester  
staple in the Americas, began operations on April 1.

	The company hopes that its joint ventures will reduce the level  
of exposure it has in a changing market while increasing 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont said in a release today that its employees who have their  
positions terminated can get ``transition packages'' available in 
their country or region. For instance, the company said, U.S. 
employees leaving DuPont will receive a package including payments 
based on length of service, benefit assistance and educational 
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Brit Accused of Attacking Attendants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- A trans-Atlantic flight was diverted when a  
British passenger who was refused drinks tried to get into the 
cockpit and assaulted two flight attendants, airport officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta jet was flying from Atlanta to Manchester, England,  
when Christopher Bayes, 41, became belligerent in first class, 
demanding another drink, said Jeff Russell, marketing director at 
the Bangor International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayes, from Manchester, England, tried to get into the cockpit  
to press his demand. The cockpit door was locked and two flight 
attendants and some passengers battled to subdue him. 
</P>
<P>
	They tied Bayes up until Flight 064 landed in Bangor late  
Saturday, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two flight attendants were treated at a hospital for minor  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayes was charged Monday in federal court with assault,  
interference with a flight crew and causing an aircraft to divert. 
He was being held at the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was blotto,'' said Paul Palumbo, an agent with the Federal  
Bureau of Investigation, said Monday. ``But I saw him today and 
he's a very nice guy.''

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Has Woods Picked in Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Tiger Woods is one man's choice to win next  
week's U.S. Open. And this man knows about such things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if anybody can play the way he does,'' Jack  
Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who has four U.S. Open titles, spoke after watching  
Woods win the Memorial Tournament yesterday with a remarkable short 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus' comment about Woods recalls what Bobby Jones said 40  
years ago about Nicklaus: ``Jack is playing an entirely different 
game -- a game I'm not even familiar with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods saved pars from lies that lended themselves to double  
bogeys. While playing partner Vijay Singh watched with mounting 
frustration, Woods got up-and-down pars at Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 16 and 
blasted out of deep rough for a birdie at the fifth hole. 
</P>
<P>
	His most memorable shot -- coming seconds after he muffed a  
similar sand wedge shot -- came at the 14th. He flopped the ball out 
of deep rough and rolled in a lightning-quick, sidehill 25-footer 
for par. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line was a 3-under 69 that left him at 15-under 273  
and two shots ahead of Singh to pick up his second tour win of the 
year and the first-place check of $459,000. 
</P>
<P>
	This was his second straight victory, following the Deutsche  
Bank-SAP Open two weeks ago in Germany. Now he heads to the Open at 
Pinehurst, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods played the No. 2 course there early last week and was  
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent a lot of time on those greens and chipping around,  
having a lot of fun, playing different clubs,'' he said. ``I felt 
pretty good. I tried almost every club in my bag around the 
greens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods customarily hits 350-yard drives and on Saturday reached  
Muirfield Village Golf Club's 539-yard 11th hole with a pair of 
2-irons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicks dig the long ball,'' he cracked, flashing his famous  
grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it was his creativity around the greens -- frequently  
overlooked, he said -- that paved the way for his ninth PGA Tour 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``His long game was probably not the most pristine that he's  
ever seen,'' said Nicklaus, the tournament founder and course 
designer. ``But I think his short game was unbelievable. Most 
players at 23 don't have that kind of an imagination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said there was a lot of truth to the adage about driving  
for show and putting for dough. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask most people if they think John Daly has a good  
short game, they'll say no,'' he said. ``But he's got a great short 
game. People don't realize it because he hits it so far. They look 
at only the fact that he hits it 330 yards. They don't realize how 
good a touch he really has around the greens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus said there's a lesson in that for younger players,  
citing Woods and David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the two best players in the game today, Tiger and  
David, both love to practice their short game,'' Nicklaus said. 
``And it's paid off for both of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Nicklaus was renowned in his youth for prodigious  
drives although few acknowledged his delicate touch around the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said this victory was particularly sweet because it came  
in a tournament created by the 59-year-old Nicklaus, whom he has 
long admired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hitting balls next to him the other day on the left side  
of the range and it was pretty cool watching him out there hitting 
balls with the perfect trajectory, never a bad shot,'' Woods said. 
``I'm thinking, 'Wow, if I'm as old as he is, I'd like to be able 
just to walk.'''

<HEADLINE> Stanley Finals: Gritty Not Pretty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- These Stanley Cup finals are made for hockey  
purists who prize goaltending more than goal scoring, backchecking 
more than breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be gritty, not pretty. They will be a turf war on  
skates, with goals given only grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
	They are not made for TV, darn the NHL's luck.  
</P>
<P>
	Here is hockey's best chance in years to gain some artistic and  
competitive ground on the Michael Jordan-less NBA, to add some 
rating points and build off the publicity created by the nostalgic 
farewell of its own megastar, Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	But just when the NHL needed some offense, some oomph, some Mark  
McGwire vs. Sammy Sosa-like fireworks to steal the NBA's thunder 
and some of its TV viewers, it gets a Stanley Cup final between ... 
Buffalo and Dallas? 
</P>
<P>
	In hockey, it doesn't get any better defensively than Sabres vs.  
Stars, the Dominator vs. the Indomitable. But when it comes to 
hockey on TV, defense usually is a tough, tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, this isn't going to be a series made for television,''  
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Monday, little more than 24 hours 
before Tuesday night's Game 1 at Reunion Arena. ``So if you're 
looking for Champions on Ice, you are watching the wrong game. This 
is going to be a hard-fought, passionate contest where ice is going 
to be defended very tough. It is a series where both teams' wills 
will be extended to the max.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So could the ability of fans to hang with a series where goals  
will likely result mostly from breakdowns, not breakouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo has the Dominator, goaltender Dominik Hasek, the game's  
most dominant defensive player and the one most capable of deciding 
a series single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Proof of evidence: his unyielding goaltending for the gold  
medal-winning Czech Republic in the 1998 Nagano Olympics and 
Buffalo's 11-3 record in these playoffs following a seventh-place 
finish in the Eastern Conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
	And no one can question Dallas' credentials for greatness. The  
Presidents' Trophy champions unquestionably were the NHL's best 
regular season team, with 16 more points than Colorado and 23 more 
points -- and 14 more wins -- than Buffalo. They are a team so 
committed to the defense-first style of Hitchcock and general 
manager Bob Gainey that reformed one-way player Brett Hull has even 
adapted to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Picture Jose Canseco willingly accepting a role as a late-inning  
defensive replacement, and you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two teams that are as committed to physical play, to  
defending, to second and third shots, to sacrificing in front of 
both goals. It is going to make for very emotional hockey,'' 
Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emotions already were stirred in Buffalo by Stars center Mike  
Modano's remarks following Dallas' 4-1 victory Friday over Colorado 
in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. Modano wondered if the 
Stanley Cup Finals, already awarded to Dallas in the minds of many, 
might prove a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Those four-game Stanley Cup sweeps by the last three Western  
Conference champions, Detroit in 1998 and 1997 and Colorado in 
1996, might have contributed to his mindset. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody is anticipating a little bit of a letdown  
going into the finals,'' Modano said. ``Once you saw teams like 
Philly, New Jersey and Ottawa go down, it was kind of 
disappointing. To be the best, you want to go through the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Modano, one of only three players remaining from the  
Stars' last Stanley Cup finalists, the 1991 Minnesota North Stars, 
couldn't have backtracked any faster if he had been on motorized 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I said was never meant to take anything away from  
Buffalo,'' Modano said. ``I think a lot of people were discussing a 
letdown because of what our conference finals were against 
Colorado. They figured everything was going to be a letdown, but we 
never felt that way. I think everybody wanted the top two teams to 
be in the finals, and you do have the top teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' Dixon Ward didn't sound overly insulted.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever people think doesn't matter to us,'' he said. ``It is  
not anticlimactic for us whatsoever. We are excited to be here, and 
we have earned the right to play for the Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's evident. The Sabres are 7-0 at home, compared to Dallas'  
7-2, and Hasek historically plays better in bigger games than the 
Stars' Ed Belfour, who went winless for Chicago in the 1992 Stanley 
Cup finals against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' biggest edge may be its ability to seize a lead, then  
protect it. They are 10-1 when they score first, 7-0 when leading 
after the first period and 8-0 when leading after the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the best hockey club in the NHL, on top of being the  
toughest team to play against when they have the lead,'' Colorado 
coach Bob Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a series that promises to more passionate than  
aesthetically pleasing, how many outside Buffalo and Dallas be 
watching when it is over? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to put on a fashion show and make it  
exciting,'' Modano said. ``When you win, you win. I think the fans 
here have finally accepted that, whether you win ugly or pretty, it 
doesn't matter.''

<HEADLINE> Magnet Company Guilty on Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Federal prosecutors say they will continue  
to pursue individuals involved in an international magnet company 
that pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud investors with false 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	YBM Magnex International Inc. entered a guilty plea Monday  
before U.S. District Judge Franklin VanAntwerpen to conspiracy to 
commit securities and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newtown, Pa. company, which claimed to have a growing market  
in large industrial magnets, agreed in a plea bargain to pay a $3 
million fine, pay compensation to investors, and cooperate with a 
continuing federal investigation, said U.S. Attorney Michael R. 
Stiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiles said prosecutors also hope to bring criminal charges  
against unnamed individuals, including ``an individual, primarily 
from Budapest, Hungary, who was associated with organized criminal 
activity in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union,'' who 
Stiles said planned and directed the formation of YBM. 
</P>
<P>
	YBM was placed in receivership last year by the Court of Queen's  
Bench in Calgary, Alberta. Stiles said the plea agreement provided 
for distribution of payments to investors through that court. The 
Canadian court gave approval in April for YBM to enter into the 
plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiles said the conspirators issued false financial statements  
as YBM's stock rose from 10 cents a share when initially listed in 
Canada in 1994 to about $14 a share when it was ordered off the 
Canadian exchanges by the Securities Commissions in Ontario and 
Alberta in mid-May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	YBM officials could not be reached for comment. At the office of  
YBM vice president Guy Scala, who earlier said he was disappointed 
by last year's events, a woman who answered the telephone said ``No 
comment'' and hung up without identifying herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our good-faith belief that we are talking about hundreds  
of millions'' of dollars owed to investors, Stiles said. The task 
of identifying defrauded investors and making compensation payments 
would take years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the stock ceased trading, YBM's market capitalization was  
about $430 million, according to the plea agreement Stiles filed in 
U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock was never listed on an organized stock exchange in the  
United States, and YBM dropped efforts to have it listed last year. 
But it was traded over-the-counter in the United States and Canada 
between August 1994 and May 1998, the court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiles said the company fraudulently claimed that it had strong  
penetration of the North American magnet market, that it was 
marketing a computer security device called ``Catch Disk'' that 
never was a viable product, and that a powder byproduct of 
magnet-making could be used in oil refining. The company also 
falsely claimed that it was getting money from magnet production 
that actually came from the resale of magnets purchased elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our position that there was no industrial magnet  
business. It is our position that ... the amount of business was 
grossly overvalued,'' Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe included investigators from the U.S. Attorney's  
office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service, and local police from several 
communities.

<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Criticizes Commercial TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has nothing  
good to say about commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a Public Broadcasting Service meeting here on  
Monday, he described television as a ``potentially lethal light in 
our living rooms and our minds'' that ``has the capacity of eroding 
our culture from within.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of ``The Civil War'' and ``Baseball'' documentaries  
called PBS ``an oasis on the dial.'' Among ``dozens of clone-like 
channels,'' PBS, which airs Burns' work, is able to thrive because 
it's different, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns also showed a few minutes of his upcoming 18-hour series  
``Jazz,'' which traces the music's origins and offers a glimpse 
into America's soul, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary, slated for broadcast in fall of 2000, will  
complete his trilogy of works delving into the nation's history.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Red Violin' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The search for perfection is a recurring theme in ``The Red  
Violin,'' and it is not extravagant to say that this remarkable 
movie comes close to achieving that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a film that touches all of the senses -- eyes, ears, mind  
and heart -- with the blending of evocative storytelling and 
symphonic music that is a rare treat in this summer of the 
big-budget blitzkrieg of special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Violin'' is clearly a labor of love and a passion for  
all involved in making this film for an astonishingly low $9 
million. The Canadian-Italian co-production takes viewers on a 
journey across five countries and three centuries as it tells the 
imagined story of a very special violin as it transforms the lives 
of its owners. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, ``The Red Violin'' feels like five movies in five  
languages. But the clever plotting of the story and the mystery 
that is solved only in the final frames bring all of them together 
in a satisfying and surprising climax. Subtitles for all but the 
English-language sections keep the authenticity of each locale. 
</P>
<P>
	The only ``stars'' likely to be recognized by American audiences  
are Samuel L. Jackson as a violin expert who becomes enamored of 
the legendary instrument and Greta Scacchi as the romance writer 
and muse to an unconventional violinist (Jason Flemyng) in 
19th-century England. But all of the performances are expert. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, written by Canadian director Francois Girard and Don  
McKellar, begins in 17th-century Italy where a noted violin maker, 
Nicolo Bussotti (Carlo Cecchi), creates his masterpiece, a perfect 
violin intended as a gift for his unborn son. But the future of the 
baby and of Bussotti's beautiful wife (Irene Grazioli) are shadowed 
by tragedy predicted by a fortuneteller (Anita Laurenzi) whose 
readings of tarot cards are a unifying thread of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	With the death of Bussotti's dream, the Red Violin, so named for  
its unique varnish color, begins its journey across continents, 
showing up first in Vienna at a monastery where monks train orphan 
boys as violinists. There, it is assigned to an angelic 6-year-old 
prodigy, Kaspar Weiss, portrayed by real-life violin prodigy, 
Christoph Koncz. The small boy turns out to be a genius and is 
adopted by a French music master, providing another short 
film-within-a-film. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the violin falls into the hands of Gypsies who take  
it to England where it inspires the virile virtuoso Frederick Pope 
(Flemyng). It then makes its way to Shanghai and becomes a 
political hot potato in China's cultural evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Each story allows for violin solos, performed by acclaimed  
musician Joshua Bell. The London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted 
by Esa-Pekka Salonen, plays John Corigliano's haunting score for 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The violin's ultimate arrival at a prestigious auction house in  
present-day Montreal is telegraphed throughout the film as we see a 
high-stakes auction in repeated flashbacks. In yet another subplot, 
Jackson, in a virtuoso performance of his own, is the violin expert 
brought in to authenticate the Red Violin. When he concludes that 
he has found perfection and unravels the violin's shocking mystery 
through use of computers and DNA testing, he faces an ethical 
crisis that provides the film's grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Girard first drew attention last year with his ``Thirty-Two  
Short Films About Glenn Gould.'' His early background was in 
filming architecture, dance and music, which explains the exquisite 
look and sound of this movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Production designer Francois Seguin, photography director Alain  
Dostie and costume designer Renee April have crafted scenes that 
are vivid paintings of each era. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Violin'' was produced by Niv Fichman and is being  
released by New Line International Releasing, Channel Four films 
and Telefilm Canada. Released without a rating, this movie has 
brief nudity, a whimsical sex scene and little violence. A bit too 
sophisticated for young children. Running time: 126 minutes.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Globe and Mail, one of Canada's two  
nationally circulated newspapers, today named Phillip Crawley as 
its publisher and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawley, who serves as the Globe's chief operating officer and  
president, will succeed Roger Parkinson, currently chairman, 
publisher and chief executive, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson, who joined the Toronto-based newspaper in 1994, will  
stay on as chairman and will focus on long-term strategy, along 
with customer and industry relations. the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawley, 55, joined the newspaper in 1998 from the New Zealand  
Herald where he was managing director. He also spent five years as 
editor-in-chief of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe and Mail is the flagship publication of the newspaper  
division of Thomson Corp., the Toronto-based publishing and 
information company. While Thomson has sold most of its Canadian 
newspapers, it still owns about 50 dailies in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Crop Has Growers Smiling / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio families are putting more strawberry  
pie and strawberry shortcake on the menu at home. The state's 
strawberry crop, the nation's 11th largest, is more plentiful and 
flavorful this season than in recent years, fruit growers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got good size, flavor and quality,'' said Mike Pullins,  
executive director of the Ohio Fruit Growers Society. ``We have an 
excellent crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry growers have a mild winter, warm spring and dry early  
summer to thank. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been nearly perfect,'' Pullins said Monday. ``You don't  
always get all three of those to cooperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key to the berry crop is the weather in the prior year,  
Pullins said. A mild winter allowed the berry plants to store 
plenty of energy, and even though some areas were dry this spring, 
it helped limit disease and bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers also didn't face a damaging late frost this year.  
Irrigation systems allowed growers to deal easily with the dry 
periods, Pullins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's fruit growers produce about 3 1/2 million pounds of  
strawberries each year, making Ohio the 11th ranking state for that 
crop. Nearly all of it is sold at farmer's markets and in the field 
at popular pick-your-own farms. 
</P>
<P>
	As in most of the country, most strawberries sold at  
supermarkets come from California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelli Klickman, operator of Klickman Strawberries in Elmore,  
said the season has been excellent so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year the early berries are the sweetest they've ever  
been,'' she said. ``Last year the early berries needed sugar. This 
year you don't need sugar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Typical for farming, though, worries are not far away.  
Temperatures in the mid-90s have caused the berries to ripen at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Her solution: increase advertising.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were real busy over the weekend,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Most growers are about a week ahead of schedule in harvesting  
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Grass seed growers once burned off the straw  
on their Willamette Valley farms, ridding the land of waste that 
bred pests and plant disease. Now they're exporting it to Asia in 
record amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, farmers in northwest Oregon's Willamette Valley  
expect to ship about $40 million worth of straw to Japan, Taiwan 
and South Korea, where it is used as roughage in feed for beef 
cattle and dairy animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The exports do more than make money. They help solve  
environmental problems created by smoke from the burning of the 
fields every year. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of smoke complaints from urban residents,  
coupled with a deadly, smoke-caused accident along Interstate 5 in 
1988, produced severe limits on burning in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is a remarkable marketplace solution to an  
environmental problem,'' said Steve van Mouwerik, general manager 
of the Oregon division of Anderson Hay and Grain Co. Inc., an 
Ellensburg, Wash., exporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, Oregonians considered burning straw in the  
Willamette Valley to be our worst environmental problem,'' he said. 
``Now it's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon straw exports appear ready to set a record this year,  
because worse than usual typhoons damaged rice crops in Japan and 
South Korea, reducing the amount of rice straw available for animal 
feed. At the same time, a long dry spell during the Willamette 
Valley's baling season last July and August produced a bumper crop 
of straw, Van Mouwerik said.

<HEADLINE> Church Votes To Oust Archbishop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The oldest and largest Greek Orthodox diocese in  
the United States has voted for the ouster of the church's 
archbishop, intensifying a feud over his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Clergy and laity from 63 parishes in New England voted 58-51 on  
Saturday to adopt a report calling for the removal of Archbishop 
Spyridon. 
</P>
<P>
	His detractors say he has stifled dissent and has an immigrant  
mentality that keeps him from relating to faithful who feel more 
American than Greek. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's chased anyone with money and credentials out of the  
church,'' said Dean Popps, spokesman for Greek Orthodox American 
Leaders Inc., which was founded two years ago for the sole purpose 
of removing Spyridon. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyridon, 54, enjoys the full support of the Ecumenical  
Patriarch Bartholomew, who is headquartered in Istanbul, Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	That has prompted another dissident group, the Chicago-based  
Orthodox Christian Laity, to seek autonomy from the patriarch for 
the American church, which is estimated to have as many as 2 
million members. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen Greek Orthodox churches in the United States have agreed  
to withhold funds from the archdiocese as a way to protest the 
archbishop. Popps said churches generally give 15 percent of their 
revenue to the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Spyridon offered to resign if he failed to placate  
his critics. The Rev. Mark Arey, a spokesman for Spyridon, said the 
dispute was a matter of arcane church politics fueled by a group of 
wealthy dissidents who simply don't like the archbishop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would characterize the vote as an expression of frustration  
and nothing really more,'' Arey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed out that Spyridon has ordered the liturgy translated  
into English, proposed conducting Greek education in English and 
transferred the archdiocese's $45 million endowment to a lay 
organization.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidate Kasich Takes Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Kasich is opposed to ethanol subsidies  
and corporate tax loopholes. He would cut some Social Security 
benefits, and he thinks abortion is overestimated as a voter 
concern. ``God is not a wedge issue,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	These are tough stands for a Republican presidential candidate  
to take, but Kasich said during a recent campaign stop, ``I'm not 
going to change for anything. Not even to be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His advisers are not so fatalistic; they say the Ohio  
congressman's against-the-grain style should distinguish him from a 
crowded field and breathe new life into his long-shot campaign. 
It's a gamble several other presidential hopefuls are willing to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	Calculated risks are an early rite of the 2000 campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, former president of the American Red Cross,  
called for gun control before the Colorado school shootings. Party 
activists are generally staunch Second Amendment proponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley, a Democratic candidate, is considering  
a proposed ban on hand gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., urged President Clinton to win the  
conflict in Yugoslavia at all costs -- even if that meant the 
deployment of ground troops. Polls show little support for a 
full-fledged war. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, McCain and Kasich are establishment Republicans  
overshadowed by the fledging candidacy of Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, who has a wide lead in polls and the endorsement of scores of 
GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bradley trails far behind the Democratic front-runner, Vice  
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush and Gore play it safe, their rivals are taking  
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kasich is doing it because Mrs. Dole did it and McCain did it,  
and they had some success getting attention,'' said GOP strategist 
Eddie Mahe. ``If I were the rest of them, I would be figuring out 
some position I can take that conflicts with the party's base, 
because if it doesn't conflict it wouldn't be a story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the attention could come at a cost if primary voters reject  
the risky stands. In Iowa, site of the nation's first presidential 
caucuses, ethanol subsidies are considered untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the fine line Kasich and them are walking,'' Mahe said.  
``They get the attention, but the attention could kill them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Graff, a presidential historian at Columbia University,  
said the strategy is part of a broader trend in presidential 
politics to avoid big issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these candidates is trying to distinguish himself and  
herself from the pack,'' he said. ``It's understood that no one 
needs to have a vision anymore, just an issue that gives them some 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton criticized a black rap  
singer in a calculated effort to portray himself as a centrist 
Democrat with a streak of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich says he is speaking from his heart, not from polls.  
</P>
<P>
	Shouting into a mobile phone from a noisy airport tarmac in  
California, Kasich says, ``I have to stay true to the things I 
believe. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believes police should not detain people simply because of  
their race, making him the first GOP candidate to speak out against 
so-called racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes abortion is wrong, but is too often used by fellow  
Republicans as a divisive issue. ``God is not a wedge issue,'' he 
says. ``We should not use values to divide the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believes Social Security cannot be overhauled without baby  
boomers sacrificing some benefits in exchange for a system that 
gives them more freedom to invest in their own retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes assault-style weapons should be banned, and voted  
against the GOP majority for such a bill in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes corporate loopholes -- what he calls ``corporate  
welfare'' -- should be eliminated, even if that means killing the 
ethanol subsidy beloved by Iowa Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tell me that's going to kill me in Iowa, but I'm not  
going to change my position to get votes,'' Kasich told Iowans in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you'll forgive me,'' he said, ``and be for me anyway.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopeful Alexander Cuts Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif., (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Lamar  
Alexander has cut still more staff from his campaign, telling 
workers the layoffs were necessary to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of Alexander's three-day California swing, deputy  
press secretary Valerie Walston was laid off Monday morning, said a 
campaign source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign also told press aide John Tolsma not to report to  
work as planned June 16, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's cuts appeared to be part of an earlier round last week  
in which Alexander laid off his communications director, legal 
counsel and several support staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who lags in presidential preference polls, is  
shifting all of his efforts to Iowa, the source said. The former 
Tennessee governor and U.S. education secretary is aiming to finish 
strong in an August straw vote in Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign representatives did not immediately respond to messages  
left Monday evening at Alexander's campaign offices in Washington, 
D.C., and Nashville, Tenn., seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	When the cuts were disclosed last week, Alexander adviser Tom  
Rath said Alexander was trying to survive ``Bush mania,'' hoping 
the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, would stumble. 
</P>
<P>
	In that scenario, Alexander would siphon support from Bush, his  
fellow GOP moderate, and make a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alexander campaign is leaving its fund-raising operation  
intact, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander plans stops in San Francisco, Orange County, Los  
Angeles and Sacramento during his California visit Tuesday through 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Opposes Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leading opponent of proposed campaign  
finance revisions asked the Supreme Court on Monday to declare 
unconstitutional the 25-year-old $1,000 limit on contributions to 
federal campaigns by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., argued in a friend-of-court brief  
that contribution limits, adopted by Congress after Watergate, have 
a ``severe adverse effect'' on the ability of candidates to raise 
the increasing amounts of cash needed to finance a run for federal 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's economy, the $1,000 is worth $302, according to the  
brief, filed as part of a Missouri campaign-finance dispute the 
high court will resolve next term. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted for inflation, the individual limit should be $3,306,  
the filing said. It would be $4,600 if adjusted both for inflation 
and increases in voting-age population. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial  
Committee, which raises money and recruits Republican Senate 
candidates, said ``broad agreement'' for higher contribution limits 
exists, including among many of those who want to change the 
system, such as President Clinton and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a 
2000 presidential hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that purchasing power has been eroded,''  
McConnell said at a news conference on the Supreme Court steps, 
across from the Capitol. ``Clearly this is a problem that everyone 
can agree needs to be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court upheld campaign contribution limits in 1976,  
two years after they were adopted by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend that higher contribution limits would pump even  
more money into federal campaigns, foster corruption and increase 
the influence of wealthy contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, however, blamed the 1974 limits for creating the  
``money chase,'' in which candidates spend large amounts of time on 
the fund-raising circuit. Higher limits would help them raise money 
from fewer sources, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gates Tape Played for Bristol Jurors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Microsoft chairman Bill Gates denied in  
a deposition played for jurors today that his company had tried to 
freeze out a tiny Danbury software company after initially giving 
it access to Windows programming code. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for Bristol Technology Inc. grilled Gates about an  
e-mail message in which he wrote that Microsoft was choosing 
Bristol's main competitor, Mainsoft Inc., as its partner, and 
``revving up their activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The videotaped deposition was played Monday in U.S. District  
Court, where Bristol has filed an antitrust lawsuit against 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, who appeared combative and forgetful during a lengthy  
deposition last year for the larger antitrust case being heard in 
Washington, D.C., was generally congenial and relaxed during the 
deposition for the Bristol case. 
</P>
<P>
	During his deposition for the Justice Department case, Gates  
appeared so evasive in interviews with government lawyers that the 
judge laughed and shook his head while watching the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs  
that were written for Windows to run on computers with different 
operating systems, such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Microsoft signed a three-year contract with Bristol  
giving the company access to programming code -- the software 
blueprints -- for Windows NT 3.0, a version of its operating system 
designed to work with powerful corporate computers. 
</P>
<P>
	When the contract expired in 1997, the two companies could not  
come to an agreement. Bristol claims Microsoft promised to make the 
code available into the future. Microsoft says Bristol is trying to 
get more favorable licensing terms for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Bristol's lawyers questioned Gates about a  
September 1997 e-mail he sent to several Microsoft employees. In 
it, Gates lists eight actions Microsoft was taking, including 
choosing Mainsoft as a partner in its cross-platform program, 
called the Windows Interface Source Environment, or WISE. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol had also been a WISE partner with Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now what did you mean -- if you didn't mean to exclude Bristol  
from the WISE program -- then what did you mean by picking Mainsoft 
as your partner?'' Bristol attorney Patrick Lynch asked Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean anything about whether it was Mainsoft or  
Bristol, I'm just talking about the things we're doing, so for 
total completeness, maybe I should have listed Bristol,'' Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, and you didn't mean to tell your people that for some  
reason you had decided to freeze Bristol out of the WISE program?'' 
Lynch asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Gates replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury appeared alternately amused and bored by Gates'  
testimony. At one point, several jurors chuckled when Gates became 
animated about the competitive threat posed by Netscape -- an issue 
in the case brought by the Justice Department case and 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the government contends that Microsoft illegally  
wielded monopoly power from its dominant Windows product to expand 
into new markets, such as Internet software, and thus crush 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Netscape stated very clearly that their goal was to put  
Windows out of business, to make it obsolete and useless, and that 
Microsoft would go bankrupt based on their activities,'' Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that caused you to believe that it was a serious  
competitive threat?'' asked Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, when people say those things, it gets my  
attention,'' Gates said.

<HEADLINE> NiSource Wants Columbia Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- NiSource Inc. launched a hostile bid for  
Virginia-based Columbia Energy Group Monday, a $5.7 billion deal 
that if successful would make NiSource into one of the nation's 
biggest natural gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsolicited bid came after a formal offer to Columbia's  
board of directors was rejected and Columbia's executives refused 
to discuss merging with NiSource. 
</P>
<P>
	``A merger of our two companies has substantial benefits to our  
respective shareholders, customers, and employees,'' NiSource 
chairman and chief executive Gary L. Neale wrote in a letter to 
Oliver Richard III, Columbia Energy's chairman and CEO. 
``Unfortunately, your refusal to discuss these benefits leaves us 
no alternative but to go public with our proposal. ... We are 
confident that your shareholders will enthusiastically support our 
proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a response letter sent later Monday, Richard grudgingly  
conceded that NiSource's move will force Columbia to consider the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Columbia Energy Group is not for sale and is not interested in  
any merger transaction in which another company acquires control of 
Columbia,'' he wrote. ``Nevertheless, in light of the formal nature 
of the offer set forth in your letter, your offer will be 
considered by our board of directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource hopes its public announcement will force the Columbia  
board to not only consider the offer but also open talks, Neale 
said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a majority of Columbia stock is institutionally held.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to at least take our proposal to those  
shareholders,'' he said. ``Hopefully if they like the deal they'll 
put pressure on the board to sit down with us. ... We'd like to 
turn this into a friendly merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource is offering to buy Columbia Energy for $5.7 billion in  
cash, or $68 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The price represents a 30.7 percent premium over the average  
closing share price for Columbia common stock for the 20 trading 
days ended Friday, NiSource said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, shares of Columbia Energy closed up $7.43 3/4 to $63.18 3/4  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of NiSource were down 62 1/2 
cents, to $27.56 1/4, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would double the size of NiSource, making it one of the  
largest natural gas companies in the country with pipelines 
connecting the Texas coast of the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to Richard, Neale said NiSource first made an  
offer for Columbia Energy on April 1. Columbia Energy canceled 
meetings to discuss that offer, and then launched an unsuccessful 
bid of its own to acquire CNG, a natural gas supplier and pipeline 
owner with holdings from Ohio to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, CNG spurned Columbia Energy's offer and accepted a  
takeover bid from Dominion Resources Inc. After that, NiSource 
tried to reopen talks with Columbia Energy, but Columbia Energy 
refused, Neale said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbia Energy proposal is the latest in what has been a  
busy year for NiSource. In February, the company completed the 
acquisition of Massachusetts-based Bay State Gas Co., which 
provides natural gas service to more than 300,000 customers in 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. In April, company 
shareholders voted to rename the corporation from Nipsco Industries 
Inc. to NiSource. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., is a holding company with  
a market capitalization of approximately $3.6 billion whose primary 
business is the distribution of electricity, natural gas and water 
in the Midwest and northeast. The company also markets utility 
services along a corridor stretching from Texas to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon, Va.-based Columbia Energy is a major energy services  
company with roles in natural gas exploration and production, 
transmission, distribution and storage. Its 1998 revenues were 
nearly $6.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> NYC Ballet Gets Two New Jazz Ballets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City Ballet dancers came out swinging --  
as though they'd been born to jitterbug instead of pirouette. 
</P>
<P>
	It was jazz night, one of four the company is dancing with the  
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra playing. The most fun came at the end 
of the evening Saturday. ``Duke!'' presented three choreographers' 
takes on music composed by Duke Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadway choreographer Susan Stroman got the big finish with a  
funny conceit danced to ``It Don't Mean a Thing if it Ain't Got 
That Swing.'' Maria Kowroski in blue tutu sits on a bench with six 
young women in slinky red dresses. The women in red dance, jivey 
and jazzy, with men wearing suits, red shirts and ties. Kowroski 
scoots up close, pats her foot, tries to figure out the steps. 
She's none too gently pushed aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she encounters a member of the on-stage band who plays the  
triangle. He turns out to be Robert La Fosse, in reality a company 
dancer. She whips off the tutu, revealing a red dress, and the two 
of them, as their grandparents might have said, really cut a rug. 
</P>
<P>
	La Fosse choreographed the first part of ``Duke!'' --''Rockin' in  
Rhythm'' -- letting the men pretend to be casual as they move to the 
rhythm and worship dancer Helene Alexopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	Garth Fagan choreographed the second part to a section of  
Ellington's ``Far East Suite.'' His movements were limited in 
number and didn't really flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke!'' was the last of three ballets the dancers performed.  
</P>
<P>
	The second, ``Them Twos,'' also was new. The music was composed  
by Wynton Marsalis, his first for orchestra. Peter Martins 
choreographed. Janie Taylor and Sebastien Marcovici danced the 
``First Love'' section, a light-hearted idyll in which she is 
frisky and coy and he shows off. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Almost,'' dancer Nilas Martins' job was to be an attentive  
partner to Miranda Weese. When he jumped, it was around her and 
toward her. She finally slipped away from him. In ``Horror,'' Maria 
Kowroski was dramatic, and frightening, as a fatal attraction for 
Charles Askegard. And in a section titled ``Sex,'' Yvonne Borree 
and Nikolaj Hubbe, dressed for a harem scene, did much back-to-back 
arm twining and back bending. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last section, ``Loss,'' Jock Soto was sad and solitary,  
even when Darci Kistler, almost floating to indicate she's a 
memory, was at his side. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening at the New York State Theater began with the joyful,  
jumping ``Jazz,'' for which Marsalis wrote the music and Martins 
choreographed in 1993. The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra played 
from the pit. Jock Soto, in particular, seemed to be having the 
time of his dancing life. 
</P>
<P>
	Guest conductors were Robert Sadin and David Berger.

<HEADLINE> Big Names Supporting Shoeless Joe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DYERSVILLE, Iowa (AP) -- Some big hitters will take to the Field  
of Dreams in a call for Shoeless Joe Jackson's reinstatement to 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famers Ted Williams, Bob Feller and Yogi Berra, along  
with former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, will 
participate in a July tournament at the Field of Dreams in 
northeast Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 80 years ago this October that Jackson and seven of his  
Chicago White Sox teammates were accused of conspiring to throw the 
1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was banned from baseball in 1920, but he was acquitted  
of criminal charges. He died in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	He still has the third-highest career batting average -- .356 in  
13 seasons -- but is ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as he 
is banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams plans on meeting Friday with commissioner Bud Selig to  
discuss Jackson. He will then join Iowa native Feller, Berra and 
Lasorda at the Shoeless Joe Jackson National Baseball Tournament to 
rally for Jackson's reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins July 1 at the Field of Dreams.  
</P>
<P>
	The field is the site of the 1989 movie of the same name in  
which Kevin Costner's character turns his cornfield into a baseball 
field and meets Jackson's ghost, played by Ray Liotta.

<HEADLINE> Former NBA Player Admits Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Former NBA player Dontonio Wingfield pleaded  
guilty today to assaulting two suburban Cincinnati police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield, the former University of Cincinnati forward who went  
on to play for the Seattle SuperSonics and Portland Trail Blazers, 
could be sentenced to as many as 18 months behind bars and fined 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be sentenced Sept. 2 in Hamilton County Common Pleas  
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield, 24, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and assault  
on two officers. He was originally charged with felonious assault 
on a police officer -- with a possible punishment of up to 10 years 
and a $20,000 fine -- but reached the plea agreement with 
prosecutors to the lesser offense. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, the 6-foot-8 Wingfield was visiting the  
apartment of girlfriend Christina Cornett and they became involved 
in a dispute. Police said Wingfield was verbally abusive, resisted 
arrest, and broke a finger and tore tendons of one officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield, from Albany, Ga., played for the University of  
Cincinnati in the 1993-94 season and left after his freshman year 
for the NBA.

<HEADLINE>  Undeterred Blazers Look To Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers' grand  
experiment -- trying to win an NBA title without a consistent scorer 
or a proven leader -- was a surprising success for most of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the San Antonio Spurs revealed the many shortcomings  
of the system, beating the Blazers seven out of eight times this 
season, including four straight in the Western Conference finals. 
Whenever the Spurs put together a run or hit a big shot late in the 
game, the Blazers didn't have anyone who craved the ball or the 
pressure of carrying the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Portland went 35-15 in the regular season, winning their  
first Pacific Division title since 1992. They also erased the 
stigma of losing six straight years in the first round of the 
playoffs by going deeper than almost anyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The way they ended the season didn't discourage the Blazers from  
predicting big things for 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the way we played this year,'' said forward Brian  
Grant, whose dreadlocked hair and rebounding fury came to symbolize 
the team's resurgence. ``I think we need to maybe get a couple guys 
more established as our scorers, but I kind of like the way we did 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a better feel for what it takes the next time  
around,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``Very few teams ever 
get there without having to pay the price of a learning experience. 
This is a start for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether their 4-0 sweep to the Spurs, in which they  
averaged just 76 points a game, tarnished their accomplishments, 
guard Isaiah Rider snapped, ``No. We went to the third round and 
had a great season. We'll be back stronger next season. ``Nobody 
expected us to get above seventh place (in the West) this year. The 
joke is on you guys and the others that doubted us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good team the way it is -- we almost went to the  
(NBA) finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite. Despite having so many offensive threats -- including  
Rider, Jim Jackson, Damon Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace, Walt 
Williams and Arvydas Sabonis -- showed a painful inability to score 
at times. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Dunleavy's much-publicized methods for parceling  
out minutes. Jackson, a 25-point early in his career with Dallas, 
averaged just 8.4 points this season as Rider's backup. Wallace, 
one of the game's most exciting young players, shared playing time 
at small forward with Williams and Stacey Augmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire had the most trouble adjusting to his new role. The  
more the Blazers won, the more Dunleavy relied on backup point 
guard Greg Anthony late in games. The veteran, who signed a 
two-year, $2.1 million contract as a free agent before the season, 
was simply a better defender, and Stoudamire, the hometown hero, 
stewed about it. 
</P>
<P>
	After he sat out the fourth quarter in a late-season loss at  
Utah, Stoudamire destroyed the Blazers' veneer of harmony by 
allowing his agent, Aaron Goodwin, to blast Dunleavy publicly. 
Then, after the Blazers got down 2-0 to the Spurs, Stoudamire 
picked the worst possible time to air his frustrations about not 
playing more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret it,'' said Stoudamire. ``Unfortunately, what I said  
took the focus away from the team and put it on me. It made me look 
selfish, and I am not. What I've learned is that sometimes you've 
got to bite the tongue. I could have waited and said it after the 
season was over. I've taken some hits from it, but I'm still 
standing. I learned from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I can win (the fans) back,'' added Stoudamire, who was  
booed by many at the Rose Garden crowd Sunday. ``I hope they can 
accept me for what I am. And that I am learning from my mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many fans still would like to see Stoudamire run out of  
town, a trade seems unlikely. But there could be other changes. 
Backup forward Jermaine O'Neal is the only free agent, but Rider 
has an opt-out clause in his contract. But president and general 
manager Bob Whitsitt said Monday he doesn't have any plans to 
shuffle the roster -- at least yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we like our team? Absolutely,'' Whitsitt said, but later  
added: ``I'm not telling you what we'll do, because I don't know 
what we will do.''

<HEADLINE> Discovery's Flight Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery and its  
astronauts are back from the international space station after 
accomplishing everything they set out to do. 
</P>
<P>
	All the headaches are now back on Earth.  
</P>
<P>
	Hanging over the successful supply mission is uncertainty about  
both the status of the next shuttle flight and scheduled follow-up 
trips to the new space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears were momentarily was set aside as Discovery emerged  
like a ghost ship from the predawn Sunday sky and touched down on 
Kennedy Space Center's floodlighted runway. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the 11th time that a space shuttle landed in  
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome home, Discovery, from the first docking mission to the  
international space station,'' radioed Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven astronauts skipped the traditional shuttle walkaround  
and picture taking, and instead asked to be driven straight to crew 
quarters. They left managers waiting on the landing strip, fueling 
speculation that one or more of the crew might be nauseated, as 
sometimes happens to returning astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, commander Kent Rominger told reporters no one was  
sick, although it took ``a while to get our Earth legs back.'' 
Because everything seemed to take longer than usual at touchdown, 
and because he and his crewmates had plans for later in the day, 
they decided ``to head on back and get on with our day off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so nice at wheels stop for at least a day just to,  
ahhhhhh, relax and go see family and friends ... basically get away 
from it all for a day,'' Rominger said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We had a fantastic adventure.''  
</P>
<P>
	During their 10 days in orbit, the astronauts unloaded 2 tons of  
supplies at the space station for future inhabitants, replaced bad 
electronic boxes and installed mufflers over noisy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	On their way home, they dropped off a glittering, mirrored  
satellite called Starshine that schoolchildren will track until it 
falls from orbit at the beginning of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts aren't due back at the space station until December,  
when they're supposed to haul up more supplies aboard Atlantis. But 
that mission cannot take place -- and neither can any other missions 
to the 6-month-old space station -- until the Russians launch a 
crucial service module that will double as crew quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The component is scheduled to fly in November, 1 1/2 years behind  
schedule, provided all the testing between now and then goes well. 
The Russian Space Agency's money problems and delays have long 
bothered NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always hope for the best, plan for the worst,'' NASA  
Administrator Daniel Goldin said following Discovery's return. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's more immediate concern involves Columbia and the $1.5  
billion observatory Chandra, also running a year late because of a 
multitude of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The upper-stage motor on Chandra is similar to one that  
malfunctioned aboard a military satellite in April, leaving the 
spacecraft in a uselessly low orbit. An Air Force investigation 
into the failure continues. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, NASA is proceeding toward a July 22 launch of Columbia,  
the only shuttle big enough to hold the 45-foot X-ray telescope. 
Technicians moved Columbia to the launch pad today. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldin stressed, however, that he won't give the final go-ahead  
until ``the NASA team walks into my office and says they understand 
exactly what went wrong, they understand how it was fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has until mid-August to send Columbia on the  
telescope-delivery mission without impacting other missions, said 
shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that NASA's oldest shuttle is due for its  
regularly scheduled tune-up and, unless it flies soon, it will have 
to undergo eight to nine months of maintenance before launching 
Chandra. That would bump the mission -- the first to be commanded by 
a woman -- into late 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it takes a year, it will take a year,'' Goldin said. ``Time  
is not an issue.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced moderately today as  
investors were encouraged by the strength on Wall Street last week, 
while the dollar sank against the yen on speculation about a 
rumored call for large-scale tax cuts in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 175.14  
points, or 1.07 percent, ending the afternoon session at 16,475.89. 
On Friday, the Nikkei closed up 73.25 points, or 0.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.84 yen late afternoon, down 0.78 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and below its New York level of 122.22 yen 
late Friday. The currency ranged from 120.55 yen to 122.45 yen 
today in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices were buoyed initially by  
Friday's 136.15-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average, 
which closed at 10,799.84. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors were relieved by New York's rally,'' said Hidenori  
Karaki, a manager at Ryoko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the rise in Tokyo was mainly futures-led, although  
individual shares in the high-technology and pharmaceutical sectors 
also put on big gains mirroring the movement of their counterparts 
in New York Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues beat retreating issues 851 to 319, while 130  
issues were unchanged. Volume on the first section was estimated at 
379.03 million shares, up slightly from 369.03 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the stock market was news that the government  
decided on Friday to close Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co., a 
troubled medium-sized Japanese insurance company. The company's 
liabilities were found to have exceeded its assets by $1.64 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei's finish, however, ended up well below its midday  
level of 16,576.51 points because of profit-taking in the 
afternoon, said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general manager at Daiwa 
Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 12.12 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,328.65. 
The TOPIX closed down 1.16 points, or 0.09 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen on  
speculation that the head of Japan's Liberal Party, Ichiro Ozawa, 
called for large-scale, permanent tax cuts to stimulate the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the comments moved the markets even though Ozawa  
has repeatedly made similar remarks and the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party has not heeded the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.47 yen, down  
from 125.29 late Friday in Tokyo, on news that negotiations between 
NATO and Yugoslavia had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond stood at  
1.640 percent late Tuesday, up from Friday's finish of 1.635 
percent, pushing down its price to 97.93 yen from 97.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Judge Nixes Manslaughter Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A grocery clerk accused of beating a thief  
to death with a tree branch was cleared of involuntary manslaughter 
Monday by a judge who suggested that prosecutors should have 
brought more serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed with the defense that prosecutors had not  
proved that Daniel Rodbourn was guilty of involuntary manslaughter. 
The judge said voluntary manslaughter would have been more 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The motion was that we undercharged his client, and I've never  
seen that,'' prosecutor Craig Croom said. ``That was a shock to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodbourn attacked Jason Cort in 1998 after Cort snatched $130  
from a Food Lion cash register and ran from the store. Rodbourn, a 
North Carolina State University student, chased Cort into a parking 
lot and hit him repeatedly with a branch. Cort later lapsed into a 
coma and died. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge E. Lynn Johnson said that for Rodbourn to be found guilty  
of involuntary manslaughter, prosecutors had to show that he 
unintentionally acted in a way that was not considered ``naturally 
dangerous to human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that the holding of a 4-foot tree limb in  
the fashion of a baseball bat, and then swinging it, is an 
intentional act,'' the judge said. ``To hit another human being in 
the head multiple times using a baseball swing as demonstrated in 
this case was naturally dangerous to human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors cannot charge Rodbourn again, although the victim's  
family could sue him for wrongful death. The family would have to 
prove Cort's death resulted from a blow to the head, delivered by 
Rodbourn's branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Cort was a skinny, learning-disabled 23-year-old man who came  
from a well-to-do family but struggled with depression, a learning 
disability, alcohol and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodbourn claimed he acted in self-defense because Cort was drunk  
and on cocaine. Defense attorney Rick Gammon also suggested in his 
opening statement that the fatal blow to Cort might have come when 
he hit his head in the parking lot as he broke free from two 
customers who were trying to hold him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodbourn, crying after hearing the judge's decision, said he was  
relieved but called the situation an ``incredible tragedy.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Police Say Nude `Macbeth' Broke Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The owner of an adult nightclub and three  
dancers who challenged an anti-nudity ordinance by performing 
``Macbeth'' in the buff were charged Monday with violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Club Juana owner Michael Pinter and dancers Margaret Morgan,  
Sara Jo Uffelman and Christy McKee were charged with a misdemeanor 
and ordered to appear in court next month. The maximum sentence is 
60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 28 performance, which included the opening witches scene  
from ``Macbeth,'' and part of a play by the Marquis de Sade, was 
intended to challenge Seminole County's anti-nudity ordinance, 
which requires dancers to wear at least a G-string and pasties. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, passed in November, exempts ``bona fide performances''  
-- which, according to county officials, refers to legitimate 
theater. The club's attorney said the performance that included 
``Macbeth'' was meant to show the hypocrisy of the ``bona fide'' 
restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	However, which performances are considered bona fide won't be  
addressed in this case because the defendants were charged under a 
separate anti-nudity ordinance in Casselberry, the Orlando suburb 
were Club Juana is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Casselberry's ordinance prohibits nudity in establishments where  
alcohol is served. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinter said he was happy he was getting his day in court but  
would have preferred to been charged under the Seminole County 
ordinance, which has been challenged in four separate lawsuits by 
dancers and club owners. The cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only way we can get into court,'' Pinter said.  
``They're trying to legislate me out of business.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Urges Trade With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boeing Co. chairman Phil Condit on Monday  
defended China's bid to enter the World Trade Organization, saying 
it would force Beijing to play by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit also told reporters the United States should not  
unilaterally restrict the sale of technology to China. Tighter 
controls should be formulated in concert with European allies 
through an organization such as NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about making a gift to China,'' Condit said  
following a speech to about 200 business representatives attending 
a conference on trade with Southeast Asia. ``The exchange of 
sensitive information is always a subject that will take a lot of 
care. I put it to the U.S., we have to be careful with our 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress began considering tighter controls on trade with China  
following the release two weeks ago of a House report detailing 20 
years of Chinese espionage against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Major portions of the report dealt with the theft of nuclear  
weapons technology from top-secret labs. But the report also 
suggested that China has acquired significant amounts of aerospace 
and manufacturing technology through commercial trade with U.S. 
companies. U.S. trade negotiators are attempting to craft a deal 
with China that would open the world's most populous nation to U.S. 
companies and allow China to enter the WTO. The Geneva, 
Switzerland-based group makes and enforces rules for international 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	If China enters the WTO it will be forced to open its markets  
and abide by the same rules that govern trade among most nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tighter sanctions on the sale of technology to China are likely  
to backfire because much of the technology that U.S. companies sell 
is available in Europe and other parts of the world, those who 
support China's bid have said. If the United States moves by itself 
on the issue it will simply block U.S. companies from doing 
business, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to approach that collectively through an organization  
like NATO,'' Condit said. ``We need to be sure we don't list a lot 
of things that really don't need to be listed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, U.S. ambassadors to Thailand and Vietnam  
also raised concerns about the future impact of the House report on 
the sale of technology abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of tighter sanctions ``threatens to impair our  
commercial interests all around the world,'' said Richard 
Hecklinger, the U.S. ambassador to Thailand. ``Even though all of 
us have not seen lost contracts, we can see it happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Peterson, ambassador to Vietnam, said Congress should be  
sure allegations in the House report are accurate before it acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the U.S. Congress hasn't become the foremost  
counter-espionage group in the United States,'' Peterson said. 
``America sells technology. That's what we're all about, we just 
can't close the door on that because that's our major strength in 
the global market.''

<HEADLINE> Romance Writer Killed in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Viewed through the prism of her murder  
Saturday night, the purple prose still hovering on Nancy 
Richards-Akers' Web site Monday acquired morbid new meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more to a romance writer's life than devastatingly  
sexy, handsome Irish warriors, more than poetry and poets, more 
than romance...,'' the 45-year-old novelist wrote about herself. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also trouble, the kind that family and friends don't  
always know much about until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 10:30 p.m. Saturday, police found Richards-Akers  
slumped in her Jeep, dying from gunshot wounds to the head. The 
Jeep was near the home she once shared with her husband in one of 
Washington's fanciest neighborhoods, said Metropolitan Police Sgt. 
Joe Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
	She had told friends in her literary circle that she was going  
through a difficult divorce from attorney Jeremy Akers, said two 
sources in the romance novel industry who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say that a man they believe to be Akers, 57, shot himself  
in the head two hours after her murder as he saw officers approach 
him at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall. Gentile 
said police located the man after Akers, a former Marine, called a 
friend from a phone near the memorial; police later traced the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a neighbor took the couple's children from the  
Georgetown-area house after the shooting. A grief counselor was 
summoned Monday to Our Lady of Victory Elementary School, where the 
Akers children attended the fourth grade and fifth grade classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent among a cybercircle of novelists and their fans who  
thrive on daydreams, sweetness and love, Richards-Akers wrote 16 
historical romance novels, including ``Devil's Wager'' and ``Miss 
Wickham's Betrothal.'' Her latest was ``So Wild a Kiss.'' Her 1997 
book, ``Wild Irish Skies,'' was named one of the top 10 romance 
novels of that year by The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards-Akers was working on a new book, tentatively titled,  
``Lady of the Tower,'' at the time of her death, according to Joan 
Schulhafer, vice president of Avon Books. It was to be the first of 
a trilogy set in Scotland during medieval times and is still 
scheduled to be released next year, Schulhafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	On her Web site, Richards-Akers gushed about her family, her  
life and her love of ``Irish warriors, blanket bogs and miracles.'' 
Her biography describes first jobs in Washington as a speech writer 
with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and political 
consultant Bob Squier. 
</P>
<P>
	Politics, Richards-Akers said, is ``a tragic waste for a chronic  
daydreamer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``little girl with curly hair and an overactive  
imagination'' who had spun fantasies about love and wanted to be an 
actress felt more at home as a grown-up writing about love and 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	Her death jarred the close-knit cyberworld of romance novelists.  
</P>
<P>
	The Avon Ladies chat room, which crackles with talk of romance  
and writing, was abruptly consumed by the news shortly after it 
trickled onto the Internet on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before 8:31 p.m., the messages shifted jarringly from one  
author boasting about an interview she had given over tea and 
chocolate to another chat room participant who posted an early 
newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please tell me this is not true!'' the participant,  
``Shocked,'' pleaded in the first message of Richards-Akers' death. 
</P>
<P>
	``God, it is true.... Here's the rest of the article,'' replied  
another participant, named ``Stunned,'' at 10:18 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, the community of writers turned to mourning the  
true-life death of a romantic apparently murdered by her own 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy's death is truly a tragedy, moreso in juxtaposition to  
her life, which I believe she lived to the fullest every single 
day,'' her editor, Lyssa Keusch, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever their marital problems might have been, Nancy didn't  
deserve this. She was entitled to live a rich and happy life. Her 
husband stole that from her in the cruelest of ways,'' said 
best-selling romance novelist Nora Roberts. ``My heart breaks for 
her children. Just breaks.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Becomes Undisputed Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- In boxing, there are more champions than  
there are titles. And that's why Roy Jones is so unique. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones pounded out a unanimous decision that left Reggie Johnson  
battered and bleeding and made Jones the first undisputed world's 
light heavyweight champion in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love championship belts,'' Jones said after adding his third  
one. ``I think there should always be an undisputed champion. That 
is something prestigious and made this fight interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones becomes only the third undisputed light heavyweight  
champion, joining Bob Foster and Michael Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' speed and quickness gave him a huge edge and an easy  
victory Saturday night. He won every round and every judge scored 
it 120-106 in favor of Jones, who added Johnson's IBF title to the 
WBA and WBC crowns he already had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've proven everything I had to prove,'' Jones said. ``After  
awhile, I was just having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who weighed 174 pounds, used a straight right 1:58 into  
the first round to knock down Johnson. The Houston fighter got up 
quickly, but was bleeding from his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third round, Jones countered a right from Johnson with a  
left-right combination that sent him to the canvas. Again Johnson 
got up quickly and the bell ended the round. By that time, blood 
was streaming from Johnson's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was only able to fight back in spurts by the fourth  
round. The rest of the time he was backing away or covering up. 
When he managed to get inside, Jones punished him with jabs and 
uppercuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the 12-round fight Johnson's face was swollen,  
his white trunks streaked with blood. But Johnson (39-6-1) kept 
answering the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy was real quick,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't have time to  
counter his punches. Coming into the fight, I knew I had to give a 
lot and take a lot of punches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones landed 273 punches to just 49 for Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, which included a big contingent from Jones' hometown  
of Pensacola, Fla., called for a knockout. There were some boos 
late in the fight when Jones didn't press his attack. Johnson did 
go down in the 12th after a solid right from Jones, but it was 
ruled a slip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have pressured him and knocked him out, but why would  
I take a chance on him getting a lucky punch and knocking me out?'' 
Jones said. ``That's not very businesslike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones was not completely businesslike.  
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't resist showboating when it became apparent how  
completely he was dominating the fight. At one point, he backed 
Johnson to the ropes, looked at Michael Jordan, who was seated 
ringside, and shouted, ``Watch this!'' before throwing a flurry of 
jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the best player ever in the building and, at the same  
time, we had the best boxer in the building,'' Jones said.

<HEADLINE> IBM-Microsoft Face Court Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The troubled on-again, off-again marriage of  
Microsoft and the IBM Corp., two of the largest companies in the 
computer industry, was laid bare in a courtroom today as a 
government witness testified against Microsoft at its antitrust 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Norris, an IBM manager who negotiated key agreements  
between the companies in 1995 and 1996, described Microsoft's 
alleged efforts to persuade IBM to sacrifice its rival OS/2 
operating system software to favor Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson appeared to be  
following Norris' testimony closely, frequently taking notes, 
asking minor questions for clarification and reading e-mails and 
other evidence on a projection screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris contends that after IBM rejected Microsoft's alleged  
overtures to kill OS/2, Microsoft took an unusually tough stance 
negotiating the wholesale price that IBM paid to put Windows 95 on 
the computers it sold to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said Microsoft demanded that IBM ``make Windows 95 the  
standard operating system of your company'' and to identify Windows 
as the only operating system in IBM advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	As incentive, Microsoft offered to reduce the price IBM would  
pay for Windows, discounts worth $40 million to $48 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not agree to those provisions,'' Norris said.  
</P>
<P>
	Norris said Microsoft executives told him ``on several  
occasions'' that: ``IBM can have Compaq's (Compaq Computer Corp.) 
deal when you stop competing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who kept a journal of his communications with Microsoft,  
is expected to testify this week that Microsoft pressured IBM not 
to include ``objectionable software'' from competitors, such as 
Netscape Communications Corp. or Lotus Development Corp., on its 
line of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prepared handwritten notes as well as computer notes,''  
Norris told Justice Department lawyer Phil Malone, who took over 
questioning for his colleague, David Boies. Malone, from the 
department's San Francisco office, has worked behind the scenes for 
more than a year helping build evidence against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM bought Lotus in the summer of 1995, as IBM was negotiating  
its price for Windows. Lotus' popular SmartSuite package of 
business software applications competes directly with Microsoft's 
lucrative Office bundle. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to rebut claims from Norris by showing  
the judge the final 1994 proposal for its alliance with IBM, which 
doesn't include encouragement for IBM to reduce or stop sales of 
its OS/2 software. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM rejected the offer during a private meeting at a trade show  
in Las Vegas in November 1994 with top Microsoft executives, 
including Bill Gates. Instead, IBM told Microsoft it planned to 
sell computers with both Windows and OS/2, which ultimately proved 
a commercial failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ridiculous,'' said Mark Baber, the former Microsoft  
executive who negotiated with IBM during the period. ``In no way, 
shape or form did Microsoft -- with IBM or any other (computer 
maker) I was working with -- talk about exclusivity or the 
elimination of competitive products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Baber acknowledged that an earlier draft of the proposal  
required IBM to promote Microsoft's products primarily on its 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the terminology was `predominantly promote Microsoft  
products.' It wasn't specific to Windows 95,'' Baber said. ``It was 
dropped because IBM said they had chosen a different strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris also told government lawyers that Microsoft pressured IBM  
during 1996 and 1997 not to include rivals' software on its 
computers, and discussed whether it was appropriate for IBM to 
participate in the debut of the latest version of Microsoft's 
Internet software in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just absolutely false,'' Baber said. ``We had excellent  
relationships with other computer makers that offered competitive 
products,'' Baber said.

<HEADLINE> IBM-Microsoft Relations Outlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An IBM Corp. manager accused Microsoft on  
Monday of offering discounts worth tens of millions of dollars to 
IBM to sacrifice its rival computer operating system and to stop 
distributing software from key competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Norris, a mid-level IBM executive, said Microsoft Corp.  
Chairman Bill Gates was so angry about IBM's defiance that he 
overheard the billionaire screaming during a private phone call in 
July 1995 to another IBM executive in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty loud,'' Norris said, eliciting laughter from a  
crowded courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who negotiated key agreements in 1995 and 1996,  
testified that IBM saw the total fees it pays to Microsoft rise 
from $40 million in 1996 to $440 million last year because it 
rejected Microsoft's alleged overtures not to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the  
verdict in the antitrust trial later this year, frequently took 
notes, asked questions for clarification and studied e-mails and 
other documents on a large projection screen in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris is a crucial witness because none of the nation's major  
computer makers had previously been willing to testify in court in 
support of government allegations that Microsoft uses the prices 
for its dominant Windows operating system to punish enemies and 
reward allies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was crystal clear there was no viable commercial  
alternative,'' said Norris, who kept a journal of his 
communications with Microsoft executives. ``We needed a 
relationship with Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said Microsoft proposed an alliance with IBM in 1994,  
years after a bitter feud had ended the companies' 1980s 
partnership in which they worked together on programming languages 
and helped develop the earliest versions of each other's operating 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But Norris accused Microsoft of setting as a condition for the  
1994 alliance the sacrifice of IBM's OS/2 operating system, which 
competed with Windows until the popularity of OS/2 waned later in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that after IBM rejected the proposal for an alliance in  
November 1994, Microsoft took an unusually tough stance negotiating 
the wholesale price that IBM paid the following summer to put 
Windows 95 on computers it sold to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM believed some of its competitors, such as Compaq Computer  
Corp., had negotiated lower prices. Norris said that Microsoft 
executive Mark Baber told him on several occasions: ``IBM can have 
Compaq's deal when you stop competing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baber, in a telephone interview, called Norris' claims  
``ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In no way, shape or form did Microsoft -- with IBM or any other  
(computer maker) I was working with -- talk about exclusivity or the 
elimination of competitive products,'' Baber said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Norris produced Microsoft's 1995 contract offering discounts  
of $1 to $3 per copy of Windows, for example, if IBM were willing 
to ``adopt Windows 95 as the standard operating system for IBM'' 
and to mention Windows as the only operating system in IBM 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not agree to those provisions,'' Norris said, adding  
that those inducements were worth $40 million to $48 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said Microsoft also was angry about its 1995 purchase of  
Lotus Development Corp., whose popular SmartSuite business software 
competes directly with the lucrative Microsoft Office applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The government showed a memorandum from IBM's Richard Thoman  
after an August 1995 meeting with Microsoft's Joachim Kempin, who 
urged IBM not to distribute the Lotus programs on its computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman wrote that Kempin suggested IBM ``not bundle Lotus  
SmartSuite on our systems for a minimum of six months to one 
year.'' Another IBM internal e-mail said Kempin was ``definitely 
worried about SmartSuite being given away and eating into their 
'Office heartland.'''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 109.54 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose for a third straight session Monday  
as corporate mergers and bargain prices lured investors back to a 
market that is again inching toward record heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 109.54 points to close at  
10,909.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index rose 6.77 to 1,334.52, and the Nasdaq composite 
rose 45.87 to 2,524.21 as technology leaders and upstart Internet 
companies had solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading got a boost from the announcement of several mergers,  
particularly a $14.82 billion deal between AlliedSignal and 
Honeywell that creates an aerospace parts-and-electronics 
conglomerate. AlliedSignal rose 4 7/16 to 62 13/16 and Honeywell 
gained 7 to 112 as investors applauded the cost savings expected 
from the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	First Security Corp. rose 5 3/4 to 24 3/8 after agreeing to merge with  
Salt Lake City rival Zions Bancorp in a deal worth $5.9 billion. 
Zions fell 6 25/32 to 58 19/32. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Dow stocks benefited from positive recommendations  
from Wall Street analysts. American Express rose 2 3/4 to 128 after 
Prudential Securities raised its rating on the stock, citing rising 
credit card use in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which saw its price slump last month, rose 4 1/2 to 120 1/2 after  
a J.P. Morgan analyst said IBM's stock could reach 150 within 12 
months. The analyst said strong sales of IBM's electronic business 
software are helping its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad base of good corporate news heartened Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those sessions where all is right with the  
world,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	With Monday's gains, the Dow is less than 200 points, or about  
1.8 percent, short of its May 13 record level of 11,107.19. The 
index slid to a close of 10,466.93 on May 27 before beginning its 
ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, which had dipped as much as 10 percent below its  
April 26 record of 2,652.05, is now just 4.8 percent short of that 
mark. The technology-heavy index was as low as 2,380.90 on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gradual rally has not lifted all stocks, and analysts  
still fret over the lack of a consistent leading sector. On Monday, 
the drug stocks couldn't keep up with the broader market. Eli Lilly 
fell 3 3/8 to 71 7/8, and Pfizer lost 4 1/8 to 111. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL, the parent of United Air Lines, was mostly lower before  
regaining ground late in the day. The airline warned analysts late 
Friday that its second-quarter earnings will fall below well 
estimates. UAL ended up 9/16 at 66 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume remained light as traders already began looking ahead to  
Friday, when the government's producer price index is expected to 
offer signals about inflation and perhaps an indication of whether

<HEADLINE> Rodman Returns -- To Wrestling Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Dennis Rodman has found a summer job -- as a  
wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has made a few cameo appearances inside the ring  
over the past couple years, signed with World Championship 
Wrestling today to make at least five appearances this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman will make his 1999 debut on ``WCW Monday Nitro Live'' on  
TNT on July 5 and his deal with culminate with ``Road Wild,'' an 
annual pay-per-view event on August 14 in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-NBA star was released by the Los Angeles Lakers in April  
because he was a distraction to the team. He has maintained a 
relatively low profile since then, except for two lawsuits being 
filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman sued Rodman for assaulting her earlier this month in Las  
Vegas and a casino security guard sued him last month after 
accusing him of grabbing her breast while she was working at the 
Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's first hit the wrestling scene in 1997, but his  
best-known match came last year at ``Bash at the Beach'' when he 
and Hulk Hogan won a tag-team bout to fellow-NBA player Karl Malone 
and Diamond Dallas Page. 
</P>
<P>
	The WCW also announced it signed rapper Master P, who recently  
established No Limit Sports, a professional sports agent business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signings of Dennis Rodman and Master P clearly demonstrate  
the extensive worldwide appeal, audience, and reach of World 
Championship Wrestling,'' WCW president Eric Bischoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Master P signed a one-year deal with WCW to appear in an  
undetermined number of events.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Would Scrap GOP Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker wants to replace  
California's winner-take-all GOP presidential primary with a system 
that could cause problems for the front-runner, Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Ray Haynes' plan would discontinue the practice of  
giving the winner of the GOP primary all of the nation's biggest 
bloc of Republican National Convention delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, candidates would fight for 156 of California's  
delegates by congressional district. A victory in one district in 
the March 7 primary would be worth three delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Another dozen to two dozen at-large delegates would go to  
candidates based on their proportion of the statewide vote, 
although Haynes said he is willing to give all those delegates to 
the overall winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes, one of the Legislature's most conservative members, said  
his proposal isn't designed to derail the more moderate Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes, of Temecula, said Monday that he supports Bush and  
believes his plan would help him in the long run by forcing him to 
organize in California earlier and more extensively than he would 
with a winner-take-all primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are forced to do the work for the primary you don't  
have to work as hard the September before the general election,'' 
Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some past GOP candidates have tried to set up a California  
organization after getting the presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not work,'' Haynes said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Parsky, Bush's California chairman, said the Texas  
governor's campaign is willing to ``play by whatever rules are 
established by the California party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added: ``It would certainly be better to give people  
advance warning about what the rules are going to be rather than 
change them after a number of candidates have announced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would give candidates with limited budgets a chance to  
pick up California delegates by focusing on one or two areas, said 
Brian Kennedy, national political director for GOP candidate Lamar 
Alexander, a former Tennessee governor who lags in presidential 
preference polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes as California anticipates playing a bigger  
role in presidential nominations after moving its primary from June 
to March. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes' proposal gets its first test Wednesday when the state  
party's rules committee meets in Burbank. If approved, it will be 
considered June 19 by the 100-member executive committee in 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes predicts he has enough votes in the 11-member rules  
committee and is close to having enough to win executive committee 
backing.

<HEADLINE> Dallas' Cup Winners Seek 2nd Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars can be divided into two groups:  
those who've won the Stanley Cup and those who haven't. It's hard 
to tell which is more excited about being in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that an NHL championship is about the only accolade  
missing from the career resumes of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Ed 
Belfour, it is tempting to say the have-nots are the most 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Then listen to Craig Ludwig, a 38-year-old defenseman who is one  
of eight Cup winners who will be seeking another championship 
beginning Tuesday night against the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of us who know what it's like at the end of the  
rainbow,'' said Ludwig, who won with Montreal in 1986. ``We want 
that back. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a few of us, we know we don't have many kicks of the can  
left. To us, this is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Carbonneau falls into that group. A two-time Cup winner in  
Montreal, the 39-year-old forward can't help but smile as he 
recalls the thrill of receiving hockey's holy grail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the ultimate, the best feeling in the world,'' Carbonneau  
said. ``It's also the hardest feeling to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once you're there, there are no other places you'd rather  
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are driven by the same goal, but the stories shared  
in their locker room are secondhand. Only six Buffalo players have 
been to the finals, and between them they've won a total of one 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a child I didn't even know what a Stanley Cup was, but it  
is my focus right now,'' said goaltender Dominik Hasek, who led the 
Czech Republic to the 1996 Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas and Buffalo franchises are 0-3 in finals. The Sabres  
lost in 1975, while the Minnesota North Stars fell in 1991 and 
1981. This is the Stars' sixth season in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier equates Dallas' experience  
with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel for them that the time is now,'' Regier said. ``They  
have some older players that don't have a lot of years left, and 
they have to seize the opportunity. But our players feel the same 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the top-seeded team in the West, come into the finals  
on a roll, having beaten second-seeded Colorado twice while facing 
elimination. Some viewed that series as the true finals, noting the 
Western Conference champion has won the last three Cups, each with 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano upset several Buffalo players by saying Dallas ``is  
anticipating a bit of a letdown in the finals'' because the Sabres 
are the East's seventh-seeded team. He clarified his stance Sunday 
and praised Buffalo for ``deserving to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody else was saying that there was going to be a  
letdown; I didn't think there would be,'' he said. ``I think that's 
a lot of the hockey geniuses around the NHL predicting that, 
considering Colorado and our series was a pretty good series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, however, are still treating Modano's initial  
comments as bulletin-board material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a team that's really on a mission is going to  
have one of their leaders saying that the team's going to have a 
letdown after the conference final,'' Buffalo center Michael Peca 
said. ``If a team's on a mission, those kind of statements aren't 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're already setting up excuses, saying that the Western  
Conference was their Stanley Cup. But he may say things that he 
doesn't realize he's saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres were underdogs against Ottawa, Boston and Toronto,  
and won each series, so they don't mind the same label despite a 
playoffs-best 12-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's saying that they're going to run away with it.  
We're fine with that,'' Buffalo defenseman Jason Woolley said. 
``We're used to that. Nobody expected us to get this far, that's 
for sure.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Didn't Need Ball at the End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reggie Miller didn't get his 25 shots. A nice  
running jumper and a fist pump were the extent of his highlights. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be the scariest thing that emerged from the Indiana  
Pacers' 90-78 victory over the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the 
Eastern Conference finals. The Pacers might not need Miller to 
carry them, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you, I'm starting to feel better the longer this  
series goes,'' said Miller, who followed his scoreless fourth 
quarter in Game 3 with a mere 12 points and 3-for-10 shooting 
Monday night as Indiana tied the series 2-2. ``I keep telling the 
guys, it's almost like an overflowing dam. It's getting to the top 
and it's getting ready to burst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, urged to shoot more by Indiana coach Larry Bird after  
Game 3, wasn't a factor in this game at his favorite arena, either. 
By the time he turned a driving shot into a three-point play -- 
pumping his fist right in front of the Knicks' sideline -- the 
Pacers already had a double-digit lead with 96 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``There at the end of the game, we kept telling Reggie to get  
the ball, get some shots, get some good looks at the basket,'' Bird 
said. ``He played a good defensive game. He's going to break 
loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when? And are the Pacers too balanced, too tested, too  
determined for it to matter? 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of guys who have been through these situations  
before,'' said Jalen Rose, one of those guys, who led the Pacers 
with 19 points. ``We're not going to panic, regardless of the 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a Knicks-killer for the better part of a decade, picked  
up two fouls on successive plays in the span of a second early in 
the first quarter. He was 0-for-3 in the first half and didn't make 
his first basket until hitting a 3-pointer 3:57 into the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a far cry from his scintillating 38-point performance in  
Game 4 of the conference semifinals last year -- including a 
3-pointer in front of Spike Lee that forced overtime with 5.7 left. 
The Pacers won 118-107 and won the series in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	With Miller again not at his best in this game, the Pacers  
showed the extent of their determination to avenge all the 
postseason runs that have fallen short this decade. The concurrent 
themes of payback and reconciliation have weighed heavily on their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning a championship is going to mean a lot to everybody,  
not just Larry,'' Miller said. ``He's toasted before. No one on our 
team, besides (assistant coach) Rick Carlisle, has toasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After losing to Michael Jordan's Bulls in seven games in the  
Eastern Conference finals last year, they dedicated themselves to 
finishing their mission -- practicing during the lockout, never 
forgetting that the anguish they've inflicted on the Knicks in the 
playoffs will mean nothing if they don't cap it with a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	All along, it seemed only natural that Miller would carry them  
there. And yet he was 0-for-5 in the final four minutes of the 
first three games of this series. On the last possession of the 
Pacers' two losses, Miller didn't touch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Superstars are supposed to get the basketball,'' said Bird, a  
man who understood this concept as well as anyone. ``Reggie didn't 
do that. A lot of great players do that, and he didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this game, he didn't have to.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 109.54 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose for a third straight session Monday  
as corporate mergers and bargain prices lured investors back to a 
market that is again inching toward record heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 109.54 points to close at  
10,909.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index rose 6.77 to 1,334.52, and the Nasdaq composite 
rose 45.87 to 2,524.21 as technology leaders and upstart Internet 
companies had solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading got a boost from the announcement of several mergers,  
particularly a $14.82 billion deal between AlliedSignal and 
Honeywell that creates an aerospace parts-and-electronics 
conglomerate. AlliedSignal rose 4 7/16 to 62 13/16 and Honeywell 
gained 7 to 112 as investors applauded the cost savings expected 
from the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	First Security Corp. rose 5 3/4 to 24 3/8 after agreeing to merge with  
Salt Lake City rival Zions Bancorp in a deal worth $5.9 billion. 
Zions fell 6 25/32 to 58 19/32. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Dow stocks benefited from positive recommendations  
from Wall Street analysts. American Express rose 2 3/4 to 128 after 
Prudential Securities raised its rating on the stock, citing rising 
credit card use in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which saw its price slump last month, rose 4 1/2 to 120 1/2 after  
a J.P. Morgan analyst said IBM's stock could reach 150 within 12 
months. The analyst said strong sales of IBM's electronic business 
software are helping its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad base of good corporate news heartened Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those sessions where all is right with the  
world,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	With Monday's gains, the Dow is less than 200 points, or about  
1.8 percent, short of its May 13 record level of 11,107.19. The 
index slid to a close of 10,466.93 on May 27 before beginning its 
ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, which had dipped as much as 10 percent below its  
April 26 record of 2,652.05, is now just 4.8 percent short of that 
mark. The technology-heavy index was as low as 2,380.90 on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gradual rally has not lifted all stocks, and analysts  
still fret over the lack of a consistent leading sector. On Monday, 
the drug stocks couldn't keep up with the broader market. Eli Lilly 
fell 3 3/8 to 71 7/8, and Pfizer lost 4 1/8 to 111. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL, the parent of United Air Lines, was mostly lower before  
regaining ground late in the day. The airline warned analysts late 
Friday that its second-quarter earnings will fall below well 
estimates. UAL ended up 9/16 at 66 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume remained light as traders already began looking ahead to  
Friday, when the government's producer price index is expected to 
offer signals about inflation and perhaps an indication of whether 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to keep the economy 
from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have slipped in the weeks since the Fed warned it might  
raise rates, and volume has been lower than normal as Wall Street 
weighs the impact of a possible increase on corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts say the dip has finally brought buyers back into  
the market.

<HEADLINE> Euro Falls on Kosovo Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro slipped even further against the dollar  
Monday as hopes receded for peace in Kosovo. The dollar fell 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0286, down  
from $1.0362 late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 120.80 
Japanese yen, down from 122.22 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over  
implementing the Kosovo peace agreement reached last week caused 
further jitters over Europe's new currency, which has been 
suffering since its debut in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the euro could fall even further against the dollar  
unless some good news comes soon. Signs of weakness in major 
European economies such as Germany have also darkened the outlook 
for the young currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen, meanwhile, gained some ground against the dollar on  
reports that Japan's government may implement further fiscal 
stimulus measures in hopes of reviving that country's moribund 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5436 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5310, and 1.4685 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4702. The British 
pound fell to $1.6005 from $1.6103. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9015 German 
marks, up from 1.8875; 6.3776 French francs, up from 6.3291; and 
1,883.24 Italian lire, up from 1,869.16.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Baseballers Sue Over Video Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With a click of a mouse, former Braves infielder  
Darrel Chaney can bat against the $105 million arm of Kevin Brown 
or the great Cy Young. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike current players, who are paid through their union  
when computer game designers use their names and images, obscure 
players like Chaney don't get a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, many  
ex-players don't have high-paid lawyers or estates to demand money 
from game designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney, a .217 career hitter who had more strikeouts than hits,  
played 10 seasons for the Reds and Atlanta Braves before retiring 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He's leading a group of former major leaguers suing 10 computer  
game makers to try to get deals similar to those of current players 
-- from 8.5 percent to 9 percent of a game's net sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney, who chairs the major league baseball alumni association  
committee that's pursuing the lawsuit, said the payments would be a 
big help to many retired players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some guys that are old and don't have much of a  
pension,'' said Chaney, who now works for an Atlanta corporate 
relocation service. ``They have no voice for them out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar complaint is pending in Los Angeles against Warner  
Communications' ``Hardball 5'' and the firm that distributed it. 
The suit was filed two years ago by a group that includes Don 
Newcombe and several members of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Former pitcher Phil Niekro, outfielder Mike Lum and catcher  
Johnny Bench are the other plaintiffs in Chaney's suit. The players 
want to designate the lawsuit as class-action, meaning thousands of 
former players could sign on. Lawyers say they have talked to 
nearly 1,700 players interested in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose, baseball's hit leader, batted .370 for the Reds in  
the 1975 World Series, while Chaney was hitless in two at-bats. But 
Chaney says they both are entitled to the same compensation from 
any company that wants to include ``The Big Red Machine'' in a 
computer game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My World Series winning check was the same as Pete Rose's, not  
a penny's difference,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game makers, who oppose class-action status, argue the suit  
amounts to little more than a flimsy cash grab by players trying to 
profit from statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Leyh, a Seattle lawyer for Sierra Online Inc., said the  
company used only the players' names and statistics -- ``historical 
facts that appear in any number of commercially available 
textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting case, but I think it's got more fluff than  
substance,'' Leyh said. ``The plaintiffs have made huge demands, 
which we think are way out of line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra offered to pay 9 percent of sales on its ``Baseball '94:  
Legends and Stadiums,'' which sold poorly. The players rejected 
that offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all these years ... these guys want what's fair,'' said  
Atlanta lawyer Mark Van Spix, who represents Chaney's group.

<P>
	One company, Microleague Multimedia Inc. of Lancaster, Pa.,  
settled for $350,000, plus 11 percent of future sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the game makers say many of the companies can't  
afford the players' demands. Microleague, for example, has filed 
for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Heinke, who represents Warner in the California suit, argues  
that the players' identities are incidental to game sales. He said 
most of the games include specific teams to offer specific famous 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the question comes down to one of what really  
is the value of someone who is an obscure player from a long time 
ago,'' said Paul Anderson, assistant director of the National 
Sports Law Institute at Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
	The players say even long-forgotten benchwarmers are important  
to the accuracy of the game. If a video game manager wants to match 
the 1975 Reds against the 1998 New York Yankees, there may come a 
point when Chaney will come off the bench to pinch hit with the 
game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney is confident the players will prevail even if they don't  
get much money. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least it's a starting point,'' he said. ``To make people  
aware that former baseball players are people, too, and have 
certain rights.''

<HEADLINE>  Study of Mentally Ill Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a White House conference on mental illness,  
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and their wives worked 
today to dispel myths about people who suffer from such illnesses 
as depression and schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans with mental illness should have the same opportunity  
all Americans have to live to the fullest of their God-given 
abilities,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House used the gathering to announce a $7.3 million  
study by the National Institute of Mental Health to explore mental 
illness and a national training program for teachers to identify 
and help troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also notified the 285 health plans used by federal  
employees that they must cover mental illness and substance abuse, 
and he called on other employers to do the same. ``It is high time 
that our health plans treat all Americans equally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the administration was pressing Congress for  
legislation to stop forcing disabled people who are receiving 
Medicare or Medicaid to give up their benefits when they go to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The training program was developed with the help of the National  
Education Association and EchoStar, a satellite company based in 
Littleton, Colo., where two students killed a teacher, 12 
classmates and themselves earlier this year. EchoStar was donating 
1,000 satellite dishes and 40 hours of air time to the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than changing policy, the conference was aimed at  
changing attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton drew parallels between the stigma surrounding mental  
illness and discrimination, saying the mentally disabled ``are 
perhaps just the latest in our enduring challenge as a people to 
continue the work of our founders to widen the circle of 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, recounted for the  
audience at Howard University and listening nationwide how she 
sought treatment to overcome depression after her son was injured 
by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people that are within the sound of my voice, who  
perhaps are suffering with this or any other mental illness, to 
know that there is the right diagnosis and the right treatment and 
the right health care professional out there for you,'' she said. 
``Don't hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, a longtime advocate for the mentally ill, chaired the  
conference, which was linked electronically to 6,000 sites 
nationwide. CBS newsman Mike Wallace, who also overcame depression, 
joined the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Cabinet secretaries and more than 20 members of Congress  
from both parties were participating in the daylong session. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore is working with Surgeon General David Satcher and the  
Ad Council to produce the campaign on mental illness. Clinton 
issued an executive order Friday to eliminate the government's 
stricter hiring and promotion standards for mentally disabled 
people.

<HEADLINE> Shopping for Stocks / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Neither fear nor Alan Greenspan's warnings nor  
even the lack of money seem strong enough to dampen the exuberant 
spirits of shoppers and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrowing remains near all-time highs. The savings rate is down  
to zero. Demand for new cars continues at a pace unusually high for 
so aged an economy. And the same is true for housing. 
</P>
<P>
	You might as well add stocks to that list. But stocks are  
investments, not spending, you say. And it is true that some folks 
believe we should count stock purchases as savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics might point out major flaws in that reasoning, but the  
one that flashes in glaring red is that much of the current 
investing isn't being accomplished with cash but with credit, or as 
it's described on Wall Street, on margin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, you might say, the stock market is full of consumers,  
buying up stocks in the same way they buy houses and automobiles, 
which is with credit, More than $180 billion of it, as of April. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure, in fact, is for credit on only one exchange, the  
New York Stock Exchange, a relatively conservative institution. And 
it represents a one-month increase of no less than 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing wrong with this, as market analysts will quickly  
argue, because stocks are more fairly valued now than just a few 
months ago and, in spite of earlier doubts, the economy is strong. 
</P>
<P>
	You don't have to look hard or in out of the way places to find  
evidence of this view of the economy. And during your search you 
might even detect a renewal of enthusiasm among brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter says investors might consider buying  
overseas stocks. T. Rowe Price sees good values among 
``long-neglected second-tier issues.'' Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
suggests investors might be underestimating future corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But, even while regulatory officials seem unconcerned, at least  
publicly, it is hard to dismiss that margin debt. It is nine times 
the 1985 figure and 28 percent higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, you'll find many defenses for such behavior, the most  
fascinating being the ``new era'' theory. We are, some will argue, 
in the midst of an Internet tidal wave that will transform life 
more fundamentally than the car, the radio, telephone and TV 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	The new-era belief is so deep and so widely accepted, and the  
enthusiasm it generates so contagious, it overwhelms a sense of 
history. Past and present are far less significant than future. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, a bullish goal was to double your money in five  
years. Today, that view sounds passe. EToys, a new issue originally 
slated to be offered at $10, closed at $76.56 on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the old days, a stock was considered a good value if it  
maintained steady profits growth over a five-year span. Today, some 
of the hottest stocks earn nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument for assessing these hot new stocks is that they are  
companies of the future. Building market share for tomorrow's 
Golden Age, it is explained, is more important than current 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the future will prove current thinking to be correct. And  
if that is so, future historians will be compelled to concede that 
the 1990s was the beginning of a new economic and investment era.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Takes Part in 'Free' Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By THOMAS WAGNER    	
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- From the dense jungles of Irian Jaya  
to the rebellious province of Aceh, Indonesians got their first 
real taste of democracy since 1955 as they voted today for a new 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Wading through muddy rice fields, paddling canoes on outlying  
islands, and riding three-wheeled rickshaws through crowded cities, 
millions of people cast ballots for the assembly, which will help 
choose the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	It was another major step away from authoritarian rule that  
ended when riots by pro-democracy student groups forced President 
Suharto to resign in May 1998 after 32 years in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real democracy now, not like before,'' said Muswantoro,  
a 55-year-old English teacher, after voting at a makeshift booth in 
a soccer field in the village of Rempoa near the capital, Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Indonesians have never voted in a truly free election. The  
first and last open ballot was 44 years ago. The ones that followed 
were largely rigged to ensure that candidates from the ruling 
Golkar Party won. 
</P>
<P>
	Up for grabs are 462 of Parliament's 500 seats. The rest go to  
appointees of the powerful military, which is not allowed to vote. 
The new legislators will join 200 government appointees to choose a 
new president in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite heavy rain in Jakarta and other areas, a big turnout was  
expected, with an estimated 112 million registered voters in the 
world's fourth most populous nation and its largest Muslim country. 
</P>
<P>
	There were minor disturbances linked to confusion about whether  
voters could register at the last minute, said Adnan Buyung 
Nasution, chairman of the General Election Commission. Three ballot 
boxes at a station near Jakarta were set on fire in a registration 
dispute, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission chief said problems were insignificant  
compared with the overall success of voting in the far-flung 
Southeast Asian archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in Aceh, a province in northern Sumatra island where  
separatist guerrillas oppose the election, many people refused to 
vote, said Yusuf Ismail, a member of a local human rights group. 
``The people were too scared,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polling was postponed in four Aceh districts because of militant  
attacks, and ballot boxes at a polling station in the area were set 
on fire. Two stations in Irian Jaya province were closed because of 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls began closing in the afternoon to get the laborious  
counting process started before sunset. Officials go through the 
boxes ballot by ballot, with one reading out the results while 
another uses a marker on standardized forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Andi Mallerengang of the General Election Commission said early  
results showed front-runner Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian 
Democratic Party for Struggle doing very well in Jakarta, the 
sprawling capital of 11 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated she could win up to 50 percent of the vote there,  
but stressed that the pattern of voting in other areas could be 
different, and more complete results should be available within two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallies from outlying areas are expected to take days, with some  
ballot boxes being ferried by foot and canoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's party was unlikely to win a majority in Parliament,  
creating the need for coalitions among the 48 parties that fielded 
at least 11,000 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just wait for the result,'' said Megawati, the daughter  
of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, after voting near her 
home on the southern outskirts of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's former protege and  
leader of the Golkar Party, voted with his wife, Hasri Ainun. ``God 
willing, this election will be free, just and fair,'' said Habibie. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto was accompanied by three of his six children to the  
polls. The former president -- now besieged by allegations of 
massive corruption during his rule -- raised his ballot for the 
television cameras and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	But Megawati's party won in the polling stations where Suharto  
and Habibie cast their ballots. Golkar was fourth at one and third 
at the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of foreign monitors, including former President Jimmy  
Carter, were on hand to help hundreds of thousands of Indonesian 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any doubt (the election) will bring an  
end to violence and open up the country to immediate economic 
improvement,'' said Carter as he toured a voting station in Rempoa. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first areas to vote was East Timor, where many people  
see an Aug. 8 referendum on the territory's future as far more 
significant than the national election. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum will decide whether the impoverished former  
Portuguese colony, invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the 
following year, should become an autonomous state or go its own way 
as a fledgling nation. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timorese voters said Indonesian authorities and their  
militant supporters coerced people into voting, reasoning that high 
turnout in this election equals support for staying a part of 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The authorities told me that if I didn't vote, there would be  
bad consequences,'' said independence supporter Augusto Gomes. 
``They'd come and interrogate me. I'm very afraid of that.''

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.52 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.510 percent, down from 4.620 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.760 percent, up from 4.750 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since May 24, when the bills  
sold for 4.495 percent. The six-month rate was the highest since 
Sept. 8, 1998, when the rate was 4.790. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.638 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,886, and 4.958 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,759.40. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.08 
percent last week from 4.93 percent the previous week.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is adding two fugitives to its Ten  
Most Wanted list today, replacing two Libyans now in custody and 
suspected in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh  
arranged a news conference at bureau headquarters to announce the 
additions. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspected former Libyan intelligence agents Abdel Basset Ali

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed in April to hand them over for 
trial in the Netherlands as a neutral venue. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Libyans are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit  
murder and violations of international aviation safety laws in the 
Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 people 
on the plane and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the excitement over their unexpected march

bad memories of an inconsistent, often ugly regular season.

	On Monday night, those ghosts all came back in one dreadful

<P>
	For 12 fateful minutes, the Knicks played U-turn basketball,  
reversing all the good things that had them just two wins away from 
the NBA Finals. The second quarter was a sea of turnovers and bad 
passes, poor shooting and careless ball handling. It put New York 
in a hole that was too deep to escape as the Indiana Pacers took 
advantage for a 90-78 victory in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference 
Finals, tying the best-of-7 series at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``They crushed us,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``We're right  
back where we were with this team in the regular season. We're a 
defensive, rebounding team first and foremost and we didn't do 
either tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers hit half of their field goal attempts and  
outrebounded New York 41-30. Much of that happened in the second 
quarter when Indiana opened some old wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	New York managed just 12 points in the quarter -- one for each  
minute of the period -- and trailed at halftime 45-32. And that was 
without Indiana's big guns, Rik Smits and Reggie Miller, scoring a 
single point. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the worst period the Knicks played all season because  
they played some other ugly ones en route to a 27-23 record. But it 
certainly was a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not making shots right now,'' Van Gundy said. ``And  
they're a better shooting team than we are, so if we're going to 
get in a shooting contest with them and we're not going to guard 
them, we're going to struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the playoffs, the Knicks looked like the  
eighth-seeded team in the Eastern Conference, a team that barely 
made the postseason, cost general manager Ernie Grunfeld his job 
and placed Van Gundy in serious jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks made just five of 14 shots in the second period and  
committed six turnovers. After trailing by just three points after 
the first quarter, they fell behind by 13. And even though they 
managed to hang around in second half, they never quite overcame 
those 12 awful minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Camby, whose 18 points and 14 rebounds led New York,  
noticed the problems that Van Gundy talked about. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to play better defense,'' he said. ``We were letting  
guys go by who shouldn't go by. We missed out on a big opportunity. 
We're happy at 2-2, but felt it should be 3-1. There's still much 
basketball to be played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The perplexing second period was reminiscent of some of New  
York's poorest games, like the night in March that the Knicks 
scored just 22 in the first half and five in the second quarter 
against Chicago. And the night in April when they shot 34 percent 
from the field at Philadelphia and failed to score 70 points for 
the third time in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy started Latrell Sprewell to try and protect Kurt  
Thomas from early foul trouble. But Sprewell picked up two 
personals early and when he entered the game, Thomas drew three 
whistles in eight minutes. And Sprewell wound up fouling out in the 
final minute of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that kind of night.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter who we start if we defend and rebound like  
that,'' Van Gundy said. ``We could start the assistant coaches and 
it wouldn't matter if we don't guard.''

<HEADLINE> Kasparov To Play Chess Match on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- World chess champion Garry Kasparov, who lost a  
tournament two years ago to a computer, now is taking on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparov has cut a deal with Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft  
Corp. to play a match this summer against a ``world team'' made up 
of anyone who comes to a Microsoft Internet site and votes for 
suggested moves against the Russian grandmaster. The world team 
will be guided by five young chess experts, who will suggest 
possible moves and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will encourage people to pay more attention to  
chess,'' Kasparov said in a telephone interview from his Moscow 
home. ``I think it will be an event that will help us to establish 
new technologies and new technological means to bring new masses of 
people to play chess live on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The match, starting June 21, will be played in the ``Gaming  
Zone'' of Microsoft's MSN network of Internet services at 
www.msn.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparov will make the opening move, and visitors to the site  
will be given 24 hours to vote for a countermove. Kasparov will 
reply with a move 24 hours later, and so on until the conclusion of 
the match, which is expected to take all summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a highly publicized tournament in 1997, Kasparov was defeated  
by the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. IBM crowed at the victory of 
``man vs. machine,'' which left Kasparov smarting -- he complained 
that the match was supposed to be a friendly scientific 
competition, but the IBM team took it as a win-or-lose contest at 
any price.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton won't get any help from  
a leading abortion-rights group if she runs for the Senate against 
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and  
Reproductive Rights Action League, said Monday that her group won't 
take sides in the race because both likely candidates are 
abortion-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be choosing one over the other. She has been a  
strong advocate of a woman's right to choose and he has been 
extraordinarily strong as well,'' Michelman said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's political director, Gloria A. Totten, said NARAL  
plans to help abortion-rights candidates get elected to the White 
House and Congress in 2000. Mrs. Clinton has been a champion of 
NARAL's cause, ``so it won't be easy'' to take a pass on her likely 
Senate candidacy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She understands that we have to be careful how we dedicate our  
resources,'' Totten said of Mrs. Clinton.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top fund-raiser for Dan Quayle has left his  
2000 presidential campaign, as aides predict a slight dip in 
contributions from the first quarter reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Hodges, finance director in Quayle's Phoenix, Ariz.,  
office, was in charge of day-to-day operations of the Quayle money 
machine. Her deputy, Liesl Hickey, also left the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Jonathan Baron said the pair ``made the decision to  
depart the campaign, as often happens in presidential campaigns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Quayle has added staff in Iowa, New Hampshire and  
Phoenix, including fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very good first quarter,'' Baron said. ``We'll have a  
solid second quarter, given the realities of the fund-raising 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reality is that front-runner George W. Bush raised nearly $8  
million in the first three months of 1999, compared to Quayle who 
finished second in the GOP field with $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle advisers say the former vice president has already raised  
$1 million in the second quarter -- which ends June 30 -- but 
probably won't match his first-quarter figure. On the other hand, 
the Texas governor expects to at least match his $8 million 
first-quarter showing.

<HEADLINE> Simon, Dylan Kick Off Joint Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Bob Dylan and Paul Simon have  
kicked off a joint 30-city summer tour that includes hits from 
their repertoires as well as a few duets. 
</P>
<P>
	The two musical legends, touring together for the first time,  
left about 1,000 chairs empty in the 8,000-seat Colorado Springs 
World Arena on Sunday night -- the tour's smallest venue. But the 
duo played to an enthusiastic crowd that rushed the stage before 
the concert and remained standing throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in blue jeans and a baseball cap, Simon opened with  
``Bridge Over Troubled Water'' before performing ``Mrs. Robinson,'' 
``Slip Slidin' Away,'' ``Graceland,'' ``Diamonds on the Soles of 
Her Shoes'' and ``You Can Call Me Al.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon and Dylan teamed on ``The Sounds of Silence,'' dominated  
by Dylan's raspy growl and bluesy harmonica, followed by Johnny 
Cash's ``I Walk the Line,'' which turned into ``Blue Moon of 
Kentucky'' and ``Forever Young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan, in a black suit and cowboy boots, followed with several  
slower numbers before launching into fast-paced versions of 
``Tangled Up in Blue'' and ``All Along the Watchtower.''

<HEADLINE> Orange County Reaches Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Orange County has reached a $20.8  
million settlement with 12 finance and securities firms connected 
to the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, officials 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy  
Court and would bring the total amount recovered by the county to 
$860.58 million. The cases stem from the infamous $1.64 billion 
collapse of Orange County's investment pool in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The out-of-court settlement brings to a close most of the  
numerous lawsuits the county filed in the case. Settlements were 
reached previously with 15 other firms, whose brokers and dealers 
were accused of contributing to the county's downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch agreed last year to pay the county $437.1 million  
to settle a lawsuit accusing the firm of giving bad advice that 
contributed to the financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit against the Standard &AMP; Poor's rating service has not  
been settled and is headed for trial soon in Los Angeles. The 
settlements announced Monday will have no bearing on the case, said 
Leah Johnson, director of communications for the bond rating 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	All proceeds from the lawsuit settlements will be applied to the  
county's remaining debt, said Gary Burton, the county's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to have this behind us because we're working on  
financial planning and in putting good management practices in 
place,'' Burton said. ``This allows us to focus on that, rather 
than bankruptcy issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The county would receive only 38 percent of the settlements,  
which must be shared with other participants in the failed 
investment pool, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies that agreed to settle with the county include:  
Bank of America Securities; Citibank and Citicorp Securities; Fuji 
Securities; Lehman Brothers; PaineWebber; Prudential Securities; 
Smith Barney; Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corp.; Daiwa Securities 
America Inc.; Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp.; Kidder, 
Peabody &AMP; Co.; Sanwa Securities USA.

<HEADLINE> Karsay Giving Tribe Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Steve Karsay bounded off the mound to one of  
the strangest sights and sounds at Jacobs Field all season -- fans 
standing to cheer an Indians pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay's two-strike curveball made Sammy Sosa swing at air. And  
as he headed toward the dugout, Karsay tipped his cap as Cleveland 
fans saluted a pitcher who in two months has gone from being fairly 
unknown to nearly unhittable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to get an ovation like that when you're coming out  
of a game,'' Karsay said. ``Things have gone my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long ago Karsay wondered if he would ever pitch in the  
big leagues again, never mind having a ballpark full of 40,000 fans 
roaring for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay, a career starter who has been slowed by elbow injuries,  
is pitching out of the bullpen for the first time. And although he 
longs to start once more, Karsay has flourished in his new role and 
become the MVP of Cleveland's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	He's 5-1 with a 2.06 ERA with a team-leading 25 appearances, and  
with a new splitter and fastball clocking 100 mph on a pitch to 
Sosa on Sunday, Karsay has struck out 39 in 39 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter when or for how long Indians manager Mike Hargrove has  
needed him, Karsay has come through. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked Steve to do something that he had not really ever  
done before,'' said Hargrove, booed Sunday when he pulled Karsay. 
``I think that truth be known, he probably wasn't really 
comfortable with it to begin with, but he really has taken it and 
run with it. He has done a great job for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay, acquired after the 1997 season from Oakland, came to the  
Indians with a short pitching resume and an overstuffed medical 
file. 
</P>
<P>
	After being taken by Toronto with the 22nd overall pick in the  
1990 draft, Karsay began having elbow problems and underwent 
several operations. But after being traded in 1993 to the A's for 
Rickey Henderson, cartilage damage forced him to shut down after 
just four starts in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	His elbow didn't respond well and the following spring he  
decided to have ``Tommy John'' surgery. Karsay missed all of 1995 
and began his slow return in the California League pitching against 
the likes of Lake Elsinore and Rancho Cucamunga. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's striking out Sosa, and fanning the side in order to  
beat the Yankees in New York last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always doubts in the back of your mind after you've  
had a major surgery,'' he said. ``'Can I come back and be as good 
as I was before I had the surgery'. A lot of hard work will pay off 
for you. It's paid off for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew I could pitch at this level and be successful.  
It was just a matter of time after the surgery that I was going to 
get the opportunity and show what I could do. It's just coming out 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay's emergence provides Hargrove with a current luxury and a  
possible dilemma. If Jaret Wright or Dwight Gooden continue to 
struggle, Hargrove would be tempted to move Karsay into the 
starting rotation at the cost of weakening his bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's real good right now where he's at,'' Hargrove said. ``It  
remains an option for us. Having Steve in the bullpen gives us a 
legitimate chance to win every game we play. If we take Steve out 
of that mix, it still gives us a chance to win but it takes a 
little of that (bullpen) depth from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay, who has made 37 career starts, isn't knocking on  
Hargrove's office door every day to ask for a chance to make No. 
38. He's confident his time will come. And, anyway, this long 
relief gig isn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was bred a starter, and I will probably always be a starter  
in the back of my mind,'' he said. ``I feel like I can start, but 
we have five capable guys who are doing a great job in this 
rotation. But if it's a year down the road or three years down the 
road, then so be it.''

<HEADLINE>  WNBA Adds Four Teams for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA is growing up fast.  
</P>
<P>
	Set to enter its third season this week, the women's basketball  
league on Monday added four teams that will begin play in 2000 -- 
Miami, Seattle, Indianapolis and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion, yet another step up for a league backed by the  
NBA's money and marketing savvy, comes six months after the rival 
American Basketball League folded, leaving the WNBA the only pro 
women's league in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had not anticipated expanding this quickly,'' WNBA  
president Val Ackerman said. ``But the combination of the success 
of the league in the first two seasons and the strong interest 
expressed by NBA owners has convinced us that the time is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The additions will bring the league to 16 teams, double the  
number from the first season. Ackerman would not disclose the cost 
of the new franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA opens its season Thursday night, with new teams  
in Minnesota and Orlando. The league added teams in Detroit and 
Washington last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does something for the city of Indianapolis and the state  
of Indiana,'' Pacers president Donnie Walsh said. ``And it 
legitimizes the WNBA because, how could you have a league and we're 
not in it in women's basketball?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue, in West Lafayette, Ind., won the women's NCAA basketball  
championship and it's coach, Carolyn Peck, left to coach the 
Orlando Miracle in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman said no target date had been set for further expansion,  
but she indicated more than four cities expressed interest for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge now is to roll out new teams for the future,''  
Ackerman said, adding that the WNBA would award franchises only to 
NBA cities. ``It makes no sense to go to places where there is no 
NBA infrastructure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Average attendance in the WNBA last year was more than 10,000,  
an increase of 8 percent from 1997. Ackerman said the average 
ticket price in the WNBA is about $14, with some seats $5. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48 players for the teams that begin playing next year will  
come mostly from the defunct ABL, players who lost their WNBA jobs 
this season because of the influx of ABL players and college 
seniors. The teams' nicknames and logos have yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL, which began as a fall-winter league in 1996, folded  
after 2 1/2 seasons, filing for bankruptcy in December. Both leagues 
began with hopes of capitalizing on the gold-medal performance of 
the U.S. women's team at the Atlanta Olympics and the growing 
popularity on the college level. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other women's leagues have come and gone over the years.  
The Women's Basketball League survived just three years before 
folding in 1981 because it ran out of money. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because the WNBA has the NBA's backing, along with  
sponsors and TV contracts, it is less vulnerable to such problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Before getting final approval, the four expansion teams must  
sell at least 5,500 season tickets by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the new teams will play in new arenas -- Indianapolis in  
the Canseco Field House, which opens in November, and Miami in the 
American Airlines Arena, which opens Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portland, the new team will fill the void left by the ABL's  
Portland Power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this is a tremendous market for women's  
basketball,'' said Harry Hutt, the Portland Trail Blazers' vice 
president of marketing, who put together the team's pitch to the 
WNBA. ``It's exciting that young girls all over the state of Oregon 
will now have their very own sports role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the alignment plan next year, Indiana and Miami will be in  
the Eastern Conference, along with Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, 
New York, Orlando and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland and Seattle will play in the Western Conference with  
Houston, Los Angeles, Minnesota, Phoenix, Sacramento and Utah.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Matriarch Hawkins Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Eloise Hawkins, chairman and chief  
executive of the authority which ran stock-car races at Bowman Gray 
Stadium, died Monday after a battle with cancer. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, Hawkins was head of the Winston-Salem Speedway,  
Inc., which conducts NASCAR-sanctioned stock-car racing at the 
municipal stadium under a lease from the city. She remained active 
in its operation until the illness struck her earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins was born Sept. 1, 1916, in Spartanburg County, S.C., and  
was one of 11 children. She entered the auto racing industry when 
she married J. Alvin Hawkins, who co-founded the stadium's racing 
in 1949 in a partnership with NASCAR founder William France. 
</P>
<P>
	France withdrew from the enterprise in the 1960s and Hawkins  
became the stadium's racing chief after her husband died in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include five daughters, 16 grandchildren and 12  
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. at the Hayworth-Miller  
Funeral Home. Memorials may be made to West Side Baptist Church in 
Winston-Salem.

<HEADLINE> Study of Mentally Ill Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Michigan congresswoman said drugs for  
treating her manic depression once ate up half her family's income. 
A mother said it took three years to find the right specialist in 
Nashville, Tenn., for her son's mental problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a backdrop of such testimony, President Clinton asked  
Congress on Monday to ensure that Americans with mental illness get 
the same health benefits they now have for a broken leg or an 
asthma attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Without proper treatment for mental illness, he told a White  
House conference, ``the loss of human potential is staggering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was led by Tipper Gore, Vice President Al Gore's  
wife, whose role in advising Clinton on mental illness took on a 
personal dimension when she recently disclosed she had suffered 
clinical depression after her son was hit by a car 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental illness is ``the last great stigma of the 20th century,''  
she said, noting how cancer and then AIDS were once unmentionable 
in many families. ``Most people treat someone with a mental illness 
as if it's their fault or as if they can just snap out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, drawing mental health professionals together  
here and in cities across the country who were linked 
electronically, focused on making people understand that mental 
illness is a sickness much like any other -- ``a real disease of a 
real organ, the brain,'' as one panelist put it -- and that no one 
should feel shame or suffer discrimination for getting treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is seeking expansion of a 1996 law that prohibits health  
plans from setting lifetime payment caps that are higher for 
physical illnesses than for mental illnesses. He wants to prevent 
insurance companies from imposing other limits, such as the number 
of hospital days or doctor visits allowed for mental treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill to eliminate distinctions between physical and mental  
coverage is pending in the Senate but the Republican-led Congress 
has been wary of costly expansions of health care. The health 
insurance industry is also worried about mandated benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our experience has been that mandates, no matter how well  
intentioned, raise the cost of coverage,'' said Richard Coorsh of 
the Health Insurance Association of America. The National 
Association of Manufacturers also criticized the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore said she sought professional help and medication  
because ``I was not myself'' after her family's trauma -- her son 
Albert's 1989 accident, from which he recovered. ``I'm happy to say 
that it worked,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	People must know ``there is the right diagnosis and the right  
treatment and the right health care professional out there for 
you,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons and the Gores shared the stage with CBS newsman  
Mike Wallace, whose own depression once laid him ``lower than a 
snake's belly,'' as well as others who believe healing power is 
found in the knowledge that mental problems strike people in all 
walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lynn Rivers, D-Mich., wife of an auto worker, said severe  
mood swings in her late teens were the first signs of her manic 
depression. She said the day she was diagnosed, some years later, 
was a happy one because ``I was finally dealing with something that 
was not my fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, she said it took 10 years to figure out the right mix  
of medication, and the treatment consumed half the family's 
earnings. She went public with her problem after political 
opponents in the 1994 election that brought her to Congress spread 
word that she had had a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Robyn Kitchell spoke of the imbalance of a health system that  
would cover her son's physical diagnostic tests for manic 
depression but not the $150 psychiatric sessions in Nashville. 
``When mental illness hits puberty, boy is that a ride,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the struggle continues, her son graduated from the  
eighth grade and won a football award. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is moving on its own, meanwhile, to  
give federal workers mental health coverage that equals their 
protection for physical ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton said people who receive disability payments  
for mental illness should be given access to affordable health 
coverage when they go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced that 1,000 schools will get free  
satellite programming on how to deal with students prone to 
violence. The project is a collaboration of the National Education 
Association, EchoStar Communications and Future View, a video 
production company.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher  
Monday, boosted by Friday's rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index rose 421.85 points,  
or 3.4 percent, closing at 12,837.39. On Friday, the index had 
gained 56.07 points, or 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was shortened to a 90-minute trading  
session because tropical storm Maggie forced a shutdown in all 
financial markets in the morning as it swept into south China. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said prices rose in reaction to gains on Wall Street,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.3 percent Friday 
after U.S. employment data for May came in weaker than expected and 
eased fears of an imminent rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Any rise in U.S. interest rates is usually followed by a similar  
hike in Hong Kong because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the 
U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 175.14  
points, or 1.07 percent, ending at 16,475.89. On Friday, the Nikkei 
closed up 73.25 points, or 0.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the rise in Tokyo was mainly futures-led, although  
individual shares in the high-technology and pharmaceutical sectors 
also put on big gains mirroring the movement of their counterparts 
in New York Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the stock market was news that the government  
decided on Friday to close Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co., a 
troubled medium-sized Japanese insurance company. The company's 
liabilities were found to have exceeded its assets by 200 billion 
Japanese yen ($1.64 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.84 yen  
late afternoon, down 0.78 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below 
its New York level of 122.22 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares closed sharply higher, with the main index  
surging 5.6 percent following a fall in local interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 44.82 points to  
842.32, its highest close since July 11, 1996, when the index stood 
at 847.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in Jakarta because of elections in  
Indonesia. The New Zealand market was also closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher in a rally sparked by  
technology stocks, with the main index rising to a new high for the 
year. The Weighted Stock Price Index rose 163.39 points, or 2.1 
percent, to 7,802.69. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks closed higher, boosted by a rally in  
shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. and a cut in the 
central bank's overnight rates following lower-than-expected 
inflation in May. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 
48.41 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,403.01. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, following  
Friday's gains on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 
2,944.10, up 14.80 points, or 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell as investors cautiously sat  
on the sidelines amid expectations that prices could drift lower in 
the absence of market-moving news. The benchmark Kuala Lumpur 
Composite Index fell 1.2 percent, or 8.79 points, to 731.01. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher, boosted by Wall  
Street's gains and the peaceful Indonesian election campaign. The 
Straits Times Index rose 27.04 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,955.41. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Thailand SET Index  
rose 6.78 points, or 1.4 percent, to 483.25.

<HEADLINE> Europeans End end Web boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European Internet users have ended a 24-hour  
boycott of the World Wide Web that aimed to win a reduction in 
local telephone charges. The next stage in their campaign is to 
enroll the support of political leaders, British participants said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunications said Internet  
users in 15 European countries coordinated efforts to win a 
reduction in costs, including a flat-rate charge for local calls, 
similar to that in the United States. The boycott ended Sunday at 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Erol Ziya, a spokesman for the group, called the British  
contribution to the effort ``a great success'' and said it 
generated widespread news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziya could not say how many Britons boycotted the Internet  
Sunday. In Spain, however, there was a 38 percent drop in use of 
the Internet, a 60 percent drop in Internet chat room activity and 
a 90 percent drop in e-mail traffic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign ran a similar boycott Jan. 31, with seven countries  
participating. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants were seeking the introduction of unmetered charges  
for connections to an Internet service provider using a telephone 
modem ``to enable everyone who wants to access the Internet without 
incurring open-ended costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Telecom Internet Plan has announced it was introducing a  
toll-free weekend access number for subscribers to its plan, who 
pay a monthly subscription fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has welcomed the decision but says that users are  
still tied to a single Internet service provider, ``as with all 
'free' offers so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other countries where Internet users participated in  
Sunday's boycott, the campaign said, were Austria, Belgium, the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, 
Romania, Sweden and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Baseballers Sue Over Video Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With a click of a mouse, former Braves infielder  
Darrel Chaney can bat against the $105 million arm of Kevin Brown 
or the great Cy Young. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike current players, who are paid through their union  
when computer game designers use their names and images, obscure 
players like Chaney don't get a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, many  
ex-players don't have high-paid lawyers or estates to demand money 
from game designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney, a .217 career hitter who had more strikeouts than hits,  
played 10 seasons for the Reds and Atlanta Braves before retiring 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He's leading a group of former major leaguers suing 10 computer  
game makers to try to get deals similar to those of current players 
-- from 8.5 percent to 9 percent of a game's net sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney, who chairs the major league baseball alumni association  
committee that's pursuing the lawsuit, said the payments would be a 
big help to many retired players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some guys that are old and don't have much of a  
pension,'' said Chaney, who now works for an Atlanta corporate 
relocation service. ``They have no voice for them out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar complaint is pending in Los Angeles against Warner  
Communications' ``Hardball 5'' and the firm that distributed it. 
The suit was filed two years ago by a group that includes Don 
Newcombe and several members of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Former pitcher Phil Niekro, outfielder Mike Lum and catcher  
Johnny Bench are the other plaintiffs in Chaney's suit. The players 
want to designate the lawsuit as class-action, meaning thousands of 
former players could sign on. Lawyers say they have talked to 
nearly 1,700 players interested in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose, baseball's hit leader, batted .370 for the Reds in  
the 1975 World Series, while Chaney was hitless in two at-bats. But 
Chaney says they both are entitled to the same compensation from 
any company that wants to include ``The Big Red Machine'' in a 
computer game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My World Series winning check was the same as Pete Rose's, not  
a penny's difference,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game makers, who oppose class-action status, argue the suit  
amounts to little more than a flimsy cash grab by players trying to 
profit from statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Leyh, a Seattle lawyer for Sierra Online Inc., said the  
company used only the players' names and statistics -- ``historical 
facts that appear in any number of commercially available 
textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting case, but I think it's got more fluff than  
substance,'' Leyh said. ``The plaintiffs have made huge demands, 
which we think are way out of line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra offered to pay 9 percent of sales on its ``Baseball '94:  
Legends and Stadiums,'' which sold poorly. The players rejected 
that offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all these years ... these guys want what's fair,'' said  
Atlanta lawyer Mark Van Spix, who represents Chaney's group. 
</P>
<P>
	One company, Microleague Multimedia Inc. of Lancaster, Pa.,  
settled for $350,000, plus 11 percent of future sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the game makers say many of the companies can't  
afford the players' demands. Microleague, for example, has filed 
for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Heinke, who represents Warner in the California suit, argues  
that the players' identities are incidental to game sales. He said 
most of the games include specific teams to offer specific famous 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the question comes down to one of what really  
is the value of someone who is an obscure player from a long time 
ago,'' said Paul Anderson, assistant director of the National 
Sports Law Institute at Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
	The players say even long-forgotten benchwarmers are important  
to the accuracy of the game. If a video game manager wants to match 
the 1975 Reds against the 1998 New York Yankees, there may come a 
point when Chaney will come off the bench to pinch hit with the 
game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney is confident the players will prevail even if they don't  
get much money. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least it's a starting point,'' he said. ``To make people  
aware that former baseball players are people, too, and have 
certain rights.''

<HEADLINE> British, Dutch Steel Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Steel PLC's proposed $6.5 billion merger  
with Dutch metals maker Koninklijke Hoogovens NV would make it No. 
1 among Europe's steel producers, but some analysts were 
questioning whether in this case, bigger really is better. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today will give the combined company a larger  
stake in the regional steel market, allow it to cut an estimated 
$313 million in annual costs and give it a stronger position as a 
supplier of steel for Europe's auto industry. Left unanswered, 
analysts said, were concerns about how the company would deal with 
with issues facing all steelmakers -- overcapacity in the industry 
and slumping demand in key markets like Russia and East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that you're a big volume producer is not going to  
make you a competitive producer. What matters is the quality of 
your steel and your relationship with clients,'' said Mark Horn, 
head of European research at the stock brokerage T. Hoare 
Canaccord. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned merger means the wave of consolidation sweeping  
Europe's banks and telecommunications firms is lapping also at 
heavy manufacturing firms. The combined company would be the 
world's third-biggest steelmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other companies seeking mergers, British Steel needed  
help to lift its earnings. The company had a loss equivalent to 
$130.6 million for the year ending April 3, compared to a net 
profit of $364.5 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual sales fell by 10 percent to $10.42 billion from $11.56  
billion. The company blamed the effects of Asia's financial crisis 
and the strong British pound, which has made British-made steel 
more costly than steel made in other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogovens' net profit, meanwhile, fell 17 percent in 1998 to  
$196.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As Europe's largest steelmaker, the combined company would have  
annual sales worth $14.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by regulators and shareholders. Upon  
approval, shareholders of both firms would receive stock in the new 
company, initially to be called BSKH. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger marks a major turning point in the life of  
one of Britain's best-known businesses. British Steel was once 
symbolic of the country's uncompetitive industries. Privatized in 
1988, it now employs fewer than 40,000 people in Britain, compared 
to 250,000 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel, which sells commodity-grade steel along with more  
specialized varieties, has long complained that the strong pound 
has hurt its exports. It should benefit by transferring some its 
production costs outside of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will have an improved position as a supplier of  
high-quality flat steel that is used in Europe's auto industry, 
said Philippe Haspeslagh, a professor of corporate strategy at 
INSEAD, an international business school in Fontainebleau, France. 
</P>
<P>
	But Europe's steel producers face falling prices, cheap imports  
and excess supply, and the industry shows little sign of an 
immediate improvement in demand, said Eric Sardain, senior steel 
analyst in London for the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort 
Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian nations used to import 50 million tons of steel per year.  
Now, Asia is a net exporter of steel, Sardain said. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel's stock fell 6.8 percent Monday to 150.75 pence,  
or $2.43, per share. In Amsterdam, Hoogovens' share price rose 1.6 
percent to 45.70 euros, or $47.41.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Uncomfortably hot weather slipped across much of the nation  
today, pushing sultry air from New England to Arizona and sparking 
storms in the Great Lakes, Gulf Coast and Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern and central New England were expected to have showers,  
powerful winds and thunderstorms as a result of a mixed system 
hovering over the Northeast and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south and east, the rest of the Northeast and the  
mid-Atlantic states should have clear to partly cloudy skies and 
hot weather. The dry weather was forecast to extend as far south as 
southern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon heat and abundant moisture were expected to create  
scattered showers and thunderstorms from the Tennessee Valley, 
south and west into the lower Mississippi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were forecast from the  
eastern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, southwest into the 
mid-Mississippi Valley and southern Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	North and west of this area, clear to partly cloudy skies and  
dry weather was likely to extend from the western Great Lakes, 
south and west into the central Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Successive waves of storms that swept across Wisconsin on Sunday  
and early today damaged buildings, uprooted trees and tore down 
power lines. Thunderstorms also swept through Michigan, knocking 
out power to more than 6,000 homes in the northwest Lower 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms again were predicted today in the northern and  
central Rockies. A few of the storms also could make it into the 
western Dakotas by afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Damaging winds and hail were expected to be the primary threats  
from the storms, although a few tornadoes will be possible during 
the afternoon and evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak low pressure was expected to bring a few light rain  
showers to the Pacific Northwest. Further south, high pressure was 
forecast to bring partly cloudy skies and dry weather from 
California and Nevada, south and east into the southern Rockies and 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's forecast highs: in the 60s for the Pacific Northwest; in  
the mid- to upper-70s in the Great Lakes, central Rockies, 
California coast and Ohio Valley; in the 80s in the northern New 
England, northern Plains, Tennessee and Mississippi Valley; and in 
the 90s in New England, the mid-Atlantic states and desert 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Extremes in the Lower 48 states on Sunday ranged from a high of  
100 degrees in Del Rio, Texas, to a low of 28 degrees in Mullan 
Pass, Idaho.

<HEADLINE>  Belgium Food Scandal Spreads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Belgian government added butter to  
its list of banned foods on Monday, denying residents another key 
ingredient in their already depleted diets after cancer-causing 
dioxins were found in Belgian foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders huddled in crisis session for a fourth straight day,  
while hundreds of butcher and baker shops closed because the 
government already has banned sales of Belgian poultry, eggs, fatty 
beef and pork, and all byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
	The food industry federation said the 11-day crisis over tainted  
animal feed already has cost producers $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States blocked European Union imports of pork and  
poultry, and countries from Switzerland to South Korea took similar 
actions against Belgian products. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's executive Commission was negotiating with Belgium's  
government and assessing whether the list of more than 1,000 farms 
that used some of the 176,000 pounds of dioxin-laced animal feed 
was sufficient to start freeing up part of the Belgian food market 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The list is now final,'' said Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene,  
ending days of insecurity. Now that the farms have been pinpointed, 
the government hopes it will be easy to trace any contaminated 
meat, eggs and byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he told the nation, it could be another week before the  
government lifts the food bans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and leading opposition parties also agreed to set  
up a special inquiry commission to investigate how the 
cancer-causing dioxins ended up on Belgian dinner plates so easily. 
Dioxin is a byproduct of the manufacture of some herbicides and 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the police investigation into the scandal suffered a  
setback early Monday when a court ordered the release of the only 
two suspects in the case, Lucien and Jan Verkest, who run an animal 
feed-fat production company, saying there was insufficient evidence 
to hold them. However, the two were again remanded into custody 
later Monday after prosecutors appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still base our investigation on the Verkest firm because of  
the (dioxin) positive samples at three poultry farms. The only 
thing they have in common was the fat of Verkest,'' said 
prosecution spokeswoman Nicole De Roeck. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of the contamination is widely suspected to be  
mechanical oil added to the fattening oil for the feed. 
Investigators have ruled out an accidental leak and are looking 
into other ways it could have gotten into the feed, including 
tampering during transport. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters in Brussels, the steak counter was closed  
on Monday and egg products were off the menu. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a French company admitted it had sold about a dozen  
tons of Belgian chicken suspected of being contaminated with 
dioxin. ``It's completely our fault and we regret it,'' Alain Noel 
of the Pic company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the list of countries banning Belgian products got  
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea banned the sale of Belgian, Dutch and French pork  
and poultry. Hong Kong banned beef and dairy products from the 
three nations and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand banned meat, eggs and dairy products from Belgium, and  
Malaysia banned the same products from the European Union. 
Singapore suspended sales of all livestock and byproducts imported 
from any European country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Belgian products containing eggs, milk and meat were  
ordered to be removed from store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal was also tearing at the center-left coalition ahead  
of Sunday's elections. The farm ministry has traditionally been a 
fiefdom of Dehaene's Christian Democrats and the Socialists said 
they were outraged the scandal could take so long to solve. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's health and farm ministers resigned last week after it  
became clear they had known about the problem for a month without 
informing the public or the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Phone, TV, Internet To Be Combined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cable TV wires and telephone lines have taken  
the lead in the convergence of Internet, television and phone 
service, but a wireless alternative is showing promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its clunky and contradictory sounding name, ``fixed  
wireless'' technology may allow service providers to reach places 
where phone wires and cable aren't an attractive option. It may 
also allow competitors an inroad by allowing them to bypass those 
wires, which are dominated by a handful of rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom and Sprint have spent wildly on the cellular-like  
technology in recent months, buying just about every purveyor of a 
fixed-wireless system called Microwave Multipoint Distribution 
Services, or MMDS. 
</P>
<P>
	With that market practically cornered, attention is now turning  
to the next generation of fixed-wireless access, Local Multipoint 
Distribution Services. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Motorola and Cisco Systems announced a new  
partnership to develop LMDS network equipment. While Motorola is 
the lead partner in the venture, the move by Cisco, the top player 
in networking technology, shows the crucial role that fixed 
wireless has become in the race to provide a variety of high-speed 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cisco only partners with another company when it's to their  
advantage and very often only when they're lacking something,'' 
said Lisa Pierce, an industry analyst at Giga Information Group. 
</P>
<P>
	But while fixed-wireless technology is a cheaper and easier way  
to bypass cable and phone systems than digging up the ground for 
new fiber optic networks, consumers probably won't see the benefits 
any time soon. Instead, service providers will likely focus on 
big-spending business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If costs get low enough, fixed wireless could go into the  
home, but that's not the initial target,'' said Luke Szymczak, an 
industry analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A more viable wireless alternative for consumers may be  
satellite transmission to small dishes like those used by DirecTV 
television, but it will be several years before that type of 
service is available. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Electronics, the parent of DirecTV, and Lockheed Martin  
are both leading satellite initiatives, but don't expect to provide 
two-way, high-speed Internet access and telephone calls until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	And although LMDS can transmit up to 100 times faster than the  
cable TV connections and the phone-based service known as Digital 
Subscriber Line, or DSL, there are shortcomings to fixed-wireless 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the transmission towers used in fixed wireless  
need a direct line of sight to transmit to any customer. Bad 
weather can also be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do face challenges, particularly with the rain,'' said  
Pierce. ``You also have to convince the owner of a tall building to 
rent out space. Chances are that owners of those buildings are no 
dummies. They know what their real estate is worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola and Cisco said Monday they were acquiring the  
fixed-wireless assets of Bosch Telecom in Richardson, Texas, as the 
focal point of their new initiative, which they named SpectraPoint 
Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola will own 81 percent of the venture and Cisco will own  
19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, which said they expect to announce some major  
contracts shortly with customers who will use their technology to 
deploy combined phone, TV and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be competing with more established players in  
fixed-wireless technology like Lucent Technologies and Nortel 
Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cisco could quickly become a major player in LMDS because  
companies using its other top-selling network products ``may decide 
to standardize around Cisco,'' said Pierce.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Racketeering Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify the  
reach of a federal law that allows people to file lawsuits alleging 
existence of a racketeering conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will use a Florida case to decide, probably  
sometime in 2000, whether someone can file such a lawsuit even if 
the harm suffered was caused by an act that did not amount to 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert A. Beck II was hired in 1983 as president and a director  
of the Southeastern Insurance Group, a Florida-based company whose 
subsidiaries wrote bonds for construction companies. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawsuit contends he became aware in 1988 that other company  
leaders were engaging in misconduct, such as creating false 
financial statements and diverting company money to their personal 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck says that after he reported the alleged improprieties to  
state insurance officials, the company hired a consultant that 
issued a report criticizing his performance. He was fired in May 
1988, he said, for refusing to participate in illegal conduct and 
for being a whistleblower. 
</P>
<P>
	The company filed for bankruptcy in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
	Beck sued members of the company's board of directors under  
conspiracy provisions of the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt 
Organizations law, which allows triple-damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled that Beck could not sue under RICO because  
any harm to him was not caused by racketeering acts. The 11th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``A terminated whistleblower, although he may have a wrongful  
termination claim, has not suffered an injury that was proximately 
caused by the defendants' racketeering activities,'' the appeals 
court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Beck's lawyers said other federal  
appeals courts have allowed lawsuits in which people contend they 
were harmed by acts committed as part of a racketeering conspiracy, 
even though those specific acts did not amount to racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the former company directors said Beck failed to  
show a RICO conspiracy or that he was fired in retaliation for his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Beck vs. Prupis, 98-1480.

<HEADLINE> Pine Tree Pollen Coats the Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An unusual burst of pine tree pollen has put a  
dusty greenish-yellow coating on nearly everything in the 
Northeast, from cars to patio furniture and window sills. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners have have had to wipe the film off computers, TV  
screens, book shelves -- anything near an open window. The pollen 
can squeeze through window screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Allergy sufferers will have to cast their blame elsewhere,  
however. Mold and grass pollen are the prime causes of those 
sneezes and coughs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pollen is coming from the white pine tree. The white pine,  
so named for the light hue of its wood, is the dominant variety of 
pine from Maine to the mid-Atlantic, and west to the Great Lakes 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it has been this bad, but not in the last few years  
memory,'' said John O'Keefe, coordinator of the Fisher Museum of 
Forestry in Petersham. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment in the Northeast, the tree is at the height of its  
pollination season, which lasts two to three weeks each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollen seasons run in cycles, worsening every three to five  
years or so. This year's blast of pine pollen has been worsened by 
the dry weather. Rain usually helps wash the pollen out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain, however, doesn't seem to do much for removing the  
greenish-yellow film from cars. A little water turns the pollen 
into a smeary mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Business has more than doubled at the Lechmere Autowash Center  
in Somerville, which washed more than 2,000 cars this weekend 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in business for 30 years and this has been one of  
the worst for pollen. In translation, it's one of the best for 
us,'' said owner Vicki Previte. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Vaquez, 31, of Boston, spent part of Monday scrubbing her  
green 1985 Chrysler Fifth Avenue. ``I just washed this car two days 
ago and it's dirty again,'' she said with a sigh.

<HEADLINE> Mr. Marlin Going Home As Oriole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jeff Conine stood at his locker, shaking hands and  
greeting acquaintances who filed past in a steady procession worthy 
of a visiting dignitary. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, Conine is just that.  
</P>
<P>
	The sight of former Florida Marlins in the visiting clubhouse  
has become commonplace at Pro Player Stadium, but there's only one 
Mr. Marlin. Conine was back Monday to play his first game in Miami 
since being traded 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like I have dyslexia today -- the wrong locker room,  
the wrong side of the field,'' he said before the Marlins' game 
against Baltimore was postponed by rain. ``It's a weird feeling, 
but life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conine is now a first baseman for the Orioles, but his roots and  
winter home remain in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	From the expansion Marlins' first game in 1993, when Conine went  
4-for-4, he was a cornerstone of the franchise. In 1997 he was 
demoted to a platoon role, sharing first base duties with Darren 
Daulton, but still hit 17 homers for the World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Then owner H. Wayne Huizenga dismantled the team, and Conine was  
among the first to go. General manager Dave Dombrowski traded him 
to Kansas City for pitching prospect Blaine Mull. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the nostalgia going back to opening day, it  
represented the end of an era in a way,'' Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we left was not the best circumstances,'' Conine said.  
``It's sad in that fact, but it's great to be back. I get to stay 
in my own bed for a couple of nights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He rode to the stadium Monday with Marlins closer Matt Mantei  
and stopped by the home team's clubhouse, where he encountered few 
former teammates. They've been traded away too. 
</P>
<P>
	Conine said he's impressed by the Marlins' young talent. He  
noted a contrast in moods between Florida (which began the week 
21-36 with an $18 million payroll) and Baltimore (21-34, $78 
million). 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting beaten down because we have a big payroll and  
we're not winning,'' he said. ``They're probably ecstatic because 
they're playing well and they've got no payroll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Orioles have been a flop, Conine has personally  
rebounded from a poor year in Kansas City. He began the week 
batting .293 with four homers and 27 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Conine, who turns 33 this month, becomes a free agent at the end  
of the year. There's already speculation about his possible return 
to Miami. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Camby Quiets Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marcus Camby has quieted all those who said the  
Knicks could never win in the postseason without Charles Oakley -- 
the player they gave up to get Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the credit has to go to him for perseverance,'' coach Jeff  
Van Gundy said. ``He's gotten much, much better as the season has 
gone along. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby was far down the stat sheet during the regular season,  
seventh on the team in scoring (7.2), fourth in rebounding (5.5) 
and eighth in minutes (20.5). But in the Eastern Conference finals 
against Indiana, Camby is shooting a team-high 59 percent and 
averaging 10.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 series resumed Monday night with the Knicks  
leading the Pacers 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go out there and make the most of my minutes,'' said Camby,  
whose playing time, production and presence have all steadily 
increased during the Knicks' monthlong run through the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby got a surprise at halftime of Game 3 when coach Jeff Van  
Gundy told him he'd be starting the third quarter on the floor 
instead of on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not used to starting any half,'' Camby said. ``So that was  
a big adjustment I had to make to my mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finished with 21 points, 11 rebounds and the praise of  
Indiana coach Larry Bird, who called him ``the best player on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby has been slowly changing minds throughout this season,  
which began with much of New York -- including Van Gundy -- mourning 
the departure of the gritty Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	When Camby reported to training camp out of shape and asked out  
of a game against Miami early in the season after just five minutes 
because he was winded, there were rumblings that the Knicks had 
sacrificed their title hopes in exchange for a skinny underachiever 
from Toronto who would never be able to battle with the likes of 
Miami and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months later, Camby is a big reason why the Knicks have  
succeeded against those two teams in these playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disappointment he's had is that he hasn't played as much  
as he wanted,'' Van Gundy said. ``That was my decision based upon 
what I thought was best for the team. Now was it or not? I don't 
know. All I know is now, when it counts the most, we're getting his 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Camby's best plays with the Knicks came in the second  
round against Atlanta when he took a pass at the foul line, turned 
and launched to the hoop and dunked emphatically over Dikembe 
Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	When a videotape of the dunk was played at Madison Square  
Garden, it drew cheers to rival the ones heard when the replay was 
shown of the greatest dunk in team history -- John Starks' 
left-handed skywalk over Michael Jordan in the 1993 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I've ever seen Jeff Van Gundy rewind a tape,''  
teammate Allan Houston said, ``was for that dunk.''

<HEADLINE> More Thoroughbreds Foaled Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Going in, D. Wayne Lukas was convinced he had  
the most ``dead-fit'' thoroughbred in the Belmont. Coming out, he 
had a horse that was neither fit nor, thankfully, dead. With that 
mixed blessing, racing will have to make do for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	It will now be at least 22 years between Triple Crown winners,  
and judging by what happened to Charismatic on Saturday, it could 
be longer than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Lukas' game colt won that race, he would have beaten more  
rivals than any of the horses who succeeded in sweeping the series 
-- 44 in all; 19 in the Derby, 13 in the Preakness and 12 in the 
Belmont. That would have been a dozen more opponents than War 
Admiral conquered when he set the mark by winning all three 
classics in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more, crowded fields are becoming a fact of life. More  
thoroughbreds are being foaled each year, more are being pointed 
toward the Triple Crown races, and more making it into the starting 
gates for the biggest races, starting with the first Saturday in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the money that's drawing the horses,'' Lukas said.  
``It's the desire of the owners to be in the main arena. The purses 
are secondary. The Triple Crown and the Breeders' Cup are the 
high-profile days for our sports, and everybody in the game would 
like to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to get there, they have to have horses. And not just  
any horses, but 3-year-olds thoroughbreds who will test the limits 
of their endurance at a stage in their development when they are as 
high-strung as teen-agers and just as unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there have to be enough to fill out the programs at the  
Breeders' Cup races in the fall, in the Derby prep races throughout 
the winter and spring, the Triple Crown races in May and June, and 
the Haskell or Jim Dandy or Travers as the summer lengthens into 
another fall. 
</P>
<P>
	When Charismatic was pulled up a few yards down the track from  
the finish line with what X-rays would later reveal were two broken 
bones, the natural suspicion was that the horse was overworked. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Belmont was the colt's fifth race in the last 64  
days, beginning with a fourth-place finish in the Santa Anita Derby 
on April 3 before successive wins in a Derby prep race, then the 
Derby itself and then the Preakness. On top of which, Lukas had a 
history of horses breaking down just past the wire in the biggest 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years ago, he lost a horse named Union City in the  
Preakness, setting off whispers that the horse was not sound going 
in. The next year, Tabasco Cat, the Preakness winner, was retired 
with a leg injury. Then Flanders, his champion juvenile filly, 
broke a bone and had to be retired as well. Three more of his best 
colts, 1995 Preakness winner Timber Country, 1995 Derby winner 
Thunder Gulch and 1996 Derby champion Grindstone, ran into trouble 
and had to quit prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' horsemanship and his judgment both were called into  
question in the past, and the criticism stung. Which may explain 
why Dr. Stephen Selway, the veterinarian who performed the surgery 
Sunday to repair Charismatic's fractured canon bone, went out of 
his way to make clear the horse was sound heading into the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was, '' Selway said, ``no evidence of any preexisting  
condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As grim as Saturday afternoon was, Lukas was so pleased with the  
way Sunday unfolded that even the prospect of critics feasting on 
his decision did not worry him. Charismatic's owners, Bob and 
Beverly Lewis, had stood behind Lukas at every step of the process 
and the colt's future as a stallion was at least as bright as the 
past he left out on the racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``As many horses as I train and at the level we compete, I'm  
going to get criticized,'' Lukas said. ``The only critics I have to 
worry about are my owners -- the Lewises. I can't worry about what 
people say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The racing game isn't about to change, and apparently neither  
will Lukas. He trains horses hard for campaigns that are only going 
to get tougher with each successive year. The one-time basketball 
coach is already the most successful trainer of his time, and 
likely to stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the Belmont, Lukas explained how his philosophy of  
training varied with each individual horse, even though the guiding 
principle always remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they reflect your personality, and mine's aggressive.  
You can probably guess that when I was coaching (basketball), my 
teams pressed and ran. Even,'' he said, ``when the kids I had 
couldn't press or run.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains, Advance / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices finished higher  
in trading Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade but retreated from 
a morning rally that saw July soybeans up more than 8 cents a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the early surges to reports of continued  
above-normal temperatures in the Midwest in the next week. The 
thought was that hot, dry weather could damage early planted crops, 
eventually resulting in smaller crops and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say traders backed off from some of those concerns  
by midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoughts that dry weather will aid in the harvest of winter  
wheat also kept wheat futures in check, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 cent to $2.57 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn was up 1 3/4 cent to $2.22 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 3 cents to 
$1.26 1/2 a bushel; and July soybeans surged 3 3/4 cents to $4.68 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, beef futures were mostly up on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .90 cent to 65.80 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle were up .93 cent to 77.70 cents a pound; June lean 
hogs fell .08 cent to 51.92 cents a pound; and July pork bellies 
fell .83 cent to 52.62 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> British, Dutch Steel Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Steel PLC and Dutch metals producer  
Koninklijke Hoogovens NV announced today they plan to merge in a 
$6.5 billion deal that will create the world's third largest steel 
maker and Europe's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The British company, which has sales nearly double those of  
Hoogovens, is to take a 62 percent share in the new group, which 
would have sales worth $14.9 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel shareholders will also get a cash payment of 56  
cents per existing share from the new company upon completion of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by regulators and by the companies'  
shareholders. If approved, shareholders of both companies will 
receive stock in the new company, initially to be called BSKH. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of BSKH is to be chaired by Sir Brian Moffat of  
British Steel, while the role of chief executive will rotate 
between Hoogovens and British Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in British Steel have rallied in recent days in  
expectation of the bid announcement. But the company's stock fell 6 
percent in early trading today. In Amsterdam, Hoogovens' share 
price was up 1.3 percent from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger marks a major turning point in the life of  
one of Britain's best-known businesses. British Steel was once 
symbolic of the country's uncompetitive industries and the strained 
relations between its managers and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Privatized in 1988, British Steel now employs fewer than 40,000  
people in Britain, compared to 250,000 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say British Steel's decision to merge was prompted  
partly by a downturn in demand caused the lingering financial 
crisis in Asia. Steel makers have high fixed costs, and even a 
slight reduction in sales can threaten profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, analysts say the British pound's persistent  
strength against the euro influenced the move. The strong pound 
makes British-made steel more expensive than competitors' steel 
denominated in euros. The merger would let British Steel shift some 
of its production costs away from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does mean that we have a manufacturing platform in  
Europe,'' British Steel chief executive John Bryant told the 
British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview. ``For our 
customers ... who increasingly look to be served on an 
international basis, ... we've got that platform to provide them 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falling prices, cheap imports and overcapacity have prompted  
Europe's steel makers to embark on a spate of mergers in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Koninklijke Hoogovens' net profit fell 17 percent in 1998 to  
$196.7 million, due largely to lower steel prices and increased 
competition from companies in Asia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel posted a loss of $130.6 million for the year  
ending April 3, 1999, compared to a net profit of $364.5 million in 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel and Hoogovens said they expect cost savings in  
central overhead, purchasing and logistics and that they predict 
savings of $300 million a year by the third year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, whose name would change after the deal is  
completed, will be headquartered in London and will seek listings 
on the London, Amsterdam and New York Stock Exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Stop Canyon Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmental groups that want the government  
to act more quickly to reduce noise from sightseeing planes flying 
over the Grand Canyon lost a Supreme Court appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away the groups' argument  
that the government has failed to meet the legally required 
deadlines for reducing such aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1987 federal law says Grand Canyon flights were ``causing a  
significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of 
the park'' and also raised safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The law gave the Interior secretary 30 days to make  
recommendations to the Federal Aviation Adminstration, which had 
another 90 days to issue a final plan to control air traffic over 
the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after that, the Interior secretary was to report to  
Congress on whether noise had been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial federal action took months longer than the law required,  
and the report to Congress in 1994 said further noise reduction was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA issued in late 1996 a final rule that created new  
flight-free zones, limited the hours flights could operate and 
limited the number of planes that could be used. The agency said 
that if additional rules were adopted, the law's goals would be 
reached by 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules were challenged in federal court by air tour operators  
and others who said the government was moving too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the seven environmental groups -- including the  
Grand Canyon Trust and the Wilderness Society -- contended that the 
government was moving too slowly. They sought an order requiring 
the government to act immediately to reduce aircraft noise at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
rejected all the challenges. The court said the environmental 
groups' frustration with the government's ``slow and faltering pace 
is understandable'' but that it was unfair to say officials had 
done nothing during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the environmental groups' lawyers  
said the appeals court deferred too much to the government. ``Under 
this approach, no delay is unreasonable,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's lawyers said it had acted reasonably, adding,  
``during the day, natural quiet has been restored in much of the 
park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Grand Canyon Trust vs. FAA, 98-1417.

<HEADLINE> State Inmates' Court Access Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court further limited state prison  
inmates' access to federal courts Monday, ruling that prisoners 
generally cannot pursue claims they did not raise before their 
states' highest courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling 6-3 against an Illinois man convicted of rape, the  
justices acknowledged their decision may boost the number of 
appeals to states' top courts. The increased burden ``may be 
unwelcome in some state courts,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling continued a decade-long trend in which the justices  
have narrowed state inmates' access to federal courts. Congress 
also limited such access in a 1996 law aimed primarily at speeding 
up executions. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor wrote that if a state allows an inmate to ask the  
state's highest court to review a claim, the prisoner cannot bypass 
that step before going to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	``State prisoners must give the state courts one full  
opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one 
complete round of the state's established appellate review 
process,'' she said. However, she added that inmates need not seek 
higher state court review if such review is not available to them. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will force inmates ``to go through an extra and  
largely meaningless step'' before appealing to federal court, said 
Edward M. Chikofsky of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers, which supported Illinois defendant Darren Boerckel's 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	States' top courts grant review to only about 3 percent of all  
criminal appeals not involving the death penalty, Chikofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boerckel's public defender, David B. Mote, said that when states  
outline what types of appeal issues they are likely to review, as 
Illinois did, inmates should be allowed to trim their state appeals 
without forfeiting their right to raise issues in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means Boerckel will get no federal court hearing on  
his challenge to 1976 convictions in the rape of an 87-year-old 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Boerckel contended his signed confession was unlawfully obtained  
by police in Montgomery County, Ill. He said he was denied adequate 
legal help and that his trial was tainted by prosecutorial 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Boerckel was convicted of rape, burglary and aggravated battery  
and sentenced to 20 to 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His first appeal, which raised seven issues, was rejected by an  
intermediate state court. Boerckel said his ensuing appeal to the 
Illinois Supreme Court raised only three of those issues because 
that court discourages litigants from raising every conceivable 
claim. The state Supreme Court refused to review his case. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Boerckel filed an appeal in federal court, raising  
issues that were included in his state appellate court case but 
were left out of his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge refused to consider the issues that were  
not raised before the Illinois Supreme Court. The 7th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals reinstated Boerckel's federal appeal last year, 
but the Supreme Court reversed that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. 
Souter and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens, Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg dissented. Writing for the three, Breyer said the decision 
``will add to the burdens of already overburdened state courts.'' 
The small number of state appeals actually granted review indicate 
that many states ``have no particular interest'' in requiring 
inmates to appeal every case, he said.

<HEADLINE> East Simmers in Hot Humid Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Temperatures soared into the 90s Monday across  
much of the East, making it too hot and too sticky too early in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be passing out soon,'' joked Mark Browne, a New York  
City firefighter who could feel the sweat pooling inside his 
insulated boots as his company dealt with a blown manhole cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Readings rose past the 90-degree mark by early afternoon from  
the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast, and all the way north to 
New England, where Portland, Maine, topped out at 95, a full 10 
degrees over the record for the date and the hottest day there 
since July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bad day for the air conditioning to be out of order at  
New Hampshire's Legislative Office Building in Concord, where the 
mercury hit 94. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part is being nice,'' said Sandy Wheeler, an  
administrative assistant in the building. ``You've got to act like 
you're refreshed. That's a job in itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrisburg, Pa., peaked at 96, tying a record for June 7 that  
had been on the books since 1925, and Newark, N.J., sweltered at 
97. New York's Central Park reached 94. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, a section of Business Interstate 40 was  
closed at Winston-Salem because the pavement buckled in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 172,000 people jammed New York City's seven beaches to get  
some relief from the August-like heat. By comparison, last Tuesday 
total attendance at all seven city beaches was 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The famous Swan Boats in Boston's Public Garden stopped running  
when the temperature hit 96 because that was too much for the 
drivers who pedal the boats. That usually doesn't happen until July 
or August. 
</P>
<P>
	And it wasn't just people who suffered in the heat.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard Cowen, owner of the Liberty Ice Coal &AMP; Oil Co. in Albany,  
said he got a call from the State University of New York at 
Cobleskill looking for ice to put in a fish hatchery because the 
water was too warm. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish couldn't have handled the chlorine in his ice, so he  
had to refer the school to a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	In White Plains, N.Y., Lorraine Zimmerman and her three young  
children were the only noontime diners at the outdoor tables set up 
by several restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go into the air conditioning but I knew they  
wouldn't have it,'' she said, gesturing toward the kids. ``But I am 
going to have a nice cold beer.''

<HEADLINE> Virgin Atlantic Unveils New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The skies over Britain are still  
friendly enough, but the planes are getting pretty patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic unveiled a new paint job making prominent use of  
the Union Jack on its jet fleet Monday, a day after rival British 
Airways -- ridiculed for the ``world images'' it put on its planes' 
tailfins two years ago -- said it would repaint the beloved British 
banner on half of its aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing the changes at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, Virgin  
boss Richard Branson revealed the new look on a Boeing 747-400 that 
featured silver metallic paint and the Union Jack on the wings and 
fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline also introduced a new corporate logo as well as a  
``twin seat'' design in business class that transforms into a 
double bed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virgin Atlantic is now Britain's flag carrier,'' Branson said.  
``We're a young, dynamic, innovative British company, and our new 
livery and corporate identity fully reflects this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new colors would give Virgin Atlantic jets ``a  
striking new look for the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways was the first to announce new colors. The  
airline announced Sunday that it was reverting to the Union Jack, 
replacing the ethnic logos that former Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher once described as ``awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement came two years after BA first introduced its  
``world images'' tail fins featuring designs ranging from Delft 
pottery to Chinese calligraphy. About half of BA's 340-strong fleet 
used those designs, but 160 aircraft -- including the airline's 
supersonic Concordes -- retained the Union Jack logo. All new 
aircraft will sport the patriotic look, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what our customers want. It is as simple as that,'' said  
British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling. ``People in Britain 
want an image which they can respond to as part of their culture.''

<HEADLINE> Belfour-Hasek Reunion in Stanley Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Before Dominik Hasek became known as the best  
goaltender in the world, he wasn't even the best on his own team. 
Ed Belfour was. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour was the starter and Hasek his backup for Chicago in  
1990-91 and '91-92. The Blackhawks had the NHL's best 
regular-season record their first year together and went to the 
Stanley Cup finals their second season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Belfour and Hasek will be back in the finals  
for the first time since then. This time, Belfour will be trying to 
lead Dallas to its first title and Hasek will be doing the same for 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The goalies insist they are friendly rivals, with Hasek adding  
that their wives are close and that their kids played together for 
several hours at this year's All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	If there was any tension during their Chicago days, both say it  
was nothing more than a healthy dose of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough relationship because he felt I was the person  
who could take his job and I felt he took my job,'' said Hasek, who 
started 25 games to Belfour's 123 over their two seasons together. 
``When we see each other off the ice now, we always say hello. I 
respect him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour smiled and laughed when asked if there was a problem  
with their 1-2 status in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see anything wrong with it,'' he said. ``Maybe he had  
a problem with it because I was the No. 1 guy. But I didn't ever 
have a problem with Dominik. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always enjoyed the challenge of competing against  
Dominik, even when it was in practice. He's a competitor and I love 
competition. I think it's going to be a great opportunity to play 
against him again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Tony Hrkac spent three months with the '92 Blackhawks  
and lived in the same building as Belfour and Hasek. He remembers 
the goalies being friends and sharing rides to the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dominik was learning a lot from Eddie and Eddie learned a lot  
from Dominik,'' said Hrkac, who also was Belfour's college teammate 
and is now his road roommate. ``They pushed each other. I think 
they're both where they're at because they were pushing each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goalies' careers have taken extremely different paths before  
crossing again this series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek escaped Belfour's shadow a few months after Chicago was  
swept from the 1992 finals by Pittsburgh. After another year as an 
apprentice, he became a starter in 1993-94 and led the NHL in save 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	With his slinky spine and an uncanny ability to stop pucks when  
he shouldn't know where they are, Hasek has had the best save 
percentage every year since. He's also won four Vezina Trophies and 
two MVPs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Hasek has led the seventh-seeded Sabres to the finals  
for the first time since 1975, he's four wins from adding a Stanley 
Cup title to his long list of accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is my only focus the last couple of days, and it will be  
my only focus for the next one or two weeks,'' said Hasek, who also 
is dealing with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour won the Vezina in '93, then lost four straight in the  
first round of the playoffs. Suddenly, he became labeled a goalie 
who couldn't carry his team to greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	A rocky life in Chicago ended in January 1997 with a trade to  
San Jose. He joined Dallas in the offseason and led the Stars to 
the best regular-season record, only to lose the Western Conference 
finals in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour's old label was reattached following that series, but  
he's coming close to dropping it. He and backup Roman Turek led 
Dallas to its first Jennings Trophy for the lowest goals against 
average and the Stars again had the NHL's top regular-season 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas reached its first finals since moving to Texas six  
seasons ago with a Game 7 victory over second-seeded Colorado in 
the Western finals. Belfour outplayed counterpart Patrick Roy 
throughout the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchock said Belfour is playing up to his  
potential because he's remained focused only on stopping pucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ed Belfour was a defensive person when he came here,''  
Hitchcock said. ``For us to get the best out of him, we needed the 
defense mechanisms dropped. And it was some wild times to get them 
to drop. But they're dropped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reputations are hard to erase. Roy alluded to it throughout the  
last round and Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff already is hinting that 
Belfour could go off. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's stayed very composed and been under control; he hasn't  
thrown any temper tantrums at all,'' Ruff said. ``We're going to 
try to get to him.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Launches Office 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft formally launched Office 2000  
today, integrating Web site design tools into the first major 
upgrade of its word-processing and spreadsheet package in more than 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Office 2000 comes in five different versions and should be  
available in stores on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade to the most popular Office 97 version, Office 2000  
Professional includes the FrontPage Web site authoring tool and 
PhotoDraw 2000 business graphics software. The suggested retail 
price is $309 for upgrades, $599 for new users. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its biggest benefits are for companies that are going to be  
doing a lot of Web authoring,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with 
Giga Information Group. ``You can create and maintain a much more 
professional Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Office 2000 has arrived too late for many companies using  
Microsoft's software in the workplace, many of which may delay 
upgrading until next year due to fears about the Year 2000 bug, 
Enderle said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 million customers worldwide use Office 97. The  
software suite accounted for about one-third of Microsoft's $14.5 
billion in revenues for the fiscal year 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Office 97 accounts for about 90 percent of the market for  
business productivity software.

<HEADLINE> Pataki, Bush Bet on Stanley Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Gov. George Pataki is willing to  
bet some of Buffalo's famous chicken wings that the Buffalo Sabres 
will beat the Dallas Stars for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki made the bet Monday with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who  
put up some of Texas barbecue and brisket against 100 of the wings 
and a dozen ``Beef on Weck'' sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef on weck is a roast beef sandwich slathered in gravy and  
horseradish on a salty roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki holds a 1-0 record over Bush after the New York Yankees  
beat the Texas Rangers in the 1996 American League Championship 
Series.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy Losing To S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The signs of South Africa's success are  
everywhere in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartons of South Africa's Ceres juices line grocery shelves  
where there used to be cans of Kenya's Treetop orange. Bartenders 
serve up South African Castle beer alongside locally produced 
Tusker. 
</P>
<P>
	Apples. Wine. Eggs. Cheese. Barbecue grills. All bearing South  
African labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, when South Africa was a commercial pariah, such  
sights were unthinkable. But since 1994, when South Africa held its 
first all-race elections and the heavy gates of apartheid sanctions 
swung open, the country has positioned itself as Africa's super 
exporter, and its goods have flooded central and east African 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the June 2 presidential elections, South Africa was  
expected to continue to be an economic force on the continent -- 
something that concerns many in Kenya, East Africa's biggest 
economy. Political and business circles have been abuzz for several 
weeks with talk of the massive trade imbalance and accusations of 
unfair barriers and tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer accept to be the dumping ground of South African  
goods,'' Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho told African leaders 
in Nairobi for a recent regional trade summit. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Kenyan businesses say they can't get their products  
into South Africa and trade officials threaten higher tariffs, 
analysts and some locals say the blame is being misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya became accustomed during apartheid to being the region's  
biggest economy, discouraging imports with heavy taxes until the 
early 1990s when it opened its doors. However, some analysts say it 
also failed to invest in its own industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Unused to competition, Kenyan products don't measure up here or  
in South Africa, which became highly developed and self-sufficient 
during apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	``All countries find reasons to protect their industries, and  
here we've failed to protect ours,'' said Peter Gachuba, a 
financial consultant with KPMG Peat Marwick in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Corruption is the main problem, Gachuba says. The Kenyan  
government has allowed people to illegally import South African 
goods and dump them on the market, he says, and Kenyan executives 
know they can buy their way around safety or quality requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in the streets say, 'There's so much stuff from South  
Africa,' but when they go to the store, that's what they buy. I 
think there is some feeling that our products aren't that good and 
you can't trust things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the competition benefits Kenya because it lifts  
quality. And the average consumer gains access to a wider range of 
goods -- at cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good because it has made us wake up,'' said Joyce Kimuhu,  
a member of a women's craft cooperative that displayed its goods 
for export at the trade summit. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's defenders note that it has invested deeply in  
Kenya, building such plants as the $45 million Castle Brewery, one 
of the biggest single foreign investments in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	But many still feel bitter about South Africa, which in 1997  
became Kenya's leading source of imports, a role once shared by 
Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common complaint is the widening trade gap: Kenya  
imports 18 times more from South Africa than it exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparable Kenyan products can't compete in South Africa, as  
it's cheaper to make goods in South Africa, which has a larger home 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Many feel South Africa exacerbates the gap by creating  
unnecessary barriers, like requiring foreign tea to be mixed with 
an equal part of local tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an indirect way of saying 'No,' '' said Phillip Biegon, a  
Kenya Tea Packers salesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffiths Memela, the South African High Commissioner to Kenya,  
has publicly denied unfair trade accusations and says Kenya hasn't 
aggressively marketed its goods. 
</P>
<P>
	South African businessmen are taking the complaints seriously,  
however, and have formed the South African Business Association of 
Kenya to boost their image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's a good sign that we're bringing out all these  
hidden problems,'' said Adam Fuller, the group's chairman.

<HEADLINE> Ben Hogan Room To Be Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAR HILLS, N.J. (AP) -- Ben Hogan's wife spent Monday touring the  
first room at the USGA Museum to be dedicated to the life and 
career of a professional golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Hogan donated the collection of more than 300 objects --  
including her late husband's famed 1-iron -- in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he would be pleased that the public can come to see his  
things,'' Mrs. Hogan, his wife of 62 years, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ben Hogan Room will open to the public on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The display includes items from Hogan's days as a young caddie  
in Fort Worth, Texas. His recovery from a near-fatal car-bus 
accident and historic championship record also are recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors can view the set of irons that Hogan used to earn the  
Masters, U.S Open and British Open titles in 1953. His medals from 
various tournaments are also on display, as is an actual locker 
from his home club, Shady Oaks Country Club in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	An area rug in the Hogan room reads: ``The prospect that there  
was going to be golf in (my day) made me feel privileged and 
extremely happy, and I couldn't wait for the sun to come up the 
next morning so that I could get out on the course again.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crews Move Plane Crash Wreckage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The wreckage of an American Airlines  
jet was carefully removed today from the riverbank where it came to 
rest and trucked to a hangar for what could be months of detailed 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	A salvage crew moved the pieces of the burned-out shell early in  
the morning, when a lull in air traffic permitted closing a runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 1420 with 145 passengers and crew aboard landed in a  
storm Tuesday night, then skidded off the end of the runway, broke 
apart and caught fire, killing Capt. Richard Buschmann and eight 
passengers. More than 80 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Four tarpulin-covered tractor-trailers carried the pieces of the  
plane from the south bank of the Arkansas River to a private hangar 
across the airport grounds, where crews began unloading them. The 
wreckage could remain in the hangar up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two appeared to carry the main parts of the fuselage  
while the third carried the tail section -- American Airlines' 
red-and-blue ``AA'' logo jutting up from the back of the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth carried a wing -- its tip stretching beyond the back  
of the tarpulin. A crane from the crash site followed behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, heavy machinery noise could be heard coming from the  
hangar, and a Central Flying Service employee said part of the 
plane's tail section was being sawed off so it could fit through 
the hangar's rear doorway. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the National Transportation Safety Board have focused  
their investigation on computers that controlled the plane's 
mechanical systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the wreckage from the crash site gives investigators  
their first chance at recovering onboard computers that could 
disclose whether the plane's spoilers, reverse thrusters and 
braking systems were functioning properly when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators consider information from the computers crucial in  
determining whether mechanical failure, human error, weather or a 
combination caused the first domestic commercial airline crash 
deaths in 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is a possible cause. What we need to do is ...  
start narrowing the scope,'' said Greg Feith, lead investigator for 
the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The computers are located in the lower part of the MD-82's  
fuselage, beneath the cockpit and inaccessible to investigators 
until the main wreckage is salvaged, Feith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out if the computer equipment that actually control  
the spoilers and other systems were capable of normal operations,'' 
Feith said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have recovered and are analyzing the plane's  
flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder and have 
interviewed witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They give us a lot of information, but they don't give us all  
the answers,'' Feith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's spoilers -- panels on top of the wings -- were supposed  
to be raised at touchdown to break the plane's lift and slow the 
aircraft. Reverse thrusters from the engines are usually engaged 
until the plane slows to a speed at which the pilot can safely 
steer it on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hospital interview Friday, First Officer Michael Origel  
told investigators that he believes the captain set the spoilers. A 
flight data recorder indicates they never popped up when the plane 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of the early investigation focused on a severe  
thunderstorm -- with wind gusts to 87 mph around the time of the 
crash -- Origel told the NTSB that the plane approached the airport 
through a break in the clouds. He said he saw the runway through 
the entire approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel, who was released Saturday from a hospital where he had  
been recovering from a broken leg, also told authorities he 
believed the jet hydroplaned on the runway. Investigators have said 
the runway was adequately grooved and that the jetliner had a firm 
grip on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at the physical evidence first and then go  
back and resolve some of the discrepancies or get clarity for some 
of the answers that he gave us to our questions,'' Feith said. 
</P>
<P>
	While crews worked to salvage the wreckage Saturday, memorial  
services were held in suburban Chicago for Buschmann, 48, and in 
Arkansas for three passengers who died in the crash -- James 
Harrison, 21, of Paragould, and Gordan McLerran, 64, and his wife, 
Joyce, 65, of Dardanelle.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Extends Offer To Coffee Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp. said shareholders representing the  
majority of coffee roaster Chock Full o'Nuts' shares have opted to 
tender their shares to Sara Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Control of such shares could give Sara Lee officials more clout  
in their hostile takeover bid of New York-based Chock Full o'Nuts, 
Jeff Kanter, a senior food analyst for Prudential Securities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly takes it one step closer,'' Kanter said.  
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday, Sara Lee said 56 percent of Chock Full o'Nuts  
shares have been tendered. 
</P>

	Officials at Sara Lee, a Chicago-based maker of food and  
consumer products, also said it has extended until June 18 its cash 
tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the New York 
company's common stock for $10.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Chock Full o'Nuts rejected a $225 million offer from  
Sara Lee, which seeks to expand its $2.8 billion-a-year coffee 
business. Sara Lee's Superior Coffee unit sells such brands as 
Superior, Douwe Egberts, Hillshire Farms, Continental, Metropolitan 
and Java Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Chock Full o'Nuts, which has annual sales of $396.4 million,  
sells its own self-named brand of coffee, as well as others 
including Cain's LaTouraine. The coffee roaster also owns a chain 
of 40 drive-through coffee outlets called Quikava. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanter said acquiring Chock Full o'Nuts was not a ``make or  
break deal'' for Sara Lee. But he said the business fit well with 
Sara Lee's existing brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good little business for Sara Lee,'' Kanter said.  
``That's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee said discussions with Chock Full o'Nuts officials were  
continuing.

<HEADLINE> Former NFL QB Joins CFL's BC Lions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Quarterback Todd Marinovich,  
a first-round pick in the 1991 NFL draft, is getting another 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the starter for the then-Los Angeles Raiders, Marinovich  
reached a one-year deal Monday with the B.C. Lions of the Canadian 
Football League, where he will sit on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Todd will be given the opportunity to be the backup,'' said  
Greg Mohns, the Lions head coach and assistant general manager. 
``It was made very plain and clear from the start to Todd that 
Damon (Allen) was our No. 1 quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marinovich, 29, hasn't played football since 1994 when he  
suffered a serious knee injury during training camp with the CFL's 
Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He hasn't dressed for a game since 1992, 
when he was with the Raiders, who drafted the 6-foot-4, 220-pound 
Marinovich 24th overall in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had the itch (to play again), and it progressively  
got stronger,'' Marinovich said Monday at a news conference in 
Vancouver. ``I decided to get back into it before it got too old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was sentenced to six months in jail after pleading  
guilty to a felony charge of cultivating marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the NFL cleared Marinovich to pursue a comeback. He  
worked out with Chicago, Seattle, New Orleans and Washington, but 
never signed an NFL contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a growing process, everybody goes through tough times and  
it makes a person stronger,'' Marinovich said. ``It has made me 
stronger, it's something I've had to overcome and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marinovich said returning to the NFL remains a goal, but a  
distant one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I'm on the one-day-at-a-time plan,'' he said.  
``We'll see down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marinovich isn't the first high-profile former NFL quarterback  
to look to the CFL to resurrect a fledgling career. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Schlichter, selected fourth overall in 1982 by the Baltimore  
Colts, joined the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1988 after being suspended 
by the NFL when it was disclosed that bookies threatened him while 
attempting to collect more than $150,000 in gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter played just eight games with Ottawa and later was  
sentenced to two years in federal prison on bank fraud charges.

<HEADLINE> Harnischfeger Seeks Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Harnischfeger Industries Inc., a manufacturer  
of mining and paper-making machinery, is seeking protection from 
its creditors in a Bankruptcy Court filing Monday and said it would 
stop paying interest on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milwaukee-based company had reported a loss last week and  
disclosed a management shakeup two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing in federal court in Delaware, where Harnischfeger is  
incorporated, was under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 
which enables a company to continue operating while it attempts to 
reorganize its finances under the court's supervision. The filing 
covers Harnischfeger and its U.S.-based operating subsidiaries, Joy 
Mining Machinery, P&AMP;H Mining Equipment and Beloit Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Monday that it will continue cost-cutting, but  
spokesman David Brukardt would not say if those initiatives 
includes eliminating more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, in its quarterly financial report, Harnischfeger  
said it had exceeded its goal of reducing 3,100 positions from 
early 1998 to the end of 1999, cutting more than 3,400 by the end 
of the second quarter ended April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnischfeger did not trade until the final half hour of  
Monday's session on the New York Stock Exchange, then plunged 55.6 
percent in a rising market by dropping $1.25 to close at $1 a share 
in heavy trading. The NYSE said it was reviewing the issue to see 
if the company still qualifies for listing. 
</P>
<P>
	John Nils Hanson, the company's new chief executive officer,  
said the company had been hurt by economic problems around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnischfeger, which had a loss of $90.7 million in the six  
months ended April 30, has debts of approximately $1.3 billion. In 
its announcement Monday, Harnischfeger said it would stop interest 
payments on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	In disclosing the filing, Harnischfeger said it has received  
commitments for $750 million in financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the company's view, staying out of Chapter 11, given the  
current conditions affecting the company and its highly leveraged 
capital structure, could well have led to a far worse situation and 
potentially a greater loss of value for creditors as well as equity 
holders,'' said Robert B. Hoffman, the company's new chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this action will give us the ability to preserve  
the value of the company and begin the rebuilding process for the 
benefit of all of our constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanson, who had been serving as the company's president, chief  
operating officer and vice chairman, was named chief executive 
officer two weeks ago when Jeffrey T. Grade resigned. Hoffman, who 
had been an independent outside director, replaced Grade as 
chairman. Francis M. Corby, Jr. also resigned as executive vice 
president, finance and administration and chief financial officer 
at that time.

<HEADLINE> Indian Trust Documents Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A court-appointed investigator found the  
government still handles American Indian trust records carelessly 
more than three months after two Cabinet officials were held in 
contempt of court over them. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report issued Monday, the official said trust documents are  
stored in ``patently substandard conditions'' at several Bureau of 
Indian Affairs offices he inspected recently. At Anadarko, Okla., 
records were kept in wooden sheds. Files were spilled loosely 
around and stuffed in unmarked boxes strewn among truck tires, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Balaran was appointed a special master in a lawsuit against  
the government after U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth found 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin in contempt for delaying the turnover of trust records. The 
judge said he had ``never seen more egregious misconduct'' by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges the government has been mishandling the  
accounts for decades. They include 300,000 accounts held by 
individual Indians, subjects of the lawsuit, and an additional 
1,600 tribal accounts worth $2.5 billion. The money includes lease 
revenue, royalties and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Balaran recommended the judge order safeguarding of the  
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The absence of an order affirmatively mandating the  
preservation of Indian trust records risks the possibility that the 
deficiencies ... will continue unchecked and that the opportunity 
for a meaningful accounting will be forever lost,'' Balaran wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau of Indian Affairs officials say trust records are kept in  
108 offices, and it takes time to ensure that all have proper 
storage. Balaran visited a dozen offices in April and said most 
were ``models of efficiency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big job,'' said BIA spokesman Rex Hackler. ``I think  
we're doing very well in most places. There's always a way to do 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department released a memorandum dated June 2 that  
ordered all its agencies to ensure preservation of Indian fund 
records they might hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Records have been lost or ruined over the years, and ownership  
of reservation property has been divided so often through 
inheritances that only a few cents a year passes through many of 
the accounts, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs claim the government could be liable  
for billions of dollars in underpayments to account holders. While 
making no estimates, Bureau of Indian Affairs officials have 
acknowledged that the liability could be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau is to start using a new computer system this month  
for handling the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is to be tried in two phases, with the first trial  
set to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the judge declined a request by government attorneys  
to appoint a mediator in the case, because lawyers for the 
plaintiffs said they prefer a trial.

<HEADLINE> Disney May Buy All of Infoseek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- In moves aimed at expanding its Internet  
presence, The Walt Disney Co. is negotiating to buy the remaining 
portion of Infoseek Corp. it doesn't already own and will take a 
stake in another company dedicated to nurturing Internet startups. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney is seeking to buy the 57 percent of Infoseek it did not  
acquire last year when it took a minority stake in the Sunnyvale, 
Calif.-based Internet portal company, the two companies announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move, Disney announced in a news release that it will  
take a ``significant'' stake in a venture called eCompanies that 
will serve as an incubator for Internet startups. Details were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	ECompanies is being formed by Jake Winebaum, who resigned as  
chairman of Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group, and Sky Dayton, 
chairman of the Internet service provider Earthlink. 
</P>
<P>
	After Disney bought a share of Infoseek, the two companies last  
year launched the Go Network, an Internet portal offering 
personalized news, entertainment, Internet search capabilities and 
electronic commerce services. Go Network competes with Yahoo!, 
Excite and other major Web portals. 
</P>
<P>
	In news releases, Disney and Infoseek stressed that no deal has  
been reached in talks to complete the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the new operation would combine Infoseek and  
Disney's online businesses under a single roof. The deal would 
include creation of a special class of Disney common stock that 
would track the online ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Such as deal would give Disney more leverage in establishing its  
brand in the online world, said Jack Staff, an analyst at Zona 
Research. Disney already operates some of the Internet's most 
popular sites, including Disney.com and ESPN.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The company may face a challenge, however, in merging the  
audience of Disney fans with other Internet users who want to surf 
the Web but aren't interested in Disney films and memorabilia, 
Staff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merging the cultures of Disney and Infoseek also could be a  
challenge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big difference in the corporate culture of the  
people who drive Mickey and the people who drive major Web 
portals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winebaum helped oversee a variety of Disney Internet ventures,  
including Disney.com, ESPN.com, ABC.com and Go Network. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is only about 20 percent invented,'' Winebaum  
said. ``We want eCompanies to play a role in the creation of a 
small piece of the remaining 80 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winebaum will be replaced by Steve Wadsworth, the former senior  
vice president and chief financial officer for Buena Vista Internet 
Group. Wadsworth joined Disney Online at its inception in September 
1995 and helped to launch the division.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Victim Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A year after their father was chained to a truck  
and dragged to his death in a racist attack, James Byrd Jr.'s 
children still get letters and calls of support from around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them are white people saying that they're sorry,''  
said Jamie Byrd, the victim's 17-year-old daughter. ``It's like 
they want us to know it's not the entire white race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Austin, two dozen people, including black leaders from around  
Texas, held a rally today at the Texas Capitol to mark the first 
anniversary of the June 7, 1998, killing and call for passage of a 
tougher hate crime law. Byrd, who was black, died when he was 
dragged about three miles along a country road outside of Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Three white suspects were accused in the slaying.  
</P>
<P>
	White supremacist John William King, 24, was convicted of murder  
earlier this year and condemned to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection is scheduled to begin Aug. 31 in the trial of a  
second defendant, Lawrence Russell Brewer. Defendant Shawn Allen 
Berry, 24, is to be tried later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Renee Mullins, 28, the oldest of Byrd's three children, said the  
murder ``gets harder and harder to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's supposed to get easier and easier. But you have to go on  
living,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she tries not to let the anger get the best of her.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't let the people who did this take another member of the  
family,'' she told The Dallas Morning News. ``If I chose to hate, 
I'd get sick. I know I would hate them that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the rally in Austin, protesters were critical of Gov. George  
W. Bush for not backing a bill named for Byrd that would have 
toughened the state's hate-crimes law. Bush took no position on the 
bill, which died in the state Senate. Speakers implored him to call 
a special session of the Legislature to revive the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had he not received his precious tax break, Bush would have  
called a special session -- why not for hate crimes?'' said Kyev 
Tatum, an Austin minister who helped organize the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, responded Texas already has a  
good hate crimes law, adding, ``The individual convicted of the 
terrible, barbaric murder of James Byrd Jr. received the ultimate 
penalty: death.''

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Two dozen protesters Monday marked the  
one-year anniversary of the dragging death of a black man by 
praying at the Capitol and demanding a special session of the 
Legislature to enact a tougher law against hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, which would have toughened  
Texas' hate-crimes law, died in the state Senate earlier this year. 
The demonstrators were particularly critical of Gov. George W. Bush 
for not taking a position on the bill. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Airstrikes Will Intensify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Allied air forces will step up attacks on  
Yugoslavia until the stalled peace plan is transformed into an 
actual Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo, Pentagon officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's standoff with Yugoslavia over details of a troop pullout  
has put the Pentagon in an awkward position of accelerating a 
bombing campaign as it rushes to prepare for peace. Bombing was 
scaled back over the weekend to reflect steps toward peace, but the 
airstrikes escalated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see an intensification of the campaign today, tomorrow  
and in the future,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. He said 
NATO planes carried out 93 strike missions Sunday, and plans called 
for doubling or tripling that number over the next few days. He 
would not discuss bomb targets. Sunday's strikes were almost 
exclusively against Serb army forces in southwestern Kosovo, where 
they were in fierce battles with the separatist Kosovo Liberation 
Army, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is on our side. Time is against them,'' Bacon said.  
``It's their military structure that is being struck, and I assume 
they will see the wisdom of meeting the (NATO) conditions and 
getting their troops out of harm's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serb air defenses continued to fire at NATO planes, Bacon said,  
but with less regularity. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart reiterated that  
NATO will not suspend its bombing until the Serbs begin a 
verifiable troop pullout. Bacon said NATO saw no sign of a 
withdrawal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was in Bonn, Germany, for  
a meeting with Russian and allied foreign ministers. They broke up 
with all but Moscow agreeing to tough peace terms for Kosovo laid 
out in a draft U.N. Security Council resolution. The Russians 
opposed making NATO the core of a Kosovo peacekeeping force, and it 
insisted on an early NATO bombing pause. The Bonn talks are to 
resume Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke for about 15 minutes each with Russian President  
Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said they 
would instruct their foreign ministers to work quickly to resolve 
the remaining problems, National Security Council spokesman David 
Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dual stalemates on the U.N. Security Council  
resolution and details of withdrawing Serb troops from Kosovo, 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic offered assurances relayed to 
the foreign ministers meeting in Bonn that he intends to carry out 
the agreement he accepted last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, a critic of the NATO military  
campaign, said in a House speech that ``NATO is risking re-igniting 
a wider war by simultaneously insisting on troop withdrawals and 
continuing bombing attacks on the troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Either NATO has a peace plan in its hand, or it doesn't. If it  
does, then it should stop the bombing instead of this approach of 
putting one foot on the accelerator of war and the other on the 
brake of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preparations for positioning a contingent of 2,000 Marines in  
Macedonia to be the vanguard of U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo hit a 
snag when the Greek government blocked the Marines from landing at 
an Aegean port. The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, aboard three 
Navy ships, remained Monday just outside Greece's territorial 
waters, awaiting a go-ahead from Athens, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the problem is minor and will not stop the Marines  
from fulfilling their peacekeeping role. He said NATO ally Greece 
has given assurances that the Marines will be allowed to land soon. 
``We don't believe there will be any problem meeting the 
timelines,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines are to be the lead element of a 7,000-strong U.S.  
peacekeeping contingent. Bacon said some details of U.S. planning 
are yet to be settled, but it is possible that some soldiers from 
Task Force Hawk, the Army group with Apache helicopters in Tirana, 
Albania, could join the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon would not speculate on reasons for the Yugoslavs' balking  
at beginning their troop withdrawal. But he said Serb forces were 
engaged Monday in heavy fighting with KLA soldiers in southwestern 
Kosovo near Mount Pastrik and near the town of Junik, seven miles 
from the Albanian border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs are still trying to drive the KLA out of Kosovo, ``but  
they appear to be losing,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska, urged the Senate to tread carefully with 
Kosovo-related amendments ``at this tense moment in the peace 
negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was debating a bill to provide funds for the Pentagon  
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.

	Milosevic Says He'll Carry Out Deal  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
insisted today that he still plans to carry out the peace agreement 
on Kosovo despite a breakdown in talks yesterday. A State 
Department spokesman says Milosevic gave assurances to the 
president of Finland by telephone and the Finnish leader has 
relayed it to Secretary of State Albright and other foreign 
ministers. Officials said the Finnish leader told Milosevic that 
NATO allies don't want to allow any gap between the time Serb

	NATO Attacks Intensify  
</P>
<P>
	TABANOVCE, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO warplanes struck targets in  
Kosovo today in intensified airstrikes against Yugoslavia, after 
talks on implementing a Kosovo peace plan collapsed and left the 
entire settlement in question. NATO said its planes hit four Serb 
tanks, 20 artillery pieces and 17 armored personnel carriers in 
attacks over the previous 24 hours. Two waves of NATO jets attacked 
the Podujevo area, 20 miles north of the Kosovo capital of 
Pristina, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported. Tanjug said 
alliance aircraft launched more than 100 attacks on targets 
throughout Kosovo over the last 24 hours.

	Court Won't Stop Canyon Flights

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court turned away an argument  
today by environmental groups hoping to end sightseeing flights 
over the Grand Canyon. The groups said the government has failed to 
meet the legally required deadlines for reducing such aircraft 
noise. The Federal Aviation Administration in 1996 issued a rule 
that created new flight-free zones, limited the hours flights could 
operate and limited the number of planes that could be used. But 
the environment groups said the government was acting too slowly to 
enforce the rules.

	Congress To Get New Security Package

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will send Congress

year's spending on construction to improve security at overseas 
U.S. diplomatic missions. But Retired Adm. William Crowe, who 
headed State Department panels that studied embassy security, and 
some members of Congress denounced the funding, which is at $3 
billion over the next five years, as woefully inadequate. Bomb 
blasts at embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 
last year prompted the systemwide survey of security facilities at 
missions abroad.

banned foods. More nations, from Malaysia to the United States, 
banned meat and dairy products from Belgium and the entire 
15-nation European Union. Suspects Lucien and Jan Verkest, who run 
an animal feed-fat production company suspected of causing the 
cancer-causing dioxin pollution, were freed because of lack of 
evidence. Sales of Belgian poultry, eggs, fatty beef and pork have 
already been banned.

<HEADLINE>  British, Dutch Steel Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Steel PLC and Dutch metals producer  
Koninklijke Hoogovens NV announced today they plan to merge in a 
$6.5 billion deal that will create the world's third largest steel 
maker and Europe's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The British company, which has sales nearly double those of  
Hoogovens, is to take a 62 percent share in the new group, which 
would have sales worth $14.9 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel shareholders will also get a cash payment of 56  
cents per existing share from the new company upon completion of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by regulators and by the companies'  
shareholders. If approved, shareholders of both companies will 
receive stock in the new company, initially to be called BSKH. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of BSKH is to be chaired by Sir Brian Moffat of  
British Steel, while the role of chief executive will rotate 
between Hoogovens and British Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in British Steel have rallied in recent days in  
expectation of the bid announcement. But the company's stock fell 6 
percent in early trading today. In Amsterdam, Hoogovens' share 
price was up 1.3 percent from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger marks a major turning point in the life of  
one of Britain's best-known businesses. British Steel was once 
symbolic of the country's uncompetitive industries and the strained 
relations between its managers and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Privatized in 1988, British Steel now employs fewer than 40,000  
people in Britain, compared to 250,000 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say British Steel's decision to merge was prompted  
partly by a downturn in demand caused the lingering financial 
crisis in Asia. Steel makers have high fixed costs, and even a 
slight reduction in sales can threaten profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, analysts say the British pound's persistent  
strength against the euro influenced the move. The strong pound 
makes British-made steel more expensive than competitors' steel 
denominated in euros. The merger would let British Steel shift some 
of its production costs away from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does mean that we have a manufacturing platform in  
Europe,'' British Steel chief executive John Bryant told the 
British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview. ``For our 
customers ... who increasingly look to be served on an 
international basis, ... we've got that platform to provide them 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falling prices, cheap imports and overcapacity have prompted  
Europe's steel makers to embark on a spate of mergers in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Koninklijke Hoogovens' net profit fell 17 percent in 1998 to  
$196.7 million, due largely to lower steel prices and increased 
competition from companies in Asia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel posted a loss of $130.6 million for the year  
ending April 3, 1999, compared to a net profit of $364.5 million in 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel and Hoogovens said they expect cost savings in  
central overhead, purchasing and logistics and that they predict 
savings of $300 million a year by the third year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, whose name would change after the deal is  
completed, will be headquartered in London and will seek listings 
on the London, Amsterdam and New York Stock Exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Ban Upheld on Olympic Swimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic gold medalist Michelle  
Smith de Bruin lost her appeal today to lift her four-year drug 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed the case by the  
Irish swimmer, who was banned by the sport's governing body amid 
accusations she tampered with a urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
	The international swimming federation (FINA) suspended Smith on  
Aug. 6, 1998, after finding her guilty of manipulating the 
out-of-competition drug test. FINA said the samples were 
contaminated by a large amount of alcohol, which could mask the 
presence of performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member CAS panel rejected Smith's defense that the  
samples were not hers or that a third party was responsible. The 
panel also dismissed Smith's contention that the burden of proof 
was upon FINA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts of the case and the evidence before them,  
the arbitrators were of the opinion that FINA had convinced them 
that (Smith) was the only person who had the motive and opportunity 
to manipulate the sample,'' the CAS statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Smith's lawyer, Peter  
Lennon. Calls to his Dublin office went unanswered and his mobile 
phone was switched off. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who emerged from relative obscurity to win three gold  
medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, submitted to a random drug 
test at her home in Kilkenny, Ireland, on Jan. 10, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA later reported that the sample was contaminated with large  
amounts of alcohol, apparently whiskey. There was so much liquor 
that it would have killed a person had it been a legitimate sample. 
Analysis of the backup sample at the IOC accredited laboratory in 
Barcelona confirmed the finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith denied any wrongdoing and appealed the ban, which  
disqualifies her from the 2000 Olympics and 2001 World 
Championships. She appeared at a CAS hearing in Lausanne on May 3-4 
to argue her case. Her lawyer, Peter Lennon, maintained there were 
major flaws in the testing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's spectacular results in Atlanta led to claims that she  
used performance enhancing drugs, a charge she repeatedly denied. 
She said she had been tested more often than her rivals and each 
time the result was negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is coached by her husband Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus  
thrower and shot putter who was banned for four years after testing 
positive for high testosterone levels.

<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An arbitration panel today upheld  
the four-year drug-related ban imposed on triple Olypmic gold

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Red Violin' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The search for perfection is a recurring theme in ``The Red  
Violin,'' and it is not extravagant to say that this remarkable 
movie comes close to achieving that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a film that touches all of the senses -- eyes, ears, mind  
and heart -- with the blending of evocative storytelling and 
symphonic music that is a rare treat in this summer of the 
big-budget blitzkrieg of special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Violin'' is clearly a labor of love and a passion for  
all involved in making this film for an astonishingly low $9 
million. The Canadian-Italian co-production takes viewers on a 
journey across five countries and three centuries as it tells the 
imagined story of a very special violin as it transforms the lives 
of its owners. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, ``The Red Violin'' feels like five movies in five  
languages. But the clever plotting of the story and the mystery 
that is solved only in the final frames bring all of them together 
in a satisfying and surprising climax. Subtitles for all but the 
English-language sections keep the authenticity of each locale. 
</P>
<P>
	The only ``stars'' likely to be recognized by American audiences  
are Samuel L. Jackson as a violin expert who becomes enamored of 
the legendary instrument and Greta Scacchi as the romance writer 
and muse to an unconventional violinist (Jason Flemyng) in 
19th-century England. But all of the performances are expert. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, written by Canadian director Francois Girard and Don  
McKellar, begins in 17th-century Italy where a noted violin maker, 
Nicolo Bussotti (Carlo Cecchi), creates his masterpiece, a perfect 
violin intended as a gift for his unborn son. But the future of the 
baby and of Bussotti's beautiful wife (Irene Grazioli) are shadowed 
by tragedy predicted by a fortuneteller (Anita Laurenzi) whose 
readings of tarot cards are a unifying thread of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	With the death of Bussotti's dream, the Red Violin, so named for  
its unique varnish color, begins its journey across continents, 
showing up first in Vienna at a monastery where monks train orphan 
boys as violinists. There, it is assigned to an angelic 6-year-old 
prodigy, Kaspar Weiss, portrayed by real-life violin prodigy, 
Christoph Koncz. The small boy turns out to be a genius and is 
adopted by a French music master, providing another short 
film-within-a-film. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the violin falls into the hands of Gypsies who take  
it to England where it inspires the virile virtuoso Frederick Pope 
(Flemyng). It then makes its way to Shanghai and becomes a 
political hot potato in China's cultural evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Each story allows for violin solos, performed by acclaimed  
musician Joshua Bell. The London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted 
by Esa-Pekka Salonen, plays John Corigliano's haunting score for 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The violin's ultimate arrival at a prestigious auction house in  
present-day Montreal is telegraphed throughout the film as we see a 
high-stakes auction in repeated flashbacks. In yet another subplot, 
Jackson, in a virtuoso performance of his own, is the violin expert 
brought in to authenticate the Red Violin. When he concludes that 
he has found perfection and unravels the violin's shocking mystery 
through use of computers and DNA testing, he faces an ethical 
crisis that provides the film's grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Girard first drew attention last year with his ``Thirty-Two  
Short Films About Glenn Gould.'' His early background was in 
filming architecture, dance and music, which explains the exquisite 
look and sound of this movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Production designer Francois Seguin, photography director Alain  
Dostie and costume designer Renee April have crafted scenes that 
are vivid paintings of each era. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Violin'' was produced by Niv Fichman and is being  
released by New Line International Releasing, Channel Four films 
and Telefilm Canada. Released without a rating, this movie has 
brief nudity, a whimsical sex scene and little violence. A bit too 
sophisticated for young children. Running time: 126 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Letter for Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After acknowledging concerns about the slow  
start of Al Gore's campaign, President Clinton lent a hand by 
signing a fund-raising letter mailed to 750,000 Democrats by the 
vice president's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's letter promoting Gore as his successor includes a  
swipe at unidentified ``powerful forces'' -- a clear reference to 
congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They continue to resist change -- trying, over and over again,  
to return our country to the policies that have failed,'' Clinton 
wrote. ``They struggled against our economic plan. They shut the 
government down. And they tried to poison our country with 
partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter is dated May 18 -- five days after The New York Times  
quoted the president as expressing concern about the start of 
Gore's presidential campaign but declaring it ``in a lot better 
shape now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he will formally endorse Gore once the vice  
president officially declares his candidacy. He is wading into an 
intraparty fight, since former Sen. Bill Bradley also is seeking 
the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the fund-raising  
letter was just one indication of Clinton's willingness to help his 
vice president succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has said many times that he is going to do  
everything he can to be helpful to the campaign,'' Salazar said. 
``We very much appreciate what he's doing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the two-page letter, Clinton praises Gore's record on the  
economy, education and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done my best to serve our country and build our bridge  
to the 21st century,'' Clinton wrote. ``When I think of Al Gore 
leading our nation, it gives me confidence that our progress can 
continue. ... I hope my strongest supporters will be in the 
vanguard of his efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-month period ending March 31, the last date for  
which figures are available, Gore led all presidential hopefuls by 
raising $8.9 million. Second was Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who 
raised $7.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Heist Gets Attorney 8 Year Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- An attorney convicted of laundering money  
stolen from an armored car company was sentenced Monday to eight 
years in prison and ordered to pay more than $1.1 million in 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in January found Jeffrey Guller, 56, guilty of  
money laundering and conspiracy to launder money for his role in 
the $17 million Loomis, Fargo &AMP; Co. heist. 
</P>
<P>
	Guller was convicted of helping his onetime client, Steven  
Chambers, launder the stolen money so Chambers could buy a $635,000 
house, knowing the money was obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers, one of two ringleaders in the robbery scheme, was  
represented by Guller in closing the sale of the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Guller was the only one of 21 defendants to go on trial. All of  
the others pleaded guilty. Chambers was sentenced in April to 11 
years and three months in prison and ordered to pay more than $3.8 
million in restitution.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Extends Offer To Coffee Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Shareholders representing the majority of coffee  
roaster Chock Full o'Nuts' shares have opted to tender their shares 
to Sara Lee, the food and consumer products maker said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Control of such shares could give Sara Lee officials more clout  
in their hostile takeover bid of New York-based Chock Full o'Nuts, 
said Jeff Kanter, a senior food analyst for Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly takes it one step closer,'' Kanter said.  
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday, Sara Lee said 56 percent of Chock Full o'Nuts  
shares have been tendered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based Sara Lee also said it has extended until June  
18 its cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the 
New York company's common stock for $10.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Chock Full o'Nuts rejected a $225 million offer from  
Sara Lee, which seeks to expand its $2.8 billion-a-year coffee 
business. Sara Lee's Superior Coffee unit sells such brands as 
Superior, Douwe Egberts, Hillshire Farms, Continental, Metropolitan 
and Java Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Chock Full o'Nuts, which has annual sales of $396.4 million,  
sells its own self-named brand of coffee, as well as others 
including Cain's LaTouraine. The coffee roaster also owns a chain 
of 40 drive-through coffee outlets called Quikava. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanter said acquiring Chock Full o'Nuts was not a ``make or  
break deal'' for Sara Lee. But he said the business fit well with 
Sara Lee's existing brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good little business for Sara Lee,'' Kanter said.  
``That's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee said discussions with Chock Full o'Nuts officials were  
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Chock Full o'Nuts rose 25 cents to $10.75 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Sara Lee slipped 6 1/4 cents 
to $24.56 1/4, also on the NYSE.

later this week. The dollar rose against the yen.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Leads AL All-Star Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. lead AL players in voting for  
next month's All-Star game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey leads outfielders with 473,436 votes, followed by Manny  
Ramirez (217,751) and Kenny Lofton (195,350) of the Cleveland 
Indians. Juan Gonzalez of Texas, the AL MVP, is fourth at 143,461. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey has started every All-Star game in the 1990s. He was the  
AL's leading vote-getter in 1991 and 1993 and led all players in 
1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Indians lead their positions: first baseman Jim Thome  
(128,163) and second baseman Roberto Alomar (367,655). 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an injury-plagued season, Baltimore's Cal Ripken leads  
at third base (174,202) and is on track for his 17th consecutive 
All-Star start. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest race is at shortstop, where Derek Jeter of the World  
Series champion New York Yankees (154,051) leads Boston's Nomar 
Garciaparra (147,002), Seattle's Alex Rodriguez (94,214) and 
Cleveland's Omar Vizquel (86,046). 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Rodriguez of Texas (317,471) leads at catcher, and Jose  
Canseco of Tampa Bay (248,343), who began the day with a major 
league-leading 21 homers, topped designated hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game is scheduled for July 13 at Boston's Fenway  
Park. Starters will be announced the week of July 5. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Waylon Jennings Chases Tour Buses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Weary of the busloads of tourists that  
stop in his driveway, Waylon Jennings decided to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings and fellow country singer Andy Griggs took a break from  
songwriting on Saturday to chase tour buses and snap photographs of 
fans, Griggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings ``can get kind of irritated at the tour buses that stop  
at the foot of his driveway,'' Griggs said. ``The more mad he got, 
the more I egged him on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with disposable cameras, Jennings and Griggs spent nearly  
two hours in Jennings' Cadillac, ambushing tour buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Many tourists ``just sat there with their mouths wide open in  
disbelief,'' Griggs said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	After the adventure, the pair returned to Jennings' home and  
finished writing their song.

<HEADLINE> Boles Returns As Marlins Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The pitch appeared to be six inches outside.  
Florida Marlins manager John Boles, recovering at home from neck 
and back ailments, watched on TV as one of his players was called 
out on strikes with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I was healthy then, when I lifted up the TV and threw  
it out the window,'' Boles joked. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing 13 games in two stints, Boles returned to work  
Monday -- just in time for a rainout. The Marlins' game against the 
Baltimore Orioles was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles was sidelined for two days following emergency back  
surgery, came back to work -- perhaps too soon -- and sprained his 
neck, which sent him home for another 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than a little stiffness, Boles said he feels fine now, and  
he returns to a team playing its best baseball of the season. The 
Marlins have scored 44 runs during a five-game winning streak that 
included a three-game weekend sweep at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the best medicine a person could get, watching the team  
scoring 10 runs a game in Tampa,'' Boles said. ``It was fun to 
watch. I feel like a new person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fredi Gonzalez went 6-7 as interim manager.

<HEADLINE> Stem Cells May Restore Neurons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Laboratory studies with mice suggest that  
neural stem cells, a type of cell that can mature into any type of 
brain tissue, may eventually be used to correct damage caused by 
stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the Proceedings of the National  
Academy of Sciences, researchers report that injections of the 
neural stem cells were able to restore normal function to lab mice 
that had been born without a key brain protein. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Evan Y. Snyder of Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical  
School in Boston said the laboratory study shows that the neural 
stem cells will convert themselves into whatever type of cell the 
ailing brain needs, restoring functions that have been lost to 
disease, injury or birth defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The neural stem cell has the ability to become a whole range  
of cell types in the brain,'' said Snyder, lead author of the 
study. ``The neural stem cell can accommodate all different regions 
of the brain and insert itself appropriately into the fabric of the 
brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder cautioned that it will take at least another five years  
of study before neural stem cell transplants can be tried in 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach, director of the National Institute of  
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes 
of Health, said in a statement that Snyder's study shows that 
neural stem cells are capable of moving to all parts of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stem cells that can develop into a variety of different types  
of nerve cells and glial cells (a type of brain tissue) would be 
extremely valuable in the therapy of acute and chronic neurological 
disorders,'' Fischbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neural stem cells are found in all parts of the brain in all  
stages of development. They are capable of converting to neurons, 
glial cells and other types of cells in the central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said his team is researching using a neural stem cell  
culture that was developed 13 years ago from cells removed from the 
brain of a newborn mouse. He said the same cell line can be used in 
all types of mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Proceedings used a strain of mice called  
``shiverer.'' This breed has a genetic flaw that prevents its body 
from making a protein that is needed to form myelin, the tissue 
that insulates nerve fibers. 
</P>
<P>
	A shiverer mouse develops tremors within a three weeks of age  
and goes on to develop other symptoms similar those seen in human 
patients with multiple sclerosis. MS is a crippling and sometimes 
fatal disease caused by the progressive loss of the myelin covering 
of nerve fibers in the brain and the spine. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said his team injected the mouse neural stem cells into  
the brains of newborn shiverer mice. A control group of mice did 
not receive the cells. He said the injected stem cells apparently 
detected the absent gene in the shiverer mice and converted into 
oligodendrocytes, which are brain cells that produce myelin. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the shiverer mice that received the stem cells, 60 percent  
appeared to behave like normal mice, while the untreated shiverer 
mice showed severe symptoms of their inherited disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination of the animal's brains, said Snyder, showed that  
a much higher percentage than normal of the injected stem cells 
converted into oligodendrocytes, which then made the missing 
myelin. The brains of some of the tested mice even appeared to have 
normal myelin tissue covering nerve fibers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said earlier studies in mice showed that the stem cells  
also selectively converted into neurons to replace those that were 
missing or removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown that these cells will migrate to wherever in the  
brain they are needed,'' he said. ``If there are missing neurons, 
these cells will convert into new neurons. It is possible that 
these stem cells will replace any damaged or missing cells in the 
brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said this means that transplanting human neural stem  
cells could become part of the therapy for Alzheimer's, strokes, 
multiple sclerosis and an entire group of brain birth defects. The 
researcher, however, said stem cell transplantation is not a 
``silver bullet'' that by itself will cure those disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brain is very complex, and this means ... repairing the  
brain is not going to be simple,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder noted that all of the studies so far have been done on  
newborn mice. He said his team is turning next to conducting tests 
in mature mice to see if what works in infant rodents will also 
work in adults.

<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The NCAA patted itself on the back Monday for  
the caliber of teams in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the seeding prevailed and the best eight teams got to  
Omaha. Obviously, that was the objective of the committee,'' said 
Dick Rockwell, chairman of the NCAA baseball committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins Friday at Rosenblatt Stadium with No.  
5-seeded Alabama (51-14) playing No. 4 Oklahoma State (46-19). In 
the late game, top-seeded Miami (46-13) will play No. 8 Rice 
(58-13). 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2-seeded Florida State (53-12) plays No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M (52-16)  
Saturday. The late game has No. 3-seeded Cal State-Fullerton 
(49-12) against No. 6 Stanford (48-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Oklahoma State, which was seeded second in the  
Wichita, Kan., regional, the teams that advanced to the CWS were 
the top seeds in their regionals. The Cowboys beat top-seeded 
Baylor in last weekend's super regional. 
</P>
<P>
	When the tournament brackets were announced last month, the  
committee also seeded the top eight teams nationally. Those 
rankings were used to make up the assignments for Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell said he was surprised there weren't more upsets as the  
tournament progressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this indicates the criteria used by the committee --  
the RPI and so on -- it reinforces the fact this is a real good 
system,'' said Rockwell, athletic director at LeMoyne College in 
Syracuse, N.Y. ``If we can continue to build on it, it will be good 
for college baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from having two schools from the Big 12 -- Texas A&AMP;M and  
Oklahoma State -- the committee also limited the number of 
representatives from each conference to one school. In recent 
years, the Southeastern Conference had as many as four teams in 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in other parts of the country, they don't think so, but  
I think these pairings are good for college baseball,'' Rockwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, which advanced to Omaha for the sixth time in Jim Morris'  
six seasons as coach, was seeded No. 1 for the entire 64-team 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he had a favorite, Rockwell said:  
</P>
<P>
	``We seeded Miami No. 1, and to go against that would not be in  
the best interest of anyone,'' Rockwell said. ``But I do think 
this: The way the brackets are fixed, if you're on top of your game 
and playing your best baseball, you'll come out on top.''

	BOSTON (AP) -- A 19-year-old man drunkenly killed a woman with  
his car and laughed as he drove off, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	James Abramofsky Jr. pleaded innocent to vehicular homicide,  
operating under the influence of alcohol and leaving the scene of a 
deadly accident. He was ordered held on $250,000 bail.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Benny Agbayani hit two solo home runs, Mike  
Piazza homered for the second straight day and the New York Mets 
beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-2 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Orel Hershiser (5-5) earned his 195th career victory, giving the  
Mets their second win in a row following an eight-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Woodward, making his major league debut, drove in both  
runs for the Blue Jays. Toronto opened a six-game interleague trip 
after a 3-6 homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 21,457 was below the Mets' home average of 26,723.  
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani and Roger Cedeno, who had three hits and stole his  
major league-leading 31st base, each continued to be productive in 
place of slumping outfielders Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rey Ordonez tripled and added a two-out, two-run single off  
Woodward's glove at shortstop in the seventh. That key hit came 
after a double steal by former Toronto star John Olerud and Piazza 
-- the first stolen base for each this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani, quickly becoming a fan favorite at Shea Stadium, hit a  
leadoff home run in the fourth that put the Mets ahead to stay at 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani connected in the next inning, too, giving him eight  
homers in only 63 at-bats this season. The 27-year-old rookie is 
batting .429. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, whose homer off Roger Clemens spurred the Mets to a 7-2  
win at Yankee Stadium on Sunday night, hit his 11th home run to 
start the fifth against Roy Halladay (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno singled leading off the first and stole second. Edgardo  
Alfonzo hit an RBI double and later scored on Piazza's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno later singled and tripled, raising his average to .324.  
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser pitched six innings and gave up six hits, improving to  
6-2 against Toronto. He helped himself in other ways, hitting a 
sacrifice fly and also flawlessly fielding five groundballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Halladay allowed 11 hits in five innings. He made his first  
start since May 25 and pitched in place of Chris Carpenter, 
temporarily out because of inflammation in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward was batting .322 at Triple-A Syracuse when he joined  
the Blue Jays before the game. He had a sacrifice fly in his first 
plate appearance and an RBI single in his first official at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 8-2, the Blue Jays loaded the bases with no outs in the  
eighth against Turk Wendell. But Jacob Brumfield and Woodward 
struck out and pinch-hitter Willie Greene grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Piazza and Toronto's Tony Fernandez each extended their  
hitting streaks to 12 games. ... Cedeno was caught stealing for the 
fifth time in the fourth. ... The Mets are 5-2 against Toronto in 
interleague play. ... Carpenter visited Dr. James Andrews in 
Birmingham, Ala., on Monday and was found to be OK. Manager Jim 
Fregosi said Carpenter may be able to pitch this weekend at 
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Trial Moved Back 2 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The trial of former Housing Secretary Henry  
Cisneros was postponed for two months Monday because of the 
presiding judge's concern over the difficulty of convening a pool 
of 300 potential jurors during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was indicted in December 1997 on charges he lied to the  
FBI about $250,000 in payments he made to a former mistress after 
their affair ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally scheduled for July 6, the trial now is to begin in  
mid-September. At a hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Sporkin set the start of jury selection for Sept. 7, with the trial 
expected to begin a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Cisneros' defense team filed a motion Monday seeking  
a psychiatric examination of the woman, Linda Jones, who has agreed 
to cooperate with the independent counsel prosecuting her former 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
	In requesting the exam, Cisneros lawyer Barry Simon cited both  
Ms. Jones' addiction to a prescription medication used to treat 
depression and a recent competency motion she filed. In it she 
denied she was competent when she pleaded guilty in January 1998 to 
multiple counts stemming from the Cisneros investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who previously went by her married name Medlar, is a  
major part of the government's case against Cisneros. Currently 
serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence, she is due to testify at a 
hearing Sporkin has set for June 21 on the admissibility of tapes 
she secretly made during telephone conversations with Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones' mental competency at the time she made the tapes,  
pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Independent Counsel 
David Barrett's office is relevant, Simon said. ``She's been 
treated by, I don't know, six to eight doctors over the course of 
the years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Jackowski opposed the request. He noted a  
federal judge in Lubbock, Texas, where Ms. Jones was sentenced, 
rejected a motion she filed in March seeking to vacate her guilty 
plea on the ground that she was incompetent because of her 
prescription drug usage. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was found to be competent,'' Jackowski said. He added that  
a psychiatrist who has examined her during her incarceration ``has 
found no cognitive dysfunction or reduction in intelligence from 
use of this drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin delayed further arguments on the psychiatric exam until  
the June 21 hearing, at which Ms. Jones is expected to testify for 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros served as housing secretary from 1993 to 1996 and heads  
the Spanish-language television network Univision. He has pleaded 
innocent to accusations that he vastly underreported his payments 
to Ms. Jones as well as lying about the timing of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Two longtime Cisneros aides, John Rosales and Sylvia  
Arce-Garcia, also are charged with conspiracy to conceal the 
financial arrangements from the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who still faces a similar conspiracy charge, may have  
an ally in the independent counsel's office. Barrett has indicated 
a willingness to support a reduced prison sentence for her based on 
her cooperation in Cisneros' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old woman, who worked as a Cisneros fund-raiser  
while he was mayor of San Antonio, pleaded guilty to 28 counts 
involving fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and obstruction of 
the independent counsel's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The special prosecutor turned his attention to her after federal  
investigators discovered that she had lied about the taped 
conversations and that some of the tapes had been altered.

<HEADLINE> Crashed Plane Cleared For Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The twisted and charred chunks of an  
American Airlines jet were hauled Monday to a hangar where 
investigators plan to spend months analyzing what caused the crash 
that killed the pilot and eight passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	A salvage crew, working in the early morning dark, moved the  
pieces on a procession of four tarpaulin-covered flatbed trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet had rested in soggy lowlands near the Arkansas River  
since June 1, when it skidded off a runway at the Little Rock 
airport during a storm, tore open and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The airplane's pieces -- minus engines that were sent to Tulsa,  
Okla., for inspection -- could remain in the hangar for up to a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board investigators have been  
focusing on whether mechanical problems, pilot error or severe 
weather -- or a combination of those factors -- played a role in the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Placing the plane's pieces in a hangar should allow  
investigators to more closely study such things as the plane's 
onboard computers, which were buried under wreckage at the crash 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The computers could disclose why the plane's spoilers -- panels  
that pop up to slow the plane down on landing -- did not open when 
the jet touched down. 
</P>
<P>
	The cockpit voice recorder tape has been transcribed and  
analyzed, but the text will not be released until more 
investigation is done, a high-level NTSB source said in Washington, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. The source said the flight-data 
recorder is also still being analyzed.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Research Body Odor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George Preti approaches his patients  
sniffing. He snuffles under their armpits, takes deep whiffs of 
their necks and slowly sniffs up and down their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mmm-hmm,'' he says, jotting down notes. ``OK, take a deep  
breath and exhale into my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preti can get a good idea of what the problem is from using a  
single diagnostic instrument: his nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Preti, who counts himself among America's experts on body odor,  
is a specialist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in 
Philadelphia, where more than 50 scientists focus their research 
exclusively on smell, taste and chemical irritation. The 
31-year-old nonprofit center is the only one of its kind in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the researchers' job duties at times border on the  
revolting, their work provides crucial information about disease, 
dangerous chemicals and food safety, said Anita Pickus of the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basic science that they're doing there,'' said Pickus,  
senior adviser of the agency's Office of Rare Diseases. ``To know 
what these simple mechanisms are, to know how processes occur 
today, leads you to therapy in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many, the center's research is their only hope for a better  
life. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent day, Sandy Gordon walked into Preti's office with  
three plastic containers filled with her urine. Afflicted with 
trimethylaminuria, a rare disease that can make a person smell like 
rotten fish, Ms. Gordon turned the samples in for tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Preti was my last hope,'' she said. ``When I found out  
what I had, I just broke down crying. I came here thinking I was 
the only person with this problem. Now I know it's not something to 
be ashamed of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Preti to truly gauge human smell, patients must stop wearing  
deodorant and perfumes five days before an exam. They also are told 
only to shower with unscented Ivory soap and to stop shaving their 
armpits. The night before the exam, patients fast and stop brushing 
their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, they are subjected to breath and lung tests, spit  
measurements via ``the drooling method'' and armpit-scraping 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists at Monell have aimed their research at  
everything from perfume-preference testing to how cigarette smoking 
affects mother's milk. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent study, scientist Julie Mennella monitored infants  
after they had been exposed to alcohol in their mothers' milk. She 
found that babies who drink alcohol-flavored milk might fall asleep 
faster but sleep for a shorter length of time. 
</P>
<P>
	For pediatricians and their patients, findings like these are  
enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folklore often captures much that is true and good, but  
observations such as this remind us that it is important to put 
these verities to the test,'' said Ronald G. Barr of the Child 
Development Programme at the Montreal Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Even students at the nearby University of Pennsylvania have  
unknowingly become part of Monell's experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	To test attitudes toward novel foods, scientists altered the  
cafeteria menu one afternoon by noting that two kinds of milk were 
being served: cow's milk and marsupial milk. Students preferred 
what they thought was the cow's milk, even though the ``marsupial'' 
milk was actually cow's milk as well. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 companies in the fragrance, food, pharmaceutical  
and household product industries, including Colgate-Palmolive and 
Campbell Soup, provide funding to the center and benefit from the 
research. Their projects test, for example, which fragrance people 
like best in deodorants and which food flavors are popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientist Charles Wysocki said that after 20 years of doing  
smell experiments, he has even come to like odors that most people 
find offensive. ``I actually like the smell of skunk now,'' Wysocki 
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Tops $250 Million Mark / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Comic Book Writer Paul Newman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Paul S. Newman, who was so prolific a  
comic-book writer that he got listed in the Guinness Book of World 
Records, has died. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Newman's death May 30 was a heart attack, according  
to Newman's son, Peter. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman wrote scripts for Superman, Mighty Mouse, The Lone Ranger  
and Jungle Jim comic books, among others. Beginning in 1947, he 
wrote more than 4,100 published stories totaling about 36,000 
pages, the equivalent of 120 mystery novels. His stories included 
dialogue and panel-by-panel descriptions of what the artist was 
supposed to draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get my 4,000-plus stories approved, I had to submit another  
5,000 plots that were not approved,'' he said. ``In the old days, 
you wrote a comic book for about $10 a page or about $300 an issue. 
I'm not a millionaire but I made a very good living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the comic-book historian Robin Snyder named Newman King  
of the Comic Book Writers. The Guinness book listed him as most 
prolific comic book writer under a headline, ``Lots of plots!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote a few newspaper comic strips, as well as  
screenplays and television sketches for such stars as Boris 
Karloff. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman was born in Manhattan in 1924 and enrolled at Dartmouth  
College. He served in World War II. He hoped to be a playwright, 
but he found he could make a living writing stories for comic 
books.

<HEADLINE> Knicks To Start Sprewell Vs. Pacers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks are changing their starting  
lineup. The Indiana Pacers are changing their offensive focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for Latrell Sprewell and Reggie Miller to play much bigger  
roles tonight in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. New York 
leads the best-of-7 series 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's a gamble right now,'' said New York coach Jeff Van  
Gundy, who announced Sunday that Sprewell would start alongside 
Allan Houston, Charlie Ward, Larry Johnson and Chris Dudley, with 
Kurt Thomas moving to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way I think we can win the series,'' Van Gundy said.  
``We caught a miracle last night, we all know it. You need one if 
you're going to move on, but you can't rely on it. It was a great 
hang around, hang in there, hard-fought win. But looking back at 
it, we were dominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers, who got little offense from anyone other than Rik  
Smits in Game 3, will look for more production from Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has attempted 33 shots, including 11 3-pointers, and is  
shooting 42 percent. He attempted only nine shots in Game 3, and 
the Pacers were unable to get him the ball for the final shot in 
Games 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question I've got to be more aggressive, I've got  
to shoot more -- 15 to 20, even 25 shots,'' Miller said. ``And I 
think that's going to be the case more in Game 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to getting Miller more shots, Bird says he plans to  
run more plays for Jalen Rose -- especially if Travis Best's groin 
pull keeps him out of the game and forces Rose, averaging 7.7 
points in the series, to be the backup point guard. Best said his 
status was 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks won Game 3 Saturday night when Larry Johnson made a  
rare four-point play with 5.7 seconds left for a 92-91 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers were still upset with the ruling by official Jess  
Kersey on the play, saying the referee should have disallowed the 
shot since the whistle came at least a half-second before Johnson 
released the shot. But the Pacers also knew that they blew a chance 
to lock up the game by failing to score from the field over the 
final 3:20. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question a lot of breaks have gone New York's way, but  
we've given them a lot of breaks as well. A few of these games 
we've kind of handed it to them on a silver platter,'' Miller said. 
``We've played terrible the last three minutes of each and every 
game and were lucky to win one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, on the other hand, have played poorly in the first  
few minutes of each game. That was one of the reasons why Van Gundy 
has decided to start Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is the potential for foul trouble with the  
Knicks' remaining big men in the absence of Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like that Kurt and (Chris) Dudley were out there  
together when they're both the primary defenders on (Rik) Smits,'' 
Van Gundy said, referring to the Pacers' 7-foot-4 center. 
``Secondly, I didn't like our second unit defense giving up 30 
points in the second quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Van Gundy started Dudley in place of Ewing in Game 3,  
Indiana used 6-7 Chris Mullin to guard the 6-11 Dudley. In Games 1 
and 2, New York had exploited the matchup of Mullin trying to guard 
the faster, stronger Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of being able to go at Mullin, we couldn't. And so it  
really got us off to a bad start, and I think it would continue to 
get us off to a bad start,'' Van Gundy said. ``I know I would have 
made the change if the miracles wouldn't have happened last night, 
and miracles happening don't change what I think we need to do to 
win this series.''

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Woos Japan on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Stocks. Bonds. Actresses. Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. is  
betting the combination on a new TV show the New York investment 
firm is sponsoring will encourage wary Japanese investors to buy 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The show -- ``Money Angel'' -- debuts in the Tokyo area on June 26  
with Goldman Sachs as its sole sponsor. The program will feature 
three actresses who explain various types of investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, which Goldman says is the first of its kind, is  
aimed at overcoming one of the greatest roadblocks foreign 
securities companies face in Japan: traditional distrust of the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan would seem the perfect place for a mutual fund boom. The  
country has one of the world's highest savings rates, an aging 
population worried about nest eggs and low interest rates on 
savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors, however, have not made much of a dent in the view  
that investing in stocks is akin to gambling. The Tokyo market's 
loss of about half its value in the past decade has reinforced that 
belief. 
</P>
<P>
	But with deregulation throwing open the doors to foreign firms,  
brokerages are doing what they can to get a piece of the Japanese 
pie. Goldman has been the most successful: with more than $12 
billion in mutual fund assets, it is the No. 1 foreign mutual fund 
group in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman sees the new program, broadcast on Saturdays on TV  
Tokyo, as a way of educating individual investors about the 
alternatives to squirreling away their money in low-yeilding 
savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television is the most appropriate medium that can help  
(people to) understand the concept of `money' in a simple, yet 
comprehensive way,'' the firm said in a statement. ``This program 
will certainly help raise the awareness of asset management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show will also be accompanied by a new TV advertising  
campaign by Goldman that started on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Racing Horse Put To Sleep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) -- Niatross, harness racing's Horse of the  
Decade for the 1980s, was euthanized Monday evening after a large 
cancerous mass was discovered in his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old stallion exhibited signs of discomfort on Friday  
and was transported to the veterinary center early Saturday morning 
where an examination revealed the large mass. After two days of 
monitoring and treatment, Niatross was put to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The breed's first sub-1:50 performer, Niatross was unbeaten in  
13 starts as a 2-year-old in 1979. His winnings that season of 
$604,900 were the most any 2-year-old of any breed had earned. He 
was voted Harness Horse of the Year in 1979, one of only three 
2-year-olds ever voted overall champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bred by Elsie Berger of Niagara Acres and owned during that  
season by Berger and trainer-driver Clint Galbraith, 50 percent of 
Niatross was sold to the Niatross Stable for $5 million and insured 
for $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, Niatross won 24 of 26 starts, losing only when he fell  
over the rail at Saratoga and when he broke stride at the 
Meadowlands. He swept the Pacing Triple Crown and Meadowlands Pace, 
then put his name into the record books with a 1:49.1 time trial at 
Lexington's Red Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, he was named Horse of the Year. The New York Post  
named Niatross its 1980 Athlete of the Year, the only time a 
racehorse has won that newspaper's honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Niatross retired with earnings of $2,019,213, the first horse of  
any breed to earn over $2 million in only two racing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his stud career at Castleton Farm in Kentucky and sired  
Little Brown Jug winners from his first two crops, including 
Nihilator and Barberry Spur. He remained active as a stallion until 
a few days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Niatross sired 648 pacers with records of 2:00 or faster. To  
date, they have earned more than $57.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The stallion will be cremated and his remains interred at the  
Harness Racing Museum and Hall of Fame in Goshen, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slightly Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices edged higher Monday in light  
trading on the bond market as investors awaited key economic 
reports later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32  
point, or $0.31 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, was at 5.96 percent, slightly below 
Friday's, which was the highest level since mid-May of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to report on  
producer price inflation and the Commerce Department is expected to 
release a report on retail sales. Strong increases in either could 
heighten fear of inflation and sway the Fed to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Monday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were between unchanged and up 1/32 point, and 
intermediate maturities were up 1/16 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.61 percent as the  
discount was unchanged at 4.49 percent. Six-month yields were 4.95 
percent, as the discount was unchanged at 4.76 percent. One-year 
yields were 5.05 percent as the discount fell by 0.01 percentage 
point from late Friday to 4.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.63 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 121 5/32. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial in Fundraiser Tax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge Monday declared a mistrial in  
the tax evasion trial of Democratic fundraiser who is also accused 
of funneling money through Buddhist nuns at a 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaign fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had reported it was unable to reach a verdict Friday on  
the tax evasion charges, which are separate from the Buddhist nuns 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard A. Paez told the panel to resume  
deliberations, but the jury again reported it was divided on all 
four counts but leaning toward acquittal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Maria S. Hsia pledged to repair her  
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Asian-Americans have to work together and support each  
other, and they have to stand up and fight for justice, not just 
for ourselves but for our children,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors claim Hsia, who runs an immigration  
consulting business in San Marino, failed to file an income tax 
return for 1994, underestimated her income for 1995 and 1996 -- 
involving a total of $175,000 for the three years, and assisted in 
filing a false tax return for her business. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers said the tax charges were intended to intimidate  
Hsia in the campaign finance case. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax case is separate from accusations against Hsia in a  
Washington, D.C., case involving thousands of dollars Hsia is 
accused of funneling through Buddhist nuns at a California 
fund-raiser attended by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia was indicted in Washington on six conspiracy counts in 1998  
but five counts were dismissed by a federal judge. The U.S. Court 
of Appeals just weeks ago reversed that lower court ruling and 
affirmed the lower court's ruling that Hsia must stand trial on 
another charge of conspiracy involving $65,000 in illegal 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in Los Angeles gave federal prosecutors 10 days to  
decide whether to retry Hsia, but not before issuing a stern 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You took 10 days with ample opportunity to present your best  
case,'' Paez said. ``So you better evaluate this case very 
carefully, and I'm not kidding ... very carefully with your 
superiors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles was  
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer said the case should be dismissed.  
</P>
<P>
	``She feels she's been vindicated. This is definitely a kind of  
a statement that she's on the right track. She's not guilty,'' 
Kenneth Barish said.

<HEADLINE> TR's Daughter's Acid Wit Lives On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alice Roosevelt Longworth invented herself and  
played the role with acid-tongued perfection for most of the 20th 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Her verbal skewer was as pointed as the stiletto she is said to  
have kept in her purse. She punctured and shattered precedents, at 
times with what she sometimes called ``malevolent detachment,'' 
others with a sound like the crash of White House china. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. L, as many called her, didn't need a motto, but she had  
one, embroidered on a sofa pillow: ``If you haven't got anything 
good to say about anybody, come sit next to me.'' In a city where 
gossip is currency, she was rarely alone. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been gone since 1980 when she died at 96, having been  
center stage in Washington since her father, Theodore Roosevelt, 
followed the slain William McKinley to the White House in 1901. The 
event filled Alice with ``utter rapture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Longworth is having an active afterlife in the memoirs  
and biographies of other people. She is mentioned 10 times in 
``Personal History,'' the memoirs of Katharine Graham, the former 
publisher of The Washington Post. She appears 64 times in Carl 
Sferrazza Anthony's 1998 biography of first lady Florence Harding, 
cited in the index under such categories as ``political 
informant,'' ``spitefulness of,'' ``unconventional behavior of,'' 
``extramarital affair of'' and ``WH (Warren Harding) disparaged 
by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Longworth, whose husband, Nicholas Longworth, was a  
Republican speaker of the House, appears an additional 34 times in 
Anthony's two-volume history of America's first ladies, weaving in 
and out of one administration after another. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Graham recalled her mother, Agnes Meyer, as ``always  
ambivalent about Mrs. Longworth,'' despairing at her ``brilliant 
but sterile mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After one party they both attended early in 1920, my mother  
described Alice as having been in a very carnal sort of mood. She 
ate three chops, told shady stories and finally sang in a deep bass 
voice: Nobody cultivates me, I'm wild, I'm wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the standards of Washington early in the 20th century, Alice  
Roosevelt had been wild indeed. Her father, the president, said 
famously that he could manage the government or manage Alice -- but 
couldn't possibly do both at once. 
</P>
<P>
	Attracting enormous publicity, she smoked, drove her own car,  
plunged fully clothed into a swimming pool, placed a bet at a race 
track, was seen in public wearing a boa constrictor around her 
neck, set off firecracker and shot at telegraph poles from a train 
and was universally dubbed ``Princess Alice'' after she christened 
the yacht of Kaiser Wilhelm's brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Progressive Era there was no star like the princess,''  
Carl Anthony writes. ``She became an idol to women around the world 
... Shortly an 'Alice industry' was set in motion. When it was 
discovered that a particular gray-blue was her favorite color, 
'Alice blue' was born. ... Sheet music for the hit song 'Alice Blue 
Gown' became impossible to get because it kept selling out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alice's East Room wedding to Longworth was a spectacular affair;  
the marriage itself was decidedly sour. It did nothing to dampen 
her style. 
</P>
<P>
	When her father was succeeded in the presidency by William  
Howard Taft she planted a voodoo doll of Nellie Taft, the new first 
lady, on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	She honed an impersonation of the first lady in which she mocked  
her ``hippopotamus face'' and ``Cin-cin-nasty'' accent. Years 
later, Mrs. Longworth added to her repertoire an impersonation of 
her cousin, Eleanor Roosevelt, whom she had tormented since youth. 
</P>
<P>
	A congressman's wife, describing Alice at a White House party in  
1911, said she ``held the very scant skirt quite high, and when the 
band played, kicked about and moved her body sinuously like a 
shining leopard cat.'' At a society ball about that time she 
bounced to the Turkey Trot while blowing rhythmic puffs of 
cigarette smoke, causing some to liken her to a rocketing 
locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
	Five, six and seven decades later Mrs. Longworth was, in her  
words, ``an ambulatory Washington monument,'' still parading 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	The stories are still being told, in print and at Washington  
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	She forbade Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis., to call her by her  
first name, saying the trashman had that privilege but he didn't. 
She adopted a trademarked wide-brimmed hat and told President 
Johnson she wore it so he couldn't get close enough to kiss her. 
</P>
<P>
	She had known every president since her father took her to the  
White House at age 6 to meet Benjamin Harrison. Like many of his 
successors he left her unimpressed. ``He was like a rather solemn 
bearded gnome,'' she recalled.

<HEADLINE> CD-ROM Relives Block Graphic Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Computer and game-console games today offer vividly detailed  
graphics and rich stereo sound, featuring nuanced characters in 
complex plots. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't always that way.  
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in 1977 (yes, we had electricity and microprocessors  
even then) with the Atari Video Game Console, millions thrilled to 
arcade-style game cartridges with crude graphics. By 1980, Mattel 
Electronics had introduced Intellivision, and by 1982, Atari and 
Intellivision were in a combined 13 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A good way to relive those block-graphic times and have some fun  
is the CD-ROM Intellivision Lives! for both PC and Mac platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Intellivision Lives! is a product of Intellivision Productions  
of Redondo Beach, Calif., a company formed by a couple of former 
Intellivision programmers, Keith Robinson and Stephen Roney, who 
bought the rights to the original Intellivision games. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the games themselves, the CD-ROM has a history  
about the rise -- and subsequent fall -- of Mattel Electronics. The 
jewel-case cover admits this ``should be considered a subjective 
history by some of the people who designed the games. We're sure 
that others -- such as our friends who were in Marketing or 
Administration -- would tell the story differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate where-did-we-go-wrong musings aside, the games speak  
for themselves. With more than 50 for a price of $29.95, this is a 
good value for those who want to see what was thought entertaining 
in the late '70s and early '80s -- or for those who want to see it 
again, this time with no static about finishing your homework. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the sports titles, the games include Utopia, Sea Battle,  
Astrosmash and Night Stalker. The CD-ROM also includes video clips 
and unreleased Intellivision games. 
</P>
<P>
	Installation was smooth, and the user interface is slick. Using  
the PC keyboard instead of the game console takes a bit of getting 
used to, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
	And the games, compared with today's productions, are very  
simple. On the other hand, they don't require intense study and-or 
clue sheets. Today's games are so involved that when they arrive 
for review, the press packages routinely include ``reviewer 
guides,'' a k a ``cheat sheets,'' for puzzled journalists who don't 
have a couple of months to work out the solutions on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements for Intellivision Lives! for the PC are  
Windows 95 or 98, a 90 megahertz Pentium or better, eight megabytes 
of RAM and an eight-speed CD-ROM. For the Mac, 16 megabytes of RAM, 
Power Macintosh, OS 7.5, eight-speed CD-ROM. The software is 
available on the Internet at www.intellivisionlives.com.

<HEADLINE> 2 British Cigarette Companies Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British American Tobacco PLC, the world's No. 2  
cigarette company and maker of brands including Kent and Lucky 
Strike, has completed a $8.2 billion acquisition of its smaller 
rival, Rothmans International NV. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has cleared its final regulatory hurdle -- approval by  
Australia's Securities and Investments Commission -- BAT spokeswoman 
Denise Hart said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT's purchase of Rothmans depended on the commission's approval  
of the merger of their two subsidiaries in Australia. A second 
Australian government agency, the Competition and Consumer 
Commission, signed off on the deal last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition gives British American a 16 percent share of the  
global cigarette market, just behind Philip Morris Cos., which has 
17 percent. BAT bought Rothmans, the world's fourth-biggest 
cigarette producer, in exchange for a special issue of 604 million 
ordinary shares and 242 million preference shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmans International is owned by Switzerland's Compagnie  
Financiere Richemont and South Africa-based Rembrandt Group. They 
now own a combined 35 percent of the enlarged BAT. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced their planned merger in January.

<HEADLINE> `Death in Venice' Is No.1 Gay Novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Contributing yet another end-of-the-century  
list, an organization of gays in publishing has compiled the 100 
greatest gay novels of all time, with Thomas Mann's ``Death in 
Venice'' coming in at No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The novella about a writer's infatuation with a teen-age boy was  
followed by James Baldwin's ``Giovanni's Room,'' the story of an 
expatriate's struggle with his sexual identity, and ``Our Lady of 
the Flowers,'' Jean Genet's fantasy about a male prostitute in the 
Parisian underworld. 
</P>
<P>
	Two classic French novels finished fourth and fifth: Marcel  
Proust's ``Remembrance of Things Past'' and Andre Gide's ``The 
Immoralist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list was compiled by Publishing Triangle, which consists of  
more than 250 gay and lesbian writers, editors, agents and 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	The criteria for what constitutes a ``gay novel'' were hazy.  
Titles apparently could make the list if the author was gay, if the 
book had gay subject matter, or the text was simply open to gay 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the judges disagreed, for instance, over the  
inclusion of Herman Melville's ``Moby-Dick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these books contributes to the understanding of the  
outsider mentality,'' said one of the judges, novelist Dorothy 
Allison, whose own ``Bastard Out of Carolina'' made the list. 
``'Moby-Dick' is very much about the survival of the different. And 
that's pretty much the situation for gay and lesbian people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say that about a leper colony, too,'' countered  
fellow judge M.E. Kerr, a novelist. ``You have to consider the 
writer's intention. If you're supposed to choose a gay novel, I 
should think that it's not just because it has a group of men or 
women interacting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise was a response to the Modern Library's list last  
summer of the century's best English-language novels. That list was 
widely criticized as a stodgy compilation of white male literature. 
The Modern Library is a division of Random House. 
</P>
<P>
	``That list got me thinking about what novels by gays and  
lesbians were overlooked,'' said Charles Flowers, chairman of the 
Publishing Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Publishing Trangle list covers the best novels ever, not  
just those of the 20th century. There are far more women and 
nonwhites, and all languages were eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen judges were on the Publishing Triangle selection  
committee, among them John Loughery, art critic for The Hudson 
Review, and Anthony Heilbut, author of a prize-winning biography of 
Mann. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Modern Library could be faulted for disregarding  
alternative voices, the current list could be cited for excessive 
loyalty to those voices. 
</P>
<P>
	Few critics, for instance, would call ``Giovanni's Room'' a  
better novel than ``Remembrance of Things Past'' or rank Patricia 
Highsmith's ``The Price of Salt'' (No. 36) above ``The Turn of the 
Screw'' by Henry James (No. 40) and Louisa May Alcott's ``Little 
Women.'' (No. 43). 
</P>
<P>
	``Many elements went into the voting,'' Flowers said. ``Social  
influence. Cultural influence. Literary quality. I don't believe 
there's a single objective standard.''

<HEADLINE>  Study of Mentally Ill Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a White House conference on mental illness,  
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and their wives worked 
today to dispel myths about people who suffer from such illnesses 
as depression and schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans with mental illness should have the same opportunity  
all Americans have to live to the fullest of their God-given 
abilities,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House used the gathering to announce a $7.3 million  
study by the National Institute of Mental Health to explore mental 
illness and a national training program for teachers to identify 
and help troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also notified the 285 health plans used by federal  
employees that they must cover mental illness and substance abuse, 
and he called on other employers to do the same. ``It is high time 
that our health plans treat all Americans equally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the administration was pressing Congress for  
legislation to stop forcing disabled people who are receiving 
Medicare or Medicaid to give up their benefits when they go to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The training program was developed with the help of the National  
Education Association and EchoStar, a satellite company based in 
Littleton, Colo., where two students killed a teacher, 12 
classmates and themselves earlier this year. EchoStar was donating 
1,000 satellite dishes and 40 hours of air time to the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than changing policy, the conference was aimed at  
changing attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton drew parallels between the stigma surrounding mental  
illness and discrimination, saying the mentally disabled ``are 
perhaps just the latest in our enduring challenge as a people to 
continue the work of our founders to widen the circle of 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, recounted for the  
audience at Howard University and listening nationwide how she 
sought treatment to overcome depression after her son was injured 
by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people that are within the sound of my voice, who  
perhaps are suffering with this or any other mental illness, to 
know that there is the right diagnosis and the right treatment and 
the right health care professional out there for you,'' she said. 
``Don't hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, a longtime advocate for the mentally ill, chaired the  
conference, which was linked electronically to 6,000 sites 
nationwide. CBS newsman Mike Wallace, who also overcame depression, 
joined the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Cabinet secretaries and more than 20 members of Congress  
from both parties were participating in the daylong session. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore is working with Surgeon General David Satcher and the  
Ad Council to produce the campaign on mental illness. Clinton 
issued an executive order Friday to eliminate the government's 
stricter hiring and promotion standards for mentally disabled 
people.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Denies Overtime Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 14,000 current and former federal law  
enforcement officers who say they improperly were denied overtime 
pay lost a Supreme Court appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away the officers' effort to  
collect another four years' worth of overtime pay in addition to 
two years of pay they were granted in a settlement. Today's action, 
however, leaves open part of the officers' claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14,122 officers worked between 1984 and 1995 as criminal  
investigators or in other law enforcement positions for agencies 
including the Customs Service, the Secret Service, the Internal 
Revenue Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawsuits, filed between 1990 and 1995, said they wrongly  
were classified as exempt from federal overtime pay requirements, 
and sought back pay. The employees also filed administrative claims 
with the Government Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Federal Claims ruled for the officers, and in a  
1994 settlement they were granted two years' worth of back overtime 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' claims with the GAO sought an additional four  
years' overtime under a federal policy that allowed six years' 
worth of compensation in administrative claims. But in 1994, the 
GAO ruled that such administrative claims would be limited to two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in 1994, Congress passed a law intended to allow six  
years' worth of compensation, but changed the law the following 
year to ensure it would not apply to the officers. One congressman 
said the 1994 law would have cost the government up to $460 million 
in back pay. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1995, the officers asked a federal judge to let them  
seek the additional four years' pay. The judge ruled against them, 
and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court said the officers' claim that the policy  
change unlawfully took their property without compensation might 
have to be decided by a different court. The federal judge was 
ordered to restudy that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal acted on today said the government violated the  
officers' due-process rights in trying to ``avoid paying legitimate 
debts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said the GAO is entitled to change  
its mind on how much back pay could be awarded to government 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Adams vs. Hinchman, 98-1265.

<P>
	YORKTOWN, Texas (AP) -- A 10-year-old girl died after being  
mauled by one of her stepfather's pet tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorin Casey Villafana died of head and neck injuries. She was in  
a cage Sunday night with her stepfather, who is licensed to have 
the two tigers and takes them to exotic animal shows across Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her father was brushing the female tiger and all of a sudden  
the male tiger jumped on the little girl and dragged her through 
the cage,'' Police Chief Guy Nobles said Monday. ``The stepfather 
finally got the tiger to let her go, and he picked her up and got 
her out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stepfather was not injured. Authorities would not say  
whether they were considering charges against him.

<HEADLINE> British, Dutch Steel Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Steel PLC and Dutch metals producer  
Koninklijke Hoogovens NV announced today they plan to merge in a 
$6.5 billion deal that will create the world's third largest steel 
maker and Europe's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The British company, which has sales nearly double those of  
Hoogovens, is to take a 62 percent share in the new group, which 
would have sales worth $14.9 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel shareholders will also get a cash payment of 56  
cents per existing share from the new company upon completion of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by regulators and by the companies'  
shareholders. If approved, shareholders of both companies will 
receive stock in the new company, initially to be called BSKH. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of BSKH is to be chaired by Sir Brian Moffat of  
British Steel, while the role of chief executive will rotate 
between Hoogovens and British Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in British Steel have rallied in recent days in  
expectation of the bid announcement. But the company's stock fell 6 
percent in early trading today. In Amsterdam, Hoogovens' share 
price was up 1.3 percent from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger marks a major turning point in the life of  
one of Britain's best-known businesses. British Steel was once 
symbolic of the country's uncompetitive industries and the strained 
relations between its managers and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Privatized in 1988, British Steel now employs fewer than 40,000  
people in Britain, compared to 250,000 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say British Steel's decision to merge was prompted  
partly by a downturn in demand caused the lingering financial 
crisis in Asia. Steel makers have high fixed costs, and even a 
slight reduction in sales can threaten profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, analysts say the British pound's persistent  
strength against the euro influenced the move. The strong pound 
makes British-made steel more expensive than competitors' steel 
denominated in euros. The merger would let British Steel shift some 
of its production costs away from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does mean that we have a manufacturing platform in  
Europe,'' British Steel chief executive John Bryant told the 
British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview. ``For our 
customers ... who increasingly look to be served on an 
international basis, ... we've got that platform to provide them 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falling prices, cheap imports and overcapacity have prompted  
Europe's steel makers to embark on a spate of mergers in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Koninklijke Hoogovens' net profit fell 17 percent in 1998 to  
$196.7 million, due largely to lower steel prices and increased 
competition from companies in Asia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel posted a loss of $130.6 million for the year  
ending April 3, 1999, compared to a net profit of $364.5 million in 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	British Steel and Hoogovens said they expect cost savings in  
central overhead, purchasing and logistics and that they predict 
savings of $300 million a year by the third year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, whose name would change after the deal is  
completed, will be headquartered in London and will seek listings 
on the London, Amsterdam and New York Stock Exchanges.

<HEADLINE>  Discovery's Flight Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery and its  
astronauts are back from the international space station after 
accomplishing everything they set out to do. 
</P>
<P>
	All the headaches are now back on Earth.  
</P>
<P>
	Hanging over the successful supply mission is uncertainty about  
both the status of the next shuttle flight and scheduled follow-up 
trips to the new space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears were momentarily was set aside as Discovery emerged  
like a ghost ship from the predawn Sunday sky and touched down on 
Kennedy Space Center's floodlighted runway. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the 11th time that a space shuttle landed in  
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome home, Discovery, from the first docking mission to the  
international space station,'' radioed Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven astronauts skipped the traditional shuttle walkaround  
and picture taking, and instead asked to be driven straight to crew 
quarters. They left managers waiting on the landing strip, fueling 
speculation that one or more of the crew might be nauseous, as 
sometimes happens to returning astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA insisted the astronauts were fine and merely eager to be  
reunited with their families. 
</P>
<P>
	During their 10 days in orbit, the astronauts unloaded 2 tons of  
supplies at the space station for future inhabitants, replaced bad 
electronic boxes and installed mufflers over noisy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	On their way home, they dropped off a glittering, mirrored  
satellite called Starshine that schoolchildren will track until it 
falls from orbit at the beginning of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts aren't due back at the space station until December,  
when they're supposed to haul up more supplies aboard Atlantis. But 
that mission cannot take place -- and neither can any other missions 
to the 6-month-old space station -- until the Russians launch a 
crucial service module that will double as crew quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The component is scheduled to fly in November, 1 1/2 years behind  
schedule, provided all the testing between now and then goes well. 
The Russian Space Agency's money problems and delays have long 
bothered NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always hope for the best, plan for the worst,'' NASA  
Administrator Daniel Goldin said following Discovery's return. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's more immediate concern involves Columbia and the $1.5  
billion observatory Chandra, also running a year late because of a 
multitude of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The upper-stage motor on Chandra is similar to one that  
malfunctioned aboard a military satellite in April, leaving the 
spacecraft in a uselessly low orbit. An Air Force investigation 
into the failure continues. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, NASA is proceeding toward a July 22 launch of Columbia,  
the only shuttle big enough to hold the 45-foot telescope. Goldin 
stressed, however, that he won't give the final go-ahead until 
``the NASA team walks into my office and says they understand 
exactly what went wrong, they understand how it was fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has until mid-August to send Columbia on the  
telescope-delivery mission without impacting other missions, said 
shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that NASA's oldest shuttle is due for its  
regularly scheduled tune-up and, unless it flies soon, it will have 
to undergo eight to nine months of maintenance before launching 
Chandra. That would bump the mission -- the first to be commanded by 
a woman -- into late 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it takes a year, it will take a year,'' Goldin said. ``Time  
is not an issue.''

<HEADLINE> Ore., N.H. Lead in Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oregon and New Hampshire enjoyed the fastest  
economic growth among the states in 1997, and California's economy 
remained the biggest, the government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Commerce Department report broke down the nation's gross  
domestic product, the total output of goods and services, to show 
the amount contributed by each state. 
</P>
<P>
	The total U.S. economy grew in 1997 by 4.3 percent, after  
adjusting for inflation. Before adjusting for inflation, in current 
dollars, growth of the total economy was 6.2 percent in 1997, 
compared to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest state gains in economic output were enjoyed by  
residents of Oregon, where the economy expanded by 7.6 percent, and 
New Hampshire, close behind with an increase in its gross state 
product of 7.5 percent, after adjusting for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the scale, Hawaii actually saw its economic  
output shrink in 1997, declining 0.2 percent, as the state's 
economy was hit hard by fallout from the Asian currency crisis. 
Downturns in construction and financial services were major 
contributors to Hawaii's overall decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government figures showed the state with the biggest  
economy remained California, where total output measured $1.03 
trillion in 1997, or 12.7 percent of the national total of $8.1 
trillion in the output of goods and services measured in current 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other states with large shares of the national gross  
domestic product were New York, 8 percent of the national total; 
Texas, 7.4 percent; Illinois, 4.9 percent, and Florida, which 
accounts for 4.7 percent of total GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the five largest state economies account for 40  
percent of the nation's economy. The five with the smallest 
economies, each measuring 0.2 percent of the total, were Montana, 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the gross domestic product measures the output of goods  
and services inside U.S. borders, the gross state product measures 
the total output of goods and services inside an individual state's 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
	After Oregon and New Hampshire, the states that enjoyed the  
fastest growth in their gross state products for 1997 were Texas, 
up 6.8 percent; Arizona, up 6.7 percent; and Colorado, with a 6.5 
percent increase in output. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hawaii was the only state with a 1997 drop in output,  
other states with meager increases, far below the national increase 
of 4.3 percent, were Alaska, up only 0.4 percent; North Dakota, up 
0.6 percent; West Virginia, up 0.9 percent; and South Dakota, with 
a 1.7 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The state report is produced by the Commerce Department's Bureau  
of Economic Analysis. While the government produces an estimate of 
national GDP growth the month after the quarter ends, bureau 
economist Gerard Aman said the state data can be produced only with 
a much longer lag time because of the difficulty of breaking down 
output for each state. 
</P>
<P>
	National GDP is usually stated in terms of inflation-adjusted  
figures. Officials used both inflation-adjusted figures and current 
dollar estimates in the state report, explaining that for some 
comparisons the current dollar estimates are preferable because of 
problems in adjusting for inflation on a state-by-state basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the new report contains state information only  
through 1997, Aman said state economic planning agencies find the 
statistics useful for judging how industries in their states are 
faring compared to the same industries in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater detail on the gross state product can be found in the  
Bureau of Economic Analysis' Web site www.bea.doc.gov under the 
regional heading.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Economic Adviser May Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Yellen, chairman of the president's  
Council of Economic Advisers, is planning to leave the Clinton 
administration, an administration official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that  
Yellen's departure would occur soon. The CEA chairman is considered 
the president's chief economist and the three-member panel serves 
as the administration's in-house think tank on economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin announced he would  
be stepping down in July, and last week Alice Rivlin, whom Clinton 
appointed as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, announced her 
resignation from the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen had served as head of the three-member CEA since 1997. At  
the time, her appointment was seen as an administration effort to 
foster closer ties with the Federal Reserve, where Yellen was 
serving when Clinton tapped her for the CEA post. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen had been one of Clinton's first two appointments to the  
Fed. Before joining the central bank, Yellen had been an economics 
professor at the University of California at Berkeley specializing 
in the causes and implications of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen was Clinton's third CEA chairman, following Laura Tyson,  
another Berkeley professor, and Joseph Stiglitz. Tyson has returned 
to Berkeley as dean of the business school while Stiglitz is now 
chief economist at the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen's departure would leave the Council of Economic Advisers  
with only one confirmed member, Rebecca M. Blank. Clinton has 
nominated Harvard professor Robert Lawrence to fill a vacancy on 
the three-member panel, but the Senate has not yet acted on the 
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Borrowing Rises in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' rate of borrowing rose in April,  
fueled by heavy credit card use. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced  
at a 3.4 percent annual rate in April to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.33 trillion, the Federal Reserve said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the increase in the annualized rate of borrowing in April  
was the smallest so far this year and marked the third straight 
month that the rate of borrowing has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, American consumers borrowed at an annual rate of 4.6  
percent, which was much higher than the Federal Reserve had 
estimated. In February, the annualized borrowing rate was 9.1 
percent, and in January the annualized rate was 15.3 percent, 
according to the Fed's revised figures. 
</P>
<P>
	For April, revolving credit -- primarily credit cards -- showed  
the strongest increase: 6.8 percent at an annual rate. Auto loans 
increased by a 5.8 percent annual rate. And borrowing lumped into a 
catchall category that includes education loans, vacations, mobile 
homes and boats declined by 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, consumers' borrowed $3.7 billion more in April than  
during the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapering off of borrowing increases this year follows strong  
consumer borrowing in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And although the increases in the rate of borrowing are  
diminishing, consumers' confidence in the economy appears to be 
high.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Northern Arizona is dropping men's  
swimming and diving in order to comply with federal gender equity 
requirements, athletic director Steve Holton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The university added women's golf and women's soccer over the  
last four years but can't afford to add yet another women's 
program, Holton said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, women's enrollment has risen since 1994 to 56  
percent. Dropping the men's aquatics program places Northern 
Arizona's female participation rate at 51 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was not an easy one for anyone involved,'' Holton  
said. ``It is, however, a necessary move for the university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holton said the university will honor the scholarships of  
students participating in the men's swimming and diving program or 
will try to help them if they wish to transfer for competitive 
reasons. He also said full-time coaches will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was added to varsity sports 10 years ago.

state Republican Party leaders he won't compete in a high-profile 
straw poll the party is running this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move prompted a party leader to question McCain's commitment

	Another Bush aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bush  
was being urged to compete at some level, because skipping the 
event entirely could lead to an embarrassingly low finish. Under 
that scenario, Bush would compete but in a muted fashion to keep 
expectations low. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are arguing that we can't bypass the thing entirely,''  
said the aide, who said no decision was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's move was not surprising. He has no campaign  
organization in Iowa and has spent only three days in the state 
throughout the entire election cycle. By comparison, as of mid-May, 
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander had spent 47 days campaigning 
in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are planning the straw poll Aug. 14 and expect  
12,000 activists to show up and cast ballots in a test of 
organizational strength likely to get heavy attention. McCain won't 
be among those competing for backing, said spokesman Howard 
Opinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a strategy that's moving us forward at our own  
timetable,'' Opinsky said. ``We are not yielding any state to 
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson said McCain's tactic  
isn't likely to sell well in state where organization is king. He 
noted that McCain does pretty well in national polling, but has 
done little to translate that to caucus support. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who have general support but don't organize that  
support generally don't do well in the caucuses,'' said Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange comes as many of the GOP campaigns begin to focus  
on the straw poll, hoping to use the event to demonstrate they've 
built the ability to deliver supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome is watched because the process is akin to delivering  
supporters to thousands of precinct-level gatherings next February, 
where the first votes that count are cast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the straw poll will be a significant test of  
strength,'' said commentator Pat Buchanan. ``It will measure not 
only the strength of organization, but who has done the best in a 
short period of time. The straw poll, while not decisive, is 
certainly important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as important are campaigns seeking to set expectations  
for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush stands high atop the opinion polls, aides modestly  
note that he's only begun to build a campaign organization, and 
can't possibly be expected to perform well in the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other candidates have been here for years,'' said Joe  
Gunderson, heading up Bush's Iowa campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only one person who has to win and that's George  
Bush,'' said Keith Fortmann, who runs the Iowa campaign of former 
Vice President Dan Quayle. ``Everybody else is an expectation 
thing. If Bush finishes third it's really damaging to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you are the front-runner, you have to meet certain  
expectations of a front-runner,'' said Alexander aide David Kochel. 
``One of them is winning contests. Otherwise, you don't get to be 
the front-runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monte Shaw, an aide to Elizabeth Dole, was a bit reluctant to  
wade into the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd anticipate that if thing work out the way they should,  
we'll be there and see what happens,'' said Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush faces a dilemma. His name will be listed on the ballot, and  
if he chooses to compete it's unlikely he could meet the standards 
imposed by his high poll standings. 
</P>
<P>
	If he chooses to ignore the event, however, and suffers an  
embarrassing defeat, rivals could accuse him of snubbing the state 
and question his organizational clout. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a dangerous combination for Bush, because many of his  
backers are pragmatists who have climbed aboard because they sense 
he's the likely nominee.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Return To Jubilant San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs arrived home today  
bearing a big gift for devoted fans -- their first trip to the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exciting. You guys have been behind us for years and  
years,'' Spurs point guard Avery Johnson told hundreds of cheering 
fans who greeted the team's charter plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should feel good, because you are a part of history,''  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chanting ``Go Spurs, Go!'' and ``Sweep, Sweep, Sweep'' and  
carrying Spurs signs, about 3,500 people crowded around a private 
terminal at San Antonio International Airport to welcome the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungry for a championship after 26 years of waiting, Spurs  
supporters kicked into serious party mode after San Antonio won the 
Western Conference finals Sunday by defeating the Trail Blazers 
94-80 in Portland and sweeping the series 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars decorated with Spurs slogans cruised the streets, horns  
honking. Spectators in sports bars watched the game on television, 
then went wild afterward. The San Antonio Express-News displayed a 
banner headline Monday declaring ``SPUR-FECT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say right now is whew!'' center David Robinson said  
at the airport. ``Our work is not finished, but I'll tell you what, 
we're feeling pretty good right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diehard fans camped out all night at the Alamodome to buy  
title-round tickets, which went on sale Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran down here after the game. I was so excited,'' said Raul  
Adam, a computer consultant who was a bit breathless after 
purchasing the limit of six tickets each for the first and second 
games of the finals. The seats, in the dome's upper deck, were $25 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	An exhausted Rene Riojas, a county employee, brought his  
12-year-old son Rene Riojas Jr. with him to the Alamodome about 
9:30 p.m. Sunday to get in line for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted my son to experience the NBA ... the NBA Finals,''  
Riojas said. ``I think it's fantastic. I think it's about time. 
It's the Spurs' time now, now that the Bulls are gone. I think it's 
good for the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Bennett, president of the North East School District  
board, and his 8-year-old son, Bradley, also went to the dome 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never camped out for anything in my life,'' Bennett said,  
with a smile and a shake of his head. ``I think it's great. I've 
always liked the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Castilleja, a school employee, was not always a Spurs fan  
before. Like thousands of others, she has hopped on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived my whole life in San Antonio and I've never been to  
a Spurs game,'' she said. ``I'm a fan now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio must await the outcome of the Eastern Conference  
finals before learning whether the Spurs' opponent will be the New 
York Knicks or Indiana Pacers. The finals begin Sunday at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Spurs fans didn't seem to care which team is next.  
</P>
<P>
	But Adam Parrish had a preference.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to play the New York Knicks. They're show time.  
That'll put us on the map,'' Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and Parrish has a prediction on the series outcome.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to sweep 'em!''  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs spirit had been taking over the city for days.  
</P>
<P>
	Now it's at full speed.  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs signs decorate a tall downtown bank tower, the windows of  
shops, homes and cars and even the window of a halfway house for 
recently released federal prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited for the city of San Antonio,'' Spurs chairman  
Peter Holt said in Portland after the game. ``I love you, San 
Antonio. San Antonio has truly been our sixth player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs came to San Antonio from Dallas before the 1973-74  
season. The franchise is the first of the four old ABA teams to 
make it to the NBA Finals. Indiana could join them if the Pacers 
win the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Williams, a sixth-grade teacher, has been a Spurs  
supporter since the team's arrival in town. Naturally, he's 
thrilled the Spurs finally made the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great. It couldn't happen to a better bunch of guys,''  
Williams said. ``It's great for everyone, the city and the whole 
community.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks To Start Sprewell Vs. Pacers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks are changing their starting  
lineup. The Indiana Pacers are changing their offensive focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for Latrell Sprewell and Reggie Miller to play much bigger  
roles tonight in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. New York 
leads the best-of-7 series 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's a gamble right now,'' said New York coach Jeff Van  
Gundy, who announced Sunday that Sprewell would start alongside 
Allan Houston, Charlie Ward, Larry Johnson and Chris Dudley, with 
Kurt Thomas moving to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way I think we can win the series,'' Van Gundy said.  
``We caught a miracle last night, we all know it. You need one if 
you're going to move on, but you can't rely on it. It was a great 
hang around, hang in there, hard-fought win. But looking back at 
it, we were dominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers, who got little offense from anyone other than Rik  
Smits in Game 3, will look for more production from Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has attempted 33 shots, including 11 3-pointers, and is  
shooting 42 percent. He attempted only nine shots in Game 3, and 
the Pacers were unable to get him the ball for the final shot in 
Games 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question I've got to be more aggressive, I've got  
to shoot more -- 15 to 20, even 25 shots,'' Miller said. ``And I 
think that's going to be the case more in Game 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to getting Miller more shots, Bird says he plans to  
run more plays for Jalen Rose -- especially if Travis Best's groin 
pull keeps him out of the game and forces Rose, averaging 7.7 
points in the series, to be the backup point guard. Best said his 
status was 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks won Game 3 Saturday night when Larry Johnson made a  
rare four-point play with 5.7 seconds left for a 92-91 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers were still upset with the ruling by official Jess  
Kersey on the play, saying the referee should have disallowed the 
shot since the whistle came at least a half-second before Johnson 
released the shot. But the Pacers also knew that they blew a chance 
to lock up the game by failing to score from the field over the 
final 3:20. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question a lot of breaks have gone New York's way, but  
we've given them a lot of breaks as well. A few of these games 
we've kind of handed it to them on a silver platter,'' Miller said. 
``We've played terrible the last three minutes of each and every 
game and were lucky to win one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, on the other hand, have played poorly in the first  
few minutes of each game. That was one of the reasons why Van Gundy 
has decided to start Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is the potential for foul trouble with the  
Knicks' remaining big men in the absence of Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like that Kurt and (Chris) Dudley were out there  
together when they're both the primary defenders on (Rik) Smits,'' 
Van Gundy said, referring to the Pacers' 7-foot-4 center. 
``Secondly, I didn't like our second unit defense giving up 30 
points in the second quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Van Gundy started Dudley in place of Ewing in Game 3,  
Indiana used 6-7 Chris Mullin to guard the 6-11 Dudley. In Games 1 
and 2, New York had exploited the matchup of Mullin trying to guard 
the faster, stronger Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of being able to go at Mullin, we couldn't. And so it  
really got us off to a bad start, and I think it would continue to 
get us off to a bad start,'' Van Gundy said. ``I know I would have 
made the change if the miracles wouldn't have happened last night, 
and miracles happening don't change what I think we need to do to 
win this series.''

<HEADLINE>  'Salesman' Wins Four Tony Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Attention was paid -- again. Fifty years after it  
won the Tony Award as best play, Arthur Miller's ``Death of a 
Salesman'' was named best revival of the Broadway season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's memory tale of a jazz musician's  
fractured family life, was named best play Sunday, while ``Fosse,'' 
a revue saluting the swivel-hipped choreography of Bob Fosse, was 
picked best musical. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a little something for everyone, except ``The Iceman  
Cometh,'' which had been expected to provide ``Salesman'' with most 
of its competition. The show and its star, Kevin Spacey, went home 
empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides revival, ``Salesman'' won the top acting prize for its  
star, Brian Dennehy, who plays Willy Loman, a true believer in the 
American dream even after it has gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never realized how wonderful this play is and what it  
means to people,'' Dennehy said after the show. Also getting awards 
were Elizabeth Franz, for her poignant portrait of Willy's 
long-suffering and loyal wife, Linda, and Robert Falls, who 
directed the revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, whose play opened on Broadway in 1949, received a  
lifetime achievement award during Sunday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience stood to cheer the 83-year-old playwright when he  
came on stage. ``Just being around to receive it is a pleasure,'' 
he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	In his acceptance speech, Miller expressed the hope that  
Broadway would provide the changes ``so that a new generation of 
fiercely ambitious playwrights will ... once again find welcome for 
their big world-challenging plays, somewhere west of London, 
somewhere east of the Hudson River.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Side Man,'' which has been struggling at the box office and  
recently added television star Scott Wolf to the cast, was the only 
best original play nominee written by a living American playwright. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice if in years to come, I'm not the only  
American guy up there,'' Leight said. Frank Wood, who plays the 
distraught father in ``Side Man,'' took home a featured actor 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Academy Award-winner Judi Dench added a Tony to her collection,  
picking up a best actress prize for her role as an elegant, 
embattled actress in David Hare's drama ``Amy's View.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The winning bit is not the best, the nominating bit is the  
best. ... There is no such thing as doing a performance on your 
own, unless you are doing a one-woman show,'' said Dench, who 
received an Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernadette Peters and Martin Short won the top musical acting  
awards -- Peters for her portrayal of Annie Oakley in ``Annie Get 
Your Gun,'' and Short for playing more than a half-dozen roles in 
``Little Me.'' ``Annie'' was also named best musical revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Bourne took home two of ``Swan Lake's'' three awards --  
for direction of a musical and for choreography. Its third, for 
costume design, went to Lez Brotherston, for his modern-dress 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	The other design prizes went to ``Not About Nightingales'' (sets  
by Richard Hoover) and ``Fosse'' (lighting by Andrew Bridge). 
``Fosse's'' other prize was for orchestration by Ralph Burns and 
Douglas Besterman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the most popular -- and expected -- winners came from  
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' Kristin Chenoweth, as the 
bossy Sally Brown, and Roger Bart, who plays Snoopy, were both 
loudly cheered for their awards as best featured (supporting) 
actress and actor in a musical. ``My left paw just went numb,'' 
Bart said as he accepted his prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53rd annual Tony Awards were held at the Gershwin Theater.  
The ceremony featured a series of presenters instead of one host. 
Rosie O'Donnell, who did those chores for two years, declined this 
year because of her busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tony winners in 21 categories were chosen by more than 800  
voters, including members of the theater community and theater 
journalists. The Tonys are named after Antoinette Perry, founder of 
the American Theater Wing, a theater service organization.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 92.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose broadly today as corporate mergers  
helped distract investors from lingering concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 92.45 at 10,892.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 5.73 at 1,333.48, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 45.23 at 2,523.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was light as traders already began looking ahead to  
Friday, when the government's producer price index is expected to 
offer signals about inflation and perhaps an indication of whether 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to keep the economy 
from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have slipped in the weeks since the Fed warned it might  
raise rates, and volume has been lower than normal as Wall Street 
weighs the impact of a possible increase. But prices have turned 
around in recent sessions, and on Friday, the Dow made one of its 
strongest rallies in weeks, gaining 136.15 to close at 10,799.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Major corporate mergers stimulated trading today. AlliedSignal  
rose 5 1/16 to 63 7/16 and Honeywell rose 8 1/2 to 113 1/2 after the 
companies announced they will merge, creating an aerospace 
parts-and-electronics conglomerate. AlliedSignal, a component of 
the Dow, was a major contributor to the index's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Salt Lake City banks, First Security Corp. and Zions  
Bancorp, will merge in a deal worth $5.9 billion. First Security 
rose 5 1/4 to 23 7/8, and Zions fell 8 1/8 to 57 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express rose 2 9/16 to 127 13/16 after Prudential  
Securities raised its rating on the stock. Prudential cited rising 
credit card use in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which saw its price slump last month, rose 4 to 120 today.  
A J.P. Morgan analyst said IBM's stock could reach 150 within 12 
months, citing strong sales of its electronic business software. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad base of good corporate news heartened Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those sessions where all is right with the  
world,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	But airline stocks couldn't keep up with the market's rally  
today. UAL Corp., the parent of United Air Lines, warned analysts 
late Friday that its second-quarter earnings will fall below well 
estimates. Its shares fell 1 11/16 to 64 1/8, and weighed down several 
other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
		   Advancers outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 512.0 million shares, 
well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> School Calls Nail Clipper a Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Administrators Monday recommended the  
expulsion of a 15-year-old girl for taking to school a nail clipper 
with a 2-inch knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Tawana Dawson, a sophomore, said she thought the attachment was  
simply for cleaning fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel made up of a principal and two assistant principals from  
other schools sided with Pensacola High Principal Norm Ross, who 
wants Tawana expelled for a year under a zero-tolerance policy on 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher saw Tawana's clipper on the desk of another student  
who had borrowed it to trim her fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	Tawana's parents said they will seek a hearing before the case  
is sent to the Escambia County School Board for a decision. If 
expelled, she could attend a school for students with disciplinary 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In defense of the zero-tolerance policy, Ross recalled the  
stabbing deaths of two students at schools where he was an 
administrator, and he also cited the massacre in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said all Pensacola High students are given a handbook that  
includes the weapons ban, and are also shown pictures of prohibited 
items, including nail clippers similar to Tawana's.

<HEADLINE> Driving Through Poland Is Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOCHACZEW, Poland (AP) -- For 22 years, Piotr Deja has driven  
trucks over the mostly two-lane, never-divided road that bisects 
Poland from Belarus in the east to Germany in the west. He knows 
every turn, every pothole. 
</P>
<P>
	The bypass around the western city of Poznan is ``so  
pothole-ridden that axles and suspensions get broken,'' the 
weathered 45-year-old complained, sitting in the Warsaw office of 
his Bielmagistral transport company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten Bielmagistral trucks broke down last year, most of them on  
that rutted stretch, he said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rough roads aren't the only problems for Poland's truckers.  
</P>
<P>
	It takes at least half an hour to travel through Sochaczew, a  
town of 5,000 people about 30 miles west of Warsaw that has three 
traffic lights along a 1,000-foot stretch, Deja said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Driving through Poland is like breaking stones,'' he concluded  
with a broad-shouldered shrug. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after communist rule ended and Poland embarked on  
market reforms, it enjoys steady economic growth that has attracted 
tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the economic success has created a paradoxical transport  
situation -- the more wealth created and investment attracted, the 
more traffic on an already overloaded road system. 
</P>
<P>
	With only 160 miles of modern highways, road transport means  
losses for businesses that must get goods from Baltic ports inland 
or from factories to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors point more to roads in Poland (as a problem) than in  
other east European countries,'' said William Crisp, senior vice 
president at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the early 1990s, telecommunications were seen as a great  
limitation for business, but that has been generally overcome by 
lots of investment,'' Crisp said. ``Now, lack of roads is going to 
be the same kind of limitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many businessmen limit car trips as much as possible, choosing  
to go by train or plane instead, said Krzysztof Klapa, a spokesman 
for the McDonald's hamburger chain in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	``When somebody is told to drive to Poznan, he is terrified. It  
is like risking your life,'' Klapa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Urban, financial director at Thomson Polkolor, Poland's  
sixth biggest exporter to the European Union, has complained to 
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the rough roads, Thomson Polkolor now uses sturdy  
plastic packaging -- instead of the foam popular in Western 
countries -- to protect its products during transport from the 
factory in Piaseczno, outside Warsaw. Last year, almost 5,000 
cathode ray tubes were damaged during shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``What counts is the opinion about the product,'' Urban said.  
``Our customers had objections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem appears unsolvable, at least in the near future.  
</P>
<P>
	According to the Transport Ministry, 37 percent of Poland's  
roads need immediate repair and an additional 42 percent require 
work within three years. Improving the roads to European Union 
standards would cost the equivalent of $23 billion, or roughly 60 
percent of this year's national budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Marek Fitos said 5,400 miles of Poland's main  
roads -- 25 percent of the total -- have ruts more than two-thirds of 
an inch deep, which is considered dangerous for traffic. The 
problem comes from heavy trucks that grind down asphalt constructed 
for lighter vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitos blamed poor roads as a factor in 30 percent of crashes.  
The Transport Ministry noted vehicle accidents in 1997 caused 
losses worth 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product, 
more than three times the 2 percent threshold recommended by the 
World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor lighting, few sidewalks and a lack of bypasses around small  
towns also cause a disproportionate number of pedestrian deaths -- 
about half Poland's 7,500 total traffic fatalities in 1998, Fitos 
said. The European Union average is 15 percent to 20 percent, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the problem is increased traffic.  
</P>
<P>
	Obstacles to owning a car during the communist years -- poverty,  
shortages, bureaucratic wrangling -- have diminished. Over the past 
decade, foreign automakers flooded the formerly closed market and 
increased the number of Polish-registered cars by 50 percent to 
13.5 million -- a number the communists had not expected to reach 
until the second decade of the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, more cars carrying foreign visitors are  
driving across Poland's borders -- 27 million last year, almost 
triple the number from the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Grzegorz Bielowicki, head of the U.S. company Euroad that is  
Poland's biggest private transport business, said the traffic and 
poor roads mean Euroad trucks average 28 mph in Poland compared to 
50 mph in neighboring Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to Germany, he said, ``we need 50 percent more trucks  
to do the same number of orders.''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 92.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose broadly today as corporate mergers  
helped distract investors from lingering concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 92.45 at 10,892.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 5.73 at 1,333.48, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 45.23 at 2,523.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was light as traders already began looking ahead to  
Friday, when the government's producer price index is expected to 
offer signals about inflation and perhaps an indication of whether 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to keep the economy 
from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have slipped in the weeks since the Fed warned it might  
raise rates, and volume has been lower than normal as Wall Street 
weighs the impact of a possible increase. But prices have turned 
around in recent sessions, and on Friday, the Dow made one of its 
strongest rallies in weeks, gaining 136.15 to close at 10,799.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Major corporate mergers stimulated trading today. AlliedSignal  
rose 5 1/16 to 63 7/16 and Honeywell rose 8 1/2 to 113 1/2 after the 
companies announced they will merge, creating an aerospace 
parts-and-electronics conglomerate. AlliedSignal, a component of 
the Dow, was a major contributor to the index's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Salt Lake City banks, First Security Corp. and Zions  
Bancorp, will merge in a deal worth $5.9 billion. First Security 
rose 5 1/4 to 23 7/8, and Zions fell 8 1/8 to 57 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express rose 2 9/16 to 127 13/16 after Prudential  
Securities raised its rating on the stock. Prudential cited rising 
credit card use in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which saw its price slump last month, rose 4 to 120 today.  
A J.P. Morgan analyst said IBM's stock could reach 150 within 12 
months, citing strong sales of its electronic business software. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad base of good corporate news heartened Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those sessions where all is right with the  
world,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	But airline stocks couldn't keep up with the market's rally  
today. UAL Corp., the parent of United Air Lines, warned analysts 
late Friday that its second-quarter earnings will fall below well 
estimates. Its shares fell 1 11/16 to 64 1/8, and weighed down several 
other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
		   Advancers outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 512.0 million shares, 
well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.70 to 636.22, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 5.54 at 775.44.

<HEADLINE> Free Voice Mail Service on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- People juggling a flood of messages  
pouring in from e-mail, answering machines, and pagers can now 
organize the calls with free services offered through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	San Mateo-based Onebox.com announced its services Monday,  
joining a growing list of companies offering free communications on 
the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Onebox.com touted itself as the first to combine voice mail, fax  
and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Users get a free, personal local telephone number and e-mail  
address. Anyone who calls the telephone number can leave voice 
mails and faxes. Users can then instantly retrieve those messages 
over the phone or log on to a Web site, where they can click on 
audio files that will play the voicemail message. 
</P>
<P>
	Onebox.com is introducing the service later this month in the  
New York area, northern California and Austin, Texas with plans to 
expand later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Onebox.com is the one way to bring your life together. The one  
place to manage all your communications,'' said CEO Ross Bott. 
</P>
<P>
	Bott has brought in more than $20 million in private investments  
for Onebox.com, including the venture capital firms IVP and 
Brentwood Venture Capital, and ZDNet, a technology news Internet 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving away free stuff has a lot to do with the culture of the  
Internet,'' said Alan Alper, an analyst at Gomez Advisors, a market 
research firm in Concord, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started as a place to share information for free. Now the  
businesses are giving consumers something and in return, they hope, 
they're getting something back more valuable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That return is threefold: revenue from advertising, information  
on the customer for future marketing purposes, and establishing a 
relationship with customers who may be willing to pay for new 
services later. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Onebox.com's competitors, Telebot, which launched in  
February, has 35,000 users. eFax.com, which also launched in 
February, has signed over 600,000 users taking advantage of the 
free fax-to-email service. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotmail, a free e-mail service launched in 1996 and now owned by  
Microsoft, is the world's largest e-mail service, with more than 40 
million active members. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotmail member Jay Schorr of Miami, Fla., said he didn't see any  
reason to pay for e-mail elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hotmail has everything I need in one place. It's fast,  
reliable and free,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clouds Warned Town of Epic Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Battered by flying debris and soaked by rain,  
survivors of tornado that had torn apart their town and killed 117 
people hopped on horses and rode 10 miles to summon help -- by 
telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	The first doctors and rescue supplies arrived at midnight -- by  
train. 
</P>
<P>
	A century ago, disaster was unforeseeable and relief was, by  
today's standards, primitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no CNN, C-SPAN, no Red Cross, no federal or state  
aid,'' said Lynn Regnier, executive director of the New Richmond 
Preservation Society. ``The telegraph and telephone went out, so 
people had to get on horseback and ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twister that struck the small farming community of New  
Richmond late on the sultry afternoon of June 12, 1899, caused the 
eighth greatest recorded loss of life by a single tornado in the 
United States. It remains the deadliest ever in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	In six to seven minutes, the cyclone decimated the town about  
300 miles northwest of Milwaukee. It flattened many Victorian 
neighborhoods and reduced New Richmond's business district to 
rubble, sweeping away a cigar factory, several saloons, the livery, 
three churches and more than 200 other structures. 
</P>
<P>
	It killed 400 animals, including some from the Gollmar Brothers'  
two-ring circus, whose attractions had swollen the town's 
population of 2,000 with visitors. At least 150 people were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It essentially cut out the heart of the town and left a few  
tattered corners,'' said Mary Sather, curator of the New Richmond 
Heritage Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanche M. Powers, a 2-year-old toddler when the twister hit, is  
one of two known living survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my uncles came running over and took my brother and  
sister's hands and took them to grandfather's cellar,'' Powers 
said. ``My mother picked me up and followed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powers, now 102, still remembers stories she was told, mainly by  
her mother, about huddling in the cellar with 16 family members and 
several passersby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody got killed, except my grandfather was very tall and he  
got hit by a couch leg flying through the air,'' she said. ``My 
grandmother took her white underskirt off and made bandages. His 
head bled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, on the tornado's 100th anniversary, New Richmond  
will pause to dedicate its new Cyclone Memorial Park, with 117 
trees, and read aloud the victims' names as church bells toll. The 
Preservation Society is offering a weekend full of events to 
commemorate the centennial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes today aren't likely to take as many lives because of  
advance warning capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then they didn't have weather radars, organized  
spotters,'' said Rusty Kapela, a National Weather Service 
forecaster. ``People didn't know what was coming other than with 
their eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One who spotted trouble coming was Margaret Walsh, who was  
heading home from the circus with her 4-year-old son, Charles, when 
she stopped at a corner to chat with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``They saw the storm approaching. They saw black clouds and  
thought they better hurry home,'' said Walsh's daughter, 
100-year-old Bernadette E. Byrne, the other known survivor, who was 
then 10 months old. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair made it home as rain, then hail, provided a brief  
respite from the sultry day. But Walsh later learned that the 
friend she'd stopped to talk with died in the cyclone, along with 
that woman's husband and child. 
</P>
<P>
	An eyewitness said two funnel clouds merged to form a huge,  
twisting column over Lake St. Croix. It turned northeast, hugging 
the ground and gaining force as it took aim at New Richmond, 
according to ``A Modern Herculaneum,'' a 1900 history of the 
tornado's wrath by schoolteacher Anna P. Epley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The noise increased and the darkness became deeper and  
denser,'' Epley wrote. ``One after another each building was 
wrenched and twisted, lifted from its foundation, crushed and 
scattered by a restless and venomous force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People huddled together in terror wherever they could find a  
place, Sather said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After they came out, they were stunned and in shock,'' she  
said. ``It was a feeling of unreal. One of the survivors said the 
air was so thick and the pressure was so terrible they could hardly 
breathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors searched for loved ones among ruins of homes, some of  
which were burning after the tornado toppled their kerosene lamps 
and wood stoves stoked for supper. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were wandering around with just the clothes on their  
backs,'' Regnier said. ``The dead and injured were taken to several 
churches. There were people trapped in the fires. Even though it 
was raining, it wasn't putting out the fires because they were so 
low underneath the rubble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Byrne's house, the winds ripped off windows and doors but  
left the building standing. Her mother told of the many victims who 
came to their door. 
</P>
<P>
	``That evening people kept coming to our house looking for dry  
clothing,'' Byrne said. ``People were going through our closets and 
dresser drawers. Some of the people she knew, and some she 
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relief supplies arrived from towns throughout Wisconsin and  
Minnesota. Sixteen states gave money, according to historical 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the 117 people killed were never identified. They are  
buried at Immaculate Conception Church Cemetery in New Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people from other areas, people passing  
through,'' Regnier said. ``It was June. It was hot, and they had to 
bury them quickly.''

<HEADLINE>  NASCAR Matriarch Hawkins Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Eloise Hawkins, chairman and chief  
executive of the authority which ran stock-car races at Bowman Gray 
Stadium, died Monday after a battle with cancer. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, Hawkins was head of the Winston-Salem Speedway,  
Inc., which conducts NASCAR-sanctioned stock-car racing at the 
municipal stadium under a lease from the city. She remained active 
in its operation until the illness struck her earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>

executive of the authority which ran stock-car races at Bowman Gray 
Stadium, died Monday after a battle with cancer. She was 82.

	Since 1970, Hawkins was head of the Winston-Salem Speedway,

<HEADLINE> Miller, Hagen Honored at Tonys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Both playwright Arthur Miller and actress Uta  
Hagen spoke eloquently and passionately about theater when they 
received Tony Awards for lifetime achievement in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen, who received her Tony in the Gershwin Theater before the  
television cameras rolled Sunday, exclaimed, ``What a wonderful 
80th birthday present.'' She made her Broadway debut in 1938 in 
``The Seagull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She thanked her mentors, the Lunt family, actress Eva Le  
Gallienne, director Harold Clurman and her late actor-teacher 
husband, Herbert Berghof, ``for never letting me forget it was my 
destiny to answer my calling to a noble art, the theater, the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to think our destinies are now ruled by economics,''  
she said. ``I want to throw out a battle cry to those who think as 
I do -- that this transcendental art will become insignificant only 
as we allow it to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen, who acted this season off-Broadway in ``Collected  
Stories,'' said, ``I'm not going to be embalmed by this award. I 
will stay young, in my passionate fight to do the work the way I 
think it should be done, to be of service to the community, to 
provide food for the soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 83, whose ``Death of a Salesman'' won the Tony Award for  
best revival Sunday, 50 years after it won as best new play on 
Broadway, had his first play produced at the University of Michigan 
in 1934. His latest play, ``Mr. Peters' Connections,'' was 
presented off-Broadway last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, ``Thank you for this honor. Just being around to  
receive it is a great pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to share a hope with you that I have nursed for a  
long time.'' Mentioning Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh,'' 
which also is running on Broadway now, Miller said that if such 
plays, long and with big casts, arrived at producers' desks now, 
``they would be unlikely to end up on a Broadway stage. The 
Broadway economy would make them too expensive and risky to be 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that a new dimension and fresh resolve will inspire the  
powers that be to welcome fiercely ambitious playwrights. And that 
the time will come again when they will find a welcome for their 
big, world-challenging plays, somewhere west of London and 
somewhere east of the Hudson River.''

<HEADLINE> Ron Low Quits As Oilers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Ron Low quit as coach of the Edmonton  
Oilers today after refusing an offer to return for another season 
at the same salary he earned in 1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has pretty much been in the cards for the last three  
weeks,'' Low said in today's editions of The Edmonton Journal. 
``The deal I was offered, I just can't accept it. I'm going to 
walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Low, 48, coached the Oilers for 4 1/2 seasons and was offered the  
same $325,000 he received last season, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement was announced, but the Journal reported the  
Oilers were expected to promote assistant Kevin Lowe, a former 
Edmonton defenseman in its days as an NHL powerhouse, to head coach 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers finished the regular season at 33-37-12 and barely  
made the playoffs. But the season ended abruptly in the first round 
when they were swept in four games by the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Low's departure is not a surprise. His contract expired June 1  
and Low waited more than a month before receiving an offer from the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Low considered quitting after a 4-1 loss to the New Jersey  
Devils on March 17, a game in which the Oilers were outshot 30-4 by 
the middle of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	``That Jersey game might have been the lowest point in my life  
because I thought these guys (his players) were trying to get me 
out of here,'' Low said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Low became the Oilers' coach on April 6, 1995, replacing George  
Burnett 35 games into the strike-shortened 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was coach, the Oilers never finished the regular season  
over .500. They missed the playoffs twice and the only time they 
won more games than they lost was in the two upset playoff series. 
His final regular-season record is 139-162-40.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Mark McGwire did not start the opener of  
the St. Louis Cardinals' three-game series at Kansas City tonight 
because of a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire took part in pregame drills, including batting practice.  
But Shawon Dunston started at first base. McGwire said he probably 
will play Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``My back is a little sore, I did that for the fans,'' McGwire  
said after hitting several home runs during batting practice, 
including a long one into the shrubbery under the video board in 
left-center. ``My back has been killing me for two-plus weeks 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was sold out for the first time since opening day as  
many Cardinals fans made the trip from St. Louis. 
</P>

	On Friday, a game with the Cincinnati Reds was postponed when an

Royals were swept in a doubleheader Saturday and fans endured a 
63-minute rain delay Sunday as the Reds won 14-3.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Tell Leaf To Grow Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Some of the San Diego Chargers are wondering if  
Ryan Leaf will ever get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf was back in the team's fold Monday, mostly repentant about  
skipping the first three days of a voluntary summer workout session 
in order to honor charity commitments, some of which involved golf 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Some veterans weren't exactly understanding, and said they plan  
to sit down soon to spell it out for Leaf, the $31.25 million 
quarterback who was benched after nine starts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to grow up,'' linebacker Lew Bush said. ``Be a  
leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush clearly is growing weary of Leaf's antics. Although these  
workouts are voluntary, most of the Chargers are here. The 
organization felt Leaf needed to be here the whole time to try to 
overcome his disastrous rookie season and because new coach Mike 
Riley continues to put in his offense. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leaf was absent when the workouts began last Wednesday. They  
resumed Monday and continue through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that it happened,'' Leaf said. ``I felt the coaches  
knew I wasn't going to be here; coach Riley thought it would just 
be Friday. It was just a miscommunication on both our parts. I'm 
going to take responsibility for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I won't take back the fact I was in Orlando for the  
Children's Miracle Network. That was real positive. Anytime they 
ever ask me to do that again, I really want to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush and running back Natrone Means were literally  
shaking their heads at Leaf's sense of priorities coming off a 5-11 
season during which he melted down on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Youth is one thing, ignorance is another,'' Bush said. ``Hey,  
I don't want to be here. I've got a whole lot better things than 
this right now. But after our season last year, our season before 
that ... and we gave up a lot to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're asking too much. I think it's time he's  
going to have to start kicking back to us. Hey, the little growing 
pains are over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means, one of the few starters left from San Diego's 1994 Super  
Bowl team, said the players made a big mistake last year in not 
talking to Leaf about his blunders on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to wait like I did last year,'' Means said. ``I  
think last year we let a lot of stuff go. Way too much stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means said he doesn't intend the meeting with Leaf to be  
confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way we're going to win is as a group,'' he said. ``It  
was proven last year. Here we are with the No. 1 defense and up to 
a point we had the No. 2 rushing offense. But we still weren't a 
group and we weren't winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Until this is ingrained in him -- hey, the only way we're going  
to be able to do it is togetherness -- it's not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego had the NFL's 24th-ranked offense. Leaf threw just two  
touchdown passes while throwing 15 interceptions and losing four 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Means said Leaf's absence last week was a distraction, with  
players wondering, `Who is Ryan not to be here?' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we're coming off the Super Bowl year,'' Means  
said. ``It's not like we just got done tearing it up as the highest 
scoring offense in the NFL. We need the work. That's the bottom 
line. Everybody needs the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who's been replaced by Jim Harbaugh as the starter, said  
sitting down with some of the veterans ``would be a welcome change 
to me. No one talked to me before. I felt kind of isolated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means said there is still a tremendous upside to Leaf's career.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're here for, is to get him to that upside. We  
could use a little help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he had a productive talk with Leaf, mostly about  
avoiding situations like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley noted that Leaf's antics mostly happened before he was  
hired in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have one glitch since January, that's pretty good,''  
Riley said. ``That's a lot better than I do with my own kids.''

<HEADLINE> What Makes the Spurs So Good? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- What makes the San Antonio Spurs so good?  
</P>
<P>
	Start with the obvious -- Tim Duncan and David Robinson. Throw in  
consistent outside shooting from Avery Johnson, Sean Elliott, Jaren 
Jackson and Steve Kerr along with the toughness and experience of 
Mario Elie. Now add some serious togetherness and unselfishness. 
</P>
<P>
	It all adds up to a team that has won 10 playoff games in a row,  
sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers in the 
process, to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in the 
franchise's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every man on our team is important, and I think they know  
it,'' Robinson said. ``Even the guys who don't play push us in 
practice. I'm proud of this team. They've accepted roles. I'm proud 
of how far they've come. I'm having as much fun with this group as 
I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers got a textbook lesson in what it's  
like to face a team with big-time talent up front and confident 
role players everywhere else. The defense has to double-team Duncan 
and Robinson, and that would leave someone else open on the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every game they played, they seemed to get better,'' Portland  
coach Mike Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The book on defending the Spurs is to concentrate on Duncan and  
Robinson and take the chance that the other players won't come 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	But the role players have not let the Spurs down, helping them  
to a 42-6 record since the team got off to a 6-8 start and fans 
were calling for coach Gregg Popovich to get fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were 6-8, we had the opportunity to really turn on  
each other,'' Robinson said. ``When you have a lot of talent, it's 
easy to start pointing fingers, and we didn't do that. We decided 
we would come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Portland, Elliott was a consistent threat. After an  
injury-plagued season last year, he became a major offensive force 
both with his outside shot and his ability to drive. He shot 56 
percent and averaged more than 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been double-teaming Tim and David all year long,''  
Popovich said, ``so we've had a lot of practice spreading the court 
with shooters. We just have to make shots or we're going to lose 
basketball games. When we first came out of the gate, and we were 
6-8, we had no inside-outside coordination. Now we have that 
coordination down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, overlooked and underappreciated around the NBA but not  
on his team, was 6-for-12 in Sunday's 94-80 series-clinching 
victory against Portland. He forced the Blazers' Damon Stoudamire 
to take back his earlier observation that no team could win an NBA 
title with Johnson as the point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	When the two met on the court after Sunday's game, Stoudamire  
said, ``I told him he's proving everybody wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's teammates know how important he is, and when the point  
guard slipped and bruised his knee in the second quarter Sunday, 
they rushed to his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so scared,'' Duncan said. ``He is the biggest part of  
our team. Knowing A.J., I knew that even if he broke his leg, he 
would get back up and play again. It's an incredible relief that 
he's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, like Elie and Johnson, came up the hard way in the NBA,  
bouncing from team to team before finding himself the designated 
shooter off the bench for the Spurs. He tied a team record with six 
3-pointers in the Game 3 rout of Portland, then hit three of them 
in the fourth quarter as San Antonio pulled away in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Now add Kerr to the equation. After going 0-for-12 in the  
playoffs and struggling to find his place, Kerr settled in as 
backup point guard against Portland and hit a big 3-pointer in the 
second quarter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You stop one guy, and another guy gets on a roll,'' Duncan  
said. ``The way we're winning shows how awesome we are.''

<HEADLINE> Charismatic OK After Leg Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sometimes fairy tales just don't work out.  
</P>
<P>
	The connections of Charismatic, a record crowd of 85,818 at  
Belmont Park and millions of TV viewers found out the hard way when 
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner took a bad step near the 
finish line and pulled up yards short of a Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The charts will show Charismatic finishing third Saturday behind  
long-shots Lemon Drop Kid and runner-up Vision and Verse, but 
somewhere before the finish line the former claimer turned champion 
fractured two bones in his left front ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he underwent successful surgery, in which four screws  
were inserted to align the broken bones in the ankle. His career as 
a racehorse is over, but the great-grandson of Secretariat can look 
forward to a career as a stallion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't always play out these Hollywood scripts like we want  
'em,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas said Sunday morning. ``Life isn't 
that way. You just can't plan it all out and have it fall into 
place. That isn't reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reality is that the Bob and Beverly Lewis-owned Charismatic  
finishes a befuddling career that saw him tossed into claiming 
races twice, and less than four months later emerge as the top 
3-year-old and on the brink of becoming the 12th Triple Crown 
winner and first since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would happen,'' Lukas said, ``I really did.''  
</P>
<P>
	What did happen was for the third straight year, and for the  
seventh time since '78, the Derby-Preakness winner failed in the 
1 1/2-mile Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	In '97, Silver Charm nearly gave the Lewises a Triple Crown, but  
their Bob Baffert-trained colt was beaten by 
three-quarters-of-a-length by Touch Gold. In '98, Baffert's Real 
Quiet was nosed out of the Triple Crown by Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew how hard it was,'' said Lukas, who has won 12 Triple  
Crown races in his Hall of Fame career, ``but we played two pretty 
good scripts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont, though, didn't go according to plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, Charismatic, ridden by jockey Chris Antley, chased  
the pace from the start, laying second behind Silverbulletday from 
the clubhouse turn until less than a half-mile remained. But 
Baffert's star filly tired in the stretch and finished seventh 
after being eased by jockey Jerry Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he ran away with her,'' Bailey said. ``It's  
tough to go head-and-head that far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, with Jose Santos aboard, was fourth with a  
quarter-mile to go, then was taken outside for his winning charge 
down the middle of the track. He took the lead from Charismatic 
with an eighth of a mile remaining and won in 2:27 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas was only mildly surprised Charismatic stuck with  
Silverbulletday, who had won 11 of 12 starts against her own sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was laying a lot closer than I thought, but the horse was  
full of run,'' Lukas said. ``You don't want to give up what comes 
easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was worried about Silverbulletday before the race,  
Lukas said, ``We never mentioned her, frankly. We just treated her 
like another horse in the race. We were worried more about the 
closers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, trained by Scotty Schulhofer, returned $61.50  
for a $2 bet -- the fourth largest payoff in 131 runnings of the 
Belmont. The winner paid $26 for place and $10.60 to show. 
Schulhofer returned to his home in Florida on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Randy, said Lemon Drop Kid was fine but tired, and will  
be pointed toward the Jim Dandy at Saratoga on Aug. 8, followed by 
the Travers on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse, trained by Bill Mott, paid $44.40 and $17,  
while Charismatic returned $3.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of Luck was fourth, followed by Stephen Got Even, Patience  
Game, Silverbulletday, Menifee, Pineaff, Prime Directive, Teletable 
and Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley, meanwhile, had tears streaming down his face as he  
dismounted just past the finish line and attended to Charismatic, 
gently lifting the colt's injured leg to keep pressure off the 
broken bones before being loaded into an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave everything he had and ran as hard as he could,''  
Antley said, ``but he couldn't give the people what they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has had several well-known horses retired due to injuries  
at the peak of their careers, including '94 Preakness and Belmont 
winner Tabasco Cat, '94 Juvenile Fillies champion Flanders, '95 
Derby and Belmont winner Thunder Gulch and '96 Derby winner 
Grindstone. During the '93 Preakness, Union City fractured a leg 
and did not survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain element of the public that just can't handle  
this part of the game,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic underwent 2 1/2 hours of surgery at Dr. Stephen  
Selway's clinic at Belmont Park. A cast was fitted to the leg and 
the colt will need a few days to rest before he is able to be 
shipped to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be just fine,'' Selway said. ``It was not the worst  
injury of this kind I've ever seen, but it was a nasty one. This 
horse had horrendous stress, but he was an ideal patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was in ideal health, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was absolutely a maintenance-free horse,'' Lukas said of  
the son of Summer Squall, who earned $2,038,064 in winning five of 
17 career starts. ``He's had one vitamin shot since I've been 
training him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The colt not only restored Lukas to his usual spot as the  
nation's top trainer in a year he will be inducted into racing's 
Hall of Fame, he also came along at the right time for Antley, who 
was out of racing for 18 months because of substance abuse and 
weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse picked him up, too,'' Lukas said. ``This was  
probably more therapy mentally for him than anybody could 
prescribe.''

<HEADLINE> Travolta Can Now Fight for Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Travolta's comeback is old news. Now he's  
so big in Hollywood he can really throw his weight around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can get things done that a studio might not normally do,''  
Travolta says in Sunday's Daily News. ``I told my manager, `If we 
can't do the things now that we want to do, what good is the 
power?' It's a waste, basically. Let's test it and try to get the 
things done that we believe in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One result of that effort is ``Battlefield Earth,'' a movie  
version of L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction novel. Shooting begins 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the pinnacle of using my power for something,'' Travolta  
said. ``We've been trying to make it for 10 years, but we never got 
a script that was right. Hubbard had been writing sci-fi, fantasy 
and pulp since 1937, and it's high time it was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard is the founder of Scientology, which Travolta has  
followed for nearly a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's latest release is the upcoming ``The General's  
Daughter,'' a drama about an Army investigator trying to find a 
killer.

<HEADLINE> School Calls Nail Clipper a Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A 15-year-old girl's apparent desire to  
keep her nails trimmed could keep her out of school for a year 
because administrators believe her clippers are a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tawana Dawson told administrators she thought the two-inch metal  
blade attached to her nail clipper was to clean nails. 
Administrators said it violates a weapons policy and are 
recommending the sophomore be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingernail clippers are among the banned weapons pictured in a  
student handbook at Pensacola High. A teacher saw Tawana's clipper 
on the desk of another student who had borrowed it to trim her 
fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a panel made up of a principal and two assistant  
principals from other schools sided with Principal Norm Ross, who 
wants Tawana expelled under a zero-tolerance policy on weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Tawana's parents plan to seek a hearing before the case is sent  
to the Escambia County School Board for a decision. If expelled, 
she could attend a school for students with disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are going to need to take the pencils out of the school,  
the scissors out of the school,'' Tawana's father, Darryl Beaton, 
told Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	In defense of the zero-tolerance policy, Ross recalled the  
stabbing deaths of two students at schools where he was an 
administrator, and he also cited the massacre in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Tawana had a good disciplinary record and a 2.8 grade  
point average -- just below a B -- those factors were not taken into 
consideration. Ross said the schools cannot have double standards 
for kids doing well academically.

<HEADLINE> Court Seeks Views on Indian Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today sought the Clinton  
administration's views on a lawsuit by a Hopi Indian tribe member 
in Arizona who says an electric power plant on the Navajo 
reservation illegally refused to hire him because he is not Navajo. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers  
before acting on an appeal in which the plant operator argued that 
federal law allows non-Indian employers doing business on a 
reservation to give hiring preference to members of that 
reservation's tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled that the Hopi's lawsuit should go  
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navajo Generating Station is operated by the Salt River  
Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District, an Arizona 
quasi-government body. The district's lease with the tribe requires 
it to give job preference to ``qualified local Navajos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Dawavendewa, a Hopi Indian who lives near the Navajo  
reservation, applied for a job at the plant in 1991. He ranked 
ninth among the top 20 applicants in an employment test, but said 
he was not further considered for the job because he was not a 
Navajo or married to a tribe member. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawavendewa sued, saying the district violated Title VII of the  
1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars job bias on grounds of race, sex, 
religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the lawsuit. Title VII includes  
language exempting tribal preferences, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated  
Dawavendewa's lawsuit. The exemption in Title VII does not permit 
preferences based on which tribe someone belongs to, the appeals 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also said hiring preferences allowed by a  
separate law, the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act, did not apply to the power plant job. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the Salt River district's lawyers  
said the 9th Circuit court's ruling means tribes no longer can 
require on-reservation employers to give preference to tribe 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawavendewa's lawyers said federal law allows tribes, but not  
other employers, to give preference to their own tribal members in 
limited circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and  
Power District vs. Dawavendewa, 98-1628.

<HEADLINE> Oakland Designates Candiotti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tom Candiotti, a knuckleball pitcher who  
has won 150 games in a 16-year major league career, was designated 
for assignment today by the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's have 10 days to trade Candiotti, release him or assign  
him to the minor leagues. Oakland general manager Billy Beane said 
he thinks Candiotti will end up with another major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there may be some interest,'' Beane said. ``I  
believe Tom will be pitching in the major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti was 3-5 this season with a 6.35 ERA in 11 starts. Over  
his last seven starts, he was 1-3 with a 7.53 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiott signed a two-year deal with the A's before the 1998  
season. He went 11-16 last season, leading the club in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really meant a lot to this organization,'' Beane said. ``He  
was a class act on and off the field. That's why this is 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Athletics called up pitcher Tim Hudson to fill  
Candiotti's spot on the roster. Hudson will make his major league 
debut on Tuesday as the A's starter against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, who had his 150th career victory on May 28 against  
Baltimore, has played for Milwaukee, Cleveland, Toronto, Los 
Angeles and Oakland. He has a career record of 150-163. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's made the move more because of Hudson's performance than  
Candiotti's, Beane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Tim Hudson, if anything, led to this,'' Beane said.  
``He's pitched so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his promotion to Triple-A Vancouver on April 24, Hudson  
was 4-0 with a 2.20 ERA in eight starts. Prior to that, he was 3-0 
with a 0.50 ERA in three starts for Double-A Midland.

<HEADLINE> Tony Telecast Drops Musical Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues'' is singing  
the blues over its treatment on the 1999 Tony Awards telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-minute production number from the Tony-nominated musical  
was dropped from the telecast when the Sunday night television show 
threatened to go longer than the two hours allotted by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Television exposure is one of the perks for the nominated  
musicals. It gets their productions in front of a national audience 
of potential ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't register anywhere on the radar of what is playing on  
Broadway,'' James Morrison, a spokesman for ``Blues,'' said Monday. 
``It is quite hurtful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telecast's overnight ratings were hardly blockbuster.  
Preliminary figures indicate a drop of 24 percent, down to a 7.9 
rating and a 13 share, compared with a 10.3 and a 16 share last 
year, when Rosie O'Donnell was the host, said Tony spokesman Keith 
Sherman. This year's telecast had a succession of hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blues'' producer Eric Krebs said he has hired a lawyer to  
advise him on a course of action, but added, ``The Tony management 
committee has been responsive to exploring various options for 
rectifying the damage to our show.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Award Productions, which produced the television show,  
issued a statement saying it regretted the exclusion of ``It Ain't 
Nothin' But the Blues,'' but added that many ``cuts were made 
throughout the telecast.'' All of the cut material ``fell prey to 
one of the inherent perils of live television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Blues'' was nominated for four Tonys, including best musical,  
but didn't win any. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other nominated musicals -- ``Parade,'' ``The Civil  
War'' and the Tony winner, ``Fosse'' -- put on production numbers, 
as did the four nominees for best musical revival. The decision to 
cut ``Blues'' was not mentioned on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Oscars, which run longer and longer every year, the  
CBS portion of the Tony Awards operates under a strict two-hour 
time limit. Another hour, preceding the CBS telecast, is seen on 
public television. 
</P>
<P>
	The elimination of scenes from nominated musicals has happened  
only once before. In 1995, a segment from ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' was 
cut from the Tony show, but a number from that revue also opened 
the evening, so the musical was still represented on the television 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blues'' cast members were philosophical about their omission  
from the Tony show. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out on stage again tomorrow night and sing  
the blues and it will be a little more bluesy this week,'' said Ron 
Taylor, who also co-created the revue. ``But we will recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number deleted from the telecast was a bitter anthem of  
exclusion called ``Members Only.'' The lyrics include: ``It's 
members only. It's a private party. Don't need no money to qualify. 
Don't bring your checkbook. Bring your broken heart. It's members 
only tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Doc Rivers Hired To Coach Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Doc Rivers was hired as coach of the  
Orlando Magic today, succeeding Chuck Daly and taking over a team 
that was upset in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a four-year guaranteed contract worth about $8  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rivers has no previous coaching experience, he played  
for some of the league's best -- Pat Riley, Larry Brown and Mike 
Fratello. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has demonstrated over the course of his career to be a true  
leader and has been preparing for this day for some time,'' Orlando 
general manager John Gabriel said. ``He has a very magnetic 
personality and a sharp basketball mind. He is an outstanding fit 
for our organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who played 13 seasons in the NBA, has spent the last  
three years as a television analyst for Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot people ask why. They say: `You're doing TV. You have  
five and 10 seconds to second-guess everyone. If you go to the 
other side, that's going to change ... It's a big risk,''' River 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My answer is I'm a risk taker. My answer is this is what I  
want to be. This is what I want to do. And who cares about the 
risk. Look at the reward if things pay off. I don't really worry 
about risks. I tend to look at how I can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic tied for the second-best record in the Eastern  
Conference this season with a 33-17 mark, then lost in the opening 
round of the playoffs to Philadelphia in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame coach Chuck Daly retired on May 24, saying he was  
weary of the travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, 37, becomes the second-youngest coach in the league  
behind New York's Jeff Gundy, who's also 37. He plans to hire a 
veteran as his top assistant and reportedly is considering three 
former NBA coaches, Dave Wohl, Jim Cleamons and Johnny Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers played for the Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, New  
York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs before retiring in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 10.9 points, 5.7 assists and three rebounds a game  
as a player and his teams made the playoffs 10 times. He played for 
the first eight years of his career in Atlanta, was an All-Star in 
1988 and is the Hawks' career leader in assists.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Church Group Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLOVERDALE, Calif. (AP) -- With tears streaming down their faces,  
members of a church group held hands and prayed on the edge of a 
highway following a crash that claimed three of their number. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 members of Redwood City-based Templo La Luz were  
traveling south on U.S. Highway 101 near Cloverdale on Sunday when 
the van, carrying 13 people, blew its left rear tire. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Perfecto Rodriguez, 37, lost control of the van and  
it plunged 50 feet down an embankment, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard groaning, people calling out for God, saying, 'Lord,  
help us!''' said Rudy Zamora, who was enjoying a picnic on the 
Russian River when the sound of crashing metal echoed through the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	A Menlo Park man was pronounced dead at the scene, and a  
12-year-old boy, also of Menlo Park, died later at Sutter Medical 
Center in Santa Rosa, officials said. Their identities were 
withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
	The third victim, Faustino Castenada, 40, died today at Sutter  
Medical Center, said nursing supervisor Dwayne Stincelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten others were injured, one critically.  
</P>
<P>
	The group goes to Lake Mendocino every year for a retreat.  
Members spent the weekend studying the Bible, singing, playing 
soccer, horseshoes and volleyball, and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon accident closed the state's main coastal highway  
in both directions for an hour. Cloverdale is about 80 miles 
northwest of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> 40-Something Fights Dominate Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Someone said it looked like five guys getting  
ready to make retirement speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Holmes, James ``Bonecrusher'' Smith, Tim Witherspoon, Greg  
Page and Juan LaPorte, ranging in age from 49 down to 39, however, 
were in New York today to talk about fighting on a pay-per-view 
card June 19 in the Crown Coliseum at Fayetteville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The show kicks off what is planned as a Legends of Boxing  
series, and promoter Cozell McQueen was said the age limits are 35 
to 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you'll let a 50-year-old man fight,'' McQueen was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he's still living,'' shouted Holmes, who will turn 50 Nov.  
3. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes beat Smith and Witherspoon defeated Page in 1984 in  
heavyweight title fights. Retirements, not difficult negotiations, 
held up the rematches for which there has been no particular public 
clamor. 
</P>
<P>
	McQueen said as of Monday 1,200 tickets ranging from $20 to $150  
had been sold. The arena holds 11,500. The pay-per-view price is 
$19.95. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPorte, a 39-year-old former featherweight contender, will  
fight a 10-round junior middleweight bout against 43-year-old Billy 
Costello, WBC super lightweight champion in 1984-85. Costello did 
not attend the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for Legends of Boxing was that of Smith, a 46-year-old  
native of North Carolina who came out of retirement to fight three 
times last year. On July 4, he was stopped after one round against 
Joe Bugner when he dislocated his right shoulder while throwing a 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smith-Holmes fight will be a 12-round bout for the Legends  
heavyweight championship. Holmes stopped Smith on a cut in the 12th 
round in defense of the IBF title Nov. 9, 1984. Holmes held the WBC 
or IBF titles from 1978 to 1985. Smith won the WBA title by 
stopping Witherspoon in the first round Dec. 12, 1986, and lost it 
on points to Mike Tyson March 17, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time flies when you're having fun,'' said Holmes, who fought  
relatively often from 1991 through 1997. He did not fight last year 
when he signed to fight George Foreman, but that match was 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an individual can still get in shape to perform, then I  
don't see why they should retire him from what he loves doing,'' 
Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as two guys who know how to fight and are in the same  
age category and are in shape, I don't see anything wrong with 
it,'' said Smith, a North Carolina boxing commissioner in 1995-97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Witherspoon-Page bout is scheduled for 10 rounds. The  
41-year-old Witherspoon outpointed the 40-year-old Page for the 
vacant WBC title Dec. 12, 1984. Witherspoon later won the WBA 
title, and Page also became a WBA champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith showed up at the news conference with a bottle of  
something he called Power Punch, which he hopes to market. Asked 
what is in it, Smith said: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fruit and vegetables and a lot of other ingredients that  
make you feel young.''

<HEADLINE> Money Approved To Identify Missing Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Monday approved spending of $6  
million over the next three years to help states and the FBI in 
searches of missing persons. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed 370-4, would cover state costs of  
entering profiles of unidentified persons in a nationwide FBI file 
so that the FBI can cross-reference that information with its 
missing persons file. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without this funding, thousands of families will be deprived  
of a chance of closure,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., sponsor of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI created a missing persons file within its National Crime  
Information Center in 1975, and eight years later established an 
unidentified persons file. 
</P>
<P>
	But matching the information from the two files is not always  
possible because states are not required by law to report 
unidentified bodies to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio named the bill ``Jennifer's Law'' after a 21-year-old  
woman in his Long Island district, Jennifer Wilmer, who disappeared 
in 1993 while living in California. The bill now moves to the 
Senate for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Monday also passed and sent to the White House a  
trade bill that, among other provisions, suspends duties on certain 
imported pharmaceutical products used for AIDS and cancer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said the legislation, already  
approved by the Senate, could significantly reduce the costs of 
some AIDS and cancer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 375-1, also extends permanent normal trade  
relation status to Mongolia and gives duty-free treatment to 
individuals associated with the 1999 Special Olympics, the 1999 
Women's World Cup, the 2001 International Special Olympics, the 
2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and the 2002 Winter 
Para-Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	---	 
</P>
<P>
	The missing persons bill is H.R. 1915.  
</P>
<P>
	The trade bill is H.R. 435.

<HEADLINE> Paula Jones' Husband Wants Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Paula Jones' husband has filed for divorce,  
citing irreconcilable differences with the woman who accused 
President Clinton of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's filing, Stephen Jones also asks for joint legal and  
physical custody and joint visitation of the couple's sons, 
Stephen, 6, and Preston, 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple separated in February, and the boys currently live  
with their mother in Cabot, Ark., according to the filing in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones acknowledged in March that she and her husband were  
living apart but said they would be reunited in Arkansas and their 
marriage wasn't in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now,'' said Susan Carpenter-McMillan, Mrs. Jones' friend  
and former advisor. Carpenter-McMillan declined to elaborate, 
adding only that ``at this time, the boys will remain with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who married in 1991, disagreed over strategy in her  
now-settled sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, Mrs. Jones 
has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones and Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement of  
$850,000 in November on her claim that Clinton made an improper 
sexual advance to her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991. Her 
share of the money came to $201,000, with the rest going to 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with Stephen Jones' lawyer, Lee Salisbury, was  
not returned.

<HEADLINE> Dallas' Cup Winners Seek 2nd Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars can be divided into two groups:  
those who've won the Stanley Cup and those who haven't. It's hard 
to tell which is more excited about being in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that an NHL championship is about the only accolade  
missing from the career resumes of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Ed 
Belfour, it is tempting to say the have-nots are the most 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Then listen to Craig Ludwig, a 38-year-old defenseman who is one  
of eight Cup winners who will be seeking another championship 
beginning Tuesday night against the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of us who know what it's like at the end of the  
rainbow,'' said Ludwig, who won with Montreal in 1986. ``We want 
that back. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a few of us, we know we don't have many kicks of the can  
left. To us, this is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Carbonneau falls into that group. A two-time Cup winner in  
Montreal, the 39-year-old forward can't help but smile as he 
recalls the thrill of receiving hockey's holy grail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the ultimate, the best feeling in the world,'' Carbonneau  
said. ``It's also the hardest feeling to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once you're there, there are no other places you'd rather  
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are driven by the same goal, but the stories shared  
in their locker room are secondhand. Only six Buffalo players have 
been to the finals, and between them they've won a total of one 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a child I didn't even know what a Stanley Cup was, but it  
is my focus right now,'' said goaltender Dominik Hasek, who led the 
Czech Republic to the 1996 Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas and Buffalo franchises are 0-3 in finals. The Sabres  
lost in 1975, while the Minnesota North Stars fell in 1991 and 
1981. This is the Stars' sixth season in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier equates Dallas' experience  
with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel for them that the time is now,'' Regier said. ``They  
have some older players that don't have a lot of years left, and 
they have to seize the opportunity. But our players feel the same 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the top-seeded team in the West, come into the finals  
on a roll, having beaten second-seeded Colorado twice while facing 
elimination. Some viewed that series as the true finals, noting the 
Western Conference champion has won the last three Cups, each with 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano upset several Buffalo players by saying Dallas ``is  
anticipating a bit of a letdown in the finals'' because the Sabres 
are the East's seventh-seeded team. He clarified his stance Sunday 
and praised Buffalo for ``deserving to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody else was saying that there was going to be a  
letdown; I didn't think there would be,'' he said. ``I think that's 
a lot of the hockey geniuses around the NHL predicting that, 
considering Colorado and our series was a pretty good series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, however, are still treating Modano's initial  
comments as bulletin-board material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a team that's really on a mission is going to  
have one of their leaders saying that the team's going to have a 
letdown after the conference final,'' Buffalo center Michael Peca 
said. ``If a team's on a mission, those kind of statements aren't 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're already setting up excuses, saying that the Western  
Conference was their Stanley Cup. But he may say things that he 
doesn't realize he's saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres were underdogs against Ottawa, Boston and Toronto,  
and won each series, so they don't mind the same label despite a 
playoffs-best 12-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's saying that they're going to run away with it.  
We're fine with that,'' Buffalo defenseman Jason Woolley said. 
``We're used to that. Nobody expected us to get this far, that's 
for sure.''

<HEADLINE> WTO Members To Help Poorer Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The Netherlands said today that it and other  
European countries are spearheading efforts to create an 
independent center to give poorer countries the clout to defend 
their interests in disputes before the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advisory Center for WTO Law will provide legal advice on  
trade law to least-developed and developing countries at a much 
lower cost than the usual commercial rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``For developing countries this really constitutes a very  
important step in order to be able to exercise our rights and 
obligations in this organization,'' Colombian trade Ambassador 
Nestor Ossorio told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The center would be entirely independent of the WTO and would  
employ lawyers to help countries take cases through the 
organization's dispute settlement procedure. It would also provide 
training and intern schemes to help give countries the expertise to 
fight their own cases in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute procedure allows countries to bring cases where they  
feel other nations are discriminating against imported goods, but 
smaller countries have complained that they do not have the 
resources to go up against the might of trading powers such as the 
United States or the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Some six to eight sponsoring developed countries are needed to  
provide the bulk of the funds for setting up the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerrit Ybema, the Dutch minister of foreign trade, said the  
Netherlands will provide the largest amount announced so far -- 
about $2.25 million. Sweden, the United Kingdom, Norway and Denmark 
have pledged a million dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
	Other developed countries, such as Japan and New Zealand, have  
shown interest in supporting the project. Organizers said they hope 
the United States will contribute, but it has yet to commit any 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing countries, including Colombia, Zimbabwe, Egypt and  
the Philippines, also have pledged their support. They will be 
asked to pay up to $300,000 each to set the center up. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizers hope to have enough countries on board to launch  
the center officially during the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dispute settlement mechanism is the cornerstone of the  
success of the WTO, and we believe that a fair and effective 
mechanism which is above all accessible to all members of the WTO -- 
including the developing members -- is the key to the future of the 
multilateral trading system,'' said Stuart Harbinson, 
representative of Hong Kong, China.

<HEADLINE> Paige One of Best in Negro Leagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Buck Leonard and Satchel Paige were selected  
the best Negro Leagues figures in a survey conducted by the Society 
for American Baseball Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard, a first baseman with the Homestead Grays, helped led  
the Grays along with catcher Josh Gibson to nine consecutive Negro 
National League titles from 1937-45. He was elected to baseball's 
Hall of Fame in 1972 and died two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige, elected to the Hall of Fame in 1971, was regarded as the  
greatest Negro Leagues pitcher and made his major league debut in 
1948, going 6-1 for the Cleveland Indians. He died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Cool Papa Bell was third followed by Oscar Charleston, also an  
outfielder. SABR had about 100 Negro Leagues writers, historians 
and researchers take part in its survey. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the top 40 Negro leaguers, SABR will release four  
other surveys on June 25 at its annual convention: top 40 19th 
century figures, top 15 major league umpires, 40 greatest 
contributors to baseball and 100 greatest 20th century players.

	Milosevic Says He'll Carry Out Deal  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Daylong talks between Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright and the foreign ministers of six Western nations 
and Russia broke up today without Moscow's agreement on tough NATO 
peace terms for Kosovo that are laid out in a draft U.N. Security 
Council resolution. Despite the stalemate, Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic offered assurances that he intends to carry out 
a peace agreement, a U.S. official said. Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari, who had spoken to Milosevic by telephone, relayed the 
assurances to Albright and the seven foreign ministers drafting the 
resolution that would endorse the peace plan the Yugoslav 
government agreed to Thursday.

Australian aid workers who were convicted by Yugoslavia as spies. 
Jackson also criticized a U.S. policy against assistance to 
Yugoslavia unless President Slobodan Milosevic is removed from 
power. He said that is unfair to Yugoslav citizens who must rebuild 
their nation's economy while recovering personally from the 
bombings. Jackson helped last month win the release of three U.S. 
soldiers held in captivity by Yugoslavia.

Hampshire the last state in the country to honor the slain civil 
rights leader with a holiday. The holiday will be observed for the 
first time Jan. 17, 2000. The bill ends years of attempts to put 
King's name on the holiday, which had been celebrated as Civil 
Rights Day under a legislative compromise passed in 1991. King's 
son, Martin Luther King III, represented the King family at the 
signing.

	Indonesia Takes Part in 'Free' Vote

<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesians got their first real taste  
of democracy since 1955 as they voted today for a new Parliament, 
which will help choose the next president. It was another major 
step away from authoritarian rule that ended when riots by 
pro-democracy student groups forced President Suharto to resign in 
May 1998 after 32 years in power. Most Indonesians have never voted 
in a truly free election. The first and last open ballot was 44 
years ago. The ones that followed were largely rigged to ensure 
that candidates from the ruling Golkar Party won.

	Ore., N.H. Lead in Economic Growth  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oregon and New Hampshire enjoyed the fastest  
economic growth among the states in 1997, and California's economy 
remained the biggest. A Commerce Department report broke down the 
nation's gross domestic product, the total output of goods and 
services, to show the amount contributed by each state. The total 
U.S. economy grew in 1997 by 4.3 percent. Hawaii saw its economic 
output shrink in 1997, declining 0.2 percent, as the state's 
economy was hit hard by fallout from the Asian currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> EU Unemployment Holds at 9.6 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Unemployment in the European Union  
remained at 9.6 percent in April, unchanged from March, the EU's 
statistics office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate was down from 10.1 percent in April 1998,  
according to Eurostat's report. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 11 euro-zone nations, unemployment fell slightly to 10.4  
percent in April from 10.5 percent in March. In April 1998, the 
unemployment rate in the euro region was 11.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's unemployment rate in April remained more than double  
those of its main trading partners, with the U.S. jobless rate 
standing at 4.3 percent and Japan's at 4.7 percent, Eurostat noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg continued to register the lowest unemployment in the  
EU, at 2.9 percent. Spain's was highest at 17.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurostat gave the following April 1999 figures for the 15 EU  
countries: 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg, 2.9 percent in April, compared with 2.8 percent in  
March; Portugal, 4.3 percent, up from 4.2 percent; Ireland, 6.8

<HEADLINE> More Thoroughbreds Foaled Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Going in, D. Wayne Lukas was convinced he had  
the most ``dead-fit'' thoroughbred in the Belmont. Coming out, he 
had a horse that was neither fit nor, thankfully, dead. With that 
mixed blessing, racing will have to make do for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	It will now be at least 22 years between Triple Crown winners,  
and judging by what happened to Charismatic on Saturday, it could 
be longer than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Lukas' game colt won that race, he would have beaten more  
rivals than any of the horses who succeeded in sweeping the series 
-- 41 in all; 18 in the Derby, 12 in the Preakness and 11 in the 
Belmont. That would have been nine more opponents than War Admiral 
conquered when he set the mark by winning all three classics in 
1937. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more, crowded fields are becoming a fact of life. More  
thoroughbreds are being foaled each year, more are being pointed 
toward the Triple Crown races, and more making it into the starting 
gates for the biggest races, starting with the first Saturday in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the money that's drawing the horses,'' Lukas said.  
``It's the desire of the owners to be in the main arena. The purses 
are secondary. The Triple Crown and the Breeders' Cup are the 
high-profile days for our sports, and everybody in the game would 
like to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to get there, they have to have horses. And not just  
any horses, but 3-year-olds thoroughbreds who will test the limits 
of their endurance at a stage in their development when they are as 
high-strung as teen-agers and just as unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there have to be enough to fill out the programs at the  
Breeders' Cup races in the fall, in the Derby prep races throughout 
the winter and spring, the Triple Crown races in May and June, and 
the Haskell or Jim Dandy or Travers as the summer lengthens into 
another fall. 
</P>
<P>
	When Charismatic was pulled up a few yards down the track from  
the finish line with what X-rays would later reveal were two broken 
bones, the natural suspicion was that the horse was overworked. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Belmont was the colt's fifth race in the last 64  
days, beginning with a fourth-place finish in the Santa Anita Derby 
on April 3 before successive wins in a Derby prep race, then the 
Derby itself and then the Preakness. On top of which, Lukas had a 
history of horses breaking down just past the wire in the biggest 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years ago, he lost a horse named Union City in the  
Preakness, setting off whispers that the horse was not sound going 
in. The next year, Tabasco Cat, the Preakness winner, was retired 
with a leg injury. Then Flanders, his champion juvenile filly, 
broke a bone and had to be retired as well. Three more of his best 
colts, 1995 Preakness winner Timber Country, 1995 Derby winner 
Thunder Gulch and 1996 Derby champion Grindstone, ran into trouble 
and had to quit prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' horsemanship and his judgment both were called into  
question in the past, and the criticism stung. Which may explain 
why Dr. Stephen Selway, the veterinarian who performed the surgery 
Sunday to repair Charismatic's fractured canon bone, went out of 
his way to make clear the horse was sound heading into the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was, '' Selway said, ``no evidence of any preexisting  
condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As grim as Saturday afternoon was, Lukas was so pleased with the  
way Sunday unfolded that even the prospect of critics feasting on 
his decision did not worry him. Charismatic's owners, Bob and 
Beverly Lewis, had stood behind Lukas at every step of the process 
and the colt's future as a stallion was at least as bright as the 
past he left out on the racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``As many horses as I train and at the level we compete, I'm  
going to get criticized,'' Lukas said. ``The only critics I have to 
worry about are my owners -- the Lewises. I can't worry about what 
people say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The racing game isn't about to change, and apparently neither  
will Lukas. He trains horses hard for campaigns that are only going 
to get tougher with each successive year. The one-time basketball 
coach is already the most successful trainer of his time, and 
likely to stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the Belmont, Lukas explained how his philosophy of  
training varied with each individual horse, even though the guiding 
principle always remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they reflect your personality, and mine's aggressive.  
You can probably guess that when I was coaching (basketball), my 
teams pressed and ran. Even,'' he said, ``when the kids I had 
couldn't press or run.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Racketeering Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify the  
reach of a federal law that allows people to file lawsuits alleging 
existence of a racketeering conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will use a Florida case to decide, probably  
sometime in 2000, whether someone can file such a lawsuit even if 
the harm suffered was caused by an act that did not amount to 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert A. Beck II was hired in 1983 as president and a director  
of the Southeastern Insurance Group, a Florida-based company whose 
subsidiaries wrote bonds for construction companies. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawsuit contends he became aware in 1988 that other company  
leaders were engaging in misconduct, such as creating false 
financial statements and diverting company money to their personal 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck says that after he reported the alleged improprieties to  
state insurance officials, the company hired a consultant that 
issued a report criticizing his performance. He was fired in May 
1988, he said, for refusing to participate in illegal conduct and 
for being a whistleblower. 
</P>
<P>
	The company filed for bankruptcy in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
	Beck sued members of the company's board of directors under  
conspiracy provisions of the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt 
Organizations law, which allows triple-damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled that Beck could not sue under RICO because  
any harm to him was not caused by racketeering acts. The 11th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``A terminated whistleblower, although he may have a wrongful  
termination claim, has not suffered an injury that was proximately 
caused by the defendants' racketeering activities,'' the appeals 
court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Beck's lawyers said other federal  
appeals courts have allowed lawsuits in which people contend they 
were harmed by acts committed as part of a racketeering conspiracy, 
even though those specific acts did not amount to racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the former company directors said Beck failed to  
show a RICO conspiracy or that he was fired in retaliation for his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Beck vs. Prupis, 98-1480.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced moderately today as  
investors were encouraged by the strength on Wall Street last week, 
while the dollar sank against the yen on speculation about a 
rumored call for large-scale tax cuts in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 175.14  
points, or 1.07 percent, ending the afternoon session at 16,475.89. 
On Friday, the Nikkei closed up 73.25 points, or 0.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.84 yen late afternoon, down 0.78 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and below its New York level of 122.22 yen 
late Friday. The currency ranged from 120.55 yen to 122.45 yen 
today in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices were buoyed initially by  
Friday's 136.15-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average, 
which closed at 10,799.84. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors were relieved by New York's rally,'' said Hidenori  
Karaki, a manager at Ryoko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the rise in Tokyo was mainly futures-led, although  
individual shares in the high-technology and pharmaceutical sectors 
also put on big gains mirroring the movement of their counterparts 
in New York Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues beat retreating issues 851 to 319, while 130  
issues were unchanged. Volume on the first section was estimated at 
379.03 million shares, up slightly from 369.03 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the stock market was news that the government  
decided on Friday to close Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co., a 
troubled medium-sized Japanese insurance company. The company's 
liabilities were found to have exceeded its assets by $1.64 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei's finish, however, ended up well below its midday  
level of 16,576.51 points because of profit-taking in the 
afternoon, said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general manager at Daiwa 
Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 12.12 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,328.65. 
The TOPIX closed down 1.16 points, or 0.09 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen on  
speculation that the head of Japan's Liberal Party, Ichiro Ozawa, 
called for large-scale, permanent tax cuts to stimulate the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the comments moved the markets even though Ozawa  
has repeatedly made similar remarks and the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party has not heeded the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.47 yen, down  
from 125.29 late Friday in Tokyo, on news that negotiations between 
NATO and Yugoslavia had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond stood at  
1.640 percent late Tuesday, up from Friday's finish of 1.635 
percent, pushing down its price to 97.93 yen from 97.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> Low Turns Down Oikers' Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Ron Low turned down a contract offer  
today to return as coach of the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal I was offered, I just can't accept it,'' said Low,  
who declined a no-raise $307,000 contract for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I should be the lowest-paid coach in the NHL,''  
the 48-year-old told CBC Radio. ``That's the way I feel and I feel 
very strongly about that. And that's where this would have left me, 
and I think that's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Lowe and Walt Kyle are the leading candidates to take over  
as coach of the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, a former defenseman who helped the Oilers win five Stanley  
Cup championships, was an assistant to Low last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle is coach of the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey  
League. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not offered the job of head coach to anyone,'' Bill  
Tuele, the team's vice-president of public relations, said Monday. 
``Ron didn't reject the offer until 11 p.m.'' on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Low's contract expires June 30, Sather said he'd allow Low  
to begin looking for work elsewhere immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing in the fire,'' Low told CBC Radio.  
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers were 139-162-40 in regular-season play since Low  
replaced George Burnett during the strike-shortened 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	They were 33-37-12 last season, a respectable showing  
considering they lost goalie Curtis Joseph to free agency and top 
forwards Doug Weight and Ryan Smyth slumped. But there was 
dejection when, after the first-round playoff triumphs of 1997 and 
1998, the Oilers were swept in the first round by Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, general manager Glen Sather stated: ``Ron  
exercised his prerogative not to accept our offer and stated he 
wanted to explore other opportunities with other teams. Ron has 
been a tremendous asset over the years, bringing enthusiasm and 
hard work to the rink ever day, but now we have to look to the 
future with a new coach at the helm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers' offense was 10th-best in the NHL, but the power play  
ranked 18th. Critics said Low became too close to his players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers never finished a regular season above .500 with the  
Low, an Oilers assistant coach for six years before getting the top 
job, running the bench.

<HEADLINE> Prudential Payments in Suit Top $1B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Within two years after a huge class-action  
settlement with aggrieved policyholders was approved, Prudential 
Insurance Co. of America has sent $1 billion in checks to 250,000 
claimants. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the 650,000 claimants who sought compensation  
for Prudential's admittedly deceptive sales practices, and were 
found to be eligible, can expect payment by the end of the year, 
company spokesman Robert DeFillippo said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential has acknowledged that some of its sales agents  
persuaded customers to trade in their old life insurance policies 
for newer, more expensive ones without telling them the old 
policies would lose their value. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion in direct payments does not include the value of  
other remedies Prudential has given customers, such as paid-off 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential has set aside $2.6 billion for compensation to more  
than 1 million customers and expects to stay within those 
parameters, DeFillippo said. 
</P>
<P>
	All 650,000 of the claimants have been notified of what they can  
expect in the settlement, the company said in providing figures 
through April to insurance regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent qualified for the highest level of relief, a  
full refund with interest, or a paid-up policy. The bulk, 64 
percent, are to get partial refunds or adjustments to their policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 81,000 claimants, or more than 12 percent, were told they  
probably will not get anything because they failed to prove they 
were misled or were victims of the types of abuse the settlement 
was intended to remedy, Prudential said. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder, about 3 percent, purchased policies during years  
not covered by the settlement, or products not covered in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 650,000, some 48,000 have told Prudential they will use  
the settlement's arbitration provision to appeal their award, while 
95,000 have not yet said how they intend to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was approved in March 1997 by a federal judge in  
Newark, where Prudential is based. The payout could be among the 
largest ever in class-action litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 8 million people who bought 10.7 million life insurance  
policies from 1982 to 1995 were notified that they might qualify 
for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential got replies from more than 1 million who thought they  
had a claim, and 650,000 said they wanted to seek the largest 
amounts of compensation by demonstrating they were misled. The 
others were allowed to purchase Prudential products at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
	Some policyholders opposed the settlement, but it was upheld on  
appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to rule on the matter in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the class-action compensation, Prudential has  
paid about $70 million in penalties to the 50 states and 
Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Proposes Shifting Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to break a logjam that has kept the  
House from passing any annual spending bills for the coming fiscal 
year, Speaker Dennis Hastert is proposing to shift roughly $7 
billion extra to domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which involves proceeds from anticipated sales of  
portions of the public broadcast spectrum and transferring money 
from defense and other bills, was described Monday by top House 
Republican aides speaking on condition of anonymity. They said it 
would allow Republicans to continue claiming they are obeying 
spending limits enacted in the 1997 budget-balancing pact between 
Congress and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert spokesman Pete Jeffries declined to discuss details of  
the plan, saying only that it would involve ``a reallocation of 
funds'' and that spending legislation ``will remain within budget 
guidelines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers returned to the Capitol after a Memorial Day  
recess, Hastert, R-Ill., and other Republican leaders presented 
their plan to groups of key GOP lawmakers. And though none of the 
legislators would reveal what they had been told, there was a sign 
of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of conservatives who have  
been blocking an agriculture spending bill because of 
dissatisfaction with leadership strategy, said he would probably 
end the delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied with what he's doing,'' Coburn said of Hastert's  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders hope to push the agriculture bill -- the first of the 13  
spending measures for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1 -- through 
the House as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's proposal represents an effort to avoid another  
damaging autumn spending showdown in which President Clinton, as he 
has in past years, wins billions in extra spending from a GOP 
nervous that a politically costly government shutdown would 
otherwise result. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope when those negotiations occur again this fall --  
as seems all but certain -- they will be able to limit spending 
increases and win something else in return, such as tax cuts, said 
GOP aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican hopes of quickly approving spending bills this year  
have so far been dashed. The main reason has been internal 
Republican dissension over how to deal with spending limits 
required by the 1997 budget agreement -- limits Republicans promised 
to obey when they passed their fiscal 2000 budget in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those limits, lawmakers must hold spending to $538 billion  
for all federal programs, excluding Social Security, interest to 
federal debt holders and other automatically required benefits and 
payments. The overall federal budget is $1.7 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under plans approved last month, House Republicans would spend  
$270 billion for the Pentagon, $19 billion more than this year. 
That leaves $268 billion for the 12 other bills: $25 billion less 
than this year, and more than $30 billion below what Clinton has 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives and other critics have said that under that  
blueprint, about six of the domestic spending bills covering 
education, veterans and other popular programs would not have 
enough money to even pass the House, let alone get Clinton's 
signature. That would leave Republicans in a weakened bargaining 
position for end-of-year talks with the White House, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new Hastert plan, about $7 billion would be  
distributed among many of the bills in hopes of increasing the 
number the House can pass and that Clinton would sign. 
</P>
<P>
	About $2.6 billion would come from revenue projections from  
government sales of parts of the broadcast spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest would be money shifted from the defense, military  
construction, agriculture, transportation and other bills.

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire Approves King Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The son of Martin Luther King Jr. stood  
next to the governor here on Monday as she ended the state's 
distinction as the only one without a holiday named for the slain 
civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Luther King III said it was fitting that Gov. Jeanne  
Shaheen, New Hampshire's first female governor, was the one to sign 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father believed that democracy ought to be inclusive of  
everyone, and I think your signature on this bill signifies the 
progress we've made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day will be officially  
observed for the first time in New Hampshire on Jan. 17, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of the hard work of all the men, women and young  
people of this state, all 50 states will be unanimously observing 
the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.,'' King said. ``It's 
certainly appropriate as we go into the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change, approved by the state House and Senate last month,  
ends 20 years of attempts to put his name on the holiday, which had 
been celebrated as Civil Rights Day under a compromise passed in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents had argued that singling out King would detract from  
other American heroes such as George Washington and Abraham 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew this day would come -- we always knew we would  
overcome,'' said state Sen. Beverly Hollingworth, a Democratic 
sponsor of this year's legislation. ``We're doing for the state 
what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did for the nation -- turning a 
source of shame into a source of pride.''

<HEADLINE> Ore., N.H. Lead in Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oregon ranked No. 1 in terms of economic  
growth among all states in 1997 while Hawaii, buffeted by the Asian 
economic crisis, was last, suffering an actual drop in output, the 
Commerce Department reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The department on Monday released its latest snapshot of how  
each state is doing in relation to the rest of the country in terms 
of its gross state product, the total output of goods and services 
within the state's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy, measured by the gross domestic product for the  
country as a whole, grew by 4.3 percent in 1997, after adjusting 
for inflation. But that national figure covered a wide disparity 
among different states. 
</P>
<P>
	The best economic growth was enjoyed by residents of Oregon,  
with an increase of 7.6 percent, followed closely by New Hampshire, 
where output of goods and services rose by 7.5 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with fast growing economies were Texas, up 6.8  
percent; Arizona, up 6.7 percent and Colorado, with a 6.5 percent 
increase in output. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Hawaii actually saw its economic output shrink in  
1997 by 0.2 percent as the state suffered with the fallout from the 
Asian currency crisis, which slashed tourism and cut foreign 
investment in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with meager economic growth in 1997 were Alaska,  
with a state GDP which rose by only 0.4 percent; North Dakota, up 
0.6 percent; West Virginia, up 0.9 percent; and South Dakota, with 
a 1.7 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government figures showed the state with the biggest  
economy remained California, where total output measured $1.03 
trillion in 1997, in actual dollars before adjusting for inflation, 
or 12.7 percent of the national total of $8.1 trillion in the 
output of goods and services measured in current dollars. After 
adjusting the figures for inflation, the national total output was 
$6.97 trillion, while the California output, after inflation 
adjustment, was $883.60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other states with large shares of the national gross  
domestic product were New York, 8 percent of the national total; 
Texas, 7.4 percent; Illinois, 4.9 percent, and Florida, which 
accounts for 4.7 percent of total GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	The five largest state economies account for 40 percent of the  
nation's economy. The five with the smallest economies, each 
measuring 0.2 percent of the total, were Montana, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on state economic growth is produced by the Commerce  
Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The long lag between release of the national GDP figure,  
immediately after the quarter ends, and the state data is a result 
of the difficulty in breaking down production by state, according 
to bureau economist Gerard Aman. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater detail on the gross state product can be found in the  
Bureau of Economic Analysis' Web site www.bea.doc.gov under the 
regional heading.

<HEADLINE> Bidding for Norway Oil Co. Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The bidding war for Norway's third largest  
oil company, Saga Petroleum ASA, heated up Monday when France's Elf 
Aquitaine raised its offer by more than 8 percent, while Norsk 
Hydro ASA mulled its next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf raised its takeover bid to $2.36 billion, up from $2.16  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, which is 51 percent owned by Norway's government,  
opened bidding for economically troubled Saga on May 10 with an 
offer to trade one of its shares for three of Saga's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro also made a deal with the Norwegian state oil  
company Statoil AS, which owns 20 percent of Saga, to split the 
smaller company's assets between them. Statoil would end up with 25 
percent of Saga, and Norsk Hydro would take the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 28, Elf, which has operated in Norway since 1965, made a  
cash offer to buy Saga, promising to let the smaller company 
continue operating under its own name. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saga news release said the company welcomed Elf's latest bid,  
and ``sees this as a positive development.'' It said the offer 
would be discussed at a board meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro did not immediately comment, or disclose whether it  
might make a counteroffer before Saga's board meets. News reports 
said a new Norsk Hydro bid was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, Saga announced austerity measures after posting  
losses for 1998. The company nevertheless is attractive as a 
takeover target because it controls vast oil and natural gas 
reserves of nearly 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, with petroleum, light metals and fertilizers  
divisions, is the largest company listed on the Oslo Stock 
Exchange. It employs about 40,000 people worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Court: Feds Don't Own Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billions of dollars worth of methane gas found  
with coal under federal land is not owned by the government and can 
be claimed by companies that purchase the right to drill for 
natural gas, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-1 decision resolved a big-stakes dispute between Amoco and  
an Indian tribe in Colorado. Amoco won. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled that coal bed methane found with coal under  
the Southern Ute Tribe's reservation should not be considered part 
of the coal the federal government owns in trust for the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The methane at issue in the Colorado case has an estimated worth  
of more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said a pair of  
90-year-old federal laws that gave the government ownership of the 
coal did not apply to the methane found with it. 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed with claims by Amoco Production Co., a  
subsidiary of BP Amoco, that its contractual right to take natural 
gas from the reservation land allows it to take the methane gas 
also. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common understanding of coal in 1909 and 1910 would not  
have encompassed CBM gas, both because it is a gas rather than a 
solid mineral and because it was understood as a distinct substance 
that escaped from coal as the coal was mined, rather than as a part 
of the coal itself,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amoco Production President Andy Inglis said the ruling affects  
``over 3,000 individual royalty and working-interest owners and 
various oil and gas producers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of this century, methane gas was considered only a  
dangerous element of coal mining, but relatively recent 
technological developments have made coal bed methane commercially 
valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	When the case was argued before the court in April, Justice  
Sandra Day O'Connor accused the government, which once renounced 
ownership of the methane gas, of changing its stand only after the 
gas became valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the sole dissenter. She said the  
ambiguity in the two old laws should be construed in the 
government's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer did not participate in the case. A  
financial-disclosure statement he filed with federal court 
officials last month stated that his wife owns between $15,000 and 
$50,000 worth of Amoco stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Amoco Production Co. vs. Southern Ute Indian Tribe,  
98-830.

<HEADLINE> Poll: UK Opposed to Joining Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Opposition to Britain joining the beleaguered  
single European currency is growing among Britons, according to a 
poll published Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll for the Guardian newspaper, conducted Friday  
and Saturday, indicated that 61 percent of Britons said they would 
vote against joining the euro. That is up from 53 percent a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in support for the new regional currency comes as  
its value continues to slide to new lows. It has plunged 12 percent 
against the dollar since its January debut. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the Guardian poll indicated 52 percent were  
against Britain joining. 
</P>
<P>
	In this month's poll of 1,067 people, those in favor of monetary  
union fell back seven percentage points from 34 percent in May to 
27 percent, while the number of ``don't knows'' remained unchanged 
at 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by research group ICM, had a margin of error  
of 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE>  Khmer Rouge Commander Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A former Khmer Rouge commander was  
convicted and sentenced to life in prison today for ordering the 
1994 killing of three kidnapped Western tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of Nuon Paet was considered a test case for Cambodia's  
court system. Foreign experts have questioned whether it can 
properly try Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity 
connected to their genocidal 1975-79 rule. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprise move, prosecutors at the start of today's  
proceedings also accused two former Khmer Rouge guerrilla leaders 
now loyal to the Cambodian government in the killings of the three 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges relate to a Khmer Rouge operation that took place  
long after the group was forced out of power and had launched a 
guerrilla war against the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists -- Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet, Briton Mark Slater  
and Australian David Wilson -- were kidnapped from a train and held 
at Nuon Paet's mountaintop base. The government negotiated for 
three months with the guerrillas, at one point agreeing to pay 
$150,000 in ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deal broke down. When government troops overran the  
mountain in October 1994, the bludgeoned bodies of the three 
backpackers were found in a shallow grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuon Paet, who maintained his innocence throughout the one-day  
trial, listened to the verdict in silence. As he was being taken in 
handcuffs to a waiting police vehicle, he shouted to reporters: 
``Unjust!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Slater, Mark Slater's mother, said: ``I'm happy. It was  
worth the trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jean-Claude Braquet, father of Jean-Michel Braquet,  
called the trial a farce. ``It isn't today that they will offer the 
real truth,'' he had said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Braquet and Wilson's family believe Nuon Paet is a scapegoat for  
the killings. Wilson's family boycotted the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	As Nuon Paet's trial began, the chief prosecutor surprised the  
packed courtroom by introducing charges against two of the man's 
former superiors in the Khmer Rouge: Sam Bith, who left the 
guerrilla movement in 1997 and is now a general in the Cambodian 
army, and Col. Chhouk Rin, who also defected to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief prosecutor Yeth Chakriya said he had received clearance  
from Prime Minister Hun Sen's office to charge them. He said they 
would be tried separately from Nuon Paet. It was unclear if they 
would be taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were present as witnesses, and in their testimony they  
denied any role in the tourists' killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuon Paet was found guilty on all charges: illegal detention,  
terrorist activities, being an accomplice to murder, forming an 
armed group for the purpose of robbery and destruction of public 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed Sam Bith, Chhouk Rin and a third rebel commander, Vit  
Von, for the killings. Vit Von was killed several years ago in an 
apparent internal Khmer Rouge dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuon Paet was ordered to pay about $30,000 in compensation to  
three families of Cambodians killed or injured in the train attack 
and $5,500 in damages to the railroad company. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also ordered to pay an unspecified amount to the Wilson  
family, who have demanded $50,000 for David Wilson's death -- his 
share of the ransom money. The Wilsons' lawyer has said the family 
would give the money to a Cambodian charity.

	PUERTO OBALDIA, Panama (AP) -- The government deployed police  
along the Colombian border Monday to protect towns that have 
repeatedly been invaded by Colombian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the police were sent to the Kuna Yala region in the  
southern province of Darien, which the government declared a ``risk 
zone'' last week, limiting access to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama, which has no army, last week dispatched additional  
police to guard two villages near the Colombian border after some 
residents fled in fear of the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of the Colombian guerrillas is seen as a potential  
security problem as U.S. troops withdraw from the Panama Canal 
zone, which the United States is to hand over to Panama on Dec. 31.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- A team of International Monetary Fund

agreement for a $41.5 billion aid package approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has received $19 billion so far, but additional payouts  
depend on the government's success in cutting spending and reducing 
its huge budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy has shown an unexpectedly strong recovery after a 30  
percent devaluation of its currency, the real, in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the government announced it had surpassed all its  
goals for the first quarter. The primary budget surplus -- revenue 
minus expenses, but not including interest payments -- was $5.3 
billion, way above the target of $3.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Banks Told To Halt Selling Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top regulator warned banks to stop what he  
called the abusive practice of selling customers' personal data to 
telemarketing firms or face possible action by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees  
nationally chartered banks, said Monday the practice by a few banks 
raises ``serious legal concerns,'' which his office and other 
federal banking agencies are examining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judging from the calls we receive from state attorney(s)  
general offices around the country, the scope of the concern may be 
widespread,'' Hawke said in a speech at a meeting of bank loan 
officers in San Francisco. A text of the speech was released in 
Washington by his office, which is part of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He said sales by banks of their customers' financial data also  
raises questions about preserving consumers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One must be troubled about the implications of this practice  
for the preservation of customer confidence in the confidentiality 
of the bank-customer relationship,'' Hawke told the bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it might be unfair to burden an entire industry with  
legislation aimed at curbing the poor conduct of a few (banks), the 
persistent failure of the industry ... to address abusive conduct 
creates a fertile seedbed for legislation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Eskenazi, a spokesman for Hawke's office, declined to  
specify how many banks engage in the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the American Bankers Association were unavailable  
for comment on Hawke's speech. Spokesmen for the Bankers' 
Roundtable, a group representing the nation's biggest banks, didn't 
immediately return a telephone call requesting comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke's comments came as Democratic lawmakers push legislation  
that would give consumers the right to stop affiliated banks, 
brokerage firms and insurance companies from sharing personal 
financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and most of the financial services industry oppose a bill  
by Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., which would allow consumers to ``opt 
out'' of personal data-sharing among affiliated financial companies 
by notifying the firms in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill embodies a proposal made last this month by President  
Clinton, who urged Congress to bolster consumers' rights when banks 
and other financial companies seek to share information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke was referring in his speech to the practice by some banks  
of selling customers' data, such as addresses, phone numbers, 
account balances, credit card purchases and payment records, and 
credit ratings, to telemarketing firms in return for a commission 
on sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the personal data, the telemarketing firms can create  
profiles of bank customers and try to sell them ``trial 
memberships'' in products believed to appeal to them. If a customer 
expresses interest in a trial membership, his account at the bank 
is automatically charged by the telemarketer without his 
authorization, Hawke said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress crafts sweeping legislation to remove Depression-era  
barriers between banks, brokerages and insurers and allow them to 
merge, there is growing concern about the privacy of consumers who 
will use the new consolidated financial companies.

<HEADLINE> Apple Growers File China Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First steel, now apples. American apple  
growers filed a trade case today alleging that imports of Chinese 
apple juice concentrate are being sold at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. apple producers asked the Commerce Department to impose  
penalty tariffs on apple juice concentrate from China of up to 91 
percent in order to protect the American industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``A flood of cheap apple-juice concentrate imports from China is  
drowning much of our industry in a sea of red ink,'' said U.S. 
Apple Association President Kraig R. Naasz. 
</P>
<P>
	The apple growers asked for the penalty tariffs to counteract  
what they charged was the unfair Chinese practice of selling juice 
concentrate in the American market at prices below the cost of 
production or the home market price, a practice known as dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has filed a number of similar dumping cases  
asking for penalty tariffs as protection against a flood of cheap 
imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industries are likely to follow suit, reflecting growing  
pressures as America's trade deficit has soared to record levels 
because of the global financial crisis, which started in Asia in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	With one-third of the globe in recession, foreign producers have  
sought to unload their products in the U.S. market, the only major 
economy doing well at present. The steep devaluations in many 
foreign currencies mean that the price of the foreign products has 
fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	In their complaint, U.S. apple growers said that apple juice  
concentrate imports from China had soared more than 13-fold between 
1995 and 1998, rising from 3,000 metric tons in 1995 to 40,000 
metric tons in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	China is now the world's largest producer of apples, with a 70  
percent increase in production over the past five years. China's 
share of the U.S. market has risen from 1 percent to 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in Chinese apple juice concentrate shipments has been  
accompanied by a huge drop in prices, the group said. The average 
price for apple juice concentrate from China declined from $7.65 
per gallon in 1995 to $3.57 per gallon in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of what American growers called China's unfair  
pricing policies, the average price for American concentrate has 
been cut by 50 percent, forcing many producers to let their juice 
apples rot in the orchards this past growing season because the 
cost of harvesting the apples was higher than the price they would 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. apple industry is united in its pursuit of relief  
from the adverse economic impact of China's unfair pricing 
practices,'' Naasz said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The apple producers asked the U.S. International Trade  
Commission for a finding that their industry is being harmed by the 
Chinese imports and it requested a ruling from the Commerce 
Department on the levels of penalty tariffs that can be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department is expected to initiate a formal dumping  
investigation within 20 days and the ITC is required to make a 
preliminary determination of whether the U.S industry is being 
harmed within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade case was brought by apple interests in Michigan,  
California, Pennsylvania and Washington state. The U.S. Apple 
Association represents individual apple companies and 30 state 
apple associations representing more than 9,000 apple growers.

<HEADLINE> Undeterred Blazers Look To Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers' grand  
experiment -- trying to win an NBA title without a consistent scorer 
or a proven leader -- was a surprising success for most of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the San Antonio Spurs revealed the many shortcomings  
of the system, beating the Blazers seven out of eight times this 
season, including four straight in the Western Conference finals. 
Whenever the Spurs put together a run or hit a big shot late in the 
game, the Blazers didn't have anyone who craved the ball or the 
pressure of carrying the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Portland went 35-15 in the regular season, winning their  
first Pacific Division title since 1992. They also erased the 
stigma of losing six straight years in the first round of the 
playoffs by going deeper than almost anyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The way they ended the season didn't discourage the Blazers from  
predicting big things for 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the way we played this year,'' said forward Brian  
Grant, whose dreadlocked hair and rebounding fury came to symbolize 
the team's resurgence. ``I think we need to maybe get a couple guys 
more established as our scorers, but I kind of like the way we did 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a better feel for what it takes the next time  
around,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``Very few teams ever 
get there without having to pay the price of a learning experience. 
This is a start for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether their 4-0 sweep to the Spurs, in which they  
averaged just 76 points a game, tarnished their accomplishments, 
guard Isaiah Rider snapped, ``No. We went to the third round and 
had a great season. We'll be back stronger next season. ``Nobody 
expected us to get above seventh place (in the West) this year. The 
joke is on you guys and the others that doubted us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good team the way it is -- we almost went to the  
(NBA) finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite. Despite having so many offensive threats -- including  
Rider, Jim Jackson, Damon Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace, Walt 
Williams and Arvydas Sabonis -- showed a painful inability to score 
at times. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Dunleavy's much-publicized methods for parceling  
out minutes. Jackson, a 25-point early in his career with Dallas, 
averaged just 8.4 points this season as Rider's backup. Wallace, 
one of the game's most exciting young players, shared playing time 
at small forward with Williams and Stacey Augmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire had the most trouble adjusting to his new role. The  
more the Blazers won, the more Dunleavy relied on backup point 
guard Greg Anthony late in games. The veteran, who signed a 
two-year, $2.1 million contract as a free agent before the season, 
was simply a better defender, and Stoudamire, the hometown hero, 
stewed about it. 
</P>
<P>
	After he sat out the fourth quarter in a late-season loss at  
Utah, Stoudamire destroyed the Blazers' veneer of harmony by 
allowing his agent, Aaron Goodwin, to blast Dunleavy publicly. 
Then, after the Blazers got down 2-0 to the Spurs, Stoudamire 
picked the worst possible time to air his frustrations about not 
playing more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret it,'' said Stoudamire. ``Unfortunately, what I said  
took the focus away from the team and put it on me. It made me look 
selfish, and I am not. What I've learned is that sometimes you've 
got to bite the tongue. I could have waited and said it after the 
season was over. I've taken some hits from it, but I'm still 
standing. I learned from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I can win (the fans) back,'' added Stoudamire, who was  
booed by many at the Rose Garden crowd Sunday. ``I hope they can 
accept me for what I am. And that I am learning from my mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many fans still would like to see Stoudamire run out of  
town, a trade seems unlikely. But there could be other changes. 
Backup forward Jermaine O'Neal is the only free agent, but Rider 
has an opt-out clause in his contract. But president and general 
manager Bob Whitsitt said Monday he doesn't have any plans to

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Gunderson on Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers left-hander Eric Gunderson  
was sent today to Triple-A Oklahoma for a medical rehabilitation 
stint that can last up to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunderson, 0-3 with a 5.19 ERA in 68 games with the Rangers in  
1998, has a 7.20 ERA in 11 relief appearances with Texas this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 9 he was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive  
to the previous day, because of a small rotator cuff tear and a 
small labrum tear in his left shoulder. He has been throwing off 
the mound for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas also agreed to minor league contract with three players  
selected in last week's amateur draft -- third-round pick Hank 
Blalock, fifth-round selection Victor Hillaert of and 13th-round 
pick Jason Jones. The Rangers also signed free-agent Jamie Hill, a 
left-handed pitcher from Alabama-Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, Blalock and Hillaert were assigned to the Rookie League  
Gulf Coast Rangers. Jones will report to Pulaski in the Appalachian 
League.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Decision Just Days Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A decision on Darryl Strawberry's future is  
expected ``in the next few days,'' a spokesman for baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, has been suspended since April 24 following his  
arrest for cocaine possession. Doctors for the players' association 
and the commissioner's office have been working on a joint 
recommendation to Selig on how he should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder, who served a 90-day suspension  
in 1995 after testing positive for cocaine, pleaded no contest to 
cocaine possession and solicitation charges last month and was 
sentenced to 18 months' probation and 100 hours' community service. 
He also must undergo more drug treatment, be tested twice and week 
and pay $456 in court fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, said the decision could come as  
early as Tuesday or Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Reinstate Tremain Mack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals today reinstated  
Tremain Mack, a kick returner and defensive back who was jailed 
last season because of drunken-driving arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, 24, missed the final four games last season because of his  
latest drunken-driving arrest, in October. He has been released 
from jail after serving time for a probation violation and has been 
undergoing an NFL-mandated alcohol evaluation program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals have said they expect Mack to attend the June  
mini-camp and training camp, which begins in late July. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a history of drinking problems when the Bengals drafted  
the University of Miami standout in the fourth round of the 1997 
draft. Mack had been arrested six times in less than four years, 
with at least three of the arrests related to alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack will be subject to random drug and alcohol testing  
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack set team records in kickoff return average (25.9) and yards  
(1,165) in the first 12 games last season, with one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	He was jailed beginning in December after violating his  
probation stemming from a drunken-driving arrest Oct. 13, 1998, in 
the Cincinnati area. He underwent a mandatory two-month treatment 
program and was evaluated by the NFL under its substance-abuse 
program.

<HEADLINE> Acer, IBM Form Tech Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's Acer Group and International  
Business Machines Corp. of the United States on Monday announced a 
seven-year, $8 billion procurement and technology alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Acer, Taiwan's largest computer maker, manufactures IBM personal  
computers under an existing multibillion dollar agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new pact, IBM will sell Acer hard disk drives,  
microelectronics, networking and display technologies, the 
companies said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acer has a close ongoing business relationship with IBM ...  
both as supplier and customer,'' said Stan Shih, Acer's chief 
executive. ``This new technology alliance will allow us to combine 
the resources and advantages of both companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' collaboration could include joint development of  
new chips for use in IBM's PowerPC, the statement said. They would 
have uses in future Internet appliances and Internet-related 
business, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM could also purchase liquid crystal displays from Acer, while  
Acer could improve its displays using technology licensed from IBM, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite closer cooperation, the two companies said they have no  
plans for an equity tie-up.

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Parrish, Ausmus Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit manager Larry Parrish and catcher Brad  
Ausmus were given two-game suspensions and $500 fines today by AL 
president Gene Budig, and said they will appeal the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish and Ausmus were involved in an argument with umpire  
Chuck Meriwether and were ejected after making contact with the 
umpire on May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers pitcher Matt Anderson had just been ejected after hitting  
Mike Stanley in the seventh inning of an 8-7 loss to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said his brush with Meriwether was incidental and not  
intended. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's bad is everything was precipitated by a stupid call,''  
Parrish said. ``He pushed me twice, but I didn't really worry about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus' suspension was to begin Tuesday, while Parrish's was  
scheduled to start Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overly aggressive?'' Ausmus asked rhetorically. ``I guess I'm  
guilty of that. But I don't know if the punishment fits the 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Ausmus appealed through the players' association, the  
penalty can't start until after a hearing before Budig.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Seeks End to Energy Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's been trying to abolish the Energy  
Department for years, but a conservative Republican congressman 
from Kansas is attracting greater attention for his proposal amid 
allegations of nuclear spying by China. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Todd Tiahrt's idea is catching on following a special House  
committee report alleging that China stole America's nuclear 
weapons secrets from DOE laboratories. In fact, the panel's 
chairman, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., is a cosponsor of 
Tiahrt's legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report alleged that Beijing stole classified information  
about every currently deployed nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal. 
Cox said last week it was ``exceptionally likely'' that Chinese 
spying continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismantling DOE has been an aim of Tiahrt since he rode to  
Congress in the 1994 election wave that swept Republicans into 
control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Tiahrt and his allies were calling the department wasteful  
and ineffective. Today, they say those problems have blossomed into 
a national security nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a lack of management skills and no  
accountability -- like a lack of character -- sooner or later, it 
shows up,'' Tiahrt said in an interview last week. He pointed to 
various studies by the General Accounting Office, Congress' 
investigative arm, that detailed years of mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's showing up in the loss of our nation's most sacred  
defense secrets,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says he has taken dramatic  
steps to tighten security and that the Cox committee report does 
not reflect counterintelligence and security improvements made this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tiahrt pointed to assertions that espionage continues,  
calling those improvements ``like putting a Band-Aid on a gaping 
head wound; they're not stopping the flow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiahrt's 1994 upset of longtime Democratic Rep. Dan Glickman was  
largely due to enthusiastic support from anti-abortion activists in 
his Wichita district. Glickman went on to become agriculture 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiahrt's earliest and most avid support came from religious  
conservatives, but he has used a seat on the powerful 
Appropriations Committee to carve out a role not only as a fiscal 
conservative, but as a consensus builder who forges strong 
relationships with moderates back home and on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid of the debate, but we are a government of  
consensus,'' he said. ``I like to find things we can move forward 
on, rather than the things which hold us back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiahrt's blueprint for dismantling the Energy Department, also  
sponsored by Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., would sell off some of DOE's 
projects to private industry and transfer other functions to 
various federal agencies, with the nuclear weapons complex shifting 
to the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside estimates by such think tanks as the libertarian Cato  
Institute estimate that such a move would save taxpayers $20 
billion annually over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiahrt's fellow Kansan, Republican Rep. Jim Ryun, wants to halt  
visits to the labs by scientists from security-sensitive countries. 
Tiahrt supports that but says it can't completely stop the flow of 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that in view of White House veto threats, it's  
questionable Congress would send legislation to President Clinton 
that would abolish the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	It's more likely that lawmakers would attempt to bring the labs  
under the Pentagon's wing, Tiahrt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy industry is Tiahrt's biggest corporate backer, with  
oil and gas contributions to his 1998 campaign reaching at least 
$59,150. More than $30,000 of that amount came from Wichita-based 
Koch Industries, the oil-and-ranching conglomerate that is the 
nation's second-largest privately held company. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch -- its political action committee, owners, employees and  
family member of owners and employees -- gave more than $470,000 in 
Kansas during the last election cycle.

<HEADLINE> Drug Ban Upheld for Irish Swimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic star Michelle Smith de  
Bruin lost her appeal today of a four-year drug ban, a ruling that 
could end the Irish swimmer's career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the decision by FINA,  
the sport's governing body. Smith was suspended on Aug. 6, 1998, 
after being found guilty of tampering with a urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, did not say if he will appeal. The  
CAS ruling is final and any appeal would have to be filed in civil 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon previously raised the possibility of taking the case to  
the European Court for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who won three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,  
is ineligible for the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2001 world 
championships. She is 29 years old and will be 33 when the ban 
expires in August 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said the samples were adulterated with alcohol, possibly  
masking the presence of banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member CAS panel rejected Smith's defense that the  
samples were not hers or that a third party manipulated the 
samples. The panel also dismissed her contention that the burden of 
proof was on FINA to eliminate all possibilities other than 
manipulation by the swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts of the case and the evidence before them,  
the arbitrators were of the opinion that FINA had convinced them 
that (Smith) was the only person who had the motive and opportunity 
to manipulate the sample,'' the CAS statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes 17 months after the disputed test.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time FINA has had a manipulation case,'' Gunnar  
Werner, FINA's honorary secretary, said by telephone from Sweden. 
``Manipulation is a bad crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more or less two abuses in one -- manipulating samples to  
cover up something else. Hopefully this will warn others not to try 
anything of the same kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon called the 35-page ruling ``fairly comprehensive'' and  
said he will have a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the  
stars of the 1996 Games, submitted to a surprise, 
out-of-competition drug test at her home in Kilkenny, Ireland, on 
Jan. 10, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA later reported the sample was contaminated with a  
concentration of alcohol so high it would have killed a person had 
it been a legitimate sample. Analysis of the backup sample at an 
IOC laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, confirmed the finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith denied any wrongdoing and appealed the ban. She appeared  
at a CAS hearing in Lausanne on May 3-4. Lennon maintained there 
were major flaws in the testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's spectacular results in Atlanta -- winning gold in the  
400-meter medley, 400 freestyle and 200 individual medley, and 
bronze in the 200 butterfly -- led to accusations she used 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith repeatedly denied doing so. She said she had been  
tested more often than her rivals and each time the result was 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicions were also fueled because of Smith's coach and  
husband. Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower and shot putter, was 
banned for four years after testing positive for excessive 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAS arbitration panel was led by Yves Fortier of Canada. The  
other arbitrators were lawyers Michael Beloff of Britain and Dennis 
Oswald of Switzerland.

	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Paul S. Newman, a prolific comic-book  
writer who got listed in the Guinness Book of World Records, died 
May 30 of a heart attack. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman wrote scripts for Superman, Mighty Mouse, The Lone Ranger  
and Jungle Jim comic books, among others. Beginning in 1947, he 
wrote more than 4,100 published stories totaling about 36,000 
pages, the equivalent of 120 mystery novels. His stories included 
dialogue and panel-by-panel descriptions of what the artist was 
supposed to draw. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps His Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a swipe at congressional Republicans,  
President Clinton is going to bat for Al Gore by signing a 
fund-raising letter for the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter is dated May 18 -- five days after The New York Times  
quoted the president as expressing concern about the start of 
Gore's presidential campaign but declaring it ``in a lot better 
shape now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's letter promoting Gore as his successor criticizes  
unidentified ``powerful forces'' -- a clear reference to the 
Republicans who control the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They continue to resist change -- trying, over and over again,  
to return our country to the policies that have failed,'' Clinton 
wrote. ``They struggled against our economic plan. They shut the 
government down. And they tried to poison our country with 
partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he will formally endorse Gore once the vice  
president officially declares his candidacy. He is wading into an 
intraparty fight, since former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey also 
is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore has been a loyal vice president to Bill Clinton for  
several years, loyally standing beside him during the 
administration,'' Bradley spokeswoman Anita Dunn said. ``We're not 
surprised that Bill Clinton is repaying that loyalty by helping him 
in the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the fund-raising  
letter was just one indication of Clinton's willingness to help his 
vice president succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has said many times that he is going to do  
everything he can to be helpful to the campaign,'' Salazar said. 
``We very much appreciate what he's doing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-month period ending March 31, the last date for  
which figures are available, Gore led all presidential hopefuls in 
seeking campaign funds by raising $8.9 million. Second was Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush, who raised $7.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Virgin Atlantic Unveils New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The skies over Britain are still  
friendly enough, but the planes are getting pretty patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic unveiled a new paint job making prominent use of  
the Union Jack on its jet fleet Monday, a day after rival British 
Airways -- ridiculed for the ``world images'' it put on its planes' 
tailfins two years ago -- said it would repaint the beloved British 
banner on half of its aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing the changes at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, Virgin  
boss Richard Branson revealed the new look on a Boeing 747-400 that 
featured silver metallic paint and the Union Jack on the wings and 
fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline also introduced a new corporate logo as well as a  
``twin seat'' design in business class that transforms into a 
double bed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virgin Atlantic is now Britain's flag carrier,'' Branson said.  
``We're a young, dynamic, innovative British company, and our new 
livery and corporate identity fully reflects this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new colors would give Virgin Atlantic jets ``a  
striking new look for the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways was the first to announce new colors. The  
airline announced Sunday that it was reverting to the Union Jack, 
replacing the ethnic logos that former Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher once described as ``awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement came two years after BA first introduced its  
``world images'' tail fins featuring designs ranging from Delft 
pottery to Chinese calligraphy. About half of BA's 340-strong fleet 
used those designs, but 160 aircraft -- including the airline's 
supersonic Concordes -- retained the Union Jack logo. All new 
aircraft will sport the patriotic look, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what our customers want. It is as simple as that,'' said  
British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling. ``People in Britain 
want an image which they can respond to as part of their culture.''

	NATO Jets Pound Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets pounded Yugoslavia today  
after the alliance warned President Slobodan Milosevic to expect 
intensified bombing until he orders his troops out of Kosovo. 
Milosevic, meanwhile, sought to assure key Western countries and 
Russia that he still intends to abide by terms of a peace plan to 
which he agreed last week. His pledge was relayed to a meeting of 
foreign ministers from the Group of Eight -- the world's seven 
leading industrial nations and Russia -- in Bonn, Germany. Fear of 
ambushes by the Kosovo Liberation Army is another reason Yugoslavia 
has been reluctant to endorse NATO's pullout terms.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI put alleged terrorist mastermind Osama  
Bin Laden and anti-abortion activist and accused doctor killer 
James Charles Kopp on the bureau's list of the Ten Most Wanted 
fugitives today. FBI Director Louis Freeh said the U.S. government 
is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads 
to the arrest and conviction of bin Laden, indicted as the 
architect of the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania. Meanwhile, $650,000 is being offered for information 
leading to the arrest of Kopp, who is charged with gunning down Dr. 
Barnett Slepian last fall in his home in Buffalo, N.Y. Slepian 
performed abortions.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the wake of the school shootings this

today that would restrict youth access to video games, movies and 
other items containing violent as well as sexually explicit 
material. The proposal also would require the music industry to 
provide stores with copies of song lyrics as a means of allowing 
adults to keep questionable products from their children. The 
provisions were among several prepared by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, for inclusion in 
legislation cracking down on juvenile crime.

	Pinochet Won't Challenge Ruling

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet said today they  
will not appeal a High Court decision to allow extradition 
proceedings against the former Chilean dictator. Last month, a High 
Court judge refused Pinochet permission to challenge the home 
secretary's decision allowing Spain to try to extradite him on 
human rights charges. Pinochet could have appealed the single 
judge's decision to a three-judge panel, but has decided not to, 
his attorney said. That means the next phase in the drawn-out legal 
battle -- which began Oct. 16 with Pinochet's arrest in London -- 
will come this fall, when the extradition proceedings are due to 
open.

	Japan: Economy Has Stopped Worsening  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy has stopped deteriorating as a  
result of government spending, though risks remain, the government 
said Tuesday. The Economic Planning Agency upgraded its assessment 
of the nation's economy in June for the first time in three months. 
The agency said that the economy ``has stopped deteriorating and is 
fluctuating sideways.'' Since March, the assessment had said 
``downward movement continues to slow to a halt.'' The report is 
considered a key indicator of government thinking on the state of 
the economy and can sometimes anticipate policy initiatives.

no-raise $307,000 contract for next season. ``I don't think I 
should be the lowest-paid coach in the NHL.'' Kevin Lowe and Walt 
Kyle are the leading candidates to take over. Lowe, a former 
defenseman who helped the Oilers win five Stanley Cups, was an 
assistant to Low last season.

<HEADLINE> Study of Mentally Ill Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a White House conference on mental illness,  
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and their wives worked 
today to dispel myths about people who suffer from such illnesses 
as depression and schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans with mental illness should have the same opportunity  
all Americans have to live to the fullest of their God-given 
abilities,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House used the gathering to announce a $7.3 million  
study by the National Institute of Mental Health to explore mental 
illness and a national training program for teachers to identify 
and help troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also notified the 285 health plans used by federal  
employees that they must cover mental illness and substance abuse, 
and he called on other employers to do the same. ``It is high time 
that our health plans treat all Americans equally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the administration was pressing Congress for  
legislation to stop forcing disabled people who are receiving 
Medicare or Medicaid to give up their benefits when they go to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The training program was developed with the help of the National  
Education Association and EchoStar, a satellite company based in 
Littleton, Colo., where two students killed a teacher, 12 
classmates and themselves earlier this year. EchoStar was donating 
1,000 satellite dishes and 40 hours of air time to the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than changing policy, the conference was aimed at  
changing attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton drew parallels between the stigma surrounding mental  
illness and discrimination, saying the mentally disabled ``are 
perhaps just the latest in our enduring challenge as a people to 
continue the work of our founders to widen the circle of 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, recounted for the  
audience at Howard University and listening nationwide how she 
sought treatment to overcome depression after her son was injured 
by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people that are within the sound of my voice, who  
perhaps are suffering with this or any other mental illness, to 
know that there is the right diagnosis and the right treatment and 
the right health care professional out there for you,'' she said. 
``Don't hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, a longtime advocate for the mentally ill, chaired the  
conference, which was linked electronically to 6,000 sites 
nationwide. CBS newsman Mike Wallace, who also overcame depression, 
joined the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Cabinet secretaries and more than 20 members of Congress  
from both parties were participating in the daylong session. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore is working with Surgeon General David Satcher and the  
Ad Council to produce the campaign on mental illness. Clinton 
issued an executive order Friday to eliminate the government's 
stricter hiring and promotion standards for mentally disabled 
people.

<HEADLINE> Judge Limits Use of Backyard Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Baseball may be as American as Apple Pie,  
but a judge says a New Jersey man who built a regulation size field 
in his backyard is getting too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Victor Ashrafi said Bill Ingraham's  
round-the-clock games broke zoning laws and Ingraham must limit 
playing time at the Tewksbury Township field. 
</P>
<P>
	The man built the diamond along with an indoor field house for  
nearly $300,000 in 1996, a move reminiscent of the 1989 movie 
``Field of Dreams'' in which Kevin Costner's character turns his 
cornfield into a baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and the township -- the hometown of Gov. Christie  
Whitman -- sued Ingraham, saying his schedule of Little League and 
semi-pro games violated their privacy and peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingraham has said Tewksbury overreacted to his version of  
All-American fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court agrees that children playing baseball can not  
easily be branded a nuisance,'' Ashrafi wrote. ``One might as well 
say that apple pie is poison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But the fact that baseball for kids is wholesome and patriotic  
does not mean that full-scale games, practices and training can be 
held anywhere,'' Ashrafi added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashrafi said that Ingraham, his wife and two children can play  
baseball anytime they want on the field with up to eight guests. He 
can play games with more people than that once a month until Dec. 
31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion didn't say what would happen after that, confusing  
attorneys who said they would probably return to court for an 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling also bans uniforms, aluminum bats, night games,  
loudspeakers and outdoor lighting from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingraham also can't bring organized, league teams or paid  
officials onto the field, and can only invite paid instructors to 
give lessons to his family, Ashrafi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Township officials and neighbors had asked that Ingraham only be  
allowed to play regulation-size games at the field three times a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tewksbury's deputy mayor, Tres Arnett, called the lawsuit's end  
``a reasonable result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't looking to have him plow the field under,'' Arnett  
said.

<HEADLINE> Inkster's Career Coming Into Focus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Chances are, not many people at Old  
Waverly Golf Club this week were aware of all Juli Inkster had 
accomplished until her record-breaking performance in the U.S. 
Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	She won two majors as a rookie before anyone knew about Se Ri  
Pak. 
</P>
<P>
	She won three consecutive U.S. Amateurs before anyone cared  
about Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a time when women's golf was getting more exposure and a  
new infusion of talent from Annika Sorenstam, Laura Davies and 
Karrie Webb, Inkster was splitting time between banging balls and 
changing diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the last 10 years, golf has just picked up on a  
high,'' she said. ``I really don't think golf was as popular as it 
is now, and the media wasn't as involved as it is now. I think that 
maybe if I did it 10 years ago instead of 20 years ago, I think I 
would have been a little more appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm very content with where I'm at,'' she said. ``And I  
know a lot of people respect my game. I don't need the fanfare. I 
just want to play golf. And I want to be Mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster finished four sub-par rounds at 16-under 272, shattering  
by five strokes the Open record in relation to par set two years 
ago by Alison Nicholas. Her victory Sunday in the most prestigious 
event in women's golf also put the spotlight on a 38-year-old 
mother of two in the twilight of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like when Mark O'Meara's career took on new meaning after  
he won two majors at 41, Inkster is more likely to be recognized 
now as one of the top performers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was her third of the year and 20th of her career,  
more than any active player who is not already in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was her fourth major championship, and put her only an  
LPGA Championship away from joining Pat Bradley as the only women 
to win the modern grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my goals when I started was to win all four majors,''  
Inkster said. ``I won two my rookie year, so I thought it was going 
to be easy. It's been kind of a dry spell. It's been a long time 
coming since my third different one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster was reminded Sunday how difficult it has become.  
</P>
<P>
	She had a four-stroke lead over Kelli Kuehne, a spunky Texan who  
reminds Inkster of herself when she was 22. Whistling and singing 
between shots, Kuehne said she would go at every flag and delivered 
with alarming precision. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne was the first on the green and the first in the cup on  
the first five holes when she managed to shave one stroke off the 
lead. Inkster, who poured in important putts on top of her to keep 
some distance, restored order with a birdie on No. 6 and a 
brilliant bunker shot from a buried lie to save par on No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``She gets that old blood of mine pumping,'' Inkster said. ``She  
reminds me so much of me when I was coming out ... just her 
guttiness and desire to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster's rookie season must seem like an eternity ago.  
</P>
<P>
	She won the Dinah Shore and the du Maurier Classic in 1984, won  
four times in 1986 and her second Dinah victory made her a winner 
in six of her first seven seasons on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayley was born in 1990, and Cori followed in 1994. Inkster  
remembered her mother being there for her when she came home from 
school, and wants the same for her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of straddling the fence,'' Inkster said. ``Do I  
quit? Do I play?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She went four years without winning or even finishing in the top  
20 on the money list. Ultimately, Inkster decided to commit herself 
to practice and to bring her daughters on the road while they were 
still young. 
</P>
<P>
	She has won the Samsung World Championship each of the past two  
years, starred in the Solheim Cup in September and is now making 
sure Webb doesn't run away from the rest of women's golf this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is the Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
	The revised standards award one point for a victory, two for a  
major and one point for either player of the year or Vare Trophy 
for lowest scoring average. The Women's Open gave Inkster 24 
points, three shy of the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	She will play a full schedule the rest of this year and in 2000  
with hopes of making the Solheim Cup team, then will scale back to 
no more than a dozen or so each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can just give myself opportunities to win, I feel like I  
can earn those three points,'' she said. ``But I'm not going to say 
that if I don't have it by then, I'm going to play another year. It 
would be a great honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be the most critical piece of the puzzle. She  
couldn't wait to get back to California for Cori's pre-school 
graduation and Hayley's softball playoffs. The Women's Open trophy 
will be placed in Los Altos Country Club, where husband Brian is 
the head pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look back on my career,'' Inkster said, ``and I say I've  
done myself proud.''

<HEADLINE> Stem Cells May Restore Neurons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Injections of neural stem cells, a so-called  
master cell that can mature into any type of brain tissue, may be 
able to restore neurons killed by Alzheimer's and other diseases 
that affect the whole brain, laboratory studies with mice suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Evan Y. Snyder of Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical  
School in Boston said the laboratory study shows that the neural 
stem cells will convert themselves into whatever type of cell the 
ailing brain needs, restoring functions that have been lost to 
disease, injury or birth defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The neural stem cell has the ability to become a whole range  
of cell types in the brain,'' said Snyder, the lead author of a 
study appearing Tuesday in Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences. ``The neural stem cell can accommodate all different 
regions of the brain and insert itself appropriately into the 
fabric of the brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder cautioned that it will take at least another five years  
of study before neural stem cell transplants can be tried in 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach, director of the National Institute of  
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes 
of Health, said in a statement that Snyder's study shows that 
neural stem cells are capable of moving to all parts of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stem cells that can develop into a variety of different types  
of nerve cells and glial cells (a type of brain tissue) would be 
extremely valuable in the therapy of acute and chronic neurological 
disorders,'' Fischbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neural stem cells are found in all parts of the brain in all  
stages of development. They are capable of converting to neurons, 
glial cells and other types of cells in the central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said that his team is researching using a neural stem  
cell culture that was developed 13 years ago from cells removed 
from the brain of a newborn mouse. He said the same cell line can 
be used in all types of mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Proceedings used a strain of mice called  
``shiverer.'' This breed has a genetic flaw that prevents its body 
from making a protein that is needed to form myelin, the tissue 
that insulates nerve fibers. 
</P>
<P>
	A shiverer mouse develops tremors within a three weeks of age  
and goes on to develop other symptoms similar those seen in human 
patients with multiple sclerosis. MS is a crippling and sometimes 
fatal disease caused by the progressive loss of the myelin covering 
of nerve fibers in the brain and the spine. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said his team injected the mouse neural stem cells into  
the brains of newborn shiverer mice. A control group of mice did 
not receive the cells. He said the injected stem cells apparently 
detected the absent gene in the shiverer mice and converted into 
oligodendrocytes, which are brain cells that produce myelin. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the shiverer mice that received the stem cells, 60 percent  
appeared to behave like normal mice, while the untreated shiverer 
mice showed severe symptoms of their inherited disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination of the animal's brains, said Snyder, showed that  
a much higher percentage than normal of the inject stem cells 
converted into oligodendrocytes, which then made the missing 
myelin. The brains of some of the tested mice even appeared to have 
normal myelin tissue covering nerve fibers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said that earlier studies in mice showed that the stem  
cells also selectively converted into neurons to replace neurons 
that were missing or removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown that these cells will migrate to wherever in the  
brain they are needed,'' he said. ``If there are missing neurons, 
these cells will convert into new neurons. It is possible that 
these stem cells will replace any damaged or missing cells in the 
brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said this means that transplanting human neural stem  
cells could become part of the therapy for Alzheimer's, strokes, 
multiple sclerosis and a whole group of brain birth defects. The 
researcher, however, said that stem cell transplantation is not a 
``silver bullet'' that by itself will cure those disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brain is very complex, and this means ... repairing the  
brain is not going to be simple,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder noted that all of the studies so far have been done on  
newborn mice. He said his team is turning next to conducting tests 
in mature mice to see if what works in infant rodents will also 
work in adults.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal To Buy Honeywell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AlliedSignal Inc. is buying Honeywell Inc. for  
$14.82 billion in stock, strengthening its aerospace business with 
the addition of Honeywell's control systems, the companies 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will take the Honeywell name and the  
AlliedSignal headquarters in Morristown, N.J. Honeywell's 
headquarters in Minneapolis will be closed. The two companies will 
cut a total of 4,500 jobs, or 3.6 percent, of their combined work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies' stock surged on Wall Street today as investors  
were quick to see the synergies and cost savings of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal makes equipment ranging from aircraft engines and  
collision early-warning systems, to wheels and brakes. Honeywell 
makes control systems for aircraft, homes and commercial buildings, 
such as automatic thermostats for heating. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders have been watching AlliedSignal closely since  
December, when the company was thwarted in a hostile bid to acquire 
AMP Inc., a Harrisburg, Pa.-based maker of electronic connectors 
that was instead acquired by Tyco International. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, if approved by the companies' shareholders and  
regulatory officials, will be the swan song for Lawrence Bossidy, 
chairman and chief executive officer of AlliedSignal, who retires 
on April 1, 2000. Bossidy even hinted at it two months ago, at the 
company's annual meeting, when he said, ``I want to do something 
big in this company before I leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies' boards of directors have approved the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	Bossidy, 64, will serve as chairman for the combined company  
until his retirement. Michael R. Bonsignore, 58, chairman and chief 
executive of Honeywell, will be the new company's chief executive 
and assume the additional title of chairman when Bossidy departs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies have had on-and-off merger discussions since  
1989, when Honeywell was a much weaker company. Bonsignore's 
turnaround of Honeywell made the company a stronger potential 
partner and proved to Bossidy that Bonsignore could fill his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I looked at Honeywell and saw what Mike had done over the  
last six years in improving their outlook, I got more interested,'' 
Bossidy said in an interview today with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest issues to resolve, the executives said, were the  
company name and headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell has been based in Minneapolis for 114 years, and  
currently employs 7,500 in the Twin Cities area. The two companies 
agreed to keep 6,000 jobs in the area and maintain its 
philanthropic commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	For AlliedSignal, the company loses the name created in 1985 by  
the merger of Allied Corp. and the Signal Cos. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a better worldwide brand than we did, so we made a  
concession on that point,'' Bossidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect to save $500 million within two years by  
integrating their research and development and purchasing. The new 
company will eliminate 2,000 jobs within the first six months after 
the deal closes and another 2,500 the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading today, Honeywell's stock was up $7.81 1/4, or by  
7.4 percent, to $112.81 1/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where AlliedSignal gained $4.37 1/2, or 7.5 percent, to $62.75. The 
rise in AlliedSignal's stock added almost $1 billion to the value 
of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell shareholders will receive 1.875 shares of AlliedSignal  
common stock -- worth $117.66 in trading today -- for each share of 
Honeywell they own. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal also will assume $1.5 billion of Honeywell's debt,  
but the synergies and cost savings of the combined operations are 
expected to add 17 cents a share to earnings of the combined 
companies in 2000, and 32 cents a share in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell earned $572 million on sales of $8.02 billion last  
year. AlliedSignal made a $1.33 billion profit on sales of $15.13 
billion.
