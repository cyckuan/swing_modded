<HEADLINE> Sporadic Violence Erupts in N.Irish Catholic Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic violence broke out
Saturday during protests against a traditional Protestant
Apprentice Boys' parade in Northern Ireland's second largest city
of Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 nationalist demonstrators were involved in the
disturbances in the city center, with 130 petrol bombs thrown at
the police.
</P>
<P>
Protesters also fired catapults and set off fireworks. Six
vehicles were hijacked, of which two were burnt.
</P>
<P>
Seven protesters were arrested while at least eight police
officers were injured, but none was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
But the huge security operation, launched amid police warnings
that republicans were planning to use the event to stir up
violence, kept nationalists and marchers apart. The parade itself,
involving up to 10,000 people and 150 bands, passed off
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The parade was held amid a huge security presence and
opposition from residents of the mainly Catholic and nationalist
Bogside area of the city.
</P>
<P>
It followed violence in the Lower Ormeau Road area of the
Northern Ireland capital of Belfast Saturday morning, when
nationalists attempted to block the route of another Apprentice
Boys parade.
</P>
<P>
Scuffles broke out as police wearing riot gear moved 200
demonstrators who were sitting in the road. Nineteen police
officers and a number of protesters were injured during the
clashes in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Parades by the Protestant Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys
have been the subject of controversy for many years in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The marchers view the parades as a traditional expression of
their culture, but in Catholic nationalist areas they are often
viewed as triumphalist and intimidating.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's parade is to commemorate the 1689 Siege of
Londonderry, known as Derry to its largely Catholic population,
when Protestant apprentices shut the gates of the walled city
against the forces of the Catholic King James II in December 1688.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Protestants died before the city in that war and
Londonderry is now 75 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
The Londonderry and Belfast parades were earlier given the
go-ahead by the Northern Ireland Parades Commission.
</P>
<P>
The two marches took place on the eve of the first anniversary
of a car bomb in the town of Omagh that killed 29 people and
wounded hundreds more on August 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary was marked Saturday by shops closing on the
little high street where shoppers were killed. A prayer service
was held on the spot where the bombs went off. The town's main
remembrance ceremony will be held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Talks on implementing a Northern Irish peace deal signed in
April last year have been frozen until September as Protestant
politicians refuse to share power with Catholic republicans in the
Sinn Fein party until its guerrilla ally, the Irish Republican
Army, disarms.

<HEADLINE> UK Pension Firms Urged To Keep It Simple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Pension firms in Britain are
being urged to simplify their products after a survey estimated
more than 5 million adults had not begun saving for their
retirement.
</P>
<P>
The research by consumer analyst group Mintel discovered 5.4
million adults thought a pension scheme would be too expensive for
them for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
It also found 40 percent of families did not know when they
would start a pension because they believed they could not afford
one.
</P>
<P>
It has already announced that the British government is set to
launch stakeholder pension schemes in 2001 to give more people
access to a pension.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's efforts to encourage greater
retirement provision many family adults still do not own a
pension.
</P>
<P>
Mintel questioned 1,800 adults as a representative sample. And
25 percent said they expected to have to work after retiring from
full-time jobs to supplement their retirement income.

<HEADLINE> Health Situation Worsening in Iraq, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Minister Omid
Medhat Mubarak said on Saturday that surveys made recently by the
U.N. Children and Education Fund (UNICEF) show that the health
situation in Iraq is worsening due to the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told a press conference that the worsening health
situation is due to the widespread malnutrition, infectious
diseases, severe shortages of medicine and medical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the UNICEF surveys, made in
coordination with the Iraqi Health Ministry, showed that the
mortality rates of newly born infants and children under the age
of five amounted to 18 percent and 13 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The worsening environment situation, the continuation of the
U.S.-British bombardment of civilian facilities, power failure and
the severe lack of spare parts for medical appliances also lead
to the worsening health situation, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that many hospitals, especially children hospitals,
need to be reconstructed, adding that 30,000 hospital beds needs
to be changed.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed hope that Iraq would soon get the
medical appliances and equipment to put an end to the worsening
of the health situation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak refuted the U.S. allegations that the Iraqi government
should be responsible for the worsening health situation of the
country, saying that those allegations are nonsense and can not
be believed by any fair-minded people.
</P>
<P>
He said that two teams sent by World Health Organization (WHO)
to Iraq to verify the U.S. allegations that Iraq stores medicine
and medical appliances in its warehouses refuted the
U.S. allegation as untrue.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused the U.S. and Britain of putting pressure
on some companies to cancel their health contracts signed with
Iraq, and suspending Iraq's contracts concluded with foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
He called for the total lifting of the U.N. sanctions imposed
on the Iraqi people for more than nine years, saying that to allow
Iraq to import freely food, medicine and medical appliances is
the only solution to the end of the suffering of the Iraqi
people.

<HEADLINE> Hostages in Liberia Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 hostages, including six
 European aid workers, who had been held by Liberian rebels in the
past few days were released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They are now in a camp of the Doctors Without Borders, a France
 based charity group, two of whose aid workers were also among the
 captives seized Wednesday morning when armed men entered their
compound in Kolahun, Lofa County near the Sierra Leone and Guinea
border.
</P>
<P>
"They are apparently unharmed. They will be arriving in
Conakry this afternoon," said a British diplomat in Senegal.
Britain has no embassy in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Among the six European captives, four are British, and the
other two were Norwegian and Italian, who are working with charity
organizations of Merlin and Doctors Without Borders. They were in
the country helping to rebuild hospitals when they were seized,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The hostages had crossed over to Guinea by foot, for the
Liberian side of the Liberia-Guinea border has been closed
according to President Charles Taylor's order.
</P>
<P>
The group, mostly Liberian civilians, had been allowed to leave
the rebel's camp by foot Friday. Guinea had agreed to the passing
of its territory by the released hostages on "humanitarian
considerations".
</P>
<P>
The group seemed to have been caught in the middle of fighting
in northern Liberia on Wednesday when Liberian government forces
were battling heavily with rebels believed to be based in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor Wednesday declared a state of
 emergency in Lofa County, where he said insurgents had captured
several towns overnight.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said government troops were rushing to the front and
called on all "able-bodied men" to report for military service.

<HEADLINE> Banking Sector in Oman on Way to Y2K Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The banking sector of Oman is
drawing up comprehensive contingency plans to achieve compliance
to the year 2000 computer problem, also known as the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a Y2K follow-up meeting held at the
Central Bank of Oman (CBO) on Saturday, according to an Oman News
Agency report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Due to some programming defects rooted in their early
development stage, computers can only identify the year in the
last two digits, which means they might mistake the year 2000 for
1900. It is feared that chaos may occur when the year 2000 comes
due to this defect as computers are now so widely used.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector is "well on its way toward achieving Y2K
compliance, having already addressed the remedial and replacement
requirements," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by Iqbal Ali Khamis, CBO vice president
and chairman of the National Y2K Task Force, and was attended by
senior CBO officials, members from commercial banks and
representatives from Omani Telecommunications Corporation (OTC).
</P>
<P>
Given the heavy reliance of banks on the telecommunications
sector, an OTC representative at the meeting assured that most of
their systems were in final stages of testing. British Telecom,
which was helping in this phase, would certify their compliance.
</P>
<P>
"OTC is forming a high level committee to take responsibility
of the contingency plan that is being designed by British
Telecom," the representative said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Confirms Approval of Libyan Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government
reiterated its approval of the five-point peace plan submitted by
Libya on reconciliation between the Sudanese government and the
opposition force.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese News Agency on Saturday quoted Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail as saying that as the Sudanese government has
accepted the Libyan initiative, the ball is now in the hands of the
opposition for achieving national unity in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The report said a Libyan official will arrive in Khartoum on
Monday to discuss the details of the peace plan with Sudanese
officials.
</P>
<P>
The proposed peace plan involves immediate ceasefire, direct
dialog between the government and the opposition and immediate
suspension of hostile propagandas against each other.
</P>
<P>
It calls for forging a committee to determine the time and
venue of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The plan also outlines Libya's responsibility to coordinate
with other neighboring countries in working for a solution to the
Sudanese issue.
</P>
<P>
Civil war is raging in Sudan since 1983 between the government
troops and the forces of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) led by John Garang, which is fighting for independence from
the Muslim-dominated central government and for the establishment
of a separate state in southern Sudan where most of the population
believe in Christianism or animism.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Party Leader Arrested at S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police Saturday
confirmed the arrest of Zambia's Barotse Patriotic Front leader
Imasiku Mutangelwa who was holed up in the South African High
Commission in Lusaka after seeking asylum there, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Mutangelwa's party was suspected of backing an armed rebellion
by Namibian separatists in the Caprivi Strip last week in which 14
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He took refuge in the South African High Commission last
Thursday after claiming that his life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
Zambian police Inspector-General Francis Ndhlovu told SAPA that
 Mutangelwa was arrested at the High Commission Friday around 9
p.m. (1900 GMT) after a bench warrant was issued by the Zambian
High Court for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Ndhlovu said Mutangelwa had failed to appear before a court at
Mongu in west Zambia Thursday on charges of allegedly "causing
death by dangerous driving".
</P>
<P>
Ndhlovu said Mutangelwa would not remain in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the South African and Zambian governments in an
effort to clarify Mutangelwa's status were not resolved before his
arrest, SAPA quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mutangelwa asked for political asylum after he was summoned to
police headquarters in Lusaka following a statement in which he
allegedly expressed support for separatists in Namibia's Caprivi
Strip.
</P>
<P>
This followed alleged reports quoting him as saying that Lozis
from Zambia's Western Province had started crossing into the
Caprivi Strip to support secessionist rebels.
</P>
<P>
The people from western Zambia, formerly known as Barotseland,
are from the same Lozi ethnic group as the Caprivians in Namibia.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan Deputy Prime
Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev reaffirmed Saturday that Taiwan is
an inalienable part of China and the Taiwan issue is China's
internal affair.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev, also Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister, made the remarks
in an interview by a group of Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing Lee Teng-hui's recent "two states" statement,
Tokayev noted that both Kazakhstan and China stick to the
principles of safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and firmly oppose any separatist activity.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the five-country summit of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, to be held in Bishkek,
capital of Kyrgyzstan, Tokayev stressed that such a meeting will
greatly promote the international and regional security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Tokayev also predicted a bright future
for the economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and China. The
trade volume between the two countries reached 650 million U.S.
dollars last year, with China serving as the second biggest
trading partner of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the economic strength and market demand of both
countries, the bilateral trade volume may mount to 2 billion
dollars in the future, he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Egyptian Journalists Sentenced to Jail for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Egyptian journalists were
sentenced to two-year imprisonment with labor Saturday for
libeling the country's deputy prime minister, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The editor-in-chief of the Al-Shaab newspaper, the fiery
mouthpiece of the opposition Labor Party, Magdi Hussein, reporter
Salah Bedewei and cartoonist Essam-Eddin Hanafi were also fined by
the South Cairo Criminal Court 20,000 Egyptian pounds (5,900 U.S.
dollars) each, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth journalist of the newspaper, Adel Hussein, a columnist
and the editor's brother, was fined 20,000 pounds for defamation
to a lesser degree. Adel Hussein is also deputy chairman of the
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The court convicted them of libeling Egyptian Deputy Prime
Minister Youssef Wali in a series of articles and cartoons,
published over nearly a year, that accused him of "treason" and
"working as an agent for a foreign state."
</P>
<P>
Judge Hassib al Betrawi said it has been proven that "these
accusations are groundless."
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab called Wali, who is also the minister of agriculture,
a traitor and accused him of destroying Egypt's economy for having
signed several agricultural agreements with Israel for the supply
of seed, fertilizers and technology to arrest desertification.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Magdi Hussein has been convicted
under a 1996 press law. Last year he and another Al-Shaab
journalist were sentenced to two years in prison with labor for
libeling a former interior minister. The Supreme Court freed them
after they reached a settlement with the minister.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab is published by the Labor Party, which is allied to
the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's strongest Islamic movement, and
which opposes peace with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Supreme Leader Appoints New Judiciary Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei issued a decree here Saturday to appoint a prominent
religious scholar, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi, as new head of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi replaces Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, a conservative,
whose two, five-year terms end this year. The new judiciary chief
is to be officially introduced on August 17.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's Constitution adopted on July 28, 1989,
judiciary head exercises the supervisor-general executing judicial
power, and appoints chief justice of the Supreme Court and
prosecutor-general.
</P>
<P>
In his decree, Khamenei said the judiciary is a powerful arm
of the Islamic system and fulfilling its great mission will
guarantee security and real sustainable tranquility in the
society.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing judiciary head has been attacked for his
conservative approaches such as imprisoning reform-minded
officials and shutting down moderate newspapers. During the
student demonstrations and street riots on August 8-13 sparked by
the closing of the moderate "Salam" newspaper, the protesters
urged him to resign.
</P>
<P>
"Highlighting the difficult path that the judiciary has taken
so far, especially in recent years, the leader pointed out the
great success it has achieved despite the occasionally widespread
and deep opposition," the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Local media differ in describing the new judiciary chief. Some
brand Hashemi, 51, extremely conservative, others call him a
central but conservative-lean cleric. He has been keeping a low
profile so far and his political orientation is not clear. He was
born in 1948 and began religious studies after completing
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
He has held various positions in the powerful Experts
Assembly, the Expediency Council and the Supreme Management
Council of the Qom Theological Seminary.

<HEADLINE> Total Saudi Aid to Kosovo up to 49 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has so far
extended a total of 49 million U.S. dollars in relief aid to
Kosovo, a Saudi official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of the Saudi Red Crescent Society Saleh
Al-Tuwaijri said that Riyadh began to supply the Kosovo refugees
with relief aid after the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) forces launched air strikes against
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi aid included foods and medical equipment, the Saudi
Press Agency quoted Al-Tuwaijri as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the air raids which led to hundreds of
thousands of Kosovo Albanians fleeing to neighboring countries,
an air corridor was established, through which some daily Saudi
flights were flown from the Saudi capital of Riyadh to the Tirana
Airport in Albania, which harbored a large number of Kosovo
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Saudi relief supplies were also shipped to Albania
from the kingdom's western port city of Jeddah.

<HEADLINE> No Accommodations for Namibian Secessionists, SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Saturday reiterated that "there is no
accommodation for secessionist movements" in any country in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The SADC secretariat said this in a statement correcting media
reports attributed to SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende on
the situation in Namibia's Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
A report Friday attributed to Mbuende said that the SADC
"Council (of Ministers) would consider Namibia's complaints that
Botswana was harboring key rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
The SADC secretariat dismissed the report as baseless and "a
sign of irresponsible reporting."
</P>
<P>
The SADC secretariat pointed out that Mbuende never granted an
interview, adding that he neither mentioned Botswana nor touched
on the Botswana-Namibia relations during a media briefing on the
upcoming SADC summit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat presented a transcript of a tape recording of
Mbuende's comments on the Caprivi situation.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is very clear that the territorial integrity of
Namibia and any of our SADC member states is inviolable and we are
going to defend the territorial integrity," Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no accommodation for secessionist movements," he
noted, adding that the situation in Caprivi "is not as critical
as it was initially reported or thought and it has been
substantially brought under control".
</P>
<P>
The SADC secretariat noted that the friendly and cordial
relations between Namibia and Botswana were recently attested to
during the 9th session of the Namibia/Botswana Joint Commission
on Defense and Security in Namibian capital Windhoek earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, believed to belong to secessionist Caprivi
Liberation Army, launched an attack on the Katima Mulilo police
station, the nearby airport and occupied the offices of the
state-owned Namibian Broadcasting Corporation radio station in a
strip of land in northeastern Namibia on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were later suppressed by government forces, in which
15 people were believed to have been killed in skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Mishake Muyongo, who is now in exile in Denmark,
was quoted by a South African television as saying that Caprivi
has never been part of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Muyongo, who was former leader of Namibia's major opposition
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, fled to neighboring Botswana last
October, days before the Namibian government claimed to have
uncovered a secessionist plot in the Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 armed men followed him .
</P>
<P>
Muyongo was allegedly granted asylum by the Botswanan
authorities in February this year and was later resettled in
Denmark."

NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- About 300 rebels from the Oromo
 Liberation Front of Ethiopia have been spotted in the Malaba
hills of northeastern Kenya, a source said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Wajir District in North Eastern Province said

rebels in remote hills along the Ethiopian border.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the Oromo Liberation Front rebels, forced out

themselves in remote area in northern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Representing the interests of Oromo ethnic group, the Oromo
Liberation Front has in recent months intensified its rebel moves

</P>
<P>

Thursday its army had killed more than 700 Oromo Liberation Front
rebels in the east of the country over the past two month and a
half, while the rebel front said Friday that its soldiers had
wiped out over 1,500 Ethiopian government forces during the same
period.

<HEADLINE> Sub-regional Summit on Liberia-Guinea Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and
Cote D'ivoire are to hold a summit on the alleged rebel's
incursion into Liberia

from Guinea, according to reports reaching here from Abidjan,
commercial capital of Cote D'ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Cote D'ivoire's Foreign Minister Amara Essy said in Abidjan
Saturday that the meeting will take place in the Guinean capital
of Conakry next week.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to get Presidents Lansana Conte of Guinea and
Charles Taylor around the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tension between both countries rose after an abduction of the
western aid workers by rebel gunmen in an area where Liberian
government troops are fighting armed rebels. Liberia has been
accusing Guinea, its northern neighbor, of harboring "dissident
forces" whom it blamed for the abduction.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Liberia has lodged a protest with the United
Nations Security Council against its fellow member of the Economic
Community of West African States, which has placed its troops
or the West Africa Peace Keeping Force in Liberia in alert.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, the rebels freed the six western hostages along
with other 90 Liberian civilians, making a similar hostage-taking
drama like the one in S. Leone last week.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Conflicts Pose Challenge to SADC (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summit, held under the theme "SADC in the next millennium:
working together for peace, progress and prosperity", will run
from August 17 to 18, with the first day devoted to grand
celebrations for the 19th anniversary of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The summit was preceded by several preparatory meetings by
SADC officials and by a council of ministers gathering on Friday
and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued at the just-concluded ministerial meeting
said that among issues to be discussed are the 24-year-old Angola
civil war, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), tensions between Angola and Zambia and preparations for
general elections in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
"On Angola, there is a need for concerted effort at regional
and international levels to resolve the stalemate in the
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos in 1994 signed a peace
pact with Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), under which Savimbi was
to be given the vice-presidency of the country in return for
halting the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has since reneged on the peace deal and restarted
the war after capturing key diamond-producing regions. Close to
1.7 million people have been either displaced or become refugees
during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said at the meeting
that intervention by SADC troops in the Angolan civil war cannot
be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
"SADC intervention cannot be ruled out" in Angola, he said
without elaborating.

<P>
The heads of state will also discuss the year-old civil war in
the DRC, where Tutsi-led rebels are trying to topple president
Laurent Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
Three SADC countries -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- last
year intervened militarily in the DRC's civil war, saying they
were supporting a fellow member state against rebel aggression.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, Kabila and his allies -- Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe-- signed a cease-fire agreement in Zambian capital
Lusaka, as did the backers of the rebels, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, the main rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy, had declined to sign amid a leadership row that has
split the movement in two.
</P>
<P>
The SADC statement said it was "pleasing to note" that Angola
and Zambia "are amicably resolving their differences."
</P>
<P>
Relations between the neighbors soured in June amid
allegations of Lusaka's support of UNITA rebels fighting the
Luanda regime.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Namibia's President Sam Nujoma is likely to
raise the recent attack by secessionist rebels on his country's
northeastern Caprivi Region, an official said.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed in clashes between security
forces and the rebels on August 2.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the Caprivi and that of arms trafficking in the
region are very important to the summit," said the official, who
refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said SADC's position on the Caprivi Strip was clear --
"that there is no accommodation for separatist movements in any
country of the region".
</P>
<P>
The wars in Angola and the DRC as wells as the situation in
the Caprivi Strip will dominate the summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said the political and military
conflicts in the region will test the collective will of SADC
member states. There will be no way to achieve South African
President Thabo Mbeki's African renaissance vision before
solutions are found to end the conflicts, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Pseudo-science Book Series Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A series of books on fighting
pseudo-science, titled "The Teahouse of Mr. Science", made its
debut today in Changsha, capital of Hunan Province in central
China.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to mark the publication, Yu Guangyuan, a leading
Chinese scholar and a member of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said education about science must be initiated from
childhood.
</P>
<P>
He condemned pseudo-scientific organizations like the illegal
Falun Gong sect, whose head Li Hongzhi calls himself the supreme
Buddha and has made illegal financial profits and gained political
fame among his followers.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Falun Gong is only the tip of an iceberg, Yu said,
noting that it could not be solved in one blow.
</P>
<P>
The series, containing articles written by many famous scholars
both at home and abroad, has been published to popularize science
and combat superstition.
</P>
<P>
China is currently carrying out a campaign to make the public
aware of the evils of Falun Gong, which has been found to be a
well-organized body and to have conducted many illegal activities
against the government.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, a former forest ranger, has told his followers that
the "doomsday is coming" and "no one but himself can save the
world." He has also ordered his followers not to go to doctors
when they fall ill.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, a large number of former Falun Gong
practitioners have quit the illegal organization, while the media,
police and local scientists, including doctors, have spared no
effort to give numerous pieces of evidence concerning the harm
done by Falun Gong, which has caused hundreds of deaths among its
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
In Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province, local
police have accused Li Hongzhi and his Beijing-based Falun Dafa
Research Society of masterminding the April 26 siege of the
provincial government compound by local Falun Gong practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 2,127, or more than 99 percent of local Falun Gong
practitioners in Lanzhou, have renounced the sect, according to
police sources. Of the 163 intellectual practitioners, 161 have
quit Falun Gong, the police said.
</P>
<P>
A report from east China's Jiangsu Province says that most
local retired officials have never believed in the Falun Gong cult.

Construction and Business Bank (CBB), formerly known as the
Housing and Saving Bank, is to be privatized soon, informed
sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In order to complete the transfer of the 60 million birr (7.5
million U. S. dollars) capital bank before the end of 1999, a
foreign consultancy agency is currently conducting assets
evaluation and assessing the 11 modalities proposed for the CBB's
privatization, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
CBB, which turned into its present form in 1995, has a
20-branch network and has provided an outstanding loans of 8.7
million birr (1.1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Finance Minister Sufian Ahmed said Saturday that
government- owned enterprises, which are intended to be
privatized, should examine their accounts prior to the beginning
of the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
According to Ethiopian Privatization Agency General Manager
Beshah Azmite, activities are underway to convert some of the
state-owned enterprises into share companies.
</P>
<P>
The government has designed a mechanism that world enable
workers remain with their enterprises after the privatization
takes place, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 123 government-owned enterprises in the country will be
privatized, the agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The remains of 112 Nanjing
massacre victims have been found at an excavation site on the
premises of the Nanjing Jiangdongmen Museum since the end of last
month, according to the curator of the museum today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chengshan, the curator, said the remains, together with
those of 54 victims discovered near the same site last year, are
vivid evidence of the crimes committed by the Japanese invaders in
1937.
</P>
<P>
According to forensic identification, the remains include
skeletons of young men and women, elderly people and children.
There are nine skeletons of children, the youngest only three
years old. Many victims had been beheaded, and their bodies bore
evidence of wounds and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the burial places where the remains of 166 victims
have been found separately since last year are connected with each
other, covering about 420 sq m. At least 2,000 people are
estimated to have been buried in the area.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents reveal that the area around the
Jiangdongmen Museum was used as a killing ground when the Japanese
committed the massacre in December 1937. More than 10,000 people
were killed at that time.
</P>
<P>
To preserve the evidence, the Nanjing municipal government has
allocated money to build display rooms for the remains.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Visit Monastery in Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 Greek Cypriots
Sunday crossed into the northern Turkish Cypriots-controlled area
of Cyprus to visit the monastery of Saint Andreas on the
Assumption day, a very important day in the Orthodox calendar.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are elderly and young people who visited the
monastery for the first time to attend a church service held there.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Spokeswoman Sarah Russell said here that this is the 12th
such pilgrimage which the U.N. peace-keeping force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) has helped to organize since 1995.
</P>
<P>
She said it is normal practice for the UNFICYP to provide
assistance to the Greek Cypriots to facilitate such visits.
</P>
<P>
The one-day trip started early in the morning when pilgrims
gathered at the Ledra Palace check point in Nicosia to board
buses. And they are due to return before dusk in the day.
</P>
<P>
The convoy of about 25 buses is accompanied by U.N. vehicles to
facilitate passage through the U.N.-controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Greek Cypriots paid several visits to
the northern Turkish Cypriot area on special religious days, such
as Easter Sunday or Assumption Day.
</P>
<P>
Similar trips were also arranged for Turkish Cypriots over the
past few years to visit places of worship in the southern area,
which is controlled by the Cyprus government.

<HEADLINE> Blair Dismisses Covert Election Bid Funding Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
's Office on Sunday denied the media reports that a millionaire
supporter gave the prime minister 250,000 pounds (400,000 U.S.
dollars) to help secure his 1997 general election leadership win.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Sunday Telegraph said former Treasury Minister
Geoffrey Robinson paid the money to fund Blair's private office
before the general election.
</P>
<P>
"It is laughable and ridiculous," the Reuters quoted a
spokesman for Blair as saying. But the spokesman declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who is still a member of parliament, was forced to
resign last year from the Treasury over a home loan of 373,000
pounds (596,800 dollars) to former Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson,
who also resigned last year after it emerged that he failed to
declare the loan.
</P>
<P>
Robinson is expected to expose Labor party funding in a
forthcoming autobiography in revenge for his own disgrace over the
Mandelson loan, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Antiwar Rallies Held to Mark Japan's Surrender in World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Several Japanese civic groups held
antiwar rallies in Tokyo Sunday on the 54th anniversary of Japan's
surrender in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the rallies expressed their opposition to the
enactment of a set of bills to implement the updated Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation guidelines, moves in Japan to revise the
country's peaceful constitution and official visits to the
Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 people took part in a rally staged by the Japan
Peaceful Liaison Conference of Relatives of War Dead at an
assembly hall in central Tokyo on Sunday morning and shouted
slogans such as "Refuse to cooperate in war," "No revision to the
constitution".
</P>
<P>
Addressing the gathering, Okawa, head of the civic organization,
urged the Japanese government to remember the history of Japan's
past invasion to its neighboring Asian countries, and offer
sincere apology to people in those countries and make
compensations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at another rally at the Chitoribuchi graveyard for war
dead, opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairwoman Takako
Doi criticized the government for enacting the bills related to
the new Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines, and warned that
Japan faces the danger to fall into the abyss of war if it
implements the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines call for more Japanese logistic support to U.
S. forces in emergency cases in "areas surrounding Japan". Critics,
however, argued that the guidelines could drag Japan into war.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1993, the U.N. has imposed sanctions on the UNITA,
including prohibition of its trade in diamond, the sale of
petroleum products and arms to the rebel movement, and freezing
UNITA's assets.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions also banned foreign travel by UNITA officials and
adult members of their families.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.N. committee overseeing the enforcement of
sanctions against the UNITA has enlisted the cooperation of a
broad coalition of interests, including the global diamond
industry, to enforce the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the committee, Robert Fowler, assured that the goal
in such broad diplomatic effort is to ensure that the UNITA goes
back to dialog in peacefully resolving the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Angolan ambassador to the United Nations,
Afonso van Dunem, said that his government has made a "positive
endorsement" for the U. N. presence in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
But the ambassador stressed that the Angolan government has
been in favor of a "not so big" U.N. presence, in correspondence
with the reality of the situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings are still going on between the Angolan
government troops and the UNITA rebels in many parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Considering U.N. as a shield for the UNITA, the Angolan
government demanded a pull-out of the U.N. observer mission in
Angola last January when the government troops encountered some
setbacks in battle-fields in the central provinces of Huambo and
Bie. The U.N. mission formally pulled out from the war-torn
country on March 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Now, the U.N. has expressed a will to maintain a mediatory
organization in Angola to facilitate the peace process in the
war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
It is shocking, but true, that some Angolans have never known
peace in their country. The Angolan people as well as the whole
region are eager to see peace in the war-ravaged country as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has since his election been
promoting the idea of "culture of peace" instead of "culture of
arms". The 35th summit of the Organization of the African Unity
(OAU) in Algiers has set the year 2000 as the year of African
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, the southern African leaders, who have
seen the conflicts in Angola and the DRC weakening not only
individual states but also regional efforts to achieve economic
growth and competitiveness, will be considering a fresh initiative
to resolve the Angolan conflict.
</P>
<P>
They, committed to acting in solidarity and resolving conflicts
in the region, will review the situation in Angola and will for
sure reach consensus to bring an early end to the Angolan civil
war which has been going on since 1975 with only some four years
of uneasy truce.
</P>
<P>
But observers here believe that the Angolan crisis will not be
resolved militarily but diplomatically through peaceful and
political means, though the regional leaders will probably back
their support for a peace agreement with the threat of military
force.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seizes Over 500 Kilograms of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish gendarme soldiers have
seized 513.8 kilograms of heroin in an anti-drug operation in
eastern Turkey, an official statement said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the Turkish Gendarme Commandership,
said the gendarme soldiers on Friday stopped a truck in the
anti-drug operation in Agri province near neighboring Iran and
found the heroin in 25 bags and 498 parcels hidden in the secret
places of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle was arrested for alleged involvement
in the case, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The driver confessed that two Iranian drug smugglers gave him
10,000 Marks for bringing the heroin to Istanbul from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police conducted 2,928 operations against
drug-trafficking last year and seized over 10 tons of drugs,
including 5.3 tons of hashish and 3.8 tons of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is on a transit route of drugs from the border area of
Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was wounded
Sunday during Israel's shellings on villages in south Lebanon, the
Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mohammed Mustafa, 65, was injured when shells fired by
Israeli troops fell on the village of Touline in the central
sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to 130 the number of Lebanese civilians
wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this year. Another 18
were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE> SADC Drums Up Support for Mbeki's Renaissance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Africa was still defined as a continent trapped in a spiral of
military coups and debt and haunted by poverty and fastest-growing
rate of HIV infection rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
There was a general feeling at the meeting that political
tension, civil strife, HIV/AIDS and poverty needed to be addressed
urgently if the renaissance vision was to be realized, sources
close to the meeting said on sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place behind close doors to prepare the
ground for the SADC summit slated for August 18.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the heads of the 14 member states are
expected to sign protocols on trade, health, wildlife conservation
and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma, who was
chairing the two-day foreign ministerial meeting, told delegates
that the gathering was convened at a crucial time in SADC's
history.
</P>
<P>
As these countries enter the new millennium, the question is
whether they are collectively ready to face the massive challenges
lying ahead.
</P>
<P>
These included globalization and the need to ensure that
southern AfrIca took charge of its destiny.
</P>
<P>
In ushering in the new millennium, regional governments should
vow to change Africa's image as a continent of war, civil strife,
ethnic tension, genocide and high levels of illiteracy, said Zuma.
</P>
<P>
"History has charged us with the responsibility of doing the
best we can for the benefit of our people. We therefore have to
act in solidarity and resolve areas of conflict before they play
themselves out in wars," she said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there were only four months left before the
next century, she said regional governments needed to consider
whether or not they were ready to pool their resources to effect
rapid socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa should commit itself to abandon war and strive
for peace and stability which, Zuma said, were both prerequisites
for development.
</P>
<P>
"Our people, particularly our children, deserve better. We
have to unleash the creative and innovative energies of our people
-- men and women as equals, including our youth and the disabled
-- for the development of society in our countries, the region and
the rest of the African continent" she said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that there were concerns at the meeting that
although some protocols had been ratified they had not yet been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates called for realizing economic integration and
stimulating economic growth which remained a challenge for the
SADC, stressing that the cost of non-integration is unbearable and
undermines the social upliftment of African people.
</P>
<P>
The SADC states are Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Mauritius, Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Collegians Barred From Joining Rally With DPRK Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,000 South Korean
policemen surrounded the Seoul National University on Sunday to
block thousands of students from marching to the border truce
village Pammunjom to attend a rally on unification.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 students, who had planned to hold the rally with
compatriots from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and overseas Koreans on the day marking the 54th anniversary of
Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, encountered the
blockade as they were leaving the campus for Pammunjom.
</P>
<P>
The besieged students chanted slogans which appeal for
reunification and demanded the authorities guarantee the right of
holding peaceful pro-reunification rallies and abolish the
National Security Law, which bars the pro-DPRK activities.
</P>
<P>
Though the plan of the South Korean collegians was frustrated,
a rally on reunification was held at the north side of the truce
village and some South Koreans managed to attend it, media reports
said here.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Explore Tourism Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Southern
African Development Community (SADC) discussed the possibility of
exploring tourism potential in the region at their just-concluded
meeting, sources close to the meeting said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers ended their two-day close-door meeting late
Saturday night to discuss a wide range of issues prior to a SADC
summit planned for August 18, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to political and military conflicts in the region,
the summit will also highlight economic issues, especially the
"sluggish" economic growth and projected food shortage in the
region, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
A report submitted to the meeting identified tourism as the key
economic drive for the region in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to the 48-page document drafted by the World Travel
and Tourism Council (WTTC), this ever-expanding service sector
offered SADC governments a new opportunity to boost economic
growth and accelerate job creation.
</P>
<P>
The WTTC urged southern African governments to make travel and
tourism a cabinet priority when formulating national policies on
education, employment, trade and investment, as well as in
strategies to encourage poverty alleviation, rural employment and
local government.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that by 2010, tourism could provide some
650,000 jobs through southern Africa. Over 1.6 million jobs could
also be created directly and indirectly by travel demand across
the region's broad economy.
</P>
<P>
The report identified continuing conflict, political and
economic uncertainty in some SADC states as well as high profile
bombings and kidnappings, as impediments to the growth of the
tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of concern included gaps in infrastructure, a lack
of capacity, the need for major investment in facilities and the
high amount of "red tape" both for companies doing business in
SADC countries and for potential visitors.
</P>
<P>
The report said that success in tourism lay in increased public
sector involvement in the development of an overall regional
marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, SADC was advised to implement studies in order
to assist member economies in identifying new market and product
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The report said the southern African countries should move
toward open and competitive markets. This could be achieved by
liberalizing trade, transport and telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
For example, these governments would attract more scheduled and
 chartered air services if they opened up their transport markets,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some countries, including South Africa, have said they
recognize the potential of this sector and its pushing for closer
cooperation in the region.

<HEADLINE> Top Lawmaker Hails Educational Drive, Battle Against Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaker Li Peng
recently spoke highly of the current "Three Stresses" campaign, a
nationwide educational drive to stress theoretical study,
political consciousness and healthy trends among the people.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, emphasized the leading role of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in the work of the country's top legislative body,
whose job is to symbolize the Party's will through legislation.
</P>
<P>
Li is also a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC
Central Committee Political Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China's legislative work should learn from foreign experience,
but never adopt foreign legal theories and systems mechanically,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during the recent hearing of a report on
the "Three Stresses" campaign in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke about the ongoing drive against Falun Gong, an
illegal, anti-government organization masquerading as a health-
promotion group. Headed by Li Hongzhi, the cult conducted illegal
gathering at Zhongnanhai, where the CPC and the central government
are headquartered, and some media offices, in an attempt to make
political gains.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the struggle against the Falun Gong cult is a
serious ideological and political struggle.
</P>
<P>
The case of Falun Gong is not a coincidence, Li said. He urged
steps to improve education in socialist and communist ideals among
cadres and ordinary people, in the course of the fight against
Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Discussion on Rural Development Begins in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A SAARC sub-regional
discussion program on the promotion and development of
cooperatives and rural development institutions started here
Sunday, the official RSS new agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five people including senior officials from the central
banks of Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives and
Bangladesh participated in the five-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the discussion program is to review the
role of cooperatives in rural development of the SAARC countries
-- Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by four Nepali banks and the National
Cooperatives Development Board, will also focus on identifying the
problems of financial institutions and cooperatives and looking
for alternative concepts for institutions involved in poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the program, Nepali Minister for Agriculture
Chakra Prasad Bastola said poverty alleviation has been a common
concern for all SAARC countries, pointing out that all countries
in SAARC are poor and Nepal even poorer than other SAARC
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that since agriculture is the sole source of livelihood
 for 80 percent of Nepalese, agricultural development is an
indispensable effort to bring them into the national mainstream.
</P>
<P>
"We have initiated programs for providing rural credits to
rural women through banks and we are already witnessing the
positive impact of these efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have all made concerted efforts in the past to provide
subsidized fertilizers, seeds, irrigation and agricultural road
facilities to the rural people," Said Bastola.

<P>
Liaoning has a large number of big and medium-sized SOEs, which
are facing golden chances of development under the current
socialist market-driven economic system.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, most of these SOEs and firms
with their main shares controlled by the state, have made profits
for the first time hanks to their efforts to press ahead despite
hardships. The Chinese leader spoke highly of this when he was
briefed on the successes Liaoning has achieved.
</P>
<P>
The SOEs Jiang inspected included the Dalian Shipyard, the
Anshan Iron and Steel Group, the Shenyang N0. 1 Machine Tools
Plant, a real estate management company, an electronic information
company and an aircraft manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection tour, Jiang talked with workers, urging
them to play their key role as the principal force in China's

</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader also urged SOEs to dare to participate in
international competition to develop themselves and upgrade their
technology and equipment in line with advanced international and
domestic norms.
</P>
<P>
While he was shown around in a software firm which was started
by a group of young scientists and technicians, the Chinese
president said that science and technology constitute the primary
productive forces, and great efforts must be made to accelerate
scientific and technological advance and innovations in order to
improve China's comprehensive national strength and ensure the
sustainable, fast and healthy growth of the national economy. He

<P>
SHENYANG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has called on the whole country to emancipate mind and seek truth
from facts to push forward the reform and development of China's
State-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president, who is also general secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of
the Central Military Commission, made the call during an August 10-
15 inspection of some SOEs in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
a traditional heavy industrial base.
</P>
<P>
Jiang termed the SOE reform and development a crucial and cross-
century strategic target under the current international and
domestic situation, which was set forth at the 15th National CPC
Congress and must be well carried out.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the major issue will be put on top of the
agenda at the Fourth Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee,
which will be held in autumn this year.
</P>
<P>
The whole Party and all the people should be completely aware
of the importance and urgency of the SOE reform and development,
as well as of their long-term and protracted nature, Jiang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called on the whole Party and nation to continue to
emancipate mind, seek truth from facts, press ahead despite
difficulties and be keen on reform so as to bring the SOEs that

<HEADLINE> China Sees Rapid Growth of Postal Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The total amount of post office
deposits in China reached 362.2 billion yuan by the end of June
this year, accounting for 6.12 percent of the country's total
savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
The State Postal Bureau (SPB) has become the fifth biggest
recipient of savings deposits in the country, following the four
Chinese commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
An SPB official said that the savings service has grown into
one of the pillar businesses of the SPB since it was restored in
1986.
</P>
<P>
So far, the SPB has set up 31,646 offices handling postal
savings around the country, with 102 million people opening
savings accounts at the offices.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that China's central bank has repeatedly
lowered its interest rates over the past 18 months, postal savings
have continued to grow -- to 261.3 billion yuan by the end of last
year -- an increase 19.9 percent over one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Postal remittances have grown at a rapid rate, in both the
network and volume of transactions.
</P>
<P>
The postal savings service is improving its efficiency and
service quality through computerizing its remittance management
system and over-the-counter services. Some 31 provinces and
municipalities nationwide now conduct postal money order exchanges
with 17 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 counties in 30 provinces and municipalities have
adopted auto-banking of current accounts through a universal real-
time computer system. Within the next 12 months, the computer
system will be expanded to enable transactions, settlement and
network management between provinces and among banks.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the postal savings sector has started many
new services, such as insurance agency, treasury bonds agency,
salary and pension payment, special remittance and savings
remittance.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the postal savings services have
developed so rapidly because the SPB has the largest real-time
computer system in the country. Its has such competitive edges as
large numbers of outlets, low charges, convenience, reliability
and long service hours.

<P>
MAPUTO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Angola crisis, together with
the fragile Congo cease-fire, will be one major topic at the
coming summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
in Maputo next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It must have been one major issue grinding the minds of the
ministers of SADC member states at the just ended closed-door
meeting of the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
What kind of solutions to the crisis will the ministers present
to the heads of state or government at the summit?
</P>
<P>
At the last SADC summit in Mauritius last September, the
regional leaders declared Angolan rebel movement UNITA chief Jonas
Savimbi a war criminal, "to be hunted down", but the political
will and the military means lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this matter has to be reconsidered, and the Maputo
summit would aim at a fresh political accord guaranteed by
regional governments.
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday summit, there will be the political will to
resolve the conflict which has created some two million refugees
and even compounded the poverty situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
If the war carries on for a few more months, there may be
horrible stories of starvation, said an official with the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The World Food Program
(WFP) has also estimated that Angola currently needs some 13,000
tons of food aid each month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
might seek military help from its SADC neighbors to settle the
civil war with the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan authorities have issued an arrest warrant against
Savimbi on charges including rebellion, sabotage, murder and
torture.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was said to be pressuring South Africa and other
countries in the region to agree at the summit to use military
force to back peace efforts in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to some Zimbabwean officials, the cease-fire
agreement for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which
was signed in Zambian capital Lusaka on July 10 by the six
countries directly involved in the DRC conflict, represented "a
new vision for peace-keeping in Africa", which should be extended
to the Angolan context.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find Connection Between Psychosis Chromosome Abnormality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese researchers
led by Feng Zhiying, the president of Tianjin's Anding Hospital,
have concluded that males with two X-chromosomes or females with
one X-chromosome are more likely to suffer from psychosis than
normal people.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the group began conducting research on 1,038 male and
1,746 female patients at the hospital who were suffering from
psychosis and found that a probability of the X-chromosome
abnormality of 3.2 percent for the male patients and 7.5 percent
for the female patients. The probability of X-chromosome
abnormality among normal men is 1 out of 1,500 and among normal
women 1 out of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The research team also found from clinical studies that people
suffering from X-chromosome abnormalities have other symptoms like
slow brain and body development, incomplete growth of sperm or
ovaries, and sex gland disorders.
</P>
<P>
Professor Feng Zhiying suggests that people suffering from X-
chromosome abnormalities be given psychological adjustment at an
early age and supplementary treatment for improper glandular
secretions, as well as special education for the mentally retarded
to reduce the incidence of psychosis at an older age if they are
diagnosed with the abnormality when they are still young.
</P>
<P>
The real cause of psychosis is still unknown, but the disease
is commonly believed to be connected to heredity and environment.

<P>
KUNMING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Officials and scholars from
China, India, Myanmar and Bangladesh said here today that the four
countries should make joint efforts to accelerate economic
development and develop long-term relations of friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They made this call at an international forum on economic
cooperation and development among the four countries that opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 scholars, diplomats and entrepreneurs gathered at
the forum to discuss strategies and prospects for cooperation and
development between the four countries.
</P>
<P>
They said that there is great potential for economic
cooperation between them, because all four are developing
countries with rich mineral, energy, agricultural and tourism
resources.
</P>
<P>
The four nations also enjoy geographical advantages for
developing economic cooperation, as their mutual borders are
located where China, Southeast Asia and South Asia meet, forming a
venue for economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that closer cooperation and exchanges will help
the four countries make better use of their resources and
advantages.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, a series of cooperation projects,
including dredging water channels and building highways, have been
launched in the four countries' border areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Sam
Nujoma of Namibian and Laurent Kabila of the DRC met in Luanda and
formed an alliance with dos Santos against the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state resolved to use "all possible measures" to
help dos Santos' government.
</P>
<P>
However, so far, "all possible measures" have excluded
Zimbabwean and Namibian military involvement because they already
have thousands of troops in the DRC, propping up Kabila's regime,
and the troops there are unlikely to be home before Christmas as
expected.
</P>
<P>
"A military deployment now by Zimbabwe is out of the question.
But there has to be that general consensus within the SADC on a
military commitment shared by all countries which would lighten
the burden," a diplomat based in Luanda said, adding that although
Angolan issue would be high on the agenda, there would be no
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Military intervention is never going to happen, the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
Boniface Chidyausika, Zimbabwe's outgoing ambassador to Angola,
also said that the diplomatic approach was the only way. "If there
is a common approach, a common position, it could be like Congo.
Intervention in Angola could be similar to that in Congo. But
diplomatically not militarily," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Zimbabwe has been trying to persuade
other SADC states, South Africa in particular, into getting
involved militarily on the side of Kabila in the DRC and dos
Santos' government in Angola.
</P>
<P>
But all the indications are that South Africa is understandably
 reluctant to fall into the kind of regional entrapment being
suggested by Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
South Africa sent peace-keeping troops to the DRC only after
the cease- fire was signed and would engage only in information
gathering.
</P>
<P>
Senior South African government officials dismissed the
Zimbabwean official's suggestion that a willingness was developing
among SADC member states to deploy military forces in Angola to
back up a new peace initiative there.
</P>
<P>
However, South African deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad has
said that his government will continue to vigorously pursue the
agenda for peace and conflict resolution on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the SADC would reinforce its efforts in Angola as the
United Nations has urged to enforce the sanctions against the
UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the non-effectiveness of the sanctions, the UNITA
rebels have raised an estimated three to four billion U.S. dollars
over the past eight years through diamond sales.

<P>
Shao Xin, a college student at Shenyang Industrial University,
said that he was "surprised and outraged" upon learning of the
behind-the-scenes activities of Li Hongzhi during the gathering.
</P>
<P>
He said that Li Hongzhi's preaching actually had ulterior
political motives, and his schemes were directed at the Chinese
government. "We should further bring to light his true nature and
mischief, and guard against all superstitious thoughts and anti-
government activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Jihui from Zhengzhou University also expressed
indignation over Li and his role in the gathering. " Li's behavior
was not only a threat to the government, but also to the entire 1.
2-billion Chinese people," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Li Long, a law professor at Wuhan University, said that the
illegal gathering seriously disrupted public order and hampered
the country's security, and should be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in southwest China's Guizhou
Province also condemned Li's crime of inciting people to gather at
Zhongnanhai. They said that Li's true nature was fully exposed
when his political motive was made public.
</P>
<P>
Li Lidong, a police officer in east China's Jinan City,
Shandong Province, said that he has begun to see more clearly that
Li's Falun Gong is a well-organized group with sinister motives,
and Li's attempts to disrupt social stability are doomed to
failure.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Chinese departments also agree that the illegal
gathering at Zhongnanhai was a deliberate, well-organized and well-
planned political incident aimed at exerting pressure on the
Chinese government and causing social disorder.
</P>
<P>
They said that they fully support the government's decision to
ban Falun Gong, and will fight against the illegal organization to
the end.

BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's tourism industry
continued to grow in the first half of this year despite a 15
percent appreciation of its currency from the same period last
year, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and related businesses earned the country up to 138
billion baht (3.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of this
year, with foreign tourist arrivals rising to nearly 3.5 million,
TNA quoted Thai Farmers' Research Center, a leading research
institute of the country, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from East Asia outpaced those from western countries
in the first six months this year, with their arrivals reaching
2.44 million, an increase of 18 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Economic revival in some East Asian countries and people there
changing behavior to travel to near and cheap destinations rather
than far away ones were reasons behind the surge, the research
center noted.
</P>
<P>
Overall foreign tourist arrivals are expected to reach 8.4
million, an 8.2 percent increase from last year, according to the
research center.

<HEADLINE> State of Emergency Declared in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A month-long state of emergency
was declared by Russia's breakaway Chechnya republic on Sunday,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's office said during the
state of emergency, which starts Monday, the troops will be put on
combat alert and stricter passage regime will be imposed along its
border with Dagestan, another Russian republic where federal
troops are routing Islamic militants that took several villages.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov's decision came after Russian acting Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin's indication Friday that rebel positions inside
Chechnya could also be bombed in the latest campaign against the
Islamic militants who infiltrated the Dagestani villages.
</P>
<P>
The armed gunmen are commanded by Chechen warlord Shamil
Basayev and Khattab, an Arab who is thought to be from Jordan or
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The militants seized the villages in the Botlikh district of
Dagestan, close to the border with Chechnya, on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Chechen authorities have repeatedly denied that they had
anything to do with the militants roaming the Dagestani villages.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with regional officials Friday in Tomsk, Siberia,
Putin said Russian troops would pound rebel positions wherever
possible, including inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Chechnya - this is the territory of Russia, and we will strike
at militants wherever they are located," Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Catholic Youths Continue Violent Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Catholic youths continued with
sporadic acts of violence in Northern Ireland's second-largest
city of Londonderry early Sunday morning, hours after thousands of
Protestant Apprentice Boys marched through the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the cover of darkness, several vehicles were hijacked and
burnt, and one was used to ram a shopfront which was then set
alight. Several buildings, including three banks, were also badly
damaged by fire.
</P>
<P>
Police said most shops in the city center of Londonderry, known
as Derry to its Catholic majority, were looted.
</P>
<P>
Fire engines moved around the town, but there were no sign of
the clashes between police and demonstrators during the day
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of between two and three hundred people were said to
have gathered in the city center in the early hours of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police stayed out of the area for much of the night, but
officers in riot gear eventually moved in to clear the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's controversial parade, involving up to 10,000
Apprentice Boys and 150 bands, was held amid a huge security
presence.
</P>
<P>
Police succeeded in keeping apart the marchers and residents of
the city's mainly Catholic and nationalist Bogside area.
</P>
<P>
Petrol bomb attacks continued overnight. Nationalist youths
attacked the police throughout Saturday afternoon, while a number
of lorries were hijacked and burnt out, but the march itself
passed off peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The march in Londonderry followed violence in the Lower Ormeau
Road area of Northern Ireland capital Belfast on Saturday morning
when nationalists attempted to block the route of a smaller
Apprentice Boys parade.
</P>
<P>
Scuffles broke out as police wearing riot gear moved 200
demonstrators who were sitting in the road. Several people
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
Parades by the Protestant Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys
have been the subject of controversy for many years in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The marchers view the parades as a traditional expression of
their culture, but in Catholic nationalist areas they are often
viewed as intimidating.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's parades commemorated the 1689 Siege of Derry, when
Protestant apprentices shut the gates of the walled city against
the forces of the Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
The Londonderry and Belfast parades were given the go-ahead by
the Northern Ireland Parades Commission.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Londonderry happened as the people of Omagh
prepared to mark the first anniversary of the bombing of the town
which claimed 29 lives. It was the worst atrocity in more than 30
years of violence in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Ready to Implement First Anti-money Laundering Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Justice Ministry is
ready to implement its first money laundering control law which is
targeted to help the country fight drug trafficking and other
illicit transactions, Thailand News Agency (TNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Suthas Ngernmuon was quoted by TNA as saying
that those who had laundered money in Thailand would find it very
hard to pick up a legal loophole to continue their illicit
operation after the new law takes effect.
</P>
<P>
He said the Office of the Anti-Money Laundering Committee would
be set up soon to facilitate the enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness of the new law would depend on the
cooperation of financial institutions which should examine the
accounts of their clients to trace any unusual transactions, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
"If the law was implemented effectively, it would also help the
government suppress drug trafficking gangs," said Suthas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Parliament President Wan Muhamad Nor Matha was
reported as saying that the authorities would be empowered to
check the financial records of money laundering suspects with the
implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law requires financial institutions, land registration
offices and some other professions to report all transactions that
are unusual, suspicious or in excess of a given amount to the
Office of the Anti-Money Laundering Committee.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Marks "National Mourning Day" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshis Sunday observed the
24th anniversary of the death of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, "the
Father of the Nation."
</P>
<P>
The day is officially observed as "National Mourning Day" since
1996, when the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina, the eldest of
the two surviving daughters of Mujibur Rahman, came to power after
21 years.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of the day in 1975, Mujibur Rahman and his
family members were killed by some disgruntled army officers, and
were survived only by his two daughters -- Sheikh Hasina, the
incumbent prime minister, and Sheikh Rehana, who happened to be
abroad during the killing.
</P>
<P>
Mujibur Rahman, born in March 1920, was the first prime
minister of independent Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Various programs were organized by political parties and other
organizations to mark the day, which was declared a public
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina placed wreaths at the portrait of Mujibur
Rahman at his residence in Dhanmondi in the city.
</P>
<P>
In a message issued on the occasion, the president said "His
life-long dedication and continuos struggle resulted in the birth
of an independent and sovereign Bangladesh through a... War of
Liberation."
</P>
<P>
"His tragic death... is a shameful chapter of our national
history," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on political parties to forget "political difference,
bitterness among ourselves and sorrows of the past in the great
interest of the nation," and to ensure "national advancement"
through unity and consensus by forgetting narrow party
affiliations.
</P>
<P>
In a separate message, Hasina urged "all the countrymen to take
a vow to work for building a happy and prosperous 'Sonar Bangla'
(prosperous Bangladesh)... by turning the grief... into strength."
</P>
<P>
"We shall have to be successful in the struggle for building a
country free from hunger, illiteracy and poverty, flourishing
democratic culture and establishment of rule of law," she said.

DHAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chittagong Port Authority
(CPA) of Bangladesh has undertaken development projects with a
total cost of 228 million U.S. dollars to enhance the country's
foreign trade activities through expansion of container handling
capacity of the port, according to press reports available here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong Port is the largest sea port, which is 224
kilometers southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, a 150-million-dollar container terminal
with a 1,000-meter-long berthing capacity will be built at the new
mooring area of the port, CPA sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three feeder container vessels or two larger container vessels
and two to three general cargo vessels will be accommodated at the
berth.
</P>
<P>
Required back-up facilities for container handling will also be
constructed and container-handling equipment will be procured
under the self-financing project.
</P>
<P>
The consultant, yet to be appointed, will prepare the
specification and other details of the project, and BCEOM of
France and Mott McDonald of Britain are trying to get the
consultancy job.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project is scheduled to be implemented during the
current fiscal year and be completed in the 2004-2005 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The CPA will procure 142 pieces of container handling equipment
at a cost of 61 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CPA would arrange the fund from its own resources and
procure the equipment through international tender if other
sources cannot be managed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the CPA will also construct a 77,000 square meter
container yard at an estimated cost of 13 million dollars to be
funded from its own resources, and the project is scheduled to
commence in the current fiscal year and be completed in the
2001-2002 period.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Boosted in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 15 (Xinhua) -- General consumer confidence
improved in Kuwait in July after the formation of the new
government, which comprises a strong economic team, an opinion
poll published here Sunday showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Ipsos Stat, a local marketing research
company, and obtained by the Arab Times newspaper, showed that the
consumer confidence index picked up by four points to 67 in July,
the third best result in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The poll is conducted monthly among 1,000 randomly selected
men and is aimed at reflecting people's opinion on Kuwait's
current and future economic situation, the security situation,
expectations about future purchasing power and the level of
satisfaction with personal income. All index figures show the
ratio on a zero-to-100-point scale.
</P>
<P>
Ipsos Stat said the increase came as a surprise as it had
expected consumer confidence to drop during the month when
Kuwaitis and expatriates were abroad spending their summer
vacations.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it said "the parliament elections and the subsequent
formation of a new government with a strong economic component
were welcomed by local consumers, who were given impetus to spend
more on local goods."
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, although people's perception of the
current economic situation remained weak, with the indicator
rising to 40 from 37, their perception of the future economic
performance was very positive, with the index climbing to 74
points.
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction with personal income also improved during the
month of July, with 66 percent, a 6 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Both Kuwaitis and expatriates were expecting an improvement in
people's purchasing power in the future as the index picked up by
6 points to 70.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti and expatriate consumers were feeling more secure in
the Gulf state, with security situation index gained 8 points
to 81 in July.

<HEADLINE> Serious Crimes Down in Second Quarter in Uganda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Cases of serious crimes have
been in a downward trend in the second quarter of this year,
according to a report from the Ugandan police.
</P>
<P>
The six-page report from the Criminal Investigations Department
(CID) said that a total of 155 murder (not by shooting) cases were
recorded with 78 arrests in the second quarter compared with 395
murder cases leading to 271 arrests in the first three months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Murder induced by shooting, however, stood at 32 cases with
only 15 arrests, down from 103 cases and 37 arrests in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
From April to June, cases of defilement and related arrests
also showed drastic drop, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This declining trend was also reflected in armed and simple
robberies. There were 457 cases of armed robbery recorded in the
first quart and 175 arrests effected while in the second quarter
the figure went down to 193 cases with 86 arrests.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the plummeting of these serious crimes to
the raised public awareness and tightening up of security
measures.
</P>
<P>
However, the report warned that although serious crimes are
going down, they are still very rampant in the capital city of
Kampala and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The police authorities would, as ever, take serious measures to
detect and weed out corrupt elements from the police force, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Drought Forces 5,000 Kenyans Flee to Uganda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Drought in northwestern Kenya is
forcing thousands of farmers there into Uganda, with more than
5,000 already camped in hastily set-up villages.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Pokot tribesmen with their herds and families have
joined their Ugandan cousins across the border, Sunday's New
Vision quoted Moroto District Chairman Terrence Achia as saying
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kenyans joined their cousins in Karamoja, a
nomad tribe in northeastern Uganda famous for cattle rustling, in
search of food, grazing ground and water.
</P>
<P>
The tribemen in the exodus are camped in kraals (walled
villages) 80 km south of the main town of Moroto, itself 450 km
northeast of the capital city of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was worried that the influx might result in
ethnic killings following the most recent one in which about 140
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 140 villagers were massacred on July 29 when
a Karamojong sub-tribe combined with Kenya's Turkana warriors
attacked their rival Bakora tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan official said that the Pokot influx is scaring
people who are already traumatized by the recent killings and
called on the government to take security measures to avoid
occurrence of similar killings.
</P>
<P>
Spates of killings involving dozens in single incidents are
rife among the Karamojong who fight for cattle and grazing ground
between their rival sub-tribes, neighboring tribes and related
pastoralists from across the Kenyan border.

<HEADLINE> Eight Japanese Cabinet Members Visit Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight Japanese cabinet members
visited Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine Sunday to pay respects to Japan's
war dead on the 54th anniversary of the country's surrender in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The shrine houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war
criminals, including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, and some
2.4 million Japanese military personnel and officials who died
since 1853 in Japan's various wars.
</P>
<P>
The eight cabinet members included Transport Minister Jiro
Kawasaki, Labor Minister Akira Amari and Environment Agency chief
Kenji Manabe.
</P>
<P>
Their visits, plus that by Construction Minister Katsutsugu on
Tuesday, have brought to nine the total number of cabinet
ministers who have paid respects at the shrine this year, down
from 13 last year.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has said that "taking the
current circumstances into consideration," he would not make a
similar visit. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka also said he
would refrain from going to prevent "unnecessary misunderstanding.
"
</P>
<P>
Besides Obuchi and Nonaka, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura,
Education Minister Akito Arima and six other ministers have
indicated they would not make a visit.
</P>
<P>
Japanese cabinet members' visits to the shrine, a bastion of
the wartime military government-sponsored Shintoism and symbol of
militarism in Japan before and during World War II, draw
widespread criticism from Japan's neighboring Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers' visits to the shrine are also controversial
as Japan's postwar Constitution stipulates separation of religion
and the State.

<HEADLINE> Iran Issues Report on Student Rally Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme National Security
Council (SNSC) issued a report Saturday night on the rally of
Tehran University students last month and the following clashes
with police and civilian opponents in the dormitory.
</P>
<P>
The report said an investigation committee set up by SNSC
found the Tehran University dorm incident on July 8-9 is
"completely separate" from ensuing demonstrations and street riots.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred students staged a rally on July 8 at Tehran
University to protest the newly-approved Press Law and a ban on
the popular daily Salam (Hello), which supported moderate
President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Violence occurred after riot police forced into students'
dormitories without permission from the Interior Ministry. It was
the most violent clash since the 1979 Islamic revolution and
conservative plots were believed to be behind the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
No student was killed, the report said. But three people - a
civilian opponent, a police officer and a conscript of the Islamic
Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) - were shot by bullets in the
incident. The conscript died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The report said the probe committee believes that the law
enforcement forces had not pre-planned any confrontation with the
students and that there are no evidence indicating the chain of
command of law enforcement forces had made any earlier decisions
in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The report thus relieved senior commanders of the law
enforcement forces and special police and plainclothes of the
responsibility for the crackdown and blamed lower-ranking
officers, including a Tehran district commander, and civilian
opponents for fueling the violence.
</P>
<P>
More violent clashes erupted between riot police and thousands
of demonstrators protesting against the police crackdown on the
Tehran University students.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of a SNSC ban on illegal gatherings, several
groups of masked demonstrators armed with clubs and stones
clashed with rival groups, causing street riots, local reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The worsening situation prompted Khatami to call law and
order. "Any riot is against the interest of the Islamic system and
the nation as well as the government's slogans and policies,"
Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the president further stressed that violence,
tension and social, cultural and historical disintegration are
the worst enemies of political development and realization of a
civic society, economic growth and reforms.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC report seems aimed at calming down the situation,
further investigation is still underway.

<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A specialized export credit
insurance company is under planning as a way to encourage China's
exports, the China Daily Business Weekly reports on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up such a company has been considered for
years and details of the preparatory work are now being discussed
by relevant government bodies, including the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance, China
Insurance Regulatory Commission, People's Insurance Company of
China and the Export and Import Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory work may finish later this year, the report
said. It did not say when the company will be established.
</P>
<P>
A type of insurance typically backed by the government, the
export credit insurance covers economic losses resulted from
delayed importer's payments or debiting, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The insurance can help exporters increase credibility and its
accessibility to bank loans. It will also help boost exporter's
competitiveness by offering favorable and flexible payment
patterns.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Production Line in Jordan Expected to Reopen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Pepsi-Cola
Jordan branch expected their production line banned for
contamination last week to resume full production soon.
</P>
<P>
The officials described the ongoing meeting between the
Pepsi-Cola executives and the Jordanian Health Ministry as
positive and the ministry has approved recommendations for
improving the production procedures, Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry also dropped its threat to bring the local
Pepsi-Cola to trial, an unnamed Pepsi-Cola official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The reusable bottling line of the Jordan Ice and Aerated Water
Company, a local bottling branch of Pepsi-Cola company of the
United States, was shut down last Tuesday after laboratory tests
showed they were contaminated with impurities, including sands,
insects and cement.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Ishaq Maraqa said Tuesday the plant`s
production of Miranda, Pepsi and 7UP will be banned for a week
before the bottler is taken to court.
</P>
<P>
He also hinted Tuesday the ban could be indefinite and would
not be lifted until the production line met the hygienic
standards set by his ministry.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola in reusable bottles are the flagship product of the
Pepsi company in the Jordanian market, accounting for some 80
percent of its overall operations in the kingdom with 20 million
cases each year.
</P>
<P>
Other production lines for canisters and plastic bottles were
not closed since the decision only covered glass bottles, Jordan
Times said.
</P>
<P>
The semi-closure came at the peak sales season for the soft
drink manufacturer with an influx of tourists and increased local
consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, local Pepsi-Cola officials refused to estimated the
potential losses which might be inflicted by the temporary ban.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola products accounted for some 75 percent of the
soft drinks market in Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Control in UAE Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The transmission of malaria
has been successfully controlled in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
due to the preventive measures taken by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
"All malaria cases diagnosed in the last six years in the UAE
were found in expatriates or those who visited countries plagued
with the disease," reported Gulf Today daily on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 mobile teams to monitor malaria across the
country, and every year, a malaria test is conducted in 50,000
random blood samples, Dr. Mahmoud Fikri, assistant under-secretary
for preventive medicine at the Ministry of Health, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
All the malaria cases diagnosed have been treated locally, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry is coordinating with the World Health
Organization to test a new method to control malaria by using a
biological fish to kill the larva that causes malaria instead of
using chemical insecticides.
</P>
<P>
Natural breeding grounds of the anopheles mosquitoes, which
transmit the disease, are limited in the UAE and have been
further reduced during this summer.
</P>
<P>
Some 83,005 potential breeding grounds in the UAE were
identified and checked in 1994, of which only 1,493 showed the
presence of the anopheles mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the ministry will attend the regional
consultation meeting on the "Roll Back Malaria" program, to be
held in Cairo, Egypt, from September 14 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Fikri said the meeting is aimed at exposing the countries in
the eastern Mediterranean region to the strategic plan for
implementation of the program.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Members Bare More Sect Secrets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- More Falun Gong key members
have come forward to reveal the truth about the illegal sect and
tell about the miseries of practicing it.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yanbin and Li Shasha, leafding members of the Falun Gong
general training center in this capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, said that the illegal gathering at the compound
of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of
China in 1996 was well-prepared and directed by the Research
Society of Falun Dafa, the top governing body of the banned Falun
Gong organization.
</P>
<P>
They said that on December 30 that year, Xu Yingquan, head of
the Falun Gong general training center in Changchun, capital of
neighboring Jilin Province, came to Shenyang with directions from
the research society, convened an emergency meeting and drew up a
detailed plan for the gathering.
</P>
<P>
On the next day, Xu made an on-the-spot inspection of the
compound, and then led Falun Gong practitioners to the gate of the
compound, which was later heavily surrounded.
</P>
<P>
After the truth of the April 25 illegal gathering at
Zhongnanhai was unveiled, Liu and Chen realized that they had been
fooled by Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
They said that facts have proved that Li Hongzhi is truly a
political liar with evil motives, and Falun Gong is "opium" to
fool the people. They vowed to break away from Falun Gong and
stand on the side of the Party and the people.

<HEADLINE> Barak Orders Army Preparation for Implementing Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has instructed the army to begin preparations for resuming
implementation of the Wye Memorandum on September 1, Israel Radio
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak has told the
IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) to prepare to put in motion the
implementation of the Wye agreement at the beginning of September
1999. This means the land handover will begin on October 1," the
radio quoted a statement issued by the prime minister's office
late Saturday night as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the other issues outstanding between the
two sides regarding Wye will be discussed," the statement said,
referring to such matters as the opening of a Palestinian seaport
in Gaza and a safe passage route linking Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
This announcement was actually a reiteration of Barak's
proposal on the timetable of restarting the Wye interim accord,
signed with the Palestinians by his hard-line predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu last October.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu froze the agreement, which calls on Israel to hand
over another 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians,
after carrying out the first of its three stages.
</P>
<P>
Ousting Netanyahu in the May election, Barak has promised to
implement the remaining stages of Wye, but proposed some changes
including folding the final stage into the final-status talks,
which deal with thorny issues like Jerusalem and Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have reluctantly accepted his proposal to
restart the Wye agreement on the beginning of September and begin
to carry out the second stage of troop withdrawal on October 1.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have been at odds over Barak's suggestion to
postpone the implementation of the third stage until February
2000, when the final-status talks are supposed to have been well
under way.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that the third stage be carried out by
mid-November in line with the original timetable of Wye.

Barak's envoy Gilad Sher and senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat met in Jerusalem Saturday night, for the second time
in three days, to continue their effort to resolve the difference
on the timetable for the Wye implementation.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
will hold a summit early in the week if the two negotiators reach
agreement on a timetable, Israel Radio reported. The Palestinians
have denied that such a summit has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Sher and Erekat made no progress in their latest talks, but
promised to meet again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barak talked twice with U.S. President Bill Clinton
on the phone to discuss the latest developments in the peace
process and the upcoming visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright originally scheduled her visit in mid-August with an
aim of ensuring the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are on the
track and restarting the frozen negotiations between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
But she has postponed the visit by two weeks at the request of
Barak, who wants Washington to give him more time to iron out his
dispute with Arafat.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jin Guiqin, former head of the Falun Gong training base in
Liaoning's Anshan city, said that Falun Gong is well organized,
and orders from above were transmitted by telephones and even
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
She said that she has come to realize that Li Hongzhi, instead
of being a god, is a person with vicious political ambitions,
adding that she hates Li for fooling so many people.
</P>
<P>
Former Falun Gong official Wang Liyun from Hengyang City in
central China's Hunan Province also told of the miseries he and
his wife had suffered through practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in 1994 he began to practise Falun Gong, in the
hope of curing his illness. His wife soon followed suit.
</P>
<P>
After two years of practicing, his wife felt an acute pain in
her abdomen, but she refused to take medicine because Li Hongzhi
had said that Falun Gong could cure any illness. She insisted on
practicing Falun Gong until January 1, 1998, when she could not
practice any more because of the pain. She was rushed to hospital,
and died of cancer in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Wang's own illness also deteriorated, but his wife's death
brought him to his senses and he went to see a doctor. Since then,
his condition has improved remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that, as a victim of Falun Gong, he is determined to
tell other people the truth about Falun Gong, from his own
experience, to reveal Li Hongzhi's evil motives.

<HEADLINE> China's PC Market Taking Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The popularity of home PCs
boosted the bottom line of China's sluggish computer companies
during the first half of this year as foreign brands faced
increasing competition from local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report conducted by International Data Corp.(IDC)
said shipments of home desktops soared 40.8 percent to 500,000
units during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
"The home PC market, after one-year's cultivation, is taking
off and will be a new growth area for the whole PC market," Fanny
Yang, a research manager with IDC China, was cited by today's
Business Weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 2.22 million units of home PCs were shipped, up 19.
6 percent from the same period last year, while business desktop
shipments grew 14 percent to 1.56 million.
</P>
<P>
Foreign computer makers, which have long focused on China' high-
end market and group purchasing, began attempts to tap the country
's mid-level consumer pool.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, domestic PC companies, especially newcomers, have
shifted their focus from the business sector to the fledgling home
PC market.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic PC companies hold an advantage in exploring the huge
potential of the home PC market," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of market performance, the local brands have gained a
dominant position after a long race with foreign giants.
</P>
<P>
IDC reports indicate that six of the top ten vendors in China's
computer market during the first six months of the year were local
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders said the market share of foreign brands is
likely to shrink further when the country's home PC market booms.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build more
subways in large cities each with a population of more than one
million.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 15 out of the 34 big cities have already
submitted applications to the State Development Planning
Commission for building subways, today's Business Weekly reports.
</P>
<P>
Subway lines proposed total 430 kilometers, requiring estimated
investments of 140 billion yuan (16.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts said that developing rail transportation is a
fundamental way for the country's big cities to solve
transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the national economy and imminent
urbanization, the number of automobiles has been increasing at a
speed much faster than that of road construction, they said.
</P>
<P>
Many large cities have eyed subways to deal with worsening
traffic congestion in the 1990s. Work on several new subway lines
in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing is now underway.

<HEADLINE> China's Cosmetic Industry Prospering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's cosmetic industry
expects more than cosmetic success in the coming century, analysts
said here recently.
</P>
<P>
According to a national plan, the country's annual cosmetic
industry output will reach 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in year 2000, with total exports valued at 150 million U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to hit 80 billion yuan (9.6 billion U.S.
dollars) by the end of 2010, with export values shooting for 500
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to opening-up policies and a betterment of people's
living standards, China's cosmetic industry is maintaining a
dramatic momentum," Zhang Dianyi, board chairman of China Perfume,
Essence and Cosmetic Industry Association, was quoted as saying by
today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the output of China's cosmetic
industry rose from 200 million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) in
1982 to more than 25 billion yuan (3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Given China's huge population, the industry is anticipating
rosy prospects in the foreseeable future," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the association indicate that in developed
countries, the annual per capita consumption of cosmetics is 35-70
U.S. dollars, while the figure in China is only 20 yuan (2.4 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Industry experts believe several cosmetic products may stir up
the domestic market in the coming years, including hair care and
skin care products and goods that are used in beauty salons.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,500 licensed enterprises are now engaged in the
sector in China.

<HEADLINE> Slum Dwellers Coming Back to Bangladeshi Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Some slum dwellers, who were
earlier evicted by law-enforcing members, have started to return
to their respective places in Dhaka on hearing the news that the
High Court had ordered the government not to evict the slum
dwellers till August 19.
</P>
<P>
They have already started building thatched houses afresh at
their respective places in the capital city, The New Nation
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The slum people, along with the newcomers, were seen taking
shelters at different city slums where slums were demolished
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's High Court last Thursday directed the government
not to remove any more slums in the capital city till August 19
when the court resumes hearing of a writ petition challenging the
eviction of slums.
</P>
<P>
The writ petition, filed by three non-governmental
organizations and two slum dwellers, challenged the legality and
authority of the demolition of slums in Dhaka and the eviction of
inhabitants without arranging alternative accommodation and
without any prior notice.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day eviction drive beginning last Sunday,
members of the law-enforcing agencies dismantled about 10,000
shanties, rendering over 60,000 poor people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that there are around 2 million slum dwellers in
Dhaka, which has a population of about 9 million.
</P>
<P>
A section of the slum dwellers under the patronage of some
godfathers were involved in drug and arms trafficking, and the
eviction drive was aimed at cutting crime and criminal activities,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
The Home Ministry directed the law-enforcing agencies to evict
the slums following the killing of a police constable in the city
early this month.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Reiterates Remorse for Asian War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi expressed "deep remorse" once again on Sunday for Japan's
wartime acts in Asia while extending condolences to war victims in
neighboring Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"That war caused tremendous pain and sorrow not only to our
country but also to people in many countries, particularly those
in neighboring Asian countries. We would like to express our deep
regret and condolences to them sincerely," Obuchi said at a
government-sponsored ceremony marking the 54th anniversary of
Japan's surrender in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, Japan's prime ministers have made
similar remarks concerning Asian war victims at the annual event.
It was the second time for Obuchi to address such a ceremony since
he took office last July.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi meanwhile stressed the importance of building a
permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
"It is our important obligation to look back at the past with
sincerity, to pass onto the younger generation knowledge of the
sacrifices of the war dead as well as to build a permanent peace
so as to avoid a recurrence of the disaster of a terrible war,"
Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, some 6,000
relatives of the Japanese war dead and about 1,000 government
officials and lawmakers attended the ceremony held at Nippon
Budokan hall in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the ceremony offered a minute of silent prayer
at noon for souls of the 3.1 million Japanese who died in the war.
</P>
<P>
In a brief memorial address delivered after the prayer, Emperor
Akihito also offered condolences to the war dead and prayed for
world peace.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Says Indian Economy Strong Despite Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said on Sunday that the Indian economy has emerged
strong despite the recent armed conflict with Pakistan in Kashmir
and economic sanctions imposed on it following its nuclear tests
in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on India's Independence Day here,
Vajpayee said economic growth increased to six percent and
inflation went down to an unprecedented 17-year low of around 1.19
percent.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production hit an all-time high of over 200
million tons in 1998-99 and the foreign exchange reserves exceeds
over 30 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said the economic sanctions against his country had
lost their effect and become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
In his 26-minute speech, Vajpayee ruled out resumption of
stalled bilateral talks with Pakistan on the ground that Islamabad
continued support for cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
India would not allow Pakistan to succeed in its "designs" to
foment trouble in India and would take all steps to safeguard
security of the country, he told his countrymen from the ramparts
of the heavily-guarded historic Fed Fort in the capital.
</P>
<P>
He described his Lahore bus diplomacy last February as "a well
thought out and planned step" and accused Pakistan of having
"grounded the bus" by violating the Lahore pact in the conflict in
Kargil.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with results George Bush Wins U.S. Republican Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- George W. Bush, State
Governor of Texas, won the Iowa straw poll held on Saturday, which
was deemed as the first test to the U.S. Republican contenders for
the 2000 presidency.
</P>
<P>
Bush, also son of former President George Bush, achieved the
upper hand by pocketing 7,418 votes, followed by Steve Forbes and
Elithebeth Dole with 4,921 votes and 3,410 votes respectively,
said the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
"We won the vote," said Bush, who sought to solidify his front-
runner status through the informal poll." The winner is not George
W. Bush. It's the Republican Party and great ideas."
</P>
<P>
Republican Party officials said 24,500 people cast the ballots
on the campus of Iowa State University, twice as many as expected.
</P>
<P>
Many participants traveled aboard air-conditioned buses by
courtesy of the candidates, who also lured them with free food and
entertainment, and picked up the tab for the 25 dollars tickets
needed to vote.
</P>
<P>
Bush aides said they had purchased nearly 11,000 ballots and
distributed most of them to supporters.
</P>
<P>
Bush has budgeted 750,000 dollars for the contest while Steve
Forbes, a publishing giant and multimillionaire, reportedly spent
two million dollars on the event.
</P>
<P>
The straw poll is a fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican party,
as well as a political circus. Advocates say it helps provide an
assessment of a candidate's public appeal and the ability of his
organization to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
Though no straw poll winner ever has won the Republican
nomination for the presidency, the contest could reshape the
Republican presidential field ahead of the first real votes for
nomination, the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
Besides Bush and Forbes, the contenders are Tennessee Governor
Lamar Alexander, President of Family Research Council Gary Bauer,
former President of American Red Cross Elizabeth Dole, radio talk
show host Alan Keyes, Senator Orrin Hatch, former vice president
Dan Quayle, TV commentator Pat Puchanan.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John McCain has called the straw poll a "
scam and a "sham" and boycotted it.

<HEADLINE> More People Keep Money at Private Banks in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- More and more people in Myanmar
are keeping money at the Asia Wealth Bank (AWB), one of the
leading private banks in the country, bringing about cash deposits
at the bank amounting to 58 billion Kyats (193.3 million U.S.
dollars) by mid-July, the New Light of Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bank had also given out loans totaling 26 billion Kyats
(86.6 million dollars) by that time, it said.
</P>
<P>
The deposits at the bank were obtained especially through the
introduction of the call deposit system and the safe deposit
locker system since October 1997 after the Asian financial crisis
started to hit Southeast Asia including Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The call deposit system is reported to have drawn over 2
billion Kyats (6.6 million dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The AWB, with a total number of 28 branches across the country,
was first established with a capital of 60 million Kyats (200,000
dollars) and 84 staff members.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 private banks in Myanmar with the AWB, the Yoma
and the Myanmar Mayflower Bank leading in domestic commercial
banking services. The latter two respectively have 28 and 11
branches in the country.
</P>
<P>
The private banks in Myanmar hold about 45 percent of savings
deposits of the banking sector, while their loans account for
about 48 percent of the sector's loans to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
There are three state-owned banks in the country, including the
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar started adopting the market-oriented economic policy in
late 1988 and reformed its banking system in 1990, allowing
private banks to operate again after they were nationalized in
1963.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rises By 0.4 Percent in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate went up
0.4 percent to 1.62 percent for the week that ended on July 31,
mainly due to rises in prices of food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, India's annual
inflation rate based on Wholesale Price Index recorded a
two-decade low of 1.19 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation this year is mainly on account of a
higher base last year when prices of food articles, especially
vegetables rose substantially.

<HEADLINE> China's Building Materials Industry Invites Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China will offer 69 projects of
building materials sector, involving 15.78 billion US dollars, for
overseas investors in a coming national fair, the China Daily
Business Weekly reports on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jinfeng, director of the Foreign Affairs Department of
the State Administration of Building Materials Industry, told the
weekly that the administration will provide an overview of China's
building materials industry, development trends, technical and
economic policies during the September 8-12 Third China Fair for
International Investment and Trade in Xiamen City, coastal Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
The administration will continue to create a more favorable
investment climate for overseas investors, and help them solve
practical problems, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
China has accepted more than five billion US dollars of
overseas funds in the building materials sector so far.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China's building materials market is still
large as a result of the accelerated pace of construction of
infrastructure facilities and housing projects.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investments are welcome in the construction of large
cement projects, technological improvements in small cement plants,
and in quality improvements of sanitary ceramics production.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republican Party Holds Straw Poll in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican contenders
for the 2000 presidency competed with each other Saturday in the
Iowa straw poll, the first test on the road to the White House.
</P>
<P>
George W. Bush, son of former President George Bush and State
Governor of Texas, was the heavy favorite to win the informal poll
when votes were counted at 0200 GMT on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to win," said Bush, who sought to solidify his front-
runner status through the informal poll.
</P>
<P>
Republican Party officials estimated that 24,000 people were
present at the campus of Iowa State University to vote, twice as
many as expected.
</P>
<P>
Many participants traveled aboard air-conditioned buses by
courtesy of the candidates, who also lured them with free food and
entertainment, and picked up the tab for the 25-dollar-tickets
needed for the vote.
</P>
<P>
Bush aides said they had purchased nearly 11,000 ballots and
distributed most of them to supporters.
</P>
<P>
Bush has budgeted 750,000 dollars for the contest while Steve
Forbes, a publishing giant and multimillionaire, reportedly spent
two million dollars on the event.
</P>
<P>
The straw poll is a fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican party,
as well as a political circus. Advocates say it helps provide an
assessment of a candidate's public appeal and the ability of his
organization to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
Though no straw poll winner ever has won the Republican
nomination for the presidency, the contest could reshape the
Republican presidential field ahead of the first real votes for
nomination, the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
Besides Bush and Forbes, other contenders included Tennessee
Governor Lamar Alexander, President of Family Research Council
Gary Bauer, former President of American Red Cross Elizabeth Dole,
radio talk show host Alan Keyes, Senator Orrin Hatch, former vice
president Dan Quayle, TV commentator Pat Puchanan.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John McCain has called the straw poll a "
scam" and a "sham" and boycotted it.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: All-round Development of Sino-Malaysian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad left here Sunday for a working visit to China
from August 18 to 20 via Khabarovsk, Russia, in conjunction with
the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's visit to China at the invitation of his Chinese
counterpart Zhu Rongji is expected not only to further enhance
diplomatic relations but also produce more joint-venture projects,
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is scheduled to call on President Jiang Zemin and hold
an official meeting with Zhu to discuss bilateral issues
especially trade and investment. He is also scheduled to deliver
an address entitled "Malaysia-China Relations: Challenges and
Opportunities in the 21st Century" at the third Malaysia-China
Forum in Beijing on August 19.
</P>
<P>
The friendly relations between China and Malaysia have deepened
since the establishment of diplomatic relations. In recent years
in particular, contacts and cooperation between the two countries
have expanded at various levels, through different channels and in
all fields -- political, economic, cultural, educational, defense
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations have grown from strength to strength as
the top leaders of the two countries have shown their political
will and pledged to forge mutually beneficial cooperation based on
the principles of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs and peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of both sides have maintained close and frequent
contacts and exchanged visits which have brought about an
environment of harmony and amity and served to cement bonds of
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's current visit is his fifth to China in his capacity
as the Malaysian prime minister. His first visit to China was in
November 1985, the second in June 1993, the third in May 1994 and
the fourth in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the same token, top Chinese leaders who visited Malaysia
include Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1994 who also came to
attend the APEC leaders' informal meeting in Kuala Lumpur in 1997
and the East Asian leaders' informal consultation in 1998, Zhu
Rongji (then vice premier) in 1996, Li Peng (then premier) in 1990
and Yang Shangkun (former president) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Economically, trade and investment between the two countries
have been on an upswing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, total trade between China and
Malaysia last year stood at 4.264 billion U.S. dollars, a 20-fold
increase over that in the early years of the establishment of
bilateral diplomatic relations. During the first half of this
year, total trade between the two countries reached 2.2958 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
For mutual investment, more than 140 Malaysian companies
including over 60 listed companies are registered in China, who
formed more than 140 joint ventures valued at more than 332
million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Almost a similar number of Chinese companies formed joint
ventures in Malaysia. In addition, China is actively studying the
possibility of entering joint ventures in Malaysia to undertake
railway and power station projects and hi-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture with investment worth more than 1 billion U.S.
dollars in pulp and paper production in Malaysia is at the final
stage of negotiation. The joint venture is expected to be
discussed during Mahathir's visit.
</P>
<P>
The fruitful economic cooperation between China and Malaysia is
guided by a number of agreements signed including the Agreement on
Avoidance of Double Taxation (1985), the Shipping Agreement
(1988), the Trade Agreement (1988), the Investment Protection
Agreement (1988), the Air Services Agreement (1988), the
Memorandum of Understanding on Information Cooperation (1992) and
the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology (1992).
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation in other fields such as culture,
education and sports has also developed steadily. The two
countries signed the Sports Agreement in 1993 and the Memorandum
of Understanding on Education Cooperation in 1997. More and more
Chinese students are coming to Malaysia for studies.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the people-to-people contacts keep the momentum of
increasing. According to Malaysian officials, in 1998, the number
of tourists from China increased to 275,150 from 232,957 in 1997
and during the first quarter of 1999, Chinese tourists increased
89.4 percent compared with the same period last year. And a larger
number of Malaysians are visiting China every year.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid told a local Chinese-language newspaper in a recent
interview that the Malaysian-Chinese relations are entering an era
of all-round development.
</P>
<P>
To bring Sino-Malaysian relations to new heights, the two
countries signed in Beijing in May this year the Joint Statement
on the Framework for Future Bilateral Cooperation, setting the
direction of development of the bilateral relations in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's fifth visit to China will surely further contribute
to cementing the bilateral ties between China and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> World Coffee Price to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's coffee producers
are expected to face a price crisis in the upcoming years,
business sources were quoted as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This will be a result of supply outrunning demand, said Carlos
Alfaro Ruiz, vice president of Costa Rican Coffee Exporters
Chamber (CEC).
</P>
<P>
Alfaro said that the origin of this crisis could be traced back
to the cold spell occurring in Brazil in 1994, which forced the
world's biggest coffee producer to renew all its planting.
</P>
<P>
He said Brazil is expected to have the biggest coffee output in
history, probably 40 million 60-kilo bags, if no disrupting
natural factors occur.
</P>
<P>
A good harvest of coffee is also in sight for Costa Rica in the
present 1999-2000 season, of some 3.6 million bags, or a 10
percent to 12 percent increase over the previous harvest.
</P>
<P>
As a result, coffee supply will surpass world demand by 10
million bags, which may led to a fall in the price. The demand on
world market is estimated at 100 million bags.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Costa Rican coffee exports had diminished to
only 193 million U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, down
by 31.5 percent from the same period of 1998. The reduction was
attributed to a drop in the coffee price on world market, which
had varied between 92 and 97 dollars per quintal (46 kilos).

<HEADLINE> U.N. Confirms Forced Displacement in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
confirmed that the ruling Taliban militia are forcing tens of
thousands of people to displace from the Shamali valley near the
front lines north of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here late Saturday, the U.N. said
over 1,870 displaced families, or some 10,000 people, have entered
Kabul within a period of less than 36 hours on August 13-14,
adding that a major influx is anticipated within the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has obtained first-hand accounts from the new arrivals
representing all ethnic groups which verify that Taliban fighters
forced people out of their houses and told them to walk to the
Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
They also confirmed earlier reports that the Taliban are
intentionally setting homes on fire, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Some people said whole villages were burned to the ground and
crops set on fire to deter them from moving back to the
once-fertile valley.
</P>
<P>
Taliban authorities have continued to deny any "scorched earth"
policy in the area as reported.
</P>
<P>
International agencies in Kabul are monitoring the arrival of
growing numbers of the displaced people from the Shamali valley,
drawing up lists of the displaced, and providing new arrivals with
water and high protein biscuits.
</P>
<P>
Some of the displaced have made the 40-km journey on foot,
while others have been conveyed in trucks commandeered by Taliban
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Many of the new arrivals are not only dehydrated from their
journey but also are completely destitute and have only what they
were able to carry from their homes, according the U.N. press
release.
</P>
<P>
"Forced displacement and intentional destruction of civilian
houses are clear violations of international humanitarian law,"
said the press release.
</P>
<P>
It is also against the stated policy of the Taliban, whose
leader Mullah Omar earlier condemned such acts and called on
Taliban troops to respect the lives and property of civilians, the
press release noted.
</P>
<P>
International aid workers also reported another sizable
movement of civilians north of the front lines into the Panjsher
valley, the stronghold of the opposition forces led by former
defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is concerned for their immediate welfare,
given the terrain and limits on access to the valley, said the
press release.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Bids Farewell to Slain Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands
of Bogota residents gathered on Saturday afternoon in the center
of the capital to hold a funeral ceremony for the slain journalist
Jaime Garzon.
</P>
<P>
The crowd, coming from all directions of the city and carrying
posters and white papers reading "No More Violence", gathered in
the Plaza of Bolivar, where also stood the Capitol of the Republic,
to bid farewell to Garzon, also a satirist and peace fighter.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Hector Gutierrez who was a teacher of the assassinated
reporter, said at the massive funeral that "Jaime has fought for a
better and different Colombia. We, who still are alive, must
continue striving for peace in Colombia."
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept the continuation of the violence in
Colombia," Jaime's sister Marison Garson said. "With the efforts
of all Colombians, starting with the political leaders, we will
turn the page in the 21st century, which will be a century of
peace."
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old journalist, also a comic and political activist,
was shot dead at 05:45 local time on Friday by two gunmen when he
was driving his jeep to his work.
</P>
<P>
Garzon's killing was Colombia's most striking assassination
since 1995 when gunmen, allegedly former members of the army's
secret service, killed Conservative Party leader Alvaro Gomez.
</P>
<P>
Garzon was the latest victim of Colombia's three-decade-long
civil conflict that has claimed more than 35,000 lives in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The crowd of mourners chanted slogans demanding an end to 35
years of violence in which both right-wing paramilitary militias
and leftist rebels regularly target civilians they accused of
collaborating with their enemies.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Ecuador Satisfied With Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian Foreign Ministry
Saturday published a joint communique, signed by visiting
Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad and his Peruvian counterpart
Alberto Fujimori, which expressed satisfaction over their
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the two presidents recognized the important
progress in the implementation of the Brasilia Accord, which was
singed in October of 1998. The accord went into effect on May 13,
1999 and ended a long-standing border dispute between the two
countries that erupted into wars in 1941, 1985 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the treaty has helped consolidate a new
neighborhood based on peace, friendship, cooperation, and
bilateral integration.
</P>
<P>
They also spoke highly of the Peruvian-Ecuadoran Neighborhood
Commission presided over by the foreign ministers, saying it
functions as a political mechanism to promote, support, and
coordinate the programs, projects and activities that require
close cooperation between Peru and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
They hailed the cooperation between the two countries in
identifying the exact location of the Centers of Commerce and
Navigation in the Saramiriza and Pijuayal localities.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori and Mahuad, who was on a state visit to Peru on August
11-13, announced that their countries will contribute five million
U.S. dollars each to the Binational Fund for Peace and Development,
praising the progress in the improvement of the diverse projects
that form the Binational Plan for the Development of the Border
Region.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador have signed the Document of Execution of the
Acceleration and Deepening Agreement on Free Trade, the communique
said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad left here Sunday for his fifth visit to China,
via Russia's Khabarovsk.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's visit, at the invitation of Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji, is in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit starting from August 18, Mahathir is
scheduled to call on President Jiang Zemin and hold an official
meeting with Premier Zhu to discuss bilateral issues especially on
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is expected to state Malaysia's stand on the "One
China" policy besides exchanging views with Zhu on the economic
crisis faced by the region, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said
earlier when announcing Mahathir's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will also deliver an address at the Malaysia-China
Forum organized by the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute
and host a dinner to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid believed that the visit would further enhance
diplomatic relations and also result in more joint-venture
projects between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the joint ventures to be discussed is the setting up of
the Proton (Malaysia's national car manufacturer) plant in one of
the provinces in China, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
China on the other hand is keen to set up a pulp and paper
factory in Sabah, East Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival in Beijing on August 18, Mahathir will stay
in Khabarovsk for three days. After his visit to China, he will
then visit Buryatia, Russia from August 20 to 22.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombia has closed
its common border with Ecuador on allegation of a plague of
bananas, local press reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The closing of the border, which began on Wednesday, has
interrupted bilateral trade across the Rumichaca International
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Agriculture and Livestock Institute (ICA) has
restricted the entry into the country of mangoes, bananas, guavas,
avocados, peaches, apples, grapes, plums, oranges, lemons, papayas
and other fruits from Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
An Ecuadorian Foreign Trade Ministry official was quoted by
press reports as saying on Saturday that Colombia's attitude had
much worried his country since it went against the economic
integration process.
</P>
<P>
Colombia is Ecuador's second biggest trade partner after the
United States. The annual Colombian-Ecuadoran trade volume amounts
to 1 billion U.S. dollars, with a surplus enjoyed by Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The common border of the two countries had previously been the
focus of Colombia's fight against Ecuadorian rice and spirits

the Sacramento Monarchs, Nikkis McCray of the Washington Mystics,
Dawn Staley of the Charlotte Sting and Katie Smith of the
Minnesota Lynx as its five core members.

<P>
Today, USA Basketball named Cooper of the Houston Comets,
forwards Holdsclaw of Washington, Yolanda Griffith of Sacramento
and Natalie Williams of the Utah Starzz and center Delisha Milton
of the Sparks.
</P>

are phenomenal," said USA Women's coach Nell Fortner. "If you look
at this team as a whole, it's pretty exciting to think about the
possibilities of what they can accomplish."
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 10 players have competed on at least one gold medal
winning Olympic or World Championship squad. Cooper earned a gold
medal in 1988 and a bronze in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Rejects U.S. Intervention in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
rejected Saturday a possible U.S. military intervention in
Colombia, warning that it would start "a little Vietnam" in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"This (the U.S. intervention) is no good for us or for
Venezuela or Colombia, nor for our peoples, nor for integration,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Chavez told the press during a softball match between armed
forces teams that he will seek a meeting with his Colombian
counterpart Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
He said he insists on mediating a peace between the Colombian
government and the guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president said he expressed last Tuesday to
United States Political Affairs Undersecretary, Thomas Pickering,
his refusal to see the Colombian problem with "military lens,"
because it would create "a little Vietnam" near Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The United States government has denied that it will send
military forces to combat the guerrillas and drug traffickers in
Colombia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Two goals from Dwight Yorke took
Manchester United to a 2-0 home victory over Leeds United at the
English Premier League on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the treble winner club of last season climbed to
the top of the league.
</P>
<P>
While on the soil of Anfield at West England, newly promoted
Watford won 1-0 at big-spending Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Yorke struck with headers in the 76th and 80th minutes to
settle the game but United's celebrations were slightly muted by
the news that captain Roy Keane has refused to sign a new contract
and will consider his future at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Watford, hot favourites for relegation, had never so much as
drawn at Anfield but took all three points with a 14th minute goal
by Tommy Mooney.
</P>
<P>
Leicester's Frank Sinclair scored a last minute own goal for
the second successive week to give Chelsea a 2-2 draw just a
minute after a Muzzy Izzet's penalty had put Leicester ahead.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal were unable to break through Sunderland's defence at
the Stadium of Light and had to settle for a goalless draw while
Tottenham Hotspur twice came from behind to beat Everton 3-2.

<HEADLINE> Sixers Acquire Owens from Magic for Grant, Parker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philadelphia 76ers
acquired much-traveled forward Billy Owens from the Orlando Magic,
who continue to wheel and deal.
</P>
<P>
The 76ers signed free agent forward Harvey Grant and packaged
him with little-used guard Anthony Parker to land Owens, who has
been traded twice in just over a month. On June 30, he was dealt
from the Seattle SuperSonics to Orlando in a five-player swap.
</P>
<P>
In an injury-plagued campaign, Owens averaged career lows of 7.
8 points and 3.8 rebounds in 21 games for the SuperSonics last
season. He was sidelined early in the campaign by a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
Owens has averaged 13 points and seven rebounds per game in his
eight-year career. He joins his seventh team and always has
displayed uncommon skills for a big player.
</P>
<P>
The Magic continue to stockpile players in the final year of
their contracts. They have traded four starters from last season's
playoff squad and have 14 players under contract, most of whom
become free agents after the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
Grant aeraged 3.1 points and 2.3 rebounds in 47 games last
season. He is the twin brother of forward Horace Grant, who spent
five seasons with the Magic before being dealt to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the 76ers re-signed free agent guard Eric
Snow and forward George Lynch to multi-year contracts. They return
the nucleus of a team that made the playoffs for the first time in
eight years and upset Orlando in the first round.

HAVANA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro said
on Saturday that his counry will bid to host the 2008 or the 2012
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Castro spent his 73rd birthday with the Cuban athletes that
took part in the recent 13th Panamerican Games in Winnipeg, Canada,
where they obtained second place after the United States in the
medals table.
</P>
<P>
The president gave a Cuban flag to the team that will take part
in the Boxing World Championship to be held August 20 in Houston,
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The battle starts now, although it does not mean that justice
will be done in 2008, but will in the 2012, and I do not think it
will go beyond 2016 if we fight appropriately," said Castro in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
Fidel Castro explained that the Cuban sports authorities have
not started yet the formal procedures for the bid of the 2008
Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Keane to Decide his Future at End of Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Irish midfielder Roy Keane has
told Manchester United he is prepared to wait until next summer
before deciding whether to sign a new contract.
</P>
<P>
His announcement means he could leave United in the close
season, with the club receiving no transfer fee.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after United beat Leeds 2-0 in the
Premiership in a noon kick-off on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"At the present time I am undecided as to my future after June
of next year," said Keane in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few months I will give proper and due
consideration to the club's most recent proposal and I shall make
a decision concerning my future at the end of this season."
</P>
<P>
Keane could then leave the club for free under the Bosman
ruling, which outlawed tranfer fees for out-of-contract players
from the European Union moving within the area.
</P>
<P>
From January 1 next year he will be free to negotiate a
contract with other clubs.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has already been used by a number of players,
including former Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman who left for
Real Madrid in similar fashion this summer.
</P>
<P>
United themselves benefitted by snapping up goalkeeeper Mark
Bosnich for free from Aston Villa this summer.
</P>
<P>
The problem for clubs is that they cannot recoup any fee by
selling a player immediately if he insists on seeing out his
existing contract.
</P>
<P>
"The new season commenced only a few days ago," added Keane.
</P>
<P>
"It is my earnest wish to be allowed to continue as captain,
free from the burden of continuous media and other speculation as
to my future and to help this great club to what I hope will be
further honours this season."
</P>
<P>
The club are disappointed after "continual and substantial
efforts" to get their skipper to sign the new deal.
</P>
<P>
"We are very hopeful that he will remain a United player for
the rest of his career and that everyone associated with the club,
" said a statement.
</P>
<P>
Keane said he was upset by the criticism aimed at the board and
chairman Martin Edwards because of the contract stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"I have a very good relationship with the supporters, my
manager and the board of directors," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
"I find it both distressing and embarrassing that any criticism
whatsoever should be directed at the board and management of the
club as a consequence of the recent negotiation."
</P>
<P>
Keane says he has not asked for a new deal, or extra money.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to media statements, I have not sought a new contract
from the club nor have I made any financial or other demands of
the club," he said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Edwards believed that although the club's initial
offer to the midfielder had been refused, their second offer was "
acceptable to him in monetary terms."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the sticking point in Keane's mind was
whether he wanted a fresh challenge in his career.
</P>
<P>
It was now the club's duty to persuade him that United could
offer him just what he was looking for.
</P>
<P>
Manager Sir Alex Ferguson was confident that Keane could be
persuaded into staying.
</P>
<P>
"This gives me, the club and the fans the opportunity to show
him how much we need him," he said.

injury-time win at Highbury on the opening day of the season.
</P>
<P>
And he became the unwanted headline-maker for the second week
running as he headed past Leicester keeper Tim Flowers just 60
seconds after Muzzy Izzet had put the home side ahead from the
penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
It enabled Chelsea to escape with a 2-2 draw although in truth
the quality of their performance meant they deserved a share of
the spoils.
</P>
<P>
Vialli, who sold Sinclair to Leicester 12 months ago, said: "I
was naturally not too displeased when Frank decided to score an
own goal!
</P>
<P>
"But I do have sympathy for that happening to him, especially
two weeks running. But I'm sure he won't despair and will be
strong enough to cope with that."
</P>
<P>
Vialli admitted: "When Leicester scored the penalty I did not
hold out too much hope but in football anything is possible and we
showed tremendous spirit to earn a point.
</P>
<P>
"We did not start the game well but after the first 20 minutes,
we were in total control until the last 15 minutes and had the
chances. Leicester took advantage of a couple of mistakes."

<HEADLINE> Five Patients Found in Albania Due to Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Five people have been found with
eye problems in Albania after observing the solar eclipse, the
Albanian Telegraphic Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The patients, aged 18-25, are residents in Albania's southern
city of Elbasan. Doctors said that they watched the eclipse
without defensive means.
</P>
<P>
One of the patients has serious problems with the eye retina
and is likely to lose sight.
</P>
<P>
The results of the other four, who were receiving medical
treatment at local clinics, are unknown.
</P>
<P>
A partial solar eclipse was seen in Albania last Wednesday.
Many Albanians, frightened by the phenomenon, confined themselves
to the house to watch it, or chose to watch through television due
to lack of defensive means, like sun glasses.

<HEADLINE> Afro-China Council Supports One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Council for Afro-China
Affairs, a Nigeria-based African non-governmental organization
expressed here Saturday its full support of one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
"The council fully supports the just struggle of the Chinese
people to re-unite their motherland under the internationally
recognized government in Beijing", said chairman of the
organization Essien at a party in the Abuja Office of the Chinese
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore urge the Taiwan authorities to respond positively
to the constructive proposal of the central government for a
peaceful re-unification of China, and restrain from utterances and
activities that undermine the unification," he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa, which suffered from the arbitrarily carving out by
foreign powers, knows very well the scars of such partitioning as
left-over from history, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is the council's view that China will never have a "state to
state" relation with Taiwan, whether it is special or not, and
therefore, it urged the Taiwan authorities to face squarely the
historically-determined route of national reunification, he said.
