<HEADLINE> NATO Uses Banned Weapons in Anti-Yugoslav War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO has used banned weapons
such as cluster bombs and depleted uranium in its anti-Yugoslav
war, according to a U.N. Security Council document.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of their use are incomparably more inhumane
and dangerous than conventional arms, said the Permanent Mission
of Yugoslavia to the United Nations in a letter to the council
president, which is embodied in the document released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has dropped over
60 containers of cluster bombs totaling 15,000 bombs, in addition
to a batch of 400 cluster bombs over the territory of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia since March 25, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The cluster bombs killed some 200 people and wounded over 450
only in Kosovo and Metohija and new human casualties can be
expected from the remaining unexploded bombs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Housing estates, schools, hospitals, industrial plants and
communications infrastructure have been destroyed as a result of
the bombings, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Mission said the effects of using depleted uranium
against troops and the civilian population are fatal and highly
inhumane as it causes wounds followed by contamination which makes
the use of this ammunition a crime against humanity and
international law.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Cost of Living Jumps in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation jumped in
April to 1.7 percent from 1.0 percent in March, the largest annual
increase since October 1997, Statistic Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Roughly one third of the increase was due to higher costs for
transportation, reflecting higher prices for gasoline, new cars
and trucks, and air fares.
</P>
<P>
The price index for gasoline rose 5.9% since April 1998. The
increase can be explained by a higher demand for gasoline, a
tightening of North American supply and the recent agreement by
OPEC countries to lower production of crude oil, said the federal
agency.
</P>
<P>
The increase represented the first year-over-year advance in
the price of gasoline since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fuel oil prices were up 6.8 percent last month, also due to
higher world prices for fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
Higher home costs, especially the price of natural gas and
property taxes, also contributed to the rise in April costs, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's report, the inflation rate had been fluctuating
between 0.6 percent and one percent since November 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Peace Force for Kosovo, Call-up of Reservists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on Friday
it needs a rapid build-up of the NATO force in Macedonia which
would be deployed in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to need a larger KFOR (Kosovo Peace Implementation
Force) and we want it deployed to Macedonia as soon as possible,"
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said this followed increasing hope for a peace settlement
after two months of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bacon announced calling up reservists 1,022 air men
and women from the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units
in Illinois, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, plus 26 KC-135
Stratotanker aircraft to join the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The new call-up will bring the total number of Reservists up to
close to 5,500. These are the numbers that have been activated
under the 33,000-person ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had said earlier that NATO was considering a KFOR
of 45,000 to 50,000 troops compared with a figure of 28,000
previously agreed.
</P>
<P>
It said the new figure would probably include some 7,000 U.S.
troops. There was no target date for the force to be fully
constituted, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has some 13,000 troops already in Macedonia as the core of
a KFOR, which would be sent into Kosovo should a peace agreement
is secured in the region.
</P>
<P>
Splits have emerged in the alliance in recent days over the
possible use of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
Britain strongly advocating a build-up both to put pressure on
Milosevic and to prepare for a peace agreement while Italy and
Germany are strongly opposed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vietnam War Veteran Strives for Peace in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ron Kovic, a Vietnam War
veteran, called Thursday for an immediate cessation of the NATO
bombing on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Kovic, who was paralyzed during the Vietnam war and has been in
wheelchair for 30 years, said the United States has become one of
the most dangerous roadblocks to the peace of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that our country has taken us to a dangerous and
reckless path," he said. "We are deeply concerned."
</P>
<P>
Kovic Wednesday traveled 3000 miles from Los Angeles to the
Chinese embassy in the United States to express his condolences
for the three journalists killed on NATO's attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Kovic said the U.S. government must make a "sincere and formal"
apology to China for the missile attack on the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
"The President must not just shrug his shoulder and say we are
sorry," he said, "there must be a change of this awful and
terrible behavior, there must be a true apology."
</P>
<P>
"They must learn to say sorry and truly change their hearts,"
said Kovic, who was alos an artist and author of the non-fiction
"Born on the Fourth of July", which was made into a famous motion
picture in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Kovic, who said he spoke for millions of peace-minded
Americans, stressed that he would do everything possible to stop
the "terrible" bombing on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I am an American citizen, but I am also a citizen of the
world," he said,"to be a good American in 1999 means to honor and
respect people from other places and other cultures, and to build
bridges of friendship rather than continue a policy of
aggression."
</P>
<P>
"I hope someday the voices of peace can be louder than all the
bombings by NATO," said the war veteran turned peace-maker.
</P>
<P>
Kovic said he was strongly opposed to the U.S. policy which
were on many occasions "unconscionable and immoral", whether it
was relating to Vietnam, Iraq or Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The war veteran said he was arrested several times simply
because of trying to speak against his government's policy,
which was "deeply immoral and in many cases barbaric".
</P>
<P>
"This terrible policy will only cause tension in the world,"
he said, "we must move away from war."
</P>
<P>
"I deeply wish for peace, and our destiny is to live in peace
and become brothers and sisters." he added.
</P>
<P>
Kovic said he would like to visit Belgrade as a peace-maker to
show that Americans want the bombing to never happen again.
</P>
<P>
Though this is not an easy journey for a person in wheelchair,
he said he was not afraid to go for the sake of peace.
</P>
<P>
"I have been to the wars, this is not a place I want to return
to, but for peace I want, for a peaceful world in the next century
I would take risks."
</P>
<P>
"A journey of one thousand miles begins with the first step",
he said, citing an old Chinese saying.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to be a peace maker and work together
with more than one billion Chinese people for world peace.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Determine Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been urged to
 undertake action leading to debt cancellation and determine their
 own development path.
</P>
<P>
The three-day regional conference of "Toward an African
Consensus on Sustainable Solutions to the Debt Problem" concluded
here Friday by adopting the Lusaka Declaration.
</P>
<P>
"Our conference is part of a process of movement-building
within and beyond Africa: a movement against the crippling impact
of debt on billions of people across the world, and for a new,
people-centered genuine form of development," the declaration
said.
</P>
<P>
African countries reiterated the call for total debt
cancellation, and insist that creditors and G7 countries cannot be
allowed to dictate the terms of cancellation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative put forward
by the International Monetary Fund and other debt relief
proposals, including the recent proposals from G7 countries,
notably from the United States, Britain and Germany, all insist on
unacceptable conditions, and entail inadequate amounts of relief,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it added, the so-called debt relief initiatives have
not resulted from inclusive negotiations. The Paris Club and the
HIPC initiative are merely processes and frameworks imposed by
creditors on debtors.
</P>
<P>
"We reject HIPC and the other current debt relief processes and
commit ourselves to expose their fundamental flaws in each of the
countries, particularly in the run-up to the June G8 Meeting in
Cologne, Germany," the declaration said, adding "as members of
African civil society, we believe we have the standing to speak
truth to power, in the presence of overwhelming Northern financial
arrogance".
</P>
<P>
In short, debt is one of the most important instruments of the
North domination over the South, and the domination of financiers
over people, production and nature everywhere, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"As part of our struggle to liberate ourselves from this
bondage, we make demands for the cancellation of debt as part of a
broader struggle to fundamentally transform the current world
economic order and transfer power from the political leadership of
the rich countries, " said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we commit ourselves to working against localized
symptoms of our debt burden and economic process, including war,
corruption and other evils that undermine our development
process," it said.
</P>
<P>
The organizer of the conference, an anti-debt campaign, the
Jubilee 2000 Group, which is part of the world-wide movement
lobbying the donor countries and the international financial
institutions to cancel the debt of poor countries by the year
2000, said it wants to collect about 22 million signatures at next
month's meeting of G7/8, and press the leaders to consider
canceling the debt of the Third World countries.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Extends Iraq Oil-For-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Friday adopted a resolution under which the U.N.
oil-for-food program in Iraq will remain for another six months.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution unanimously adopted, Iraq is allowed to
sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in this period.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Security Council requested the U.N.
Secretary-General to report to it if Iraq is unable to export
petroleum and petroleum products sufficient to the total sum and
make recommendations for the expenditure of the sum expected to be
available.
</P>
<P>
Iraq complained to the United Nations early this week that the
oil-for-food program was useless and the only way to alleviate
the suffering of the Iraqi people was lifting the sanctions
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began in
December 1996, is designed to offset the impact of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of oil-for-food program will expire next
Monday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Fighting Continues Amid Impending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting continued Thursday in
Sierra Leone before a hardly-earned truce could take effect next
Monday, the country's state radio confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The west Africa peacekeeping force or ECOMOG had come under
severe attack by rebel forces in the country's eastern town of
Kenema, an important diamond-producing area, and Port Loko just
north of Freetown, the country's capital, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were repulsed by ECOMOG force after incurring heavy
looses, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Kabbah supported by the
Nigeria-led ECOMOG forces signed a ceasefire accord Tuesday in the
Togolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire is to last while envoys from both sides could
start direct negotiations in Lome for a comprehensive peace accord
ending the country's eight-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the rebels have been stepping up
their efforts of controlling more lands especially in the diamond
mining area to gain more weight in the U.N.-sponsored negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had earlier flew President Kabbah and rebel
leaders to Lome to kick start the much-desired peace talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy Jesse Jackson also
reportedly flew to Lome with Kabbah to join the talks.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Foday Sankoh and his guerrilla leadership had
earlier held internal talks on their uniformed stands in Lome over
the past three weeks.

<HEADLINE> GM Food Safe to Eat, Says UK Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government spelled out
its position on genetically-modified (GM) food Friday, saying that
GM food on sale in the UK is safe to eat and its development would
be closely watched.
</P>
<P>
There was "no current evidence to suggest that the GM
technologies used to produce food are inherently harmful",
Britain's Cabinet Office Minister Jack Cunningham told the House
of Commons.
</P>
<P>
GM technology could lead to more nutritious and tasty food and
many other benefits, he said, admitting that the risks had to be
"rigorously assessed".
</P>
<P>
In a move to end the continuing row about the safety of GM
products, Cunningham declared that the British government is
setting up two new advisory bodies to examine developments in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The Human Genetics Commission will assess the impact of GM
products on healthcare and another body, called Agricultural and
Environment Biotechnology Commission, will look at the effects of
GM products on agriculture and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Announcing tough voluntary rules on planting GM crops,
Cunningham said that there may have to be legislation on the
subject in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Unrestricted commercial cultivation of GM crops will not
proceed until we are satisfied that they cause no harm to the
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham also announced the publication of several reports
including one from the government's top medical and scientific
advisors, which recommended a national surveillance unit to
monitor any risk to health from GM food.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lashes out at NATO Attack on Belgrade Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia Friday protested
against the NATO bombing of a Belgrade hospital, saying that this
act will undermine the ongoing effort to seek a political
settlement to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, told reporters, "We protest against this action and we
state that this so-called mistake occurring daily."
</P>
<P>
"The only way to stop this tragedy is to stop the bombing and
to start concentrating on the efforts to achieve a political
settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Paradoxically, just as we try to achieve a political
settlement, the bombing intensifies. I hope this is not a
deliberate attempt (to) undermine the political settlement
efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But objectively, what is going on in the sky of Yugoslavia not
only doesn't help the efforts to achieve a political settlement,
but make those efforts much more difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador echoed the position of the the Russian
Foreign Ministry, which "reiterates its strong disapproval of the
criminal actions" of NATO raids on Belgrade Hospital Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The attack killed 4 people and wounded 15 others, including two
women who were delivering, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov voiced his protest against the NATO strikes before the
U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet on Kosovo at 3:00 p.m.
EST.
</P>
<P>
Russia is stepping up its efforts as a mediator to seek a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis, which broke out in

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to the
United Nations, Sergey Lavrov, said on Friday that the
humanitarian scheme alone could not solve the humanitarian crisis
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov made the statement to the press before the United
Nations Security Council is going to vote on the extension of U.N.
oil-for-food program in Iraq this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said the adoption of a U.N. resolution on the extension
of the program was a step which maybe unavoidable in order not
to interrupt the humanitarian scheme in Iraq, but it was not
enough to solve the humanitarian crisis facing the country, Lovrov
said.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian crisis could not be solved by the
humanitarian scheme alone and there must be efforts to revitalize
the social and economic infrastructure in Iraq, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador reiterated once again the urgent need of arrival
of a radical settlement of the current deadlock involving
introducing of a new monitoring and disarmament mechanism in
conjunction with relieving the burden of the economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Unless these efforts were made, the humanitarian crisis in Iraq
could not be alleviated, Lavrov added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to decide the continuation of
the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq for another six months
under which Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth
of oil to buy necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq complained to the United Nations early this week that the
only way to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people is lifting all

WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain on

Organization (NATO) members on the touchy issue of ground force
deployment in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the British ambassador's residence,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said there is "no crack in

U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on the American

Italy and Greece are lobbying for a pause in NATO's bombardment
of Yugoslavia, while Germany is threatening to veto any ground

Britain, on the other hand, has urged the allies to consider a

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Denies Assisting Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba has said
it would be stupid for Zambia to frustrate efforts to end the
civil war in Angola after having worked for years seeking a
peaceful solution to the conflict in that country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said this at the State House Friday while meeting with
the Canadian Permanent Representative at the United Nations and
Chairman of U.N. 's Sanctions Committee on National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) Robert Fowler.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia had never engaged in assisting anybody to
destabilize Angola because it had no resources to throw away
carelessly.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that this was the second time the U.N. was
sending a team to verify charges levelled against Zambia by
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The first mission proved that there was no truth in the
allegation that Zambia was assisting UNITA rebels "because we find
it strange and we do not know what triggered the accusations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He further said certain places which are mentioned by the
Angola do not exist or have the capacity for the work they are
supposed to be capable of.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia did not have the capacity and the desire to
destabilize Angola which had for two decades been robbed of
development due to civil war.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba further said Zambia has complied with the U.N. in all
areas that it was instructed to do and had acted in good faith.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fowler said his committee admires Chiluba's efforts
in trying to bring peace to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
He said the current position in the region where there were
civil wars was dangerous and can lead to the destabilization of
the region.
</P>
<P>
Fowler said his team did not come to judge but bring message to
the Zambian government and find out the sanction bursting by the
UNITA and put an end to it.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Special Envoy Named for Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has designated William Eagleton, a U.S. diplomat, as his
Special Representative for Western Sahara, and has informed the
U.N. Security Council accordingly, a U.N. statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council took note of the Secretary-General's
decision today," said the statement, issued by the U.N. spokesman
here.
</P>
<P>
The new Special Representative of the Secretary-General is
expected to assume his functions at the headquarters of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) in
Laayoune by early June.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has also decided to appoint the former
Chairman of the Identification Commission of MINURSO, Robin
Kinloch, as the Deputy Special Representative for Western Sahara,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Eagleton served with the United Nations as Special Coordinator
for the Restoration of Essential Services in Sarajevo from 1994 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
His latest appointment in the national service was that of the
U.S. ambassador to Syria from 1984 to 1988. Eagleton, father of
eight, speaks Arabic, French and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, Charles Dumbar of the United States, has
finished his two-year terms of office on March 31, and he did not
expect to go beyond the end of his tenure simply "for personal
reasons," U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Accepting Dumbar's resignation, Annan in his March 22 report to
the Security Council voiced his thanks to the outgoing special
envoy for "his great efforts in promoting the peace process in
Western Sahara."
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N. peace plan, the transition period is expected
to start in Western Sahara in June or July, and the referendum
will take place in December to decide the future of the
territory.

<HEADLINE> Rwandans Angered by U.N.Court Verdict on Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The 25-year jail term sentence for
Rwandan genocide criminal Obed Ruzindana Friday provoked angry
reactions among the survivors in general and those residing in
western Kibuye where he killed thousands of Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
"These people deserved capital punishment, but as you know the
International Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) does not accept such
sentence," the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) quoted Rwandan General
Prosecutor Simeon Rwagasore as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ruzindana was punished like someone who was involved in a
simple robbery case, said the general prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Either his age or his lack of education are not enough reason
to give him such a lighter sentence, another Rwandan official
said.
</P>
<P>
Ruzindana and the former prefect of Kibuye, Clement Kayishema,
were both charged by the ICTR with perpetrating the genocide and
crimes against humanity, inciting to commit genocide in their home
region of Kibuye.
</P>
<P>
They were responsible for the killings of several thousands of
Tutsis at the local church, soccer stadium, and the Bisesero Hills
from April to July in 1994.
</P>
<P>
While Kayishema was sentenced to life imprisonment, the ICTR
gave a 25- year imprisonment to the surprise of many Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
The judges had claimed that his young age, 32 at the time of
genocide, would give him a chance to be reintegrated in the
society.
</P>
<P>
But Rwandan officials said that Ruzindana did not deserve any
clemency as long as he never acknowledged the crimes he had
committed.
</P>
<P>
"We do not understand how the ICTR could hand down different
sentences to both men who teamed up in all the massacres of Tutsis
... They were seen always together at the helm of the killers,''
one woman who lost her husband and all her children declared on
the state-run Radio Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Like this woman, the genocide survivors of Kibuye felt betrayed
by the ICTR which they blamed for not taking into account the
crimes both criminals had committed in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Judicial officials in Kibuye were embarrassed by the
pronouncement of such lenient punishment for a genocide criminal.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Kayishema-Ruzindana lasted for two years and over
80 witnesses were heard by the ICTR.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the U.N. tribunal had handed down sentences to four
Rwandan genocide criminals. Notably, the former Mayor of Taba,
Jean Paul Akayezu, and former interim prime minister, Jean
Kambanda, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Omar Serushago who
was the head of the militia in Gisenyi got 15 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Oil-For-Food Plan Short to Meet Aims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. oil-for-food
program in Iraq could not meet all the humanitarian needs of the
Iraqi people, nor could it restore Iraq's economic and social
infrastructure to pre-1990 levels, a senior U.N. official on
Friday quoted U.N. chief Kofi Annan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the United Nations Security Council on the
humanitarian situation in Iraq this morning, Benon Sevan,
Executive Director of Office of the Iraq Program, said the
program was seriously short of the revenue required to meet its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said over phase IV and V of the program, the oil
revenues had not come close to the ceiling of 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars authorized.
</P>
<P>
In phase V, which expires on May 24, 1999, the final revenue
figure would be 3.8 billion U.S. dollars, still 1.4 billion below
the ceiling, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
For phase IV and V combined, the deficit in terms of spending
on the humanitarian program was more than 2.5 billion dollars,
and well over 3 billion if taking into account of the need to fund
oil industry spare parts and equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the recent upward trend in the price of oil has
not solved the difficulties encountered in meeting the objectives
of the program, Sevan added.

ANKARA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's central-left Democratic
Left Party (DSP) and right-wing Nationalist Movement Party (MHP)
Friday held "positive" talks for the formation of coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks between the DSP and MHP, DSP leader and
prime minister-designate Bulent Ecevit told reporters that he had
proposed a coalition partnership to MHP leader Devlet Bahceli.
</P>
<P>
Bahceli told reporters that he would respond to the DSP
proposal after meeting with his party group on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "I hope that the result of the meeting of the
MHP's group will be good for our country."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a coalition government between the DSP
and the MHP will be formed next week.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that the most realistic formula would be a
coalition between the DSP, the MHP and the central-right
Motherland Party (ANAP).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if he receives a positive response from
Bahceli, he will meet with ANAP leader Mesut

<HEADLINE> Polish MPs Call for Stop of Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Polish parliamentarians signed on
Friday a draft resolution calling for a stop of NATO bombing on
Yugoslavia and a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis through
talks.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, prepared by 119 members of the 460-seat
parliament from the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish
Peasant Party, had been presented to the speaker of the House of
Representatives, the Polish Press Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the NATO air raids on Yugoslavia had not
achieved the expected aim and, on the contrary, caused many tragic
incidents. It warned that "serious and long-standing international
consequences could be possible if situation got out of control."
</P>
<P>
"The Polish Parliament demands that justice be given to the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the (NATO) military action be
halted. We believe that even the hardest problem should be solved
through negotiations," it said.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution said that it was still possible that a
limited bombing could speed up the adoption of a U.N. Security
Council resolution. It also called on the Yugoslav government to
withdraw its forces from Kosovo in a firm and effective manner.

<HEADLINE> Silver Resilient Through a Turbulent 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 21 (Xinhua) - In the face of difficult economic
conditions in 1998, silver showed resilience through the turbulent
year, posting its best price performance in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Silver's strong performance in market was the result of steady
industrial fabrication demand and strong investment interest,
according to World Silver Survey 1999 released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, for the tenth consecutive year, the market continued
to have a structural deficit, causing the continued erosion of
above-ground stocks of silver in bullion and coin from by nearly
105 million ounces, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
After three years of growth, fabrication demand fell by 2.2
percent in 1998 to 840.6 million ounces. The fall in the world
total was primarily the result of a sharp decline in East Asia and
Indian fabrication demand.
</P>
<P>
The Silver Institute said in its survey that total supply of
silver to the market declined by 2 percent last year, despite
gains in three main sources of supply: mine production, scrap and
official sector sales.
</P>
<P>
While silver mine production increased for the fourth
consecutive year, up 5 percent, reaching a new record level of
545.5 million ounces, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Work Improved After Structural, Policy Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Structural and policy changes in the
World Health Organization (WHO) since last July have helped the
organization better perform its role as the world's premier health
agency, said a WHO official here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After assuming office as Director General on July 21, 1998, Dr
Gro Harlem Brundtland introduced a package of structural and
policy reform plans, WHO Executive Director and Senior Policy
Adviser Jonas Store told delegates at a special briefing of the
ongoing 52nd World Health Assembly in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Among the changes are the reduction of 50 existing programs to
35 departments grouped into nine clusters, a cabinet-based
decision making process and a policy of staff mobility and
rotation. The number of director-level posts has also been brought
down from 45 to 37.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Brundtland has initiated three high-profile cabinet
projects (Roll Back Malaria, Tobacco Free Initiative, and
Partnerships for Health Sector Development), introduced an
ambitious policy on gender balance, and decentralized
administrative and management functions.
</P>
<P>
Store said that before the introduction of the changes, WHO was
perceived as a fragmented agency with weak senior management and
vague priority-setting.
</P>
<P>
"Now WHO has regained respect: it is no longer seen as being
isolated, and it is forging new and stronger relationships with
other UN organizations," said Store. "It is also forging links
with regional organizations such as the european Union and the
Organization of African Unity, and multilateral financial
institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund."
</P>
<P>
The 191-member assembly, WHO's governing body, is holding its
annual meeting from May 17 to 25 in Geneva.

August this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here Friday, Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi said the purpose of launching the institute is to
train and provide cadres with higher education for the police
force so as to promote the efficiency of the police and make them
play a better role in the social development.
</P>
<P>
As the first phase, personnel from the interior ministry and
its affiliates will be enrolled, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Then, just as the Higher Institute of the International
Relations, the police institute will be opened to non-police
personnel, he noted. The Institute of the International Relations
used to be operated to train diplomats and now it is also open to
people of other ministries.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the fund for establishing the police
institute would mainly come from the government's budget, but
foreign donations would be most welcome.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi pointed out that with the opening of the new institute,
other police training centers will still be in operation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the teachers the new institute needs will be
Mozambicans while some foreign experts will also be employed for
some special courses which the natives are not qualified, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the corruption among the judicial departments, the
prime minister said that Mozambique has a new organizational
regulation which will award or punish the police staff according
to how they have carried out their duties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mocumbi noted that those police officers with little
 schooling will be asked to retire and a certain diploma will be
required for new comers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are five higher educational institutions
including one comprehensive university, one teachers' college and
one institute of foreign affairs, with some 10,000 students on the
campus.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Obasanjo Facing Tough Challenges Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A few days to the handing over of
power from military to civilian, President-elect General Olusegun
Obasanjo is scheduled to be sworn in as the president of the
Fourth Republic of Nigeria on May 29.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Nigeria will be a democracy by noon of that
day, bringing an end to the 16 years of uninterrupted military
rule in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo has pledged to run "an open, fair and transparent
government" throughout his four-year tenure last March after he
won the February 27 presidential election on the ticket of the
People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that General Obasanjo, who regained power
after he handed over the power to an elected government in 1979,
would face tough challenges to realize his campaign promise of
"revitalizing the Nigerian state and once again put a smile on the
faces of our long suffering people."
</P>
<P>
They noted that to promote the ideals of democracy, national
unity and good governance, the in-coming government of Obasanjo
must tackle the following main challenges:
</P>
<P>
Confidence building: Many Nigerians have lost faith in either
military or civilian governments because of the persisting failure
of previous administrations to deliver the good life to the
people.
</P>
<P>
Governance change: As Nigeria has been under military rule for
about 30 years since its independence in 1960, the due process of
civil society and the rule of law has been undermined, thus
weakening key institutions like the civil service, judiciary and
the police.
</P>
<P>
Poverty Alleviation: More than 65 percent of Nigerians are
living below the poverty line and with the increasing gap between
the few rich and many poor, poverty alleviation can no longer be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
Corruption combat: Corruption is one cankerworm that has eaten
deep into the fabric of the Nigerian society and Nigeria was
recently ranked by Transparency International, a non-governmental
watchdog, as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Debt relief: As at the end of 1998, the stock of public
external debt recorded 28.8 billion U.S. dollars and Nigeria's
ratio of debt/GDP (gross domestic product) is 70 percent. It is
practically impossible for Nigeria to achieve growth unless the
burden is substantially reduced.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure improvement: Energy and electricity supply has
increasingly worsened in recent years, leading to huge negative
impact on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Niger Delta crisis solution: Oil production has left large
parts of the Niger Delta region polluted, making it difficult for
local farmers and fishermen to earn a legitimate living from their
traditional occupations.
</P>
<P>
So, many Nigerians doubt whether the in-coming government will
be able to deliver the promise of democracy as General Obasanjo is
seen as "part of the muddle of the past and a likely pawn in the
hands of the military."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it is essential for the Obasanjo
government to take deliberate measures to get Nigeria out of the
woods, especially in the first 100 days of his administration.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo needs to swiftly embark on measures to empower
civil institutions to resume their responsibilities and to carry
out reforms of the military and the law enforcement agencies, and
to repeal all legislations which inhibit democracy, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, the president-elect confidently said at his first
press conference after his election victory that he would restore
the dignity of Nigeria, revive the civil institutions and
reinvigorate the battered economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria had for too long had governments of
"deception and oppression" which have never lived up to their
promises.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo pledged that his first business when he takes
over the reins of government would be to reconcile the Nigerians,
heal their wounds and restore the people's trust in the
government.
</P>
<P>
He promised to lead by example to fight corruption,
professionalize the military and revitalize the economy, and urged
Nigerians to look ahead positively and work hard to turn Nigeria
into the real giant of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, General Obasanjo noted that democracy is a
process, not an event, adding that after so many years of
non-democratic governance, Nigerians have acquired a number of
undemocratic attitude and it would take time to effect the change
of attitude.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the president-elect has asked Nigerians not to expect
miracle from him or think that the country's problems would be
wiped out overnight.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Nigeria, out-going Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar predicted on the occasion of his recent
meeting with National Assembly (parliament) members-elect that the
Fourth Republic of Nigeria would be stable.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNDOF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday recommended that the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) be extend for another period
of six months.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said the ceasefire
between Israel and Syria had been maintained during the past six
months without serious incident.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. chief said UNDOF was facing a serious funding
problem because of unpaid assessment and appealed to U.N. members
to pay their assessment promptly in full and to clear all
remaining arrears.
</P>
<P>
The 1,048-member UNDOF was established in May 1974 to supervise
a ceasefire and troop disengagement between Syrian and Israeli
armies on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The current mandate of UNDOF will expire on May 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Meets Obligations on Nuclear Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has fulfilled all
the major obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) by signing a facility pact with the provisional
technical secretariat responsible for the treaty, the Foreign
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The facility accord was signed in Vienna Thursday by South
Africa's permanent representative in Vienna, Nozipho Joyce
Mxakato-Diseko, and the secretariat's executive secretary,
Wolfgang Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is only the third country to have concluded such a
deal, and is the first nation in which the agreement is entirely
in effect, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The pact grants the secretariat legal authority to undertake
work on South African territory to build up and operate five
stations that South Africa is hosting as part of the international
monitoring system to verify compliance with test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry deputy director for disarmament, Stephen
McQueen, said that the stations were among 321 envisaged
facilities across the world that would monitor compliance.
</P>
<P>
They would transmit data to an international center in Vienna,
and the information would be available to all signatories to the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion of the agreement confirms South Africa's
continuing commitment to the entry-into-force of the CTBT, and
also demonstrates South Africa's readiness to contribute toward
efforts to enhance international peace and security by promoting
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Signing of the facility agreement complements South Africa's
ratification of the CTBT on March 30, it said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is one of the 17 nations to have ratified the
CTBT. To come into effect, the treaty needs 44 countries to
ratify it.
</P>
<P>
Under article one of the test ban treaty, each state party
"undertakes not to carry out any nuclear weapon test, explosion or
any other nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such
nuclear explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control".

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- European main bourses failed to
break out of a tight range Friday as a negative start for Wall
Street hit sentiment further.
</P>
<P>
Only Frankfurt managed to end in the day after the main stocks
spent a volatile session in and out of the plus column, ahead of a
three-day weekend for most of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The weak open on Wall Street finally pushed London's FTSE 100
into the red after spending most of cautious session holding on to
weak gains.
</P>
<P>
The leading index closed down 15.1 points, or 0.2 percent, at
6353.1 on provisional market volume of 766m shares.
</P>
<P>
But the day wasn't a complete loss. Merger rumors and firmer
crude futures lifted the oil sector. Shell was up 9.25 pence, or
2.1 percent, at 445 pence and BP Amoco added 21.5 pence, or 2
percent at 1138.5p.

The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt was the only one of the three major
bourses to close in the black. It finished up almost 11 points at
5253.77, a rise of 0.2 percent.
</P>

The CAC 40 in Paris ended the day above session lows but still
in the red, as it shed 24 points to 4398.13, a fall of just more

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Foreign Diplomats in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
threatened foreign diplomats in Yugoslavia, saying that those
diplomats should know it's dangerous for them to stay in Belgrade
as the U.S.-led NATO continues its air campaign.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin suggested all the other
countries should pull out their diplomats from Belgrade as the
United States did.
</P>
<P>
"I think any diplomat who is aware of the situation knows that
Yugoslavia is a dangerous place," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it is up to other countries to advise their own
employees and citizens.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after several foreign
ambassadors' residences were hit in the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin stressed NATO's bombs are accurate.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, NATO's air campaign clearly represents the most
accurate and discriminating use of air power in history," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we all want to avoid any potential for civilian or
unintended casualties," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The residences of the Spanish, Swiss, Indian, Norwegian and
Hungarian ambassadors to Yugoslavia have been damaged in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
On May 7, the alliance bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
with five missiles from different directions and three of them
exploded, killing three Chinese journalists and injuring more than
20 diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Greece: More European Countries Oppose NATO Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Many countries in Europe opposed the
use by NATO of ground forces in Yugoslavia and desired an
immediate end to the Yugoslav crisis through negotiations on the
basis of the draft agreement recently by seven Western countries
and Russia, known as the Group of Eight, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said at a press briefing that the time was right for
both Belgrade and the international community to intensify efforts
for a political solution to the crisis through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Greek government's view was that there
were some grounds for optimism for a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis discussed the
latest developments in the Yugoslav problem in telephone
conversations with German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder and Italian
Premier Massimo D'Alema, the spokesman said, adding that Simitis
was also in daily contact with other European leaders.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also chaired Friday a meeting to discuss the difference
in the position adopted by the U.S. on the one hand and most
European countries on the other.
</P>
<P>
As for Greece's refusal to allow the use of Greek airspace by
Turkish military aircraft flying to Germany to join NATO air
forces participating in the Yugoslav conflict, he said that it was
the first time such a request had been made and underlined
Greece's categorical opposition to Greek airspace being used for
these types of operations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey reportedly submitted the request to the Greek Foreign
Ministry Thursday, seeking permission for two or three aircraft to
pass through Greek airspace, but Greece rejected the request on
the grounds that Athens was neither taking part in NATO military
operations nor providing facilities to those countries which were
participating in the operations.
</P>
<P>
Greece said Friday that it had already made the necessary
preparations for sending a 500-member peacekeeping force in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece also reiterated that it would not be
providing Kosovo Albanian refugees with shelter on its territory
but was willing to help them go to other countries.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop New Bone Marrow Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have proved that it
is possible to transplant bone marrow from mismatched human donors
without the usual pre-transplant destruction to the recipients.
</P>
<P>
At present, some terminally-ill cancer sufferers are not able
to undergo bone marrow treatment because doctors think they are
too ill, weak or old to survive the pre-transplant chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplantation recipients usually undergo a
process called ablation, in which their diseased bone marrow is
destroyed by chemotherapy to wipe out their immune system, so that
it does not reject the new marrow.
</P>
<P>
But researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital, the
United States, reported Friday in The Lancet medical journal they
have successfully treated two terminally-ill patients with a
process that removes the need for such high doses of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The new technique involves blending together the immune systems
of donor and host which both removes the need for the
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied five patients who were terminally-ill
with Hodgkins Lymphoma, a cancer of the body's lymphatic system,
using this pioneering technique.
</P>
<P>
Among the five patients, two died from the disease and one for
another reason.
</P>
<P>
But the other two are now in "long-term remission", meaning
they are currently free of disease, which showed the possibility
of a lasting combination of donor and recipient immune systems
without the usual toxic treatment.
</P>
<P>
The technique not only means that more patients without
identically-matched bone marrow donors can receive treatment, it
may also be of use in preventing rejection of transplanted organs,
the researchers believed.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Switzerland, Greece to Set up Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia, Switzerland and
Greece have decided to set up "FOCUS" Project to combine their
efforts on the delivery and distribution of emergency humanitarian
assistance on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(FRY), a press release from the Russian Mission to the United
Nations said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press release, being distributed here, said that the three
countries made the decision "with the view to providing
humanitarian assistance to the affected population of FRY."
</P>
<P>
On April 28, the Steering Group on humanitarian response was
set up to carry out the project.
</P>
<P>
The main targets of the "FOCUS" Project are to provide direct
humanitarian assistance to the affected population of FRY,
including Kosovo, a Serbian province, to provide transport
facilities (air and automobile) for delivery of humanitarian goods
to the camps of refugees from Kosovo, said the news release.
</P>
<P>
The three-nation project was designed to ensure security
measures for trucks convoys delivering humanitarian supplies to
the refugee camps, and in the course of aid supplies dropping
operations, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The three countries also invited other nations and
international organizations for cooperation in the framework of the
"FOCUS" Project.
</P>
<P>
For implementing the project, a Trust Fund for donations from
other countries has been established. The contributions made

<HEADLINE> Khatami's Visit Boosts Tehran-Riyadh Ties: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The recent trip to Saudi Arabia by
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami was a turning point in
Tehran-Riyadh relations and would serve to boost bilateral
economic ties, said an Iranian minister on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Building mutual confidence and understanding was the most
significant achievement of President Khatami's visit to Saudi
Arabia, Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadar told the Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Iran and Saudi Arabia amounted to over
100 million U.S. dollars in the past few months, and by taking
into account the indirect trade between the two countries, the
figure is expected to stand at about 400 million dollars, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami Thursday concluded an eight-day
ground-breaking tour to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in which
he spent five days on talks with Saudi leaders.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Saudi Arabia expressed their national will to
expand economic cooperation and called for strengthening of
joint-economic commission and removal of trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
The second session of the Tehran-Riyadh joint economic
commission is to be held before the year end in Tehran, he said,
adding that Iran can meet the needs of Saudi Arabia for vehicles,
auto parts, clothing, foodstuffs and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed an agreement on air
transportation based on which Saudi flights to Tehran and
Mashhad and the flights from Iran to Riyadh and Dhahran are
to start by June 20 this year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous with Khatami's visit to Saudi Arabia,
representatives of two Saudi petrochemical companies - Saudi Basic
Industries Corp (SABIC) and Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co. (SAFCO)
have started operation in Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement on the issuance of
commercial visa to Iranian traders and inked a draft of a
protocol on customs, sea transportation, transit, tourism,
physical training, standard as well as protection of bilateral
investment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to jointly construct factories
producing construction material, fire bricks and high voltage
cables, as well as industrial slaughter houses and cooperate in
fish culture.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia agreed to build a power plant on Qeshm island in
the Persian Gulf, to invest in an international airport and to
make contributions to oil, gas and petrochemical industries in
Iran, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Immediate Approval of Juvenile  Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday urged the House of Representatives to "immediately"
approve the juvenile crime bill passed in the Senate Thursday and
reject the Republican plan to let the explosive debate cool off
until next month.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the House to take immediate action," Clinton
said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
He pressed the House to approve "every one" of the Senate
bill's new restrictions on gun control, which were propelled to
passage Thursday in the wake of high school shootings in Colorado
and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"We can't once again let the gears of politics as usual grind
our urgency into dust," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Clinton is urging House Democrats to
insist on passing gun restrictions beyond those approved by the
Senate, administration and Democratic aides said.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't settle" for the Senate's limited restrictions,
such as mandatory background checks for all firearms transactions
at gun shows and pawn shops, Clinton told 18 House Democrats
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the group the House should pass additional
provisions that would raise from 18 to 21 the legal age for
possessing and purchasing handguns, semiautomatic assault weapons
and high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
The aides said Clinton delivered that message to the House
Democrats during a private White House meeting to plot strategy in
the gun control debate.
</P>
<P>
Democrats were united in pushing for House action on those
issues by the Memorial Day at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
However, majority Republicans refused to budge from their plans
for Judiciary Committee hearings on the matter Thursday and floor
debate in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
House Republicans were eager to let the issue cool off after it
caused a public relations meltdown for their party during two
volatile weeks of Senate debate on gun control.
</P>
<P>
The shootings in a Colorado and Georgia have generated public
pressure on the Congress to tighten the legislation of gun
control. As many as 15 people were killed in Colorado in a
school shooting on April 20.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Start Rebuilding Process with NBA Draft Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The first step in the massive
rebuilding of the Chicago Bulls comes Saturday when the NBA
conducts its draft lottery.
</P>
<P>
After winning six championships in eight years, the Bulls
endured the worst season in franchise history with a 13-37 mark.
They finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference and
third-worst overall behind Vancouver and the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls could have as many as three first-round picks in the
June 30 draft but it is their own which carries the most
importance. Chicago has a 15.7 percent chance of winning the
lottery but could be picking as low as sixth.
</P>
<P>
Depending on where they select, the Bulls will have a chance
at one of the top underclassmen who have declared for the draft,
such as Rhode Island forward Lamar Odom, Duke forward Corey
Maggette or Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
General manager Jerry Krause is hoping to select a player who
can become a cornerstone of the franchise's future, much the way
Michael Jordan did as the third overall pick in 1984 and Scottie
Pippen did as the fifth pick in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Chicago has not had a lottey pick since 1989, when it tabbed
forward Stacey King sixth overall. The Bulls could also receive
Phoenix's pick (16th) and have the right to take San Antonio's
pick(29th).

<HEADLINE> China Improves Protection of Women's Employment Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China has dramatically improved
the employment rate and job security standards of women and
boosted the insurance related to childbearing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yazhi, Vice Minister of Labor and Social Security, made the
remarks today at a national conference on women and children,
which opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of women staff and workers amongst the urban
workforce has increased annually by 0.1 percent, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
She said that the wide introduction of the labor contract
system has provided lawful protection of the rights of all workers
including women.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that departments involved in labor rights
protection have battled against those enterprises that refuse to
sign or violate the labor contracts in various ways, and she urges
those enterprises to deal with disputes involving women workers in
a lawful way.
</P>
<P>
Liu also confirmed that the reform of insurance for
childbearing has been promoted nationwide in 26 provinces and
cities, and more than 27 million women workers have bought
policies.
</P>
<P>
Government departments at all levels have all paid great
attention to the re-education of laid-off women workers and have
cooperated with the labor unions and women's associations in
helping them re-join the job market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 80 percent of laid-off women workers
received professional re-training in 1998 and that more than 3
million woman workers found jobs via some intermediary agencies.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment rate has thus reached 50 percent.

WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers moved one
game away from sweeping the Philadelphia 76ers with a 97-86
victory in the Eastern Conference semifinals Friday night in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
With 29 points from Reggie Miller, the Pacers, who survived
late runs by the Sixers in Games 1 and 2, did the same for the
final three quarters of Game 3. This time, they never gave up the
lead and can sweep the Philadelphia with a victory in Game 4 on

Allen Iverson led the Sixers with 32 points, but needed 33
shots to do it. After he cut Indiana's lead to 77-74 with a three-

apart with a 16-4 run that gave them their biggest lead, 14 points.
</P>
<P>
Miller, decked twice on vicious fouls by Matt Geiger and Tyrone
Hill, capped the run with a 3-pointer for three of Indiana's

<HEADLINE> Camilla Martin Advances into Women's Singles Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Camilla Martin became the first
European shuttler to move into the women's singles final of the
World Championships since 1977 when she defeated Gong Ruina of
China 6-11, 11-9 and 11-3 Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Dannish player looked brilliant in the match in which she
lost the first set but found back her form in the next two sets,
winning the match in a dominating style.
</P>
<P>
Second seeded Gong Ruina, one of the top favorites to win the
world championship, jumped to lead 8-4 in the second set, but lack
of strength and stamina caused her first world title.
</P>
<P>
"She did not have much strength in the second half of the
second set," said Martin, who moved into the top four by defeating
China's Gong Zhichao Friday night. "I was a little bit lucky to
win," she added.
</P>
<P>
Martin will meet Dai Yun of China or Mette Sorensen of Denmark
in the
final.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to be in the final, and I don't care who I will
play next match," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles of the Sudirman Cup final last Saturday,
Martin lost to Dai Yun in a three-set gruelling match.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team women's singles coach Tang Xuehua said Gong's
defeat was caused by her strength. "She played quite well in the
first set, but in the next two sets, she was obviously lack of
power, and therefore she could only play rallies from the back
court," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When she was at 8-4 lead in the second set, she had chance to
win," Tang continued.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Beijing, China, aspires to enhance trade relations with Malaysia,
particularly in the agro-forestry sector.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Municipal Agro-Forestry Office's deputy director Nie
Yuzao told reporters here Saturday that most of the business
transactions between Beijing and Malaysia involved mainly palm
oil, textiles, machinery and tools, while the trade volume for
other agricultural products was still insignificant.
</P>
<P>
He added that overall, bilateral trade between Beijing and
Malaysia has improved to about 100 million U.S. dollars per year,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade was slightly affected last year due to the regional
economic crisis but the situation has returned back to normal,
said Nie who is leading a 55-member trade delegation from
Beijing's agro-forestry industry on a five-day visit to Selangor
beginning May 20.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the visit would will strengthen the economic ties
between Malaysia and China.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Chinese delegates attended a business session
with their Malaysian counterparts to explore trade opportunities,
including in forging business partnerships.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Files Appeal Against Conviction, Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Anwar Ibrahim Saturday filed a
petition of appeal against his conviction and six years' jail
sentence imposed by the High Court when he was found guilty of
interfering in police investigations into allegations of sexual
misconduct against him last month.
</P>
<P>
The petition, which contained 29 grounds, was filed at the
Court of Appeal Registrar's Office by S.N. Nair, one of his 10
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah, and their son were also present.
</P>
<P>
On April 14, Justice Augustine Paul sentenced Anwar to six
years' jail on each of four charges of corrupt practice and
ordered the sentences to run concurrently commencing on that day.
</P>
<P>
In his grounds of appeal, Anwar claimed that the sentence
imposed on him by the High Court was manisfestly excessive.
</P>
<P>
He said the judge failed to exercise his discretion judicially
in that he allowed himself to be influenced by irrelevant
questions and failed to take into account or to give due regard to
questions relevant to the imposition of sentence.
</P>
<P>
"The refusal by the judge to take into account the period
during which I was in prison on remand was unreasonable," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that due to the undue length of the record of
appeal and the numerous legal issues involved, he would apply for
leave to apply for a further and supplementary petition of appeal.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Free from Rinderpest: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Ministry of
Agriculture declared here Saturday that the Horn of Africa state
is temporarily free from rinderpest, a major cattle-killer
contagious disease.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a relevant establishment organized under the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) with the financial assistance
of the European Union had conducted a 10-year inoculation campaign
against rinderpest in 34 African countries including Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveillance conducted jointly by the OAU and pertinent
institutions of the countries where the inoculation campaign had
been carried out proved that most of the target states including
Ethiopia have arrested the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia proclaimed itself a rinderpest free zone on May 1 in
line with the International Animal Health Organization criteria,"
the ministry was quoted by the official Ethiopian News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said efforts are underway to preempt the spread
into the country of rinderpest prevailing along the southern Sudan
and western Somali frontiers.
</P>
<P>
It said Ethiopia would intensify its rinderpest control
activities to prevent the disease from resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the largest livestock population in Africa. The
Ethiopian government asked the Food and Agricultural Organization
of the United Nations (FAO) in January this year to issue
directives to those countries that boycotted cattle trade with it,
assuring them that the cattle disease is non-existence in
Ethiopia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Mozambican Liberation
Front (Frelimo) is preparing for the presidential and
parliamentary elections scheduled for October this year, Manuel
Tome, Secretary General of the party said.
</P>
<P>
One of the important measures taken by the party is to hold
three key meetings in June, Tome is quoted by Noticias daily as
saying at a press conference here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three meetings includes the second special meeting of the
central committee of Frelimo on June 4, in which a five-year
government work plan (2000-2004) is expected to be mapped out.
</P>
<P>
The second key meeting of the ruling party, to be attended by
about 500 cadres including all the central committee members, will
discuss ways for the party's campaign in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
The third meeting will study the implementation of the
government work during the 1995-1999 period, discuss the next
five-year plan and give final touch on the party's campaign
principles, and adopt the election campaign rules for the party.
</P>
<P>
Another content for the meeting is to evaluate and pass the
standards for the presidential and parliamentary candidates in the
elections, Tome said, noting that many citizens and Frelimo party
members wish to see President Joaquim Chissano to run for another
term of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Tome also said he believed that Frelimo can win the second
multi-party elections, because the party has done a "good job" in
the last five years, and it has been preparing for the elections
since 1995, with two million party members in 23,000 party
branches throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The first multi-party elections in Mozambique was held in
October, 1994, in which the Frelimo party won 129 of the 250 seats
in parliament, and Chissano won as the president.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Keen on Promoting Arab Unity: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League has exerted constant
efforts in promoting unity and cooperation among the Arab
countries and helping resolve regional disputes peacefully, a
visiting Chinese leader said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan
hailed the 22-nation pan-Arab forum as one of the most important
regional organizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Arab League will further play a key role in
the regional and international affairs through exerting its unique
influence," said Li, who arrived here on Friday to pay a six-day
official visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between China and the Arab countries was
nurtured in their common efforts of struggle against imperialism
and colonialism for national liberation, and has been getting deep
in long-term cooperation, Li Ruihuan said.
</P>
<P>
Developing the Sino-Arab friendly cooperation in the current
world situation is the same desire of the Chinese people and the
Arab people, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
"My current visit is aimed at further strengthening mutual
understanding and friendship, increasing consensus and bolstering
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan said the Middle East region has been one of the main
hot spots in the world for the past half a century. Although the
Mideast peace process has been kicked off after the end of the
cold war, regional peace has yet to be realized, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We support peace and justice, dialog and cooperation, and
oppose the use of force and threat to use force in the
region," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China maintains the concerned parties should carry out the
signed peace agreements in a bid to push the peace process
forward on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions
and the land-for-peace principle, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China enjoys friendly cooperation with the Mideast countries,
willing to work persistently with the world community to help
realize comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region, the
Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the Arab League chief, briefed Li Ruihuan
on the latest developments of the Mideast situation, expressing
gratitude to and appreciation for China's constant support for
the Arab just cause.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that he agreed to Li's evaluation of the
Arab-Chinese relations, expressing hope that the relations will
be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Li Ruihuan visits Egypt, the
fourth and last leg of his Asian and African tour which also took
him to South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- England's soccer club Chelsea
beat Hong Kong's Instant Dict 2-1 in a soccer friendly here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, finishing third in the England's Premier League this

substitute Mikael Forsell to win the match after Italy's former
international Gianfranco Zola gave Chelsea the lead in the 23rd
minute.

Ian Baird of Instant Dict scored in the 68th minute in a

start-up players in the second half, insisted that his team played
quite well despite a lackluster second half when Instant Dict
almost equalized.
</P>
<P>
Instant Dict ranked fifth in Hong Kong Division one this season.
</P>

Vialli said the rivals "came up and gave us a hard time" in the
second half and he praised the Hong Kong team's defense that

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Calls for World Attention to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy Jesse Jackson has said there is hope for Africa if
the people of the continent themselves realized their worth.
</P>
<P>
But what is more important is for the world to turn its
attention to Africa as it is doing for Europe, Asia, and others,
he said Friday, citing the situation in Kosovo and the carnage in
Sierra Leone war, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We must open the keyhole and see the door - there is big
Africa full of work and possibility. The world must hear that
story," Jackson, special envoy for democratization and human
rights, told the closing plenary of the Fifth African-African
American Summit, presided over by Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen African heads of state, vice-presidents and
the King of Swaziland participated in the summit, along with more
than 4, 000 delegates, mostly African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
The event is co-sponsored by the government of Ghana, a host
of American companies including Chevron, and some Ghanaian
companies: the Volta River Authority, and Ashanti Gold fields.
</P>
<P>
 It was organized by the Rev Leon Sullivan, founder of the
U.S-based Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OIPC) who is
also the convener, and the Ghana Investment Promotion Center on
the theme: "Business, Trade and Investment - - Africa can
compete."
</P>
<P>
Jackson said Africans and African Americans must find a common
ground to move on to higher ground. "That is our burden. That is
our challenge. That is our responsibility."
</P>
<P>
 He focused on what he termed the "psychological shift" that
has impacted on Africa and prompted it to embrace democracy,
economic growth, development and progress.
</P>
<P>
"The most profound shift that must take place at the
crossroads is to look to the future," he said, but added that
there was no future in promoting war and discord.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who mediated a cease-fire agreement in Sierra Leone
earlier this week in Lome, Togo, told the gathering that there
will now be peace in that country along with Eritrea, the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan, "because war is
unacceptable, because peace is the only option."

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Vice-President Closes Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth African-African American
Summit which attracted thousands of Africans in the diaspora and
12 heads of state from Africa, ended in Accra, capital of Ghana,
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Performing the closing ceremony, Ghanaian Vice President John
Evans Atta Mills who officially opened the business session
Monday, said, "today we may be formally closing this summit, but
we should not regard this as an ending."
</P>
<P>
 He said it should rather be the beginning of the task of
following up the contacts made, of turning ideas into projects, of
realizing goals and of further advancing the development of
strong, practical and mutually beneficial ties.
</P>
<P>
Mills said the summit was a gathering of a family, which was
divided by three centuries of painful history.
</P>
<P>
"We in Africa and you in the Americas have had to struggle
to rise above the injustices of colonialism, slavery, oppression
and marginalization before we could reach out to each other to
restore the ties and heal the wounds of the past.
</P>
<P>
 He said the summit has demonstrated that Africa is ready to
do business and it could compete. "Africa is the continent of
opportunity for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
 The five-day summit has as its main objective to attract
investments into Africa. It was attended by over 4,000 delegates
from Africa and the US, including mayors, business executives and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
 Mills said in the past, Africa was a continent of opportunity
for plunder and exploitation by others.
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we have been able to lay the foundations of an Africa
of peace, stability and democratic governance where the
opportunities are for sound, honest business partnerships in an
investor-friendly climate of mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
 Areas of instability and conflict which shall mar the image
of Africa are the exception and not the rule, he said, adding that
Africa is doing its best, with the help of its friends to resolve
and eventually eliminate conflicts in the not distant future so
the continent would know peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
 He expressed gratitude to President Clinton's Special Envoy
for democratization and human rights, the Rev Jesse Jackson in the
Sierra Leone peace process on his way to the summit.
</P>
<P>
 "We pray that the negotiations due to start next Monday will
mark not only the end of suffering and violence but the beginning
of a new dawn of reconstruction and prosperity of our neighbors."
</P>
<P>
 "Let us also pray that Nigeria, which will inaugurate a new
constitutional democracy next week, will succeed this time around
in creating the basis for the full realization of its potential,",
said the vice-president.

of the Egyptian Shura (Consultative) Council Mustafa Kamal Helmy.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Li said China and Egypt have been sharing
sincere and solid friendship on the basis of mutual respect and
understanding since they set up diplomatic ties more than 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Terming China and Egypt as influential developing countries in

should strengthen unity and cooperation in a bid to set an example
for promoting unity and cooperation among the developing countries.

Beijing always views Cairo as its close friend and the most
important partner in the Arab world and Africa, Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Helmy said in the talks that the relations between Egypt and
China are quite good, adding the Egyptian people are sincere
friends of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak attaches great importance to developing
Egyptian-Chinese relations, Helmy said, adding the two countries
should constantly exchange high-level visits to promote the
bilateral cooperation, including that between the Egyptian Shura
Council and the CPPCC.

He expressed conviction that the current visit by Li Ruihuan
to Egypt will contribute more to the development of the bilateral

ancient civilizations, having made great and unique contributions
to the mankind and social progress.

<HEADLINE> Canadian MP says Kosovo Best Served by Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The scenes of desolation and
devastation in Kosovo are so horrible that NATO needs to suspend
its bombing campaign to try to kick-start peace negotiations,
Canadian parliamentarian Svend Robinson said after a quick tour of
the war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
The Canada's New Democratic Party MP, who initially supported
the air war when it began on March 24, now believes that the cause
of the displaced Kosovo Albanians is best served by a pause in the
attacks, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"What does NATO have to lose? The important thing is to get to
the negotiating table," Robinson said in a telephone interview
Friday. He was the first Canadian parliamentarian allowed into
Kosovo on Wednesday by the Yugoslav government since the start of
the war.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslav officials accompanied him during his 24-hour-
visit in Kosovo. They wanted him to view damage caused by bombs of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Pristina, the provincial
capital, and elsewhere in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said he saw scores of burned-out or abandoned houses in more
than a dozen villages along the road. "It was just like ghost
towns."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians may still be hiding
in the mountains and forests of Kosovo and be in danger of
starvation, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
The need to get food, medicine and humanitarian assistance to
these innocent civilians is another reason for NATO to suspend
bombing operations, the MP said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a humanitarian crisis there and as long as NATO is
bombing nobody can get in there," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Spend $1,651M in 1999/2000 Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
planned to spend a total of 1,164 billion Tanzanian shillings, or
1,651 million U.S. dollars (one to 705) in the 1999/2000 fiscal
year, according to an official report issued by local media
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report was made by Minister for Finance Daniel Yona Friday
when he briefed members of two parliamentary committees for
economy, finance and social services in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Yona said among the total expenditure, which is a 15.5 increase
over last year's 1,008 billion shillings, 921.1 billion shillings
will be for recurrent expenditure and 242.9 billion shillings for
development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure is expected to be realized by 822.5
billion shillings from internal sources and 388.4 billion
shillings from external loans and grants.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the recurrent expenditure, 240.4 billion
shillings will be for salaries of civil servants, 680.8 billion
shillings for other uses which include 201 billion shillings for
social services, 148.2 billion for administration, 140.0 billion
shillings for defense and security.
</P>
<P>
Priority in the next development budget will be given to
health, education, water sectors, road construction and
rehabilitation as well as agricultural activities, said Yona.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the government would continue to ensure
strict control of expenditure in line with revenue collected
without borrowing from banks in order to further reduce inflation
from 8.8 percent this March to five percent by next June and
increase foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
Commenting the value added tax (VAT) introduced last July, Yona
said it is a success as 12,113 VAT payers out of the estimated
15,000 businessmen have been registered.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same session, Nassoro Malocho, the Minister of
State in the President's Office and vice chairman of the Planning
Commission, also made his presentation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will sustain the divestiture program in
the next financial year by privatizing at least 50 parastatals.
</P>
<P>
He explained that until last December some 270 parastatals out
of a total of 395 parastatals and companies had been privatized,
adding that the exercise so far was 69.3 percent of the target.

<HEADLINE> China to Focus on Education of Children in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Although the nine years of
compulsory education has become popular in areas involving nearly
three quarters of Chinese people, resulting in a zero illiteracy
rate among the adults, there still remain many difficulties in the
education of children in poor areas, according to Lu Fuyuan, vice-
minister of Education.
</P>
<P>
Lu was addressing a national conference on women and children,
which opened on May 21, where he said that up to the end of last
year people in more than 2,200 counties nationwide have received
the compulsory education, making up 73 percent of the whole
population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problems in these areas involve a shortage of
funds, the increasing number of children of school age and a
growing rate of illiteracy, even though 98.9 percent of children
nationwide have attended primary school and 87.3 percent attending
middle school.
</P>
<P>
"The central and local governments allocated some 10 billion
yuan for developing education in poor areas between 1995 and 2000.
The Ministry of Education has also obtained a 380 million yuan
loan from the World Bank for popularizing the compulsory primary
or secondary education in poor areas," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
The central government also set up an annual foundation to
sponsor 600,000 drop-out students from poor families to take up
their schooling again.
</P>
<P>
Lu stressed that the Chinese government also give priorities to
education in poor ethnic areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than 24,000 primary and
middle schools holding nearly four million ethnic students. China
has also cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund (
UNICEF) in promoting primary education in China's ethnic
communities in its west areas.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Tobacco Expected to Earn $160 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco, Malawi's major export
earner, is expected to earn about 160 million U.S. dollars this
season, but the scenario may not have negative repercussions, the
Malawi News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
 Grey Msonthi, general manager for Auction Holdings Limited,
was quoted as saying that the country has already realized 50
million dollars from burley tobacco sales in the month the tobacco
auction floors have been operational.
</P>
<P>
"We start with lower leaves. Soon some leaves will start
shooting and this will affect quality. When a buyer realizes that
crop will not be there, they will rush to buy thus prices will go
up," he said.
</P>
<P>
There was good quality tobacco this year with daily sales
registering 23 percent higher than last year, said Msonthi.
</P>
<P>
"Prices are firm. Quality has been extremely good and
presentation by farmers is excellent. We were worried with this
year's heavy rains that quality would be compromised, but farmers
looked after their crops very well," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said initially auction holdings estimated volume
of between 90 to100 million kilograms of burley but recent
estimates put the harvest at 75 million kilograms compared to 114
million kilos yielded last year.
</P>
<P>
He assured that prices of all the three varieties are higher
than last year's with burley pegged at an average of 1.54 dollars
per kilogram from last year's 1.30 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Prices are better this year... They are well above those paid
in Zimbabwe. Even demand for our tobacco is high," he said.

<P>
XIAMEN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A direct ocean shipping route,
connecting the port of Xiamen in east China's Fujian province and
the ports of Long Beach and Oakland along the west coast of the
United States, opened today.
</P>
<P>
 The China Ocean Shipping Company(COSCO), the major cargo
carrier on the new route, plans to send one cargo ship every
Saturday to America, with the one way journey lasting 18 days.
</P>
<P>
 There has been no direct route for a long time which meant
that cargo from southeastern China had to be shipped via other
ports in the U.S., which greatly increased the transportation cost.
</P>
<P>
 With the rapid development of the local economy over the past
decade, more and more products, such as toys, shoes, furniture and
sports equipment, are exported to the U.S., which made it more
urgent to open up a new shipping route.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah met here Saturday with Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Al-Hoss who arrived earlier in the day for a
two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Both sides discussed means of boosting bilateral relations and
issues of mutual concern, the Kuwait News Agency reported. But
the agency did not offer further details about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, according to remarks Al-Hoss made to the Kuwaiti press
before the visit, Israel's unconditional withdrawal from South
Lebanon and the reconstruction program of war-torn Lebanon would
top the bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hoss, also Lebanon's foreign minister, said he would "ask
for Kuwait's support to Lebanon in its efforts to press Israel
into halting its aggressions against the land and people of
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister was also scheduled to hold talks
with officials of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development as
well as Kuwaiti businessmen for exchanging views on the economic
situation in Lebanon, apparently with the aim to woo more Kuwaiti
investments for Lebanon's reconstruction and economic development
projects.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Al-Hoss visits Kuwait since he took
office from his predecessor Rafik Hariri last December.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Offer Jail for Rwanda Genocide Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has offered to provide
prison facilities for convicts of the 1994 Rwanda genocide, the
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. court, said in a press release reaching here that it
has reached an agreement in principle with the Zambian government
for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
"That agreement is expected to be formalized shortly," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement is signed, Zambia will become the second
country, following Mali, to accept prisoners of 1994 Rwanda
genocide in which more than 500,000 people were massacred.
</P>
<P>
On February 12 this year, the tribunal's registrar signed with
the government of Mali an agreement whereby the west African
country undertook to provide prison facilities for the enforcement
of the court's prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court said more African countries have expressed
 willingness to accept the Rwanda genocide prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are at an advanced stage with the governments of
Benin and Madagascar on this issue," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR, based in Arusha town, north Tanzania, was created by
the United Nations Security Council in November 1994 after the
genocide happened that year.
</P>
<P>
Several Scandinavian countries have also offered to provide
prisons for the genocide convicts, but the court preferred to let
them serve sentences in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The reason, according to Tom Kennedy, Chief Officer of Press
and Public Affairs of the court, is that Rwanda genocide is an
"African problem."

<HEADLINE> Theft of Fire arms Increases in S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South African police
authorities have attributed the increasing violent crimes in the
country to the alarming increase in the number of firearms stolen
and lost.
</P>
<P>
Saturday Star newspaper quoted Sydney Mufamadi, minister for
safety and security, as reporting that in 1998 alone a total of
29,694 fir arms had been reported stolen or lost to the police
forces and troops.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that in addition to the smuggling of firearms
from abroad, South African gangs and vigilante groups are
targeting armories of police stations and military barracks to get
illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
Thefts from these armories are often well organized and are
usually carried out with the assistance of a person working inside
the armory or someone with knowledge of its security procedures.
</P>
<P>
Besides, another source of illegal firearms in South Africa is
the theft or loss of civilian-owned firearms.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from 1994 to 1997 show that the number of reported
lost or stolen firearms has risen steadily, from 7,285 in 1994 to
16,963 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For now, the South African government has identified firearms
as a priority within its National Crime Prevention Strategy.
</P>
<P>
National Police Commissioner George Fivas announced recently
that reducing the number of illegal firearms was a priority. He
expressed belief that through legislation, enforcement and
preventive measures, the police would be able to go some way in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> Stuer-Lauridsen Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Danish shuttler Thomas Stuer-
Lauridsen announced retirement from the sport of badminton here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Stuer-Lauridsen, bronze medalist at the Barcelona Olympics,
told a press conference: "It is a difficult decision for me, but
it is definitely a right one."
</P>
<P>
Ranked seventh in the world, the Dane lost to China's Sun Jun 5-
15, 13-15 in the quarter-finals of the 11th World Championships
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The first thought of retirement came last September when Stuer-
Lauridsen had a left ankle surgery. "At that time, I decided to
continue for a few months to see whether how well I could do in
the sport. I have decided then if I could not reach top five, I
should quit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Danish player, 28, began his badminton career ten years ago
and he had taken part in five world championships, in which his
best result was a semi-final berth at the 1995 World Championships
in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He pointed that money played no part in his decision to quit. "
If I think financially, I may continue two more years," said Stuer-
Lauridsen.
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention his plan after retirement. "I may play
more golf," said the Danish player, who is also a good golf player.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Import White Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will have to
import white maize from international markets this year, the
Agriculture Department said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of maize import is not available. However, the
South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) quoted officials of
the department as saying that the local maize harvest this year
will be six million tons, one million tons less than last year.
</P>
<P>
This will be insufficient to meet local demand, and white
maize will have to be imported from overseas markets, a spokesman
for the department said, adding the import will apparently
increase domestic price of maize meal.
</P>
<P>
Yellow maize may have to meet the demands of the millions of
South African people whose staple food is white maize.

<HEADLINE> Iraq in Urgent Need of Oil Spare Parts, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi oil industry is in
urgent need of spare parts for increasing production capacity
which has been adversely affected by the 1991 Gulf War and the
continuation of U.N. sanctions, an oil official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of Planning and Studies Department at the Oil
Ministry Falih Hassan told reporters that if spare parts are
available, Iraq can increase its oil production to the
pre-sanctions level of 3.25 million barrels per day (bpd) from
the current 2.65 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The oil official held the U.N. Sanctions Committee responsible
for the delay of approving the contracts Iraq concluded for the
purchase of spare parts under the fourth and fifth phases of the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase Iraq's production and export capacity,
the U.N. Security Council agreed last year to allow Iraq to
purchase 300 million U.S. dollars worth of oil equipment and
spare parts from the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British representatives in
the Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval of its contracts
under various flimsy pretexts.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that the number of spare parts contracts for oil
sector which are on hold under the two phases has amounted to 245
contracts out of a total of 673 contracts Iraq signed so far.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq has only received 14 million dollars worth
of spare parts so far under the contracts signed in the fourth
phase, and that no contracted spare parts under the fifth phase to
expire on May 25 have reached Iraq yet.
</P>
<P>
The oil official expected that Iraq will accomplish marketing
350-360 million barrels of crude oil in the fifth phase
under the contracts concluded with foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Buddha's Birthday Celebrated in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great assembly also served as a worship ritual for the
Buddha's tooth relic, which arrived in Hong Kong Friday afternoon
on a specially chartered flight from Beijing. The holy tooth relic
has been preserved in China for 1,523 years as a supreme national
treasure.
</P>
<P>
For the seven consecutive days from Saturday, the tooth relic
will be placed at the Hong Kong Coliseum for public worship.
</P>
<P>
Officiating guests at the ceremony included Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Zhao Puchu, president of the Buddhist Association of China, Jiang
Enzhu, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and Ye
Xiaowen, director general of the State Administration for
Religious Affairs of China.
</P>
<P>
Among other participants at the ceremony were officials from
the Central government of China and the HKSAR, overseas venerables
from the Buddhist sectors, foreign consuls in Hong Kong,
representatives of monks from China's mainland, religious heads
and local Buddhism believers.
</P>
<P>
As the ceremony started, all participants stood to pay respects
to the Buddha's statue three times and the song "Buddha, the Most
Precious One" was played.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his opening speech, Kowk Kwong, chairman of the
organizing committee, said that for many years millions of Hong
Kong Buddhist disciples had been earnestly seeking to make the
Buddha's birthday as a public holiday and to worship the Buddha's
tooth relic.
</P>
<P>
For non-Buddhists, this provides valuable opportunities to
understand the Buddhist beliefs of compassion and equality, Kowk
Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
Buddhists advocate and promote peaceful coexistence, mutual
respect, harmonious relationships and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We strive to purify our thoughts, overcome our sins and attain
virtue; to rid ourselves of hatred and resolve conflicts so that
our society, our country and the whole world may enjoy peace and
harmony," he said.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism in Hong Kong started to take root during the Song
Dynasty (960-1279). Since then, it has attracted many followers
among the local communities.
</P>
<P>
The 8th day of April on the Chinese Lunar calendar, which falls
on May 22 this year, is believed to be the Buddha's birthday and
this is the 2,543 birthday of the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, there are only two holy teeth
left by Sakyamuni Buddha in the world when the he was cremated
more than 2,500 years ago. One is now kept in Sri Lanka and the
other was brought from India to China about 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since then, it had been worshipped by successive emperors and
has been classified as a supreme national treasure.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
funds were allocated in 1958 to build a new pagoda beside the
original site in Ling Guang Monastery in Xishan, Beijing on the
mountain side for paying homage and worship.
</P>
<P>
Owing to its sacred status as a national treasure, the
opportunities for public display are rare. To celebrate the great
Buddha's birthday this year, the tooth relic was invited to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
According Kowk Kwong, an estimated 30,000 visitors will be
received to worship the tooth relic every day and night throughout
the seven days.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puchu said that in 1956 and 1961, at the request of
Buddhists of Burma and Sri Lanka, the tooth relic was taken to
these two countries on two different occasions and was warmly
welcome.
</P>
<P>
Following the speeches by Kowk Kwong and Zhao Puchu, guests of
honor on the stage and all participants followed the traditional
Buddha's Birthday ceremony, to bathe the Buddha's statue to show
respect to Lord Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Commemorative envelopes and seals have been issued in Hong Kong
for the occasion. An exhibition named the "2000 Years of Buddhism
in China" is being held during the worship period. The exhibition
includes pictures and photographs of famous Buddhist sites and
scenes from the Qin (221-206 B.C.) and Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 220)
Dynasties to modern times.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be of interest to those who are keen on
Buddhist culture and its implications on Chinese history, religion,
philosophy and arts.
</P>
<P>
Another exhibition, the "Buddhist Social Services in Hong Kong,
" introduces the charity work done by the Hong Kong Buddhist
organizations. Buddhists and Taoists make up the vast majority of
Hong Kong's religious population.

<HEADLINE> Summit on African's Future Ends in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth African-African American
Summit aimed at preparing Africa for the new century ended in
Accra, Ghana Friday with a renewed dedication and commitment from
delegates to lift Africa from poverty to becoming a partner in
the global market.
</P>
<P>
 The Summit, which opened Monday, brought together an
unprecedented 19 Presidents and Heads of Government, 25 City
Mayors from the United States over 300 foreign companies and the
largest number of African Americans "to return to Africa after
slavery," under the theme of " Business, Trade and Investment:
Africa Can Compete."
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the history of the Summit which started
in 1991 with Abidjan, some definite solutions for the "New Africa"
vision were reached, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
 Among them was the launch of the People's Investment Fund for
Africa (PIFA), outdooring of the Global Sullivan Principles,
Signing of an Agreement between Ghana and the State of Georgia in
the U.S. to help boost tourism in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
 Memoranda of understanding were signed between some African
Companies and their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
 But, the most significant success was the shared commitment
by the American Mayors, the Black Caucaus in the U.S. and the
Official African American representatives in the White House to
push for the passing of the "African Growth and Opportunity Act."
</P>
<P>
 "Even though that may not be all that we want for Africa, it
will be a strong beginning for bringing Africa in the global
market," said Miss Rosa Whitaker, the White House assistant Trade
Representative for Africa.
</P>
<P>
 The Reverend Jesse Jackson, U.S. President's special envoy
for the promotion of democracy and human rights in Africa, said
that Africa "can go forward with hope" when the bill is passed.
</P>
<P>
 The Growth and Opportunity Act, at least, will give Africa
access to the American market and improve trade relations with the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
 Miss Whitaker said Africa needs about 100 billion dollars to
sustain a growth rate of six to seven percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
 "This cannot come in aid and grants but through investments
and opportunity to be active partners in the world trade," Miss
Whitaker said.
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the consensus on the Act, American businesses were
told to adopt a more proactive and positive outlook to the
numerous business opportunities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
 "We need to free ourselves from the 'ugly American syndrome'
of seeing Africa as a continent with no future," The Reverend Leon
Sullivan, the Convener of the Summit said at a press conference to
close the Summit.
</P>
<P>
 Rev. Sullivan said he appreciated President Clinton's visit
to Africa which was "historic and important" and the efforts he is
making to give Africa a focus on the global play-ground. However,
he said, there is more America can do to help Africa.
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing which we expect America to do is debt relief
for Africa, " Rev. Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
 The issue was also played up at one of the Summit's workshops
-- business and trade and investment -- where concerns were
expressed about the huge debt overhung of the Continent.
</P>
<P>
 About a third of Africa's annual income is spent on servicing
debts to rich Western Nations and multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
 Some of the workshops also dealt with health issues,
agriculture and food security, good governance, education and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
 From a distance, the Summit was a big step toward Africa's
reawakening vision for the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
 "This summit, by far is the most successful of all," the
67-year old Rev. Sullivan, who looked exhausted from preaching
the "new Africa" dream, said.
</P>
<P>
 The success was partly measured by the quick response of the
delegates to PIFA which realized 250,000 dollars at six percent
interest per annum.
</P>
<P>
 Rev. Sullivan said PIFA would be used to support small
businesses and also create about 5,000 new businesses in Africa in
the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes UNHCR on Humanitarian Mission Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry sharply
criticized on Saturday the procedures that the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) will use when briefing NATO on
humanitarian missions in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The new procedures are based on NATO 'recommendations' to the
commission for briefing the alliance on Yugoslavia-bound
humanitarian convoys, air deliveries and ground distribution
facilities," the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"NATO cynically interprets its (recommendations) as lowering
risks for the people who risk their lives to carry out
humanitarian missions. Brussels is endlessly repeating that it
will not grant a reprieve in the bombing," the statement pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
These "safety recommendations" show that "NATO wants to avoid
responsibility for its increasingly frequent 'mistakes' in
delivering air-strikes on schools, hospitals and refugees," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "the latest public demonstration of NATO's
aggressive intentions sharply contrasts with the ongoing
diplomatic efforts toward a peaceful Kosovo settlement," the
Interfax news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Special Fund to Be Set Up to Commemorate Killed Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The China Charity Federation, the
country's largest charitable organization, has decided to
establish a permanent fund to commemorate the three Chinese
journalists killed by the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7.
</P>
<P>
The fund, titled "Memorial Fund Dedicated to Shao Yunhuan, Xu
Xinghu and Zhu Ying", is to be set up at the suggestion of both
Chinese people and foreign friends, sources from the federation
said.
</P>
<P>
On May 7, U.S.-led NATO forces fired three missiles at the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing Shao from the Xinhua News
Agency and the couple of Xu and Zhu from Beijing-based Guangming
Daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that funds donated by individuals and work
units from at home and abroad will be used to help the family
members of the victims, the development of social undertakings of
the three's hometowns and to award excellent journalists.
</P>
<P>
A supervision committee comprising of the federation, Xinhua
News Agency, Guangming Daily, family members of the victims and
donators will be set up to manage the use of the funds.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing also wounded 20 others and severely damaged
the embassy buildings. This has sparked furious protests and
condemnations around the country.

<HEADLINE> Hike in U.S. Interest Rates Won't Affect Asia Greatly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Asian economies can survive an
increase in U.S. interest rates, Mary Bush, former United States
Alternate Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund,
said Friday during a meeting in Cebu City of the Philippines,
Philippines News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to hold the
benchmark federal funds rate at 4.75 percent, but it said it would
consider an eventual raise.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies fear that a hike in U.S. interest rates will
cause global money to rush there and deprive emerging economies of
cash.
</P>
<P>
But Bush said the United States had already "taken care of a
large part of the Asian countries' short-term debt" that are
"coming due all at once."
</P>
<P>
She explained, "With this kind of rationalization of the debt
structure, an increase in U.S. interest rates will not have such a
heavy impact" even if the short-term debt is still there.
</P>
<P>
Bush assured that the Federal Reserve takes into account what
is happening in the rest of the world and "what the risks are on
other economies when they raise interest rates or change interest
rate policies."
</P>
<P>
She said what the Federal Reserve might do is implementing "a
couple of small increase (of interest rates) to calm down
inflationary pressures," which will make the Asian countries
remain in "a much better shape."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Philippine Economic Planning Secretary Felipe
Medalla said "anything (increase) beyond 50 basis points is bad,"
because this would depress stock prices and put pressure on
domestic rates.

PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While NATO intensified its bombings on Friday, the Pentagon
hardened its tone by affirming that NATO should be open to other
possibilities than only air strikes to obtain its military
objectives by autumn this year. The Pentagon wishes to reinforce
ground troops in the Balkans as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
-- The assassination of a senior advisor of the left-wing
government of Italy on Thursday in Rome has made Italians afraid
of a return of the ``years of lead'' from 1970 till 1987, which
were haunted by terrorism from the extreme-right and extreme-left
groups like Red Brigade, which claimed the killing of Massimo
D'Antona, an advisor to the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Washington gave on Friday its agreement to a deployment of
NATO ground troops in the Balkans, while differences persist
between Russians and the Western countries over the way to end the
conflict in Yugoslavia. The Pentagon has asked NATO allies to
gather a 50,000 ground force in Macedonia, a country which the
Pentagon said is better than Albania for a strategy of ground
intervention.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time, the 10 countries along the Nile River
have tried to reach an agreement on a fair share of water
resources from the river. During their two-day meeting in Addis
Abeba this week, the ministers in charge of water resources of
these countries tried to put an end to a conflict over water
sharing which descended from ancient times.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Visits Kuwait to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Saturday left here for Kuwait on a three-day visit aimed at
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be Hoss's fourth leg of his Arab world tour since
he took office from his predecessor Rafik Hariri last December.
</P>
<P>
He has visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt in February, and Qatar
and U.A.E. in March this year.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hoss will meet Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
al-Sabah, and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
al-Sabah, according to the official itinerary.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is also due to hold talks with the Kuwaiti
ministers of foreign affairs, finance and transport.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Kuwaiti News Agency on
Friday, Hoss said he would be discussing the prospects of economic
cooperation and further Kuwaiti investment in Lebanon's
reconstruction plans.
</P>
<P>
As the second largest financial bankroller after Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait has granted Lebanon a total of 331 million U.S. dollars in
donations and soft loans since the end of the country's 1975-1990
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also reaffirmed Lebanon's position regarding the Iraqi
question, saying Baghdad should release all Kuwaitis seized
during its invasion to the country in 1989 and implement all
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
But he decried the U.N. sanctions on Iraq, citing it's not
fair to punish a population for the mistakes of its
government.

"Where does one draw the line between lobbying and corruption

The president said corruption changed its meaning and
connotations from one society to the other and challenged Kenya's
Anti-corruption Authority to come up with clear definitions of
activities that amount to corruption.
</P>
<P>
Such definitions should be based on cultural practices of
different tribes in the country, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt to Make Study Before Investing in CHT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- With assistance from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the Bangladeshi government will undertake
a detailed study in September-December this year to identify
various projects before going for massive investment in the
southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracks (CHT).
</P>
<P>
The study, which will be the first major step following the end
of the nearly two decades of insurgencies in the region with the
signing of a peace accord in December 1997, is seen by the local
people as a leap forward from the unplanned development
initiatives in the past.
</P>
<P>
The study will cost 30.3 million taka (620,000 U.S. dollars).
The ADB will provide 500,000 dollars for the study and the rest
will come from the government, The Daily Star Business Saturday
quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
A team of 13 experts -- five foreigners and eight locals --
will be appointed to conduct the study, and it will talk to a
cross-section of local people to ascertain their development
needs, they said, adding that after the study, the team will
prepare a report outlining various projects necessary for
socio-economic development in this long-neglected region.
</P>
<P>
The people in the CHT, which consists of three districts --
Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari, are hoping that this time
the CHT peace agreement will trigger massive development
activities there.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the study, the ADB and some donor countries
and agencies would come forward with financial assistance to
implement the development projects, they said.

LUSAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia-Namibia Permanent
Commission has welcomed Zambian President Frederick Chiluba's
tireless efforts to restore peace in Congo (K) under the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) mandate.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a communique released here at the
just-ended fifth session of the Zambia-Namibia joint permanent
commission on defense and security held in Namibian capital
Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
The two countries expressed support for the early signing of a
cease- fire agreement in Congo (K) and the deployment of a United
Nations and Organization of African Unity (OAU) peace-keeping
force in that country, Times of Zambia newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On the angola situation, the commission regretted the collapse
of the 1994 Lusaka protocol, which had led to renewed fighting
between the Angolan government and the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The commission put the blame on UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
It urged all parties to the conflicts on the continent to
commit themselves to African initiatives aimed at resolving
conflicts peacefully.
</P>
<P>
It also commended the recent SADC peace-keeping exercise Blue
Crane which took place in South Africa, describing it as a
positive step toward capacity building for future operations in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to work together in dealing with
the secessionist ambitions being pursued by some misguided people
in the two countries, the communique said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Sets Priority of Philippines' Charter Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Economic, not political, reforms are
the priority of the Presidential Palace in seeking amendments to
the 1987 Constitution, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program "JEEP ni Erap", Estrada also
endorsed the constitutional revision by a constituent assembly,
saying it is more economic than holding a constitutional
convention.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that any political amendment to the Constitution
should take effect only after the end of his six-year term of
office in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"I am more interested in economic reforms because these impact
on our daily lives. Political revisions can wait until after my
term ends," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was also giving the Preparatory Commission on
Constitutional Reforms until early 2000 to study and formulate
recommendations on possible amendments to the 1987 Charter.
</P>
<P>
"We will make proper consultations. We want our Constitution
amended, because it has obsolete provisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the work of the Preparatory Commission on
Constitutional Reforms, he said: "This should give the constituent
assembly proposed reforms or discussions, and save it from more
studies and debate."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the constituent assembly would be
able to finish its work early so that the people could ratify the
proposed reforms in a plebiscite, to be scheduled simultaneously
with the 2001 Congress elections.

<HEADLINE> Angola Adopts Floating Exchange Rate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government decided
Saturday to adopt a floating exchange rate system to replace the
fixed one the country has been using for over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Aguinaldo Jaime, governor of the Angolan National Bank, said
Friday when he announced the decision that the reason for the new
system is that the country's foreign reserve is "on the brink of
exhaustion", and thus Angola cannot afford to keep a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
In medium or long terms, the measure will bring positive
influence on the country's economy, as the bank can purchase the
much-needed foreign exchange for the government and adjust the
deposit of its own currency, the kwanza, Jaime noted.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, he said, is that through the new system
the central bank will be able to offer loans to the development
programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Fixed rate system has been in use ever since 1975, when the

<P>
The scientists, together with their international colleagues,
are searching for proof for their theory that the Marburg virus is
the first to have been transmitted by animals to human beings.
</P>
<P>
One theory has it that AIDS was transmitted by a monkey to a
human, who then spread it all over the world. Ebola, too, is
suspected of having been passed on in a chain of eight or nine
viral generations.
</P>
<P>
If the transmitters of the Marburg virus prove to be animals
which can live and reproduce while carrying it, this will have
been the first time in documented history that so many victims
were infected by animals rather than by other humans.
</P>
<P>
Marburg is a town in Germany where the deadly virus was first
documented in 1967. Scientists making a vaccine had handled
monkeys in order to cultivate their cells.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 people have become infected with Marburg fever
virus, and nine died.

<HEADLINE> Manila Welcomes MILF's Acceptance of Peace Talks Venue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Saturday welcomed the acceptance by the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) of a government condition to hold their
peace talks in Philippine territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his weekly radio-TV program "JEEP ni Erap", Estrada
reiterated that the peace talks should take place in the
Philippines, because it is an internal problem of the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is good that they have been enlightened on the issue. My
administration will not allow holding the talks abroad. The
problem is here; so we should solve it here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was open to having the government and the MILF
hold the peace talks in the main southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"I see no problem with that, so long as the talks are held in
Philippine territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is one of two rebel groups now negotiating peace with
the government. The other is the National Democratic Front.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MILF insisted on holding peace talks with the
government in a "neutral country." But the Estrada administration
stood pat on its position that the negotiations take place in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada said he would let Congress decide on a
proposal by Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Governor
Nur Misuari to postpone the elections scheduled for this September
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Misuari has claimed the ARMM elections should come after a
plebiscite that will determine the coverage of an expanded ARMM.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to Congress to determine the proper action, if it is
really lawful or not," Estrada said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees More Foreign Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- There were 121,550 overseas
visitor arrivals during April this year, a five-percent increase
over the same month last year, official figures showed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Acting Government Statistician Dianne
Macaskill said overseas visitor arrivals had increased for the
eighth consecutive month, adding that this April saw more visitors
from Asia, but fewer from Australia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Australia, which is New Zealand's most important source country
for international visitors, contributed one in three of all
short-term visitor arrivals in the month. Visitors from Australia
have increased by 86 percent over the last 10 years and in 1998
alone, New Zealand saw more than 500,000 arrivals of Australian
visitors.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, opposing trends in long-term arrivals
and departures are continuing. In the year ending April 1999,
there were 56,740 arrivals, down about one-third on the 1996
figure of 81,210. In contrast, long-term departures rose from
46,180 in the year ending April 1995 to 67,430 in the year ending
April 1999, a rise of 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending April 1999, long-term departures
exceeded long-term arrivals by 10,700. This is a significant
turnaround from net gains of 19,370 and 2,020 in the previous two
years.

</P>
<P>
The proposals include a call to nations to publish a legal

</P>
<P>
Mwencha said that the strategy would immensely benefit the

ZEGRAB -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman proposed Thursday
that the international community should find a solution to the
Kosovo crisis acceptable to all parties concerned.

<P>
He called for an end to the Balkan war that has caused severe
economic losses to many countries. Tudjman, who made the proposal
when meeting with some foreign ambassadors to Croatia, according
to the Croatian Broadcasting Television, noted that a settlement
of the Kosovo issue should take into account the fact that Kosovo,
a Serbian province that is mostly populated by ethnic Albanians
who have been seeking for independence, is the historical cradle

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Fighting Continues Amid Impending Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting continued Thursday in
Sierra Leone before a hardly-earned truce could take effect next
Monday, the country's state radio confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The west Africa peace-keeping force or ECOMOG had come under
severe attack by rebel forces in the country's eastern town of
Kenema, an important diamond-producing area, and Port Loko just
north of Freetown, the country's capital, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were repulsed by ECOMOG force after incurring heavy
looses, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Kabbah supported by the
Nigeria-led ECOMOG forces signed a cease-fire accord with the
rebels Tuesday in theTogolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire is to last while envoys from both sides could
start direct negotiations in Lome for a comprehensive peace accord
ending the country's eight-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the rebels have been stepping up
their efforts of controlling more land especially in the diamond
mining area to gain more weight in the U.N.-sponsored negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had earlier flown President Kabbah and rebel
leaders to Lome to kick off the much-desired peace talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy Jesse Jackson also
reportedly flew to Lome with Kabbah to join the talks.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Foday Sankoh and his guerrilla leadership had
earlier held internal talks on their uniformed stands in Lome over
the past three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Obasanjo Facing Tough Challenges Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A few days to the handing over of
power from military to civilian, President-elect General Olusegun
Obasanjo is scheduled to be sworn in as the president of the
Fourth Republic of Nigeria on May 29.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Nigeria will be a democracy by noon of that
day, bringing an end to the 16 years of uninterrupted military
rule in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo has pledged to run "an open, fair and transparent
government" throughout his four-year tenure last March after he
won the February 27 presidential election on the ticket of the
People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that General Obasanjo, who regained power
after he handed over the power to an elected government in 1979,
would face tough challenges to realize his campaign promise of
"revitalizing the Nigerian state and once again put a smile on the
faces of our long suffering people."
</P>
<P>
They noted that to promote the ideals of democracy, national
unity and good governance, the in-coming government of Obasanjo
must tackle the following main challenges:
</P>
<P>
Confidence building: Many Nigerians have lost faith in either
military or civilian governments because of the persisting failure
of previous administrations to deliver the good life to the
people.
</P>
<P>
Governance change: As Nigeria has been under military rule for
about 30 years since its independence in 1960, the due process of
civil society and the rule of law has been undermined, thus
weakening key institutions like the civil service, judiciary and
the police.
</P>
<P>
Poverty Alleviation: More than 65 percent of Nigerians are
living below the poverty line and with the increasing gap between
the few rich and many poor, poverty alleviation can no longer be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
Corruption combat: Corruption is one cankerworm that has eaten
deep into the fabric of the Nigerian society and Nigeria was
recently ranked by Transparency International, a non-governmental
watchdog, as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Debt relief: As at the end of 1998, the stock of public
external debt recorded 28.8 billion U.S. dollars and Nigeria's
ratio of debt/GDP (gross domestic product) is 70 percent. It is
practically impossible for Nigeria to achieve growth unless the
burden is substantially reduced.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure improvement: Energy and electricity supply has
increasingly worsened in recent years, leading to huge negative
impact on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Niger Delta crisis solution: Oil production has left large
parts of the Niger Delta region polluted, making it difficult for
local farmers and fishermen to earn a legitimate living from their
traditional occupations.
</P>
<P>
So, many Nigerians doubt whether the in-coming government will
be able to deliver the promise of democracy as General Obasanjo is
seen as "part of the muddle of the past and a likely pawn in the
hands of the military."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it is essential for the Obasanjo
government to take deliberate measures to get Nigeria out of the
woods, especially in the first 100 days of his administration.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo needs to swiftly embark on measures to empower
civil institutions to resume their responsibilities and to carry
out reforms of the military and the law enforcement agencies, and
to repeal all legislations which inhibit democracy, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, the president-elect confidently said at his first
press conference after his election victory that he would restore
the dignity of Nigeria, revive the civil institutions and
reinvigorate the battered economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria had for too long had governments of
"deception and oppression" which have never lived up to their
promises.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo pledged that his first business when he takes
over the reins of government would be to reconcile the Nigerians,
heal their wounds and restore the people's trust in the
government.
</P>
<P>
He promised to lead by example to fight corruption,
professionalize the military and revitalize the economy, and urged
Nigerians to look ahead positively and work hard to turn Nigeria
into the real giant of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, General Obasanjo noted that democracy is a
process, not an event, adding that after so many years of
non-democratic governance, Nigerians have acquired a number of
undemocratic attitude and it would take time to effect the change
of attitude.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the president-elect has asked Nigerians not to expect
miracle from him or think that the country's problems would be
wiped out overnight.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Nigeria, out-going Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar predicted on the occasion of his recent
meeting with National Assembly (parliament) members-elect that the
Fourth Republic of Nigeria would be stable.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ugandan Currency Plunges Against Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan currency shilling has
experienced an unprecedented depreciation of 18.9 percent against
the U.S. dollar over the past 10 months, making the local foreign
exchange market much more volatile than ever.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the two currencies stood at 1,230
shillings to one dollar last July when the new fiscal year
started. But it plummeted to a record low of 1,520 shillings to
one dollar by the end of April this year, triggering more and
fresh concerns over the stability of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
In response to public pressure, the Bank of Uganda, the
country's central bank , has pumped large sums of hard-earned
foreign exchange into the market to rescue the falling shilling,
but failed to save it from dropping to the rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
The off-season coffee, fish ban by the European Union, delayed
fund from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and insecurity in
the region are widely held responsible for the sharp shilling
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Coffee exports, which account for some 60 percent of Uganda's
foreign exchange earnings, have been on the decline over this
period.
</P>
<P>
In April alone, the coffee exports nose-dived to 173,031 bags
(50 kilograms per bag) from the previous level of 288,033 bags,
representing a decline of 40 percent in volume. The coffee
returns dropped by 43 percent to 13.45 million dollars in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority, coffee prices in the international market
have been low because of the sharp increase in Brazil's coffee
exports.
</P>
<P>
The fish ban imposed by the Ugandan government and the EU
respectively helped make the scarcity of dollar a sure thing in
the money market.
</P>
<P>
Since fish poisoning was discovered in Lake Victoria in March
this year, the government banned fish sales in the domestic
markets, followed by the EU ban of fish product exports from the
region.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been the largest buyer of Uganda's fish products. In
the wake of the EU fish ban, Uganda loses one million dollars each
week.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the IMF and other donors delayed their funding to
Uganda, saying the country's defense spending is shooting up to "a
dangerously high level."
</P>
<P>
The defense budget of this financial year was 150 million
dollars, some 2.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product,
while the prescribed rate should be 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other multilateral financial institutions providing
fund to Uganda have urged the Ugandan government to slash the
defense spending and this was set as a precondition to their
further funding to this fund- thirsty country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has delayed 18 million dollars pledged to the country
so far this year. Other donors made similar demands.
</P>
<P>
Under the mounting pressures from this donors, the Ugandan
leaders have to agree to reduce the defense spending in the next
fiscal year to 121 million dollars and to earmark all the donated
money for the top priority areas like health, education and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Insecurity in the country and the region as a whole is also to
blame for the weakening shilling. The spilling war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, frenzy rebel attacks on soft targets
and the recent spate of bombings in capital Kampala are the key
causes of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
This increasing insecurity has scared away prospective
investors and sent foreign investors drawing money from banks to
deposit it in a third country.
</P>
<P>
The safety concern acted as the prime killer to the country's
young but booming tourist industry. The Bwindi massacre in early
March this year, in which eight foreign tourists were killed by
Rwandan Hutu extremists, almost brought the business of tourist
agents to a standstill. Lots of foreign tourists have called to
cancel their planned trips to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the free fall of shilling, the central bank did not
hesitate to come to its rescue. In April, it injected a total of
25.6 million dollars to calm the market and in early May another
eight million dollars were sold out to stabilize the shilling. But
these efforts did not reverse the falling trend of the currency.
</P>
<P>
Senior economists and officials with the central bank said at a
press conference Thursday that with the coming of another coffee
season at the end of this month, coffee exports would recover and
the demand for dollar would naturally be brought down.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the shilling would gain against the dollar
very soon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Demands Probe Result of NATO's Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government should
inform China of the result of the investigation into the recent
attack on the Chinese embassy to Yugoslavia at an earlier date, a
Chinese diplomat said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiaoming, minister of the Chinese Embassy to the United
States, said the U.S. government should speed up the probe into
the raid on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and make the result
public swiftly to meet all demands of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
On May 7, NATO forces used five missiles to hit the Chinese
embassy to Yugoslavia at different angles, killing three Chinese
correspondents, injuring more than 20 Chinese diplomatic personnel
and destroying the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
The attack has triggered anger and strong condemnation not only
from the Chinese government and people, but also from over 120
other countries in the world, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said many Americans, the congressmen and congresswomen in
particular, feel that the Chinese government's demands are
reasonable and that the U.S. government should comprehensively
inform the result of the investigation of the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
China, Liu said, attaches importance to the development of the
Sino-U.S. relationship. "NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy not
only hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, but also damaged
China-U.S. ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. is sincere in improving and developing Sino-U.S.
relations, it should thoroughly, comprehensively and fairly probe
into the missile attack so as to win trust from the Chinese
government and people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu also bitterly criticized U.S. media for their biased and
distorted coverage of the attack on the Chinese embassy, saying
that what they are doing is whitewashing the incident and help the
U.S. government shirk responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Surrender to Ugandan Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 120 armed rebels of the
Uganda National Rescue Front II (UNRFII) have surrendered to the
army following a peace initiative by the government, a security
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Oya Nahori, an official in charge of rebel training programs in
the northwestern West Nile region, was quoted by Saturday's New
Vision as saying over the weekend that the former rebels under Ali
Bamuze are currently undergoing a rehabilitation course in Arua
District.
</P>
<P>
The rebels turned up at various army installations and local
council units in the area for the last one month. They came from
Sudan where they had been operating, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among those who surrendered was a major who served in the Obote
II government and a former government army captain identified only
as Yasin, the report added.
</P>
<P>
At the center, the trainees were given basic knowledge on how
to re- integrate in the society and vocational skills to enable
them to earn a decent living. They also had the option of joining
the army.
</P>
<P>
The government, in conjunction with local councils, recently
set up "Aringa Peace Initiative" to facilitate the return of armed
opposition groups operating from the West Nile Region.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the initiative could also cover other
rebel groups in Kitgum, Gulu and other parts in the north.
</P>
<P>
During his recent tour of the northern region, President Yoweri
Museveni extended amnesty to rebels and their leaders who would
like to surrender to the government. This is another move by the
government to pacify the region subject to frequent rebel attacks.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Gulf Rapproachement not to Affect UAE Stand: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UAE has no reservations about improving ties with Iran by
some of its fellow Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, but the
Iranians might misinterpret this move, UAE's Minister of
Information and Culture Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan was
quoted on Saturday by the official WAM news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran and UAE have been been at odds over the sovereignty of the
three islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs which are
located near strategic shipping lanes in the Gulf. The islands are
currently under the control of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The misinterpretation might add to Iranians' intransigence
against the UAE's repeated calls for a peaceful settlement of the
issue through dialog or international arbitration, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran always claims that the issue was just a
misunderstanding, but we see in reality that the issue is far
from what Tehran was claiming," the official said.
</P>
<P>
A series of high-level visits between Iran and GCC members
Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain recently have brighten the
prospect of improving relations between Iran and its former foes
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been uneasy over the rapproachement with Iran
by the three GCC members while its dispute with Iran remains
unsolved. The GCC also includes Kuwait and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Buy Crude Oil from Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will purchase an extra
20,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Oman, which in turn will
take an equity holding in the Thai refinery sector and use crude
terminals there, the Thai Industry Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a news release available here Saturday
that the agreement was reached by Thai Industry Minister Suwat
Liptapanlop and visiting Oman Minister of Oil and Gas, Mohammed
Bin Hamad Al Rumphy.
</P>
<P>
The Oman minister, currently in Thailand for a visit, said the
cooperation between the two countries over the direct purchase of
crude oil is to start early next year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai minister was quoted by the release as saying the
direct purchase of crude oil would be conducted on a
government-to-government basis.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000 barrels of crude oil will be purchased directly from
Oman instead of being conducted through trading firms to help
reduce import costs.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently imports 60,000-70,000 barrels of crude oil
every day for its six refineries, which have a combined capacity
of round 800,000 barrels per day. Of the total, around 250,000
barrels per day or 30 percent come from Oman.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up 13,500 Community Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will set up 13,500
community clinics in the rural areas within five years starting
from this year, with a view to providing comprehensive health and
family planning services to the rural people.
</P>
<P>
Five hundred such community clinics will be established this
year, with 100 million taka (about 2.1 million U.S. dollars)
already allocated by the government for this purpose, The
Financial Express daily newspaper Saturday quoted a source of the
Health and Family Welfare Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's health and family planning program, one
clinic will cover 6,000 persons and provide the basic health
services. But depending on the geographic location and density of
population, the number may vary but it should not be more than
7,500 and fewer than 4,500 as it was decided by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Each clinic will be manned by two government health workers,
one female family welfare assistant and another male or female
health assistant, he said, adding that based on the need of the
rural people, these clinics will work as the "one-stop service
centers."
</P>
<P>
A policy of joint venture between the government and the
related community has been evolved to set up the clinics in order
to involve the rural people in the government's health and family
services. The ministry has already formulated a guideline in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The government will bear the cost of the construction work and
provide equipment, medicines, furniture and salaries of workers,
while the local community will have to give the land for the
clinics and they will also have to carry out the day-to-day and
long-term maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The government will allocate 150,000 taka (about 30,900
dollars) for the construction of each clinic and medical
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, general medical treatment, family planning,
immunization of children, antenatal care and other medical
services are provided by various agencies under various programs
and after the establishment of these clinics, these services will
be provided from there.

PHNOM PENH, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Foreign Ministry
sent a letter Friday to the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia protesting
against its rejection of a check on a shipment of weapon parts
said to have been mistakenly sent to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The spare parts for U.S.-made M-16 assault rifles was found in
a box Monday when the embassy and the Cambodian Mine Action Center
(CMAC) checked a shipment of medical equipment donated by the
United States to the CMAC, the local newspaper Rasmei Kampuchea
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"After this surprised discovery, the embassy staff collected
all the arms parts and transported them to the embassy without
allowing the Cambodian competent authorities to inspect these
weapons," the Foreign Ministry's letter said.
</P>
<P>
It was said that there were at least 10 similar boxes on the
spot, but the boxes were immediately taken into the U.S. Embassy
by embassy staff without opening.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry considers this action of the embassy's staff as a
grave disrespect to the Cambodian laws and regulations relating to
arms control and would like to urge the embassy to return
immediately those arms parts to the Ministry of Interior, so that
the Cambodian authorities can investigate thoroughly this
incident," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy explained later that the rifle parts were
meant to go to Thailand, but were mistakenly sent to Cambodia. And
it was said an apology was already made by the embassy.

<HEADLINE> More Parties in Indonesia Join Hands for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Three major political parties in
Indonesia -- the National Mandate Party (PAN), the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Justice Party (KP)-- joined hands
Friday as the general election nears.
</P>
<P>
A seven-point communique issued by the leaders of the three
parties pledged to join reform forces to block the so-called
pro-status quo groups led by the ruling Golkar Party, local
leading newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the joint communique, the parties said they will strive for
democratic, honest, fair and secure elections. They also pledged
to get rid of all anti-reform forces which they say are still
active.
</P>
<P>
"We need to straighten the reform programs because at present
there is a strong tendency toward deviation from the reform
movement," PK's spokesman Ismail said after a closed-door meeting
of the three parties.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said pro-status quo groups are "those maintaining
tyrannical regimes using arms and money and based on feudal
concepts of power and mass support.
</P>
<P>
PAN's chairman Amien Rais said the union aims to attract more
parties in the fight against the pro-status quo groups led by
Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Rais and other reform-minded politicians have launched an open
war against Golkar, once the political vehicle of former President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
PAN recently formed a coalition with the popular Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle and the National Awakening Party. The
coalition is widely seen as a massive front with strong grassroots
support and able to topple the Golkar.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, which had won six general elections when Soeharto
was in power, has split since Soeharto stepped down in May last
year. The party has nominated incumbent President B.J. Habibie as
presidential candidate for the election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 parties will contest the forthcoming election,
the first multi-party election in 30 years. The election will
elect 462 members to the 500-seat House of Representatives (DPR).
The remaining 38 seats will be reserved for the Armed Forces which
does not vote.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected DPR will form the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) together with 200 members nominated by the
president. The MPR, the highest legislative body, is expected to
hold a meeting to elect the next president and vice president in
November this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Banks' Rates Policy Arouses Criticism (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Thailand was plunged into recession two years ago, the
government sought financial help from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and adopted its policy of high interest rates in order
to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
The general lending rate was as high as 20 percent while fixed
deposit rates ranged between 10 percent and 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the rate paid on ordinary savings remained at 5 percent,
the level it had stayed at for about a decade.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the government reversed its interest rate policy
and lending rates rapidly declined to 9-10 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-deposit rates fell to 5 percent, the lowest level in
decades. And at the beginning of this year, the rate on ordinary
savings was reduced to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Somruk Permkamlangmuang, a 62-year-old pensioner, said people
like him relied heavily on interest income. He said he was worried
by the trend as he cannot afford to risk his money in shares or
other forms of investment.
</P>
<P>
Ammar Siamwalla, a senior economist at the Thailand Development
Research Institute, criticized the banks for punishing their good
customers by charging them higher rates as a means of subsidizing
non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
He urged the banking authorities to force banks to raise
sufficient equity capital from the market to meet loan-loss
provision requirements and cease passing the burden to their good
customers.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans, accounting for 47 percent of the total
outstanding loans of the banks in Thailand, have been a heavy
burden on the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Despite their earlier efforts of recapitalization, most banks
still face an uphill battle to raise capital necessary to cover
their loan losses.
</P>
<P>
As the target of public anger, banks here argued that while
deposit rates have been fallen to their lowest point in decades,
lending rates have also fallen sharply in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said lower deposit rates means those dependent on
interest income, such as retirees, will have less money to spend
and small depositors also are worse off from sinking rates since
they cannot access alternative investments such as stocks or
bonds.
</P>
<P>
However, for larger depositors, the falling returns available
from bank deposits could encourage investment and spending, which
are crucial for the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't lower interest rates, the economy won't recover.
But if rates fall too low, then consumption won't increase. The
task is to find a balance between the two," a local banker said.
</P>
<P>
In this case, a further fall of deposit rates is just a matter
of time. Bantoon, who is also president of Thai Farmers Bank,
admitted that he himself wasn't sure how long the freeze of
deposit rates by the four banks would be in place.
</P>
<P>
Now, the only way to get banks out of the dilemma is the
corporate debt restructuring process, whose acceleration,
according to Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, would help
improve the financial system, leading to a more appropriate and
balanced interest rate structure.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Banks' Rates Policy Arouses Criticism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Bankers' Association
announced Friday that Thailand's four biggest commercial banks
have agreed to maintain their deposit rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Bantoon Lamsam, chairman of the association, announced the
decision on the association's interest rates direction at a press
conference Friday, saying the four major banks, namely Bangkok
Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank,
agreed to the freeze.
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to be a compromise made by the banks under
mounting criticism that the industry has enjoyed too wide interest
margins.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, there have been calls among the banking sector
to reduce call savings and time deposit rates, which will be
accompanied by a fall in lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Bankers have said the call savings rate should come down from
about 4.5 percent to around 4 percent before any reduction in
lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Call savings affect millions of savers in the country and
account for the bulk of the banks' funding costs.
</P>
<P>
Time deposit rates have fallen to about the same level as call
savings rates and this is regarded as a major distortion of the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in the savings and deposit rates, the prime
lending rate is still kept high, ranging from 9 percent for some
big banks to 11.25 percent for others.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Thai Danu Bank took the lead by cutting
savings and deposit rates to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai Danu's move, accompanied by the anticipation of similar
actions by other commercial banks, has aroused deep concern among
ordinary savers and sparked strong criticism from experts.
</P>
<P>
The Law Society of Thailand had condemned commercial banks for
taking advantage of the public, a view shared by many bank
customers.
</P>
<P>
Many customers said banks are exploiting the public for cutting
deposit rates while keeping lending rates at "high" levels.
</P>
<P>
Bank clients said it is unfair for banks to ask customers to
make sacrifices to help banks obtain funds more cheaply, as
financial institutions created their own problems in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
Customers wondered if banks were colluding to cut deposit rates
and complained that there were few secure options available for
the ordinary savers.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Stability Expected in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress' clear
victory in the parliamentary elections indicates that the
much-awaited political stability will come for the Himalayan
kingdom, analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
The party repeated its feat in the general elections in May
1991 by securing a majority of 106 of the 196 declared seats in
the 205-member House of Representatives. The difference is that
this time political stability may set in for a longer period of
time.
</P>
<P>
First, the party looks more united than ever before. It may be
recalled that in the past years the party was almost split due to
differences between Party President and Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala and Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, another senior leader
of the party.
</P>
<P>
But Koirala held out the olive branch months before the
elections by offering the post-polls premiership to Bhattarai.
Truce between the two septuagenarian leaders undoubtedly
contributed to the party's good showing in the polls held on May 3
and May 17.
</P>
<P>
As the party is all set to form the next government, Koirala
reiterated Thursday that Bhattarai will be the new prime minister.
"I'm committed that the new prime minister should be Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai," he told the press. "I'll not go back on my
promise."
</P>
<P>
He said that as party president, he would extend every
cooperation to the prime minister. "In the future, you'll never
hear dissension in our party."
</P>
<P>
Second, the Nepali Congress would undoubtedly draw lessons from
the past. In the general elections in May 1991, the first in the
kingdom after the multi-party parliamentary system was restored in
1990, the party won a clear majority of 110 seats with three
elected independents joining in later.
</P>
<P>
However, the majority government led by Girija Prasad Koirala
could not complete its five-year term. It collapsed three years
later due to internal dissension.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-term polls in November 1994, the party was reduced
to second position in the parliament as some candidates rebelled.
</P>
<P>
Third, the Nepali Congress won a majority in the house not
because of its performance but due to the split of its arch rival
the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Nepali Congress had not done much to win the
voters' support, but it just benefited from the split of the
CPN-UML, which might otherwise have secured a majority in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Nepalese people are tired of the political
instability in the past four and half years which has seriously
hurt the country's development. The hung parliament produced in
the 1994 mid-term polls gave rise to six governments. Further
instability, needless to say, would be unpopular among the people.
</P>
<P>
There is every reason to believe that the Nepali Congress would
try to behave itself this time for the sake of itself as well as
the nation and the people.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Military Commands to Increase to 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces had
decided to increase the number of its regional military commands
from 11 to 17 to anticipate threats to security, The Jakarta Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The number of regional military commands being developed in
gradual stages was dependent upon the "strategic environment
situation, including national, global and regional surroundings...
particularly the national environment," Defense
Minister/Indonesian Defense Force (TNI) Chief Gen. Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of new military commands would help
servicemen "who have been united with local people" to be able to
anticipate any possible threats.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the new commands would take place in phases,
as the policy required detailed preparation of human resources,
tools and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
"We started the first one at the Pattimura Regional Military
Command (because) by coincidence the people in Maluku really
wanted a (separate) military command. We established it on May
15," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
According to a decree issued by Wiranto dated May 7, 1999, the
new commands will be set up in several areas currently supervised
by existing commands. The majority of new commands will be
established in Sumatera and Kalimantan islands.
</P>
<P>
TNI spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif told the Jakarta Post
that the military command restructuring was part of a series of
reforms in TNI, with a similar reorganization to be conducted in
the Navy and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The National Police is also restructuring its provincial
police, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Ambassador Praises Yugoslav Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban ambassador in Belgrade
praised the Yugoslav people's resistance against NATO's military
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Omar Medina was quoted by the Juventud Rebelde newspaper as
saying that Belgrade residents are calmly preparing to resist when
needed, and it is said there will be a general mobilization in
case of an overland attack.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavs want a peaceful solution, but at the same time, they
will defend their sovereignty, territorial integrity and
historical and cultural values," said Medina.
</P>
<P>
The whole world deplores the intensification of the bombing
attacks against Belgrade, especially on civilian targets, the
Cuban ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The most recent example was the bombing of the maternity
hospital in Dediuje last Wednesday, which was surrounded by
housing units and several diplomatic installations; the attack
left three dead and many pregnant mothers injured.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat also said the attack had broken several glass
panes in the Cuban embassy's kitchen, which is located 300-meters
from the maternity hospital.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Reorganizes Private Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has stopped
issuing licenses for new private universities and colleges as a
first step to reorganize the private education sector, Vietnam's
English daily Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sector's emergence over the last five years has brought
about positive changes in meeting the needs of urban students, but
a lack of guidelines on its operation has generated several
problems, said Vietnam News.
</P>
<P>
One major problem is that the proliferation of private
universities and colleges is far exceeding actual demand with many
providing very low-quality education.
</P>
<P>
Since the Vietnamese government approved the founding of
private educational institutions in 1994, as many as 14
universities have been established, most of them in Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City. These universities and colleges have 65,400
students.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a lecturer at the Ho Chi Minh City Public
University of Technology as saying private universities and
colleges have increased the size and diversity of their courses
five or six times, especially in foreign languages, business
management and informatics.
</P>
<P>
Apart from stopping licensing of new private universities and
colleges, all students wanting to study at these schools now will
be required to sit for entrance examinations, said an official of
the ministry's department of higher education.
</P>
<P>
The state and relevant ministries will intensify measures to
manage and supervise operations of the private institutions and
improve the quality of training offered by them, added the
official.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Surplus Falls 8.9 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government reported a
surplus of 113.5 billion U.S. dollars last month, 8.9 percent
lower than the 124.6-billion-dollar one posted in April 1998, the
Treasury Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
April is the month that people face the deadline to pay their
income taxes. In 1997 and 1998, record surpluses for April
provided lawmakers with an unexpected windfall.
</P>
<P>
The April surplus helped congressional and White House
negotiators reach agreement in 1997 on a five-year plan to balance
the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the lack of an April surprise this year, the
Clinton administration and congressional accountants are still
predicting a bigger surplus, between 79 billion and 111 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We are on track to reach the largest annual budget surplus
ever," said President Clinton in a statement. But he added, "
Despite the good news, this is not a time for complacency."
</P>
<P>
One reason for the lower April surplus this year, as compared
to last April, was a nearly 59 percent increase in tax refunds, to
36.6 billion dollars. That reflects the new 400 dollars per child
credit and new credits for higher education as well as the
increasing popularity of electronic filing and direct deposit,
which offer speedier refunds than paper tax returns and paper
checks.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Minister Proposes to Shoot Down Drug-Trafficking Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Justice Minister Renan Calheiros
said Friday that he favors shooting down aircraft that invaded the
Brazilian air space with "clearly illicit intentions" of drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking is a transnational crime that permeates
borders, "and I advise to down aircraft that invade the Brazilian
air space with clearly illicit intentions, and I advocate
rewarding denouncers, pardoning or reducing their penalties,"
Calheiros said.
</P>
<P>
The minister asked the congress to reward denouncers, imprison
drug traffickers for life and penally discriminate between
producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the legislators to modify the penitentiary
system, "to prevent simple consumers from coexisting in the
prisons with dangerous drug traffickers," and to permit the
elimination of the bank secret in the case of suspicious persons.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Brazilian Information Center on Psychotropic Drugs,
Calheiros noted that 20,000 people died in Brazil in 1997 as
victims of chemical dependency, including cases of overdoses,
suicides and assassinations.
</P>
<P>
The minister also briefed the congress on the latest drug
seizure development, saying that the federal police have seized
two tons of cocaine so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the federal police have captured 95 tons of
marihuana, two tons of LSD, and some hashish and heroin. Drug
traffickers detained since 1998 reached 22,000.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the federal police this year will increase from
74 million dollars in 1998 to 81 million, he said.

JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The All Indonesia Soccer Federation
(PSSI) Friday announced the names of the 23 players to compete for
the country in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei
Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
PSSI coach and team manager Bernhard Schumm selected six

</P>
<P>
The SEA Games squad will start its training program on May 31,
after its junior players, which are included in the pre-Olympics
soccer team, return from South Korea after competing in the
prequalifying round for the Sydney Olympic Games, Tondo was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The pre-Olympic soccer team, comprising players under 23,
leaves Jakarta on Saturday and will return before the May 31
training.
</P>
<P>
In the SEA Games draw, Indonesia is in Group B together with
Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Brazil's Sao Paulo

The volume traded in Rio was some 8.64 million U.S. dollars

Analysts said the sharp decline of the Brazil stocks was caused

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's State Banks Told to Recover Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
ordered state banks to recover 45 trillion rupiah (5.6 billion
U.S. dollars) of their problem loans this year by focusing on
their 125 largest debtors, The Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri
Abeng said that under the new loan workout strategy, total problem
loans (all categories) at four state banks should fall from 98.9
trillion rupiah as of the end of March to 53.9 trillion rupiah by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
The four state banks are Bank Negara Indonesia, Bank Mandiri,
Bank Tabungan Negara and Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this target, we plan to complete the restructuring
of problem loans of the 125 largest groups of debtors, which have
total obligations (to state banks) of 24.3 trillion rupiah," Tanri
said.
</P>
<P>
To maximize loan recovery, state banks will be required to form
special loan recovery units, supported by improved systems, clear
loan restructuring plans and qualified human resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition to loan recovery, Tanri said, the restructuring of
state banks also covers efforts to improve the banks' risk
management, business strategy, operating efficiency through cost
restructuring, organizational efficiency and accounting management
systems.
</P>
<P>
Only after the banks meet all the targets on restructuring
measures, will the government start recapitalizing them.
</P>
<P>
The government expects to complete the recapitalization of Bank
Negara Indonesia, Bank Rakyat Indonesia and Bank Tabungan Negara
by September and Bank Mandiri by year-end.
</P>
<P>
Tanri said state banks were expected to return the government's
recapitalization-funds in stages, starting in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Warm temperatures and drought are
being blamed for the plant disease and insect pests that have been
plaguing 200,000 hectares of trees in central China's Hunan
Province for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The affected area is expected to rise to 267,000 hectares in
June, tripling that of the same period last year, according to
Zhang Jian, director of the Forestry Protection Dvision of the
Hunan Provincial Forestry Department.
</P>
<P>
Many months of warm temperatures have provided favorable
conditions for the growth of insect pests, and the drought that
hit some parts of the province earlier this year has exacerbated
the problem, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
A great number of trees throughout Hunan have been affected by
pine-needle brown-spot and caterpillar diseases, and trees in
Dongkou and Jingzhou counties in southwestern Hunan have been
killed by these diseases and insects.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has issued a circular calling for
effective measures to fight against the plant disease and pests,
and airplanes will be used to spray pesticide in the cities of
Chenzhou, Yongzhou, Changde, and Shaoyang.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Senator Piedad
Cordoba de Castro, of the opposition Liberal Party, was kidnapped
Friday in Medellin, the capital of the Antioquia department, by a
group of unidentified gunmen, local authorities said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian congresswoman was kidnapped in El Poblado, a high-
income residential sector in the southeast of the city.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted eyewitnesses as saying that at least
15 men grabbed Cordoba inside a clinic where she was visiting
someone in the exclusive neighborhood of El Poblado.
</P>
<P>
Cordoba is a member of a congressional peace commission and has
reportedly met several times with leaders of a leftist rebel group
over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Media reports also quoted the kidnappers as saying that the
taking of Cordoba was intended to send a "peace message" to the
government.
</P>
<P>
After a stalemate of several months, peace negotiations between
the government and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) resumed earlier this month.

ZEGRAB, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
proposed Thursday that the international community should find a
solution to the Kosovo crisis acceptable to all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
He called for an end to the Balkan war that has caused severe
economic losses to many countries.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman made the proposal when meeting with some foreign
ambassadors to Croatia, according to the Croatian Broadcasting
Television.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a settlement of the Kosovo issue should take into
account the fact that Kosovo, a Serbian province that is mostly
populated by ethnic Albanians who have been seeking for
independence, is the historical cradle of the nation of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
A solution to the conflict should be acceptable to all parties
involved, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO began air attacks against Yugoslavia on March 24,
transportation through Yugoslavia to neighboring countries has
been cut and an exodus of Kosovar refugees crossed Yugoslav
borders, causing a lot of social problems and economic losses to
the nearby countries.

<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
will cut its overnight borrowing and lending rates by another 12.5
basis points to 9.875 percent and 11.875 percent respective
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here Saturday, the central bank said
that this is the 15th time this year it adjusted the rates
downward in order to "help sustain the recovery of the stock
market and encourage the resumption of credit growth."
</P>
<P>
The cumulative reduction the central bank made since the start
of this year totals 350 basis points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the lower overnight rates are expected to
provide more money supply to fuel economic activities.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it was possible to reduce its key rates
further due to the absence of inflationary pressure and despite
its rate cut, capital inflow will remain strong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government has
decided to develop tourism in its southern states, Sports and
Tourism Minister Rafael Greca said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Greca said the federal and state governments, and the
Interamerican Development Bank will invest 1.5 million dollars to
develop tourism in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, Santa
Catarina and Mato Grosso do Sul.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to recover tourism industry in the southern region,
mainly in the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) region, where
privileged beaches, El Pantanal (marshlands) and the Foz de Iguazu
waterfalls are located, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The south of the country is very beautiful and needs more
investments to better exploit local tourism, which has much to
offer," Greca said.
</P>
<P>
Four million foreign tourists visited Brazil last year, who
provided 3.6 billion dollars in hard currency for the country.

COPENHAGEN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Shuttlers from hosts Denmark and
China each claimed two places in the women's singles semi-finals
event of the World Badminton Championships here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players who made the semi-finalists were second
seed Gong Ruina and fourth seed Dai Yun while third seed Camilla
Martin and eighth seed Mette Sorensen notched up the other two
places for Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Gong Ruina, winner in Swedish Open earlier this year, continued
her wining streak at the tournament, beating Hartono Cindana of
Indonesia 11-3 and 11-2 in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her compatriot Dai Yun had a hard fight in the
quarter-finals, rallied back from first set down to beat Lee Kyung
Won of South Korea 6-11, 11-5, 11-7.
</P>
<P>
Only after the first set could Dai Yun, who injured her right
thigh in a third round match against Lidya Djaelawidjaya of
Indonesia on Wednesday, find back her form and took two sets in a
row for the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I had to fight pain and tiredness in the match," said Dai Yun,
who had a immediate therapy of her injury after she left the court.
</P>
<P>
Camilla, top favourite from the host country, continued to
enjoy an easy path en route to her goal of the gold medal Friday
evening when she beat Zhang Ning 11-9, 11-7 in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I have been enjoying the tournament now," said Martin, who
lost to China's Dai Yun in the women's singles at the Sudirman Cup
final last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I have relaxed and played better and better in the
championships," she added.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Mette Sorensen scored a hard-fought victory in the
quarter-finals, beating Welsh Kelly Morgan 9-11, 13-10, 11-8.

<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Dannish and Chinese shuttlers
have displayed their power in the men's singles event by sharing
the semi-final berths at the World Badminton Championships.
</P>
<P>
After the quarter-finals Friday evening, Dannish shuttlers
secured two medals of the championships through world number one
Peter Gade Christensen and Olympic gold medal winner Poul-erik
Hoyer Larsen while Sun Jun of China and Fung Permadi of Chinese
Taipei shared the other two places.
</P>
<P>
Gade, a top favourite for the gold, defeated his teammate
defending champion Peter Rasmussen 15-3, 15-13 and Larsen roared
from first set down to beat H. Hendrawan of Indonesia 8-15, 15-4,
15-4.
</P>
<P>
However, another Dannish did not have such fortune when Kenneth
Jonassen, who made his debut top eight places at world
championships, lost Fung Permadi of Chinese Taipei 15-13, 12-15
and 15-10.
</P>
<P>
"Jonasson did not have patience in the last set," said Permadi,
who formerly a famous Indonesian shuttler.
</P>
<P>
China's Sun Jun, runner-up at the 1997 world championships in
Glasgow, overplayed another Dannish Thomas Stuer-Laudridsen in the
quarter-final, winning the match at 15-5, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
When leading the second set at 13-9, Sun Jun slowed down his
pace which allowed experienced Stuer-Laudridsen to trail the score
to 13-all.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial moment, Sun Jun managed to find back his form
and took the match with two points in a run.
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, Sun Jun was in no way satisfied with his
performance. "I could not concentrate in the second set in which I
could not attack at the net," he said. "I am lucky to win as he
had too many errors in the match," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals on Saturday, Sun Jun will meet Stuer-
Laudridsen and Gade faces Permadi.
