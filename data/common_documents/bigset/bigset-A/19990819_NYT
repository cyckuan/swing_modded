<P>
   When developers ask for approval to build their Wonderful World
of Oz theme park in Johnson County, Kan., they might have to agree
to 47 pages of requirements proposed by county planners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The requirements say ``no'' to gambling and adult entertainment,
``yes'' to marinas and ``maybe'' to fireworks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson County Commission will vote on the proposed
requirements next Thursday (8-26). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   County planners drafted regulations for resort and entertainment
developments with the Wonderful World of Oz in mind and got
comments from the developers. But the requirements would apply to
any similar project, said Dean Palos, a county planner handling the
Oz matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Oz Entertainment Co., based in Los Angeles, proposes
building a $771 million theme park and resort at what is now the
Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant. The company is negotiating with
federal and state officials to buy the plant's 9,065 acres in
exchange for ridding the land of its environmental hazards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In drafting the requirements, planners wanted to strengthen the
county's current theme-park zoning regulations in anticipation of
the Oz project. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before building, a developer would have to obtain a conditional
use permit that would come with 30 pages of new stipulations and
restrictions _ in addition to 17 pages of existing requirements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the requirements would allow the county to be
proactive in zoning the land and allow the Oz company to know what
is expected, Palos said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The County Planning Commission approved the requirements July
27. Since then, the requirements were changed slightly to
incorporate suggestions from the Oz company, a county resident,
some Planning Commission members, a zoning board member and county
staff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations would lay out what steps Oz would have to
take to win approval, including presenting a plan to the county and
agreeing to the land-use requirements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposed provisions: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The theme park could have special lighting effects _ such as
sky beacons, laser lights, searchlights and fireworks _ with
approval of the fire marshal. The developer would have to submit a
plan for special lighting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The development could not include adult entertainment; bingo
or any other gaming establishment; a car wash; pawnshops; or gun
sales. Oz developers have not proposed those businesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Buildings could not stand more than 150 feet tall, or as
recommended by the county's zoning administrator and approved by
the commission. Oz said the building requirements were too
restrictive. The proposed requirement was not changed, however. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --A quarter of the development would have to be open space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --]Lighting at the development ``should present an inviting
atmosphere'' but not be visible to residential areas. The
regulations spell out 11 provisions to ensure the lighting is
``festive'' and to buffer surrounding areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The park must have a 25-foot landscape buffer between it and
public right-of-way. Oz has said it plans a generous buffer between
the development and surrounding areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The permit would last for 10 years. Oz asked that it last for
up to 30 years, but that is a provision the commission would have
to approve, Palos said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --All environmental contamination would have to be cleaned up
before building permits would be issued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The permit would apply to the 1,750 acres on which the Oz
company plans to build its resort, Palos said. Plans call for
building the 55-acre theme park, a hotel with conference center
space, a golf course and an RV park on that acreage. &QL;

SOWARD SOUNDS OFF ON DROPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward criticized
himself Wednesday over his inconsistent performance in training
camp, which has been marked by a flurry of dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done anything. I'm not even good. I feel like I'm
sorry right now,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has dropped balls with regularity and finally lost his
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should let the freshmen start a couple practices,''
Soward said. ``I'm not playing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward said his problems stem from thinking about making big
plays in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do too much. I'm thinking about scoring before
catching the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the team's first practice in pads, Soward had several
outbursts _ some directed at the defense. On one play, defensive
back Kris Richard grabbed Soward by the face mask and tossed him to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were grabbing my face mask. Throwing me down. Maybe it's
the way they're taught defense,'' Soward said. ``I'm not going to
cry about it. I can't call (a penalty).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Freshman recap: So which of the freshmen will not redshirt?
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers Marcell Allmond, Kareem Kelly and Steve
Stevenson, cornerback Darrell Rideaux and defensive tackle Bernard
Riley will all play this season. Whether offensive lineman Lenny
Vandermade or linebacker Aaron Graham redshirt is not decided.
</P>
<P>
   But one player who is opening eyes is linebacker Omar Nazel. He
might be playing himself out of a redshirt year, depending on USC's
depth at weakside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   __ Steele update: Another day passed without any change on
linebacker Markus Steele's status. He's waiting for his JC
transcripts to be forwarded to USC.
</P>
<P>
   __ Position change: Redshirt freshman Anthony Daye has been
switched from linebacker to defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   __ Guards set: Hackett said Donta Kendrick is firmly entrenched
as the starter at left guard. There's a battle taking place at
right guard, where senior Jason Grain and freshman Zach Wilson are
the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   __ Making an impact: One player who has been a pleasant surprise
is sophomore Lonnie Ford, who is splitting time with Kori Dickerson
at defensive end. Ford was a tight end his first two seasons, until
requesting a position change last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm in a situation where I can go out and play. I can
surprise a lot of people this season,'' Ford said. ``There was no
use for me to be on offense. I wasn't really making any plays.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Linebacker Jason Steen suffered a neck injury
and underwent X-rays Tuesday afternoon. USC coach Paul Hackett did
not think the injury was serious. . . . Defensive tackle Aaron
Williams suffered a sprained ankle and might be out two days. . . .
Offensive tackle Brent McCaffrey (punctured foot) returned to
practice and appeared fine. . . . Offensive tackle Matt Welch
missed practice with a sore shoulder.

FIRST AMERICAN AGREES TO BUY OLATHE TITLE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First American Title Insurance Co., the largest title insurer in
the country, has agreed to acquire Security Land Title Co. of
Olathe, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition comes four months after First American
extended its market share in the area by purchasing the three
Guarantee Title operations in Johnson, Wyandotte and Leavenworth
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Security Land Title has 11 offices and about 210 employees, all
of whom will be retained, according to Jack Kerwin, Security Land
Title's president.
</P>
<P>
   Security Land Title, which was founded in 1974, is owned by
Kerwin, Ed Gomez, Terry Anderson and Bill Perry. Gomez is executive
vice president, Anderson is senior vice president, and Perry is
executive vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to operate as Security Land Title and
the four principals will remain in their management positions,
Kerwin said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be completed by Oct. 1, after reviews by
the U.S. Commerce Department and the Justice Department, Kerwin
said. He declined to give details of the deal, except to say it was
a stock transaction. Security had revenue of about $15 million last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Security had decided in the spring to solicit bids
for the company, Kerwin said, and received preliminary offers from
two other national firms. He said Security chose First American's
bid because of what it offered employees and because of its
resources to acquire technology.
</P>
<P>
   First American Title Insurance Co. is a subsidiary of First
American Financial of Santa Ana, Calif. The publicly traded parent
company has nearly 20,000 employees in more than 600 branch offices
in the United States and abroad and says it is the nation's leading
provider of business information. In addition to title insurance
and mortgage origination and servicing, it sells home warranties,
and performs credit reporting and other services.
</P>
<P>
   First American had net income of about $200 million last year on
revenue of $2.8 billion.

YOUNG CANCER PATIENT MAKES TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MHARI DOYLE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year ago, Michael Scherzer didn't have the strength to write
his own name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 8-year-old can write just about anything in flowing
cursive _ and he's really good at it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing is my favorite thing,'' Michael said quietly Wednesday
as he answered questions on a sheet titled ``To Know Me Is to Love
Me'' at Briarwood Elementary School in Olathe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1998, Michael was diagnosed with a rare form of
leukemia that doesn't respond well to chemotherapy. Because the
transplants severely weakened his immune system, Michael wasn't
allowed in large groups of people _ and that included most of his
first-grade year and all of second grade. Even his parents, Jeff
and Susan Scherzer, had to avoid contact with crowds. They couldn't
go to church, malls or social events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a year and a half filled with hospital stays and four
bone marrow transplants, Michael's cancer is in remission, and he's
finally back in school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, third-grade teacher Kathy Sanders
introduced him to his classmates, some of whom remembered him from
kindergarten and first grade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When she asked the class questions, Michael's hand shot up
almost every time. At recess, he played with friends he hadn't seen
for months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I treat him like everyone else,'' Sanders said. But, she
added, ``I want to...be sensitive to the fact that he's not been in
this environment for a while.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that despite having missed nearly two full grades
of classroom instruction, Michael is ``right where he needs to
be.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it was a long road for Michael, who has survived painful
surgeries, sickening medication and prolonged detachment from
schoolmates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The journey started shortly before May 28, 1998, when Michael
and his family, including his younger brother, Austin, went to
Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in St. Louis for his first
bone marrow transplant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of more than 3 million donors on file with the Heart of America
Bone Marrow Donor Registry, Susan Scherzer had the best match for
Michael's blood. But, as Michael said, ``it was too good,'' and his
body rejected the transplant, throwing him into a tailspin of
sickness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, the family searched for acceptable donors,
but found none. Briarwood staff and area parents raised about
$70,000 to offset the costs of bone marrow donor screening, which
costs $45 per person. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At school, his friends wrote letters of encouragement and hoped
for his early return. Blair Ryan, one of Michael's classmates, said
several children shaved their heads in support: ``I did it because
he didn't have much hair and he would be the only one.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the illness, Susan Scherzer said, her son never lost
hope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing about Michael is that he could be easily
distracted from everything that was going on,'' she said Tuesday.
``He could be throwing up for hours and then stop and play video
games for a long time. You knew he had that life in him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael said he doesn't remember much about his extended stays
in the hospital, but he said one of the worst parts was hospital
food. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite thing was tricking nurses,'' he said. He tried to
scare them by wrapping fake snakes around IV poles and surprise
them with noises from a whoopee cushion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late September 1998, doctors finally found that bone marrow
from Michael's aunt might work. He received his fourth transplant
from a bone-marrow bag with a note that read, ``Love, Aunt Jill.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It took,'' Susan Scherzer said as she hugged Michael closer to
her. ``The leukemia and the transplant are doing good, but
nothing's normal yet. We're still fighting infection.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael is battling a lung disease that attacks some transplant
patients, Scherzer said. To treat his lung problem, Michael had to
add steroids, which make his face puffy, to his lengthy list of
medicines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And while Michael was learning how to pronounce the names of his
medications, his former classmates were learning basic reading and
math skills. Michael was falling behind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, Olathe teacher Carol Sieber started tutoring him in
reading, writing and math. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had anyone who wanted to learn so badly,'' Sieber
said. ``You could see the eagerness and this bright shine in his
face that would glow when all of a sudden, he's got it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By July, Michael was reading at the fourth-grade level, writing
in cursive and mastering addition and subtraction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His handwriting started out very shaky,'' Sieber said. ``Now
he's got some of the most beautiful cursive I've seen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Michael even wrote a book, /{Michael's Favorite
Foods./} &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, he said, he's content playing video games, going to
school and staying away from hospitals. But, he added, he is
thinking about writing another book, /{How to Trick Your Nurse./} &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scherzer said she's happy to see her son start school again, but
she knows it will be hard to be away from him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' she said. ``I've had him
next to me this whole time. He's been my right foot!'' &QL;

WHETHER U.S. POWS WERE TRANSFERRED TO FORMER SOVIET UNION FOR
QUESTIONING IS UNANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now the idea is more Cold War fiction than fact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is the suspicion that American prisoners of war were taken
to the former Soviet Union for questioning during the Korean War. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union in 1989,
American officials could only speculate about what may have
happened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But since 1992, both American and Russian officials have been
working together to solve such mysteries, Major Gen. Vladimir A.
Zolotarev, member of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW//MIA
Affairs, said Wednesday during the Veterans of Foreign Wars
national convention in Bartle Hall in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission formed to exchange documents and information
about the fate of missing soldiers representing both Cold War
antagonists.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The task of our commission is to see that there are no unknown
soldiers, that their names should be known not only to God, but to
their fellow human beings,'' Zolotarev told the assembled
delegates. VFW veterans gave Zolotarev a standing ovation for his
statement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene that would have been hard to imagine just 10
years ago. But there was no objection to Zolotarev's presence, said
Bruce Harder, VFW director of national security and foreign
affairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It might seem odd that the VFW would invite a Russian officer
to speak, but because of the particular subject and the position he
holds, there has been no opposition,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, according to Zolotarev, since 1992 have passed
along more than 12,000 pages of documents, many of them formerly
classified. Such disclosures have helped shed light on the
circumstances of about 80 American servicemen who died during the
Korean War, he said, as well as more than 20 American soldiers who
died in Cold War incidents. About 8,000 U.S. service members are
listed as missing from the Korean War. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American sources have confirmed the deaths of 14 Soviet pilots
in Cold War incidents, Zolotarev said, and supplied videotapes
containing evidence in other cases. Russian officials continue to
seek information about the more than 1,000 Russian servicemen
reported missing during Cold War service, including about 300
sailors and pilots who disappeared at sea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea of American servicemen taken to the former Soviet Union
for questioning during the Korean War has endured. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Malcolm Toon, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and a
former commission co-chairman, said the questioning was possible,
given the close relationship between the Soviet Union and North
Korea in the early 1950s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Toon acknowledged then that no evidence of that questioning
had been found in Russian archives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Orlov, a Russian historian who accompanied Zolotarev
to Kansas City, and who is co-chairman of the joint commission's
Korean War Working Group, said research on the questioning
continues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``However, to date, there has been no evidence to show that
there was a transfer of U.S. personnel to the Soviet Union,'' Orlov
said. &QL;

 McCAIN TALKS OF WHITE HOUSE FLAWS, HIS CANDIDACY IN SPEECH TO VFW  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ The Clinton administration's approach to
foreign and military affairs suffers from wild inconsistency that
puts the world in peril, Sen. John McCain told about 4,000 fellow
veterans Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress makes things worse, the former Navy fighter pilot said,
by siphoning off money for pork-barrel projects that could be
better spent boosting military pay and buying better equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, Congress could free $4 billion for
defense spending if it only had the courage to close redundant
military bases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people must recognize the gravity of the problem
before their employees in Washington will fear to do the wrong
thing more than they currently fear to do the necessary things,''
McCain said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican, among a field of GOP presidential
hopefuls trailing Texas Gov. George W. Bush in early polls,
delivered the keynote address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was among comrades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His jet was shot down during a bombing mission early in the U.S.
involvement in the Vietnam War. His subsequent capture led to more
than five years in captivity in communist North Vietnam, where he
endured injury and torture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of Navy admirals, McCain left the Navy in
1980 and was elected to the U.S. House in 1982. He was elected to
his first Senate term in 1986. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His political career has been marked by successes in supporting
Indian gaming and brokering a deal that led television networks to
begin rating the sex and violence in their programming. He failed
in efforts to win Senate approval of a tobacco settlement or more
tightly restrict the financing of political campaigns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
and he appealed to the veterans group Wednesday on the issues of
their benefits and the treatment of men and women still in the
military. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A paucity of veterans among top administration officials, the
senator said, makes an ``inattention to our military and
veterans...not surprising.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain described a military stretched ``perilously close to the
breaking point'' around the globe in peacekeeping and humanitarian
missions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are,'' he said, ``on the razor's edge of hollowing out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, McCain said the Clinton administration bounds
from crisis to crisis with ad hoc policies that reveal an
indecisiveness the world could read as weakness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Clinton's credibility on Sino-American relations was
destroyed when his campaign took money from a subsidiary of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army and by the subsequent discovery of
stolen nuclear secrets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the administration risks lives by delivering mixed
signals about renewed hostility between the governments of mainland
China and Taiwan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The reunification of China must only occur peacefully, in
other words, voluntarily,'' McCain said. ``China must be made to
understand that the use of force would be a very serious mistake in
judgment, a serious mistake with grave consequences.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, who spoke to the VFW Monday, McCain got a standing
ovation at the opening and close of his speech. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican sometimes mentioned
as a presidential prospect, came to Kansas City with McCain to
endorse his candidacy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``On so many of the issues that are important to our country,''
Thompson said, ``Senator McCain has been a leader.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander's withdrawal
from the presidential race freed him to endorse his fellow maverick
GOP senator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after his speech, McCain continued to hint
that he will not compete in the Iowa caucuses in February and
instead skip ahead to primaries in conservative New Hampshire,
heavily military South Carolina and delegate-rich California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain sat out the fund-raising straw poll conducted by the Iowa
Republican Party on Saturday that Bush won. &QL;
</P>

   In a meeting with supporters after his speech, he said veterans
``are the base of this campaign'' for the presidency. He was
flanked by two fellow former prisoners of war. Everett Alvarez was
held captive in North Vietnam longer than any other American POW.

   He also said that even though B-2 stealth bombers flew dozens of
missions over Yugoslavia from their west-central Missouri base, he
would rather spend defense funds on other weapons systems. The
long-range bombers cost $2 billion a copy, and the senator said
that each mission costs $350,000. (Estimates provided by Whiteman
Air Force Base for per-hour flying costs and munitions put the
total closer to $444,000 for the missions to Yugoslavia.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as enamored with its capabilities as many are,'' he
said. ``I think the investment in tactical fighter aircraft is
probably more valuable.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SHOCKED. Amazed. Dismayed. Angry. Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley was every one of those things last week when he
saw on television that Scottie Pippen had requested a trade to the
Lakers. Barkley was in Kona, Hawaii, for what he called ``a Nike
vacation.'' Just that afternoon, he had played a round of golf with
one of his best friends, a Rockets teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie hadn't told me a thing about it,'' Barkley said. ``Not
one word. Nothing. Man, it threw me for a loop. I almost fell out
of my chair. I felt very frustrated very betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Scottie the next morning and told him how disappointed
I was in him. It really rubs me wrong that he'd try to bail out on
the team after one season. It's unbelievable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is in Houston, at least for a couple of days, talking to
the Rockets about returning to a team Pippen wants to escape. A
team that paid Charles a piddling $1 million last season _ at
Barkley's behest _ in order to make possible Scottie's five-year,
$67.5 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day before he signed,'' Barkley said, ``Scottie was
calling me and asking me if I was going to be (in Houston). He said
he wasn't coming if I wasn't staying. I gave him my word, and
that's why I signed for what I did when I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, you may recall, the Chuckster went out and gave Houston
twice the season Pippen did, for less than one-thirteenth the
compensation. Still, he never complained. He didn't even complain
when Pippen's turnover cost the Rockets that playoff game in LA and
Scottie later suggested to the press it was Barkley who had messed
up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Barkley has a suggestion for Pippen. No, it's not about
shoving anything anywhere the sun doesn't shine. It is about
maturity, leadership, responsibility and, above all, owning up to
one's mistakes. That's what Charles calls Pippen's trade request _
a dumb, insensitive, regrettable mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, Scottie owes the Rockets' fans an apology,'' Barkley
said. ``They've been terrific to him. Second, he owes the Rockets
an apology. And third, he owes me an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie needs to stand up and be a man. If he does, we can
move on. Everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will,'' Barkley said, brushing off the question.
``But this is a real challenge for him. This will tell you a lot
about who Scottie Pippen really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us have already jumped to conclusions regarding same.
Pippen's debut season for the Rockets, if not an out-and-out
failure, left a bad taste in lots of mouths. On a dollar-for-dollar
basis, he might have been the Least Valuable Player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley hasn't given up on the notion that Pippen has a
viable future in Houston. The story can have a happy ending,
because at least in Houston, Pippen has an opportunity to escape
the stigma of being merely an overhyped, artificially enhanced
accessory to Michael Jordan's mythic skills.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers, he would be back in the same cushy place he was
in Chicago, letting someone else carry the brunt of the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Scottie played hard,'' Barkley said, ``he played good.
Y'all saw it. I don't want Scottie traded to LA. I want him here,
playing like I know he can play. I believe in Scottie. He needs to
come in, apologize, then kick some butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about him taking charge and being a leader. With the
Lakers, it would be like Chicago all over again _ a no-lose
situation. If they win, it will be because of the `leadership'
Scottie brought to the team. If they lose, then it's going to be
Shaq's (Shaquille O'Neal's) fault or Kobe's (Bryant's) fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, who would the Lakers give us that I'd want _ Kobe?
And from what I'm told, the Lakers don't want Scottie. They haven'd
BX1d us about him; he's calling them.''

LINEMEN FIND CAMP TOUGHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most distinctive voice at Spaulding Field
these days belongs to first-year assistant Jethro Franklin, who
coaches the defensive tackles. It is loud and relentless,
unforgiving yet motivating _ like a drill sergeant's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels like boot camp out here,'' senior tackle
Pete Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   That's by design.
</P>
<P>
   When defensive-line coach Terry Tumey joined the Denver Broncos'
staff last spring, UCLA coach Bob Toledo hired Franklin to oversee
the tackles and John Pearce to direct the ends. His instructions
were explicit: Make the linemen meaner, make them tougher and make
them better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys come off the field now and they're wet, and I don't
know if they've ever done that,'' Toledo said. ``In the Miami game,
the players were holding their hands on their heads to come out of
the game and that didn't sit well with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice respites were plentiful last season as the young
linemen struggled to grasp the system. Time and again, they'd take
a knee and listen to Tumey explain assignments and alignments.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Bruins know where to go and what to do,
permitting Franklin and Pearce to focus on techniques and
fundamentals. No detail is overlooked. Few breaks are granted and
water requests are often rejected. The results are palpable: The
defensive line appears to be UCLA's most improved unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual drills are so intense, and I think we got away
from that a little last year,'' said Holland, the defensive
captain. ``The coaches are good at relating how the drills improve
our play. We know they aren't something to keep us busy. They're to
stop the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   __ How they stand: Holland and sophomore Ken Kocher have emerged
as the top tackles in UCLA's four-man defensive front. Sophomore
Anthony Fletcher and redshirt freshman Steve Morgan comprise the
second unit, giving the Bruins four big tackles for the first time
in years. Fletcher, with his cinder-block shoulders, is the most
difficult player to block.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all made jumps since the spring,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Massive junior Kenyon Coleman mans one defensive-end spot, with
redshirt freshman Rusty Williams at the other. The top reserves are
senior Travor Turner, a pass-rush specialist, and redshirt freshman
Sean Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ends pride themselves on being great pass rushers, but the key
for us is stopping the run,'' Pearce said. ``That's what we're
focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Pearce must make do without one of his most experienced
players. Junior Santi Hall, an expected starter, is playing outside
linebacker until Ali Abdul Azziz and Ryan Nece return from their
disabled-parking-scandal suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   __ Saving a year? With their depth at receiver, the Bruins might
redshirt sophomore Jon Dubravac, who played sparingly as a freshman
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real possibility if our receivers stay healthy,''
Toledo said. ``We've talked to the parents. He'll go to the Ohio
State game and then we'll make a decision. We want to try to save
his year.''
</P>
<P>
   College athletes have five years to play four seasons.

HYPE DOESN'T MAKE RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; For all of you dizzy with anticipation about the next great
rivalry in golf, and of course we're talking Sergio Garcia and
Tiger Woods, close your eyes, take a deep breath and get a grip.
</P>
<P>
   The back nine of the PGA Championship Sunday afternoon at
Medinah Country Club outside Chicago was absolutely Jordanesque as
sports theater. It was the best finish to a major championship
since 1986, when Jack Nicklaus' improbable win at the Masters gave
golf a nostalgia transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   That was a glimpse of golf's past. Sunday afternoon, we saw its
future.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brent Musburger could not have overhyped Sunday, let's
get real.
</P>
<P>
   One round of golf _ even a stellar one _ does not a rivalry
make. Even a highly rated television special cannot get the rival
juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Rivalries are a lot like dancing, excluding tap and break. It
takes two to rival.
</P>
<P>
   It does no good to declare a rivalry, then get to the first tee
only to discover you haven't got anyone to rival. Which seems to be
where golf finds itself now in the lingering shadow of the
Garcia-Woods Sunday afternoon shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The two principals offered disparate views on this rival stuff
after the last putt fell.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, flush with the exuberance of youth and a golf game that
seems skilled beyond its years, seems ready to accept or issue the
challenge, which ever the case might be.
</P>
<P>
   After Garcia posted a birdie on the 13th hole Sunday he cast a
glance toward Woods that made it clear Tiger was the only one on
the course being stalked. This is a comfortable mindset for Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I said when I turned pro that I wanted to be the No. &UR;  &LR; 1
golfer in the world. And so I knew I was going to be a rival for
Tiger. But I said that I want to be a rival but always friends like
we did today,'' he said in the post match news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Woods, who is No. &UR;  &LR; 1, a position he could hold
for years, does not have such a narrow focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as competing against Sergio as a rivalry, well I hate
to say this. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . I don't think there is,'' Woods said.
``Sergio and I had a wonderful match out there today. But I think
there are too many young players in the 20s. I think there is going
to be a handful of players that are going to lead golf into the
next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The list, Woods said, includes GarqIc.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes such established stars as David Duval, Justin
Leonard, Phil Mickels{.]

MORE NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS EXPECTED TO BE FOUND AT BLAINE, WASH.,
SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLAINE, Wash. _ Archaeologists expect to find more skeletal
bones among dirt excavated from Blaine's waste-water treatment
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lummi Tribe continues to wait for an apology from
the city, which failed to notify the tribe when workers dug up
skeletal remains of 28 Native Americans and allowed some of the
bones to be shipped out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is determining who and where best to send it (the
apology),'' said John Hobberlin, the mayor of Blaine, a city of
3,500 located near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal prosecutors are investigating whether the
city, its contractor or hired archaeologist violated criminal and
civil laws when they did not report initially finding the remains
July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, government officials and tribal leaders were among
three dozen people who Wednesday visited the excavation site at
Semiahmoo, located a few miles southwest of Blaine.
</P>
<P>
   City officials were not invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions,'' said Timothy
Ballew, chairman of the Lummi Indian Business Council, the tribe's
elected ruling body. ``It's frustrating that they (city officials)
haven't talked to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe is pushing for criminal charges, Ballew said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney General Susan Roe said investigators are
looking into whether federal laws protecting archaeological sites,
and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting was called to determine how to proceed,
particularly with repatriating other remains.
</P>
<P>
   State, federal and tribal archaeologists believe more skeletal
bones will be found amid mounds of dirt piled at the site and a
nearby landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Kinley's grandfather and great-grandmother were born and
reared in the coastal village where the waste-water treatment plant
now stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our family,'' Kinley said, gesturing toward the site
where dirt is piled 15 feet high between dormant yellow and red
cranes. ``So it's very difficult. The people who were buried here
and who were disturbed were our family.''
</P>
<P>
   City, federal and tribal officials signed an agreement in
January requiring the city to notify the tribe should remains be
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The city discovered that the site was a Native American burial
ground when it built the first phase of the waste-water treatment
plant in the 1970s. At the time, skeletal remains and artifacts
found at the site were sent to researchers at Western Washington
University in Bellingham without the tribe being notified.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe fought several years to repatriate the remains and
signed an agreement this year to prevent that from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that there were remains here,'' state senator Georgia
Gardner said as she visited the site Wednesday. ``Instead of making
sure that history didn't repeat itself, we've allowed it to happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the $7.6 million project was halted two weeks
ago. State and federal officials said they did not know when it
would resume.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe first learned of the skeletal remains when a member
visited the site two weeks ago and heard that bones had been found.
The remains could be from 150 to 4,000 years old, the tribe said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two tribal officials flew to the Denver offices of Golder
Associates, the archaeological consultant firm, and discovered some
of the remains in boxes and paper bags in the back of a pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the city should be held accountable for its
actions, Hobberlin declined to comment. Blaine and Golder
Associates have both retained an attorney, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the city is waiting to hear from all the agencies
involved to figure out what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we find out what we're supposed to do, we'll take the
appropriate action,'' Hobberlin said, adding that the city also had
heard from the White House on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The remains discovered at the construction site come from 28
burials and range from bones of individuals to full skeletons. The
remains were removed between July 26 and Aug. 2, Ballew said.

   The list, Woods said, includes Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes such established stars as David Duval, Justin
Leonard, Phil Mickelson, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke, the latter
two from the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   And for a Woods-Garcia rivalry to evolve, the two will have to
cross clubs more than a handful of times a year and every two years
in the Ryder Cup, their next great stage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this happens sooner or later remains to be seen. With
his second place win, Garcia has earned $580,650 in six PGA
tournaments this year, guaranteeing him playing privileges on tour
next year.
</P>
<P>
   He's not ready to commit to this tour full time, which would
give a rivalry with Woods some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything before probably November or
December. I have a lot of tournaments coming and I want to enjoy
that and when I finish, I'll tell you what I want to do,'' Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   So until then, golf remains a game in search of its next great
rivalry. It's been fun to talk about. Just think how much fun it
would be to watch if Woods and Garcia make these Sunday-afternoon
outings a regular thing.
</P>
<P>
   __ Foul play: Chicago should be known as the ``City of Big
Mouths'' after Sunday's final round. Not only did some members of
the gallery toss barbs at Woods, they also heckled his playing
partner, Mike Weir, who shot a final-round 80 in one of the most
memorable Sunday-afternoon meltdowns ever.
</P>
<P>
   We should be thankful that the camera was on Woods and Garcia
for the final few holes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Accomplishment: As time passes, Woods' three consecutive
United States Amateur titles becomes all the more remarkable. Two
of the three players he defeated in the finals, Buddy Marucci Jr.
and Steve Scott, failed to make it to the match-play round this
year. Neither did the 1997 winner, Matt Kuchar, and last year's
runner up, Tom McKnight.

REVOLUTION BARELY KICKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution hoped to begin a tradition
when they started MLS play four years ago. They probably did not
have losing streaks in mind at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But after falling to Tampa Bay, 1-0, Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, the
Revolution are two thirds of the way toward equaling their
league-record nine-game losing streaks they had in 1997 and '98.
Their streaks extended to six successive defeats, four successive
home defeats, and 284 consecutive scoreless minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution displayed some resilience, though, and the
addition of Leonel Alvarez in defensive midfield could allow them
to regain their playoff hopes. But Alvarez and Jeff Baicher,
acquired last week in trades, could not save the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay went on the defensive, absorbing the Revolution's
pressure for most of the first half, then scored in the 43d minute
and held off a committed Revolution effort in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score, again, what can I say?'' forward Joe-Max
Moore said. ``We need to take more initiative and be more dangerous
in the box. They stayed compact and together, and that is what a
good team is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good feeling going into the game. Now we have to stay
positive. We have only one way to go _ ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore had been one of the more in-form strikers in the US in
recent weeks, scoring goals for the US national team against
Argentina and Germany, plus converting 10 times for the Revolution.
But Moore has not scored in an MLS game since a 5-2 loss to Los
Angeles July 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny moved into a tie with Miami for third place with 22
points, 4 ahead of the Revolution in the race for the final playoff
place in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   This was a potentially fatal blow for the Revolution, who have
only two regulation-time home victories this season. But they have
another chance to recover with games against low-standing teams _
at San Jose (Saturday) and at the MetroStars (Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution displayed enough cohesion to be a threat, but
after surrendering a goal to Ritchie Kotschau, they faced a
difficult uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution received a break on the play leading to the goal
but simply failed to defend well against a free kick, leaving
Kotschau to convert a header off an excellent bending cross from
Dominic Kinnear. The move started when John Harkes fouled Carlos
Valderrama, and referee Marcel Yonan, instead of playing advantage,
ordered the Mutiny to take a free kick. This should have allowed
the Revolution to recover, but instead Valderrama played the ball
to Raul Diaz Arce, who found Kinnear.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the Mutiny had played conservatively, with Jeff
Causey forced to make only one difficult save, off Musa Shannon in
the 37th minute. And Valderrama's influence had been limited by
Alvarez, his former teammate for dozens of national team games with
Colombia. But on the goal, both outside backs moved into attack,
apparently surprising the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had three good opportunities in the first half,
but most of their chances came at random, rather than through
impressive buildups.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the contest, the Revolution were desperately
attacking with some effectiveness but were stymied by a Tampa Bay
defense led by Joseph Addo, whose last game at Foxboro Stadium was
as a member of the Revolution in an exhibition against Ajax July
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Revolution have players with a lot of fighting spirit and
that can carry a team far,'' Mutiny coach Tim Hankinson said.
``They were obviously not going to give up without a fight.''

   TURKEY-SCENE (Izmet, Turkey) _ People here spent their day
digging, sifting, grieving and increasingly despairing that those
who have not escaped from the rubble by now are probably dead. They
watched as bulldozers and front-end loaders tried to unearth
bedrooms, which is where most people were when the earthquake
struck. Then in the swirl of dust and smoke and sweltering heat,
residents picked through the rubble with hammers and chisels and
bare hands. As delicately as archaeologists, they teased out shreds

bodies. By Edmund L. Andrews.

The paintings, including large numbers of van Goghs, Modiglianis,
Renoirs and Picassos that vanished into Japan more than a decade
ago, are being resold abroad as a result of the country's economic
collapse. ``There's a loss of face associated with this art,'' said

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mesa mother who claimed she was sexually assaulted last week
in a school restroom admitted Tuesday that she made it all up.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Kari Rae Bodenski, 31, was seeking attention,
particularly from her husband, when she told authorities that a man
attacked her Friday afternoon during ``Meet Your Teacher'' day at
Mendoza Elementary School in northeast Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to go to school,'' police Sgt. Earle Lloyd said.
``Nothing happened on that campus. We have no crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Police will ask that Bodenski, who has a kindergartner and
another child at Mendoza, be charged with false reporting. They
also will try to recoup some of the costs of the massive air and
ground search for the assailant.
</P>
<P>
   She is not in custody now, Lloyd said late Tuesday, but
authorities are trying to get her to seek psychological help.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said Bodenski slugged herself in the head, leaving a large
bruise, scratched herself in the crotch area and cut her shirt and
bra with a pair of scissors. She then wrapped them in toilet paper
and left them in the corner of a stall. Police found them Tuesday,
after she confessed.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of evidence tipped police, who had grave doubts but had
to take Bodenski's claim seriously because of her injuries.
Authorities also wondered how the attack could have gone unnoticed
by the 500 or so parents on campus at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenski had emerged from a doorless restroom that opens onto
the school's inner courtyard and said that a man with cigarette
breath, dirty fingernails and long, messy hair had placed a sharp
object to her neck, knocked her unconscious and assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenski spent two nights at Desert Samaritan Medical Center.
The hunt for the assailant continued over the weekend and during
the first two days of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   The incident traumatized the school community, frightening
educators and parents alike. On the first day of school, parents'
cars clogged the street in front of Mendoza, making sure their
youngsters got to and from school safely. Police officers were on
hand, and safety was on the minds of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Willis, spokeswoman for Mesa Public Schools, was relieved
after hearing Tuesday's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that schools are safe places for
students, teachers and parents,'' she said. ``I hope this will
restore some of that confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Willis said, she had her doubts about Bodenski's
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't seem right,'' she said. ``But you had to take
it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the atmosphere at Mendoza will return to normal
today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some of the security measures that emerged may still remain
in place.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it's likely that staffers at Mendoza will wear
identification badges around their necks. It wasn't known late
Tuesday whether a parent meeting scheduled for tonight will still
be held.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Meko, who opened Mendoza 12 years ago and left this summer
to be principal of another Mesa school, has heard from many
distraught parents in the past several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled and relieved that Mendoza can get back to
normalcy,'' he said. ``I'm thankful that the good community of
Mendoza can send their kids back to a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   He applauded the district and the city for stepping up security
after the ``assault'' and treating it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Meko didn't recognize Bodenski's name, saying that he believed
she and her children were new to the school this year.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is not the first hoax in the Mesa Unified School
District.
</P>
<P>
   In March, two fifth-grade girls concocted a detailed story about
a knife-toting transient who grabbed them as they were leaving
Porter Elementary School. They fought off the man, whom they said
chewed his nails, and sprinted to a neighbor's house to get help.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the children broke down and admitted their lie was
part of a game of Truth or Dare, after several interviews with
police officers. &QL;

NEXT HURDLE FOR HAYES COMES IN SPAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Olympics have always been etched in Joanna
Hayes' mind, if not on her body.
</P>
<P>
   Stenciled in black ink on the upper right thigh of the UCLA
senior hurdler are tattoos of a dove and Olympic rings. Hayes said
tattoos are symbolic because releasing of doves is a traditional
part of the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   If Hayes qualifies for the Olympics, she plans to add color to
her tattoo of the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People dream in black and white,'' said Hayes, 22. ``It is
reality when it becomes color. If I am going to put a tattoo on, it
might as well mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   There are deeper meanings than the just the Olympics. Dove is
her middle name as well as the name of her late grandmother. One of
Hayes' most treasured possessions is a ceramic dove made by her
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes also has also a passage from the second book of Samuel
tattooed on her: ``He maketh my feet like hinds' to setteth me upon
high places.'' It is a passage Hayes learned in childhood, which
she uses as inspiration in track.
</P>
<P>
   For Hayes, who will compete in the World Track and Field
Championships beginning Saturday in Seville, Spain, the verse is
fitting. Hayes finally appears to be fulfilling a prophecy of an
illustrious high school career after an injury-riddled collegiate
career in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to UCLA thinking, `I am going to be great...'''
said Hayes, named the 1995 Track &AMP; Field News Athlete of the Year
as a Riverside North High senior. ``I had all these expectations
and they just failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations were rekindled in June when Hayes won the
NCAA title in the 400 hurdles and finished third in the 100 hurdles
to lead UCLA to a runner-up finish in the team standings.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Hayes followed her performance with a
third-place finish in the USA track and field championships to earn
a spot on the U.S. team for the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes lowered her personal best in the 400 hurdles to 54.57
seconds to finish second in the World University Games last month
and was fifth in the Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year at NCAAs, they had to carry Joanna off the track,''
UCLA women's coach Jeanette Bolden said. ``It is not how hard you
fall but how far you bounce back. I think she has learned that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hayes, the NCAA title will be remembered as the turning
point in her career, providing a confidence boost heading into the
USA championships. She had planned to stop running after 2001 if
she had not made an Olympic or World Championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one NCAA title is worth more than anything else that I
could have gotten,'' Hayes said. ``If you work hard for something,
you appreciate it much more. If I didn't win the NCAAs, I would
probably not have made the world team because I would have been so
frustrated. I had to let it all go. This is where it all begins.''
</P>
<P>
   In last year's NCAA championships, Hayes finished eighth in the
100 hurdles after straining her right hamstring in the Pac-10
Conference championships. Hayes also missed the entire indoor
season after bunion surgery on both feet.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore in 1997, Hayes hyperextended her right knee after
winning a heat in the 400 hurdles. In her freshman season, she did
not advance to the finals in either the 100 or 400 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a lot of faith that my third time I was going to do
something,'' Hayes said. ``Had I gotten hurt again, it would have
been pretty frustrating. I would have probably taken some time off
to think about what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes has never had to look far for inspiration at UCLA,
training with Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Gail Devers under the
supervision of Bruins hurdle coach Bobby Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   Running in practice against Joyner-Kersee, the world-record
holder in the heptathlon, and Devers, the 1992 and 1996 Olympic
100-meter champion, was a humbling experience. But it helped make
Hayes a better competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Although initially awestruck, Hayes found mentors in Devers and
Joyner-Kersee of the track. This summer, Hayes stayed at the
Kersees' home in St. Louis while preparing for the World
Championships. Joyner-Kersee, now retired, videotaped Hayes'
workouts to analyze hurdle technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give them all the respect that is due,'' Hayes
said. ``They're like friends and it's cool to be on the level where
you can sit down and hang out with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee is impressed with the 5-foot-5 Hayes' range, to be
competitive in the explosive 100-meter hurdles, in which she
clocked 12.89 in the NCAA championships, to the grueling 400-meter
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is truly a talent to have the speed of a sprinter and the
endurance of a half-miler,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``It still remains
to be seen what she is capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a stern test for Hayes in the World Championships.
Hayes will likely have to run close to or under her personal best
in both the first round and semifinals to the reach the
eight-runner final.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pressure for me to go out and do anything
spectacular,'' Hayes said. ``I want to have fun and use it as a
learning experience. But if I get to the final, anything is
possible.''

BIG NIGHT FOR HUNDLEY, BIG PLANS FOR FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talk to certain folks in the Dodgers organization
and they'll tell you about the huge season catcher Todd Hundley is
in for next year. A year of strengthening his reconstructed
throwing elbow, and a year of regaining his timing at the plate are
reasons for such prognostications. So is Hundley's decision to
remain at his Pasadena home during the offseason rather than return
to New York. He will work out at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the only thing that can hamper those plans are results of a
pending MRI Hundley will have when the team returns from a six-game
road trip next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who homered twice Wednesday night in Darren Dreifort's
7-0 victory against Florida in front of 36,463, has been bothered
by a sore left wrist for the better part of a month.
</P>
<P>
   His inability to freely move the pinky and ring finger on his
left hand has caused him to stop switch-hitting and bat solely
left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two fingers get locked and I can't move them,'' said
Hundley, 30, who is signed through the 2000 season and has an
option for 2001. ``I have to pry them off the bat when I hit
right-handed,'' Hundley said. ``They say the ligaments have
atrophied from surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley had surgery to remove a bone spur and close a fracture
in his left wrist in October 1995. He had a bone spur removed in
the same wrist 13 months later. Neither procedure caused Hundley to
miss playing time the next season.
</P>
<P>
   The pain has hampered Hundley to the point where he couldn't
even take batting practice from the right side. He said it's
partially why he's just 4 for 40 from the right side this season
and is the main reason he's decided to stop hitting right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts, but you play through it,'' Hundley said. ``It all
depends how much pain you can take, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hoping the ligament damage isn't too severe and surgery
isn't needed. If that's the case, he'll begin a workout schedule
almost as soon as the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be the best thing to happen to him,'' said Dodgers
coach Rick Dempsey, who tutored Hundley during an 11-day training
session earlier this season. ``He's really going to have to knuckle
down. When he comes to spring training, he'll be in game shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the majority of the winter, it's going to be leg work,
running some hills and getting his legs stronger. He'll do some
nice and easy long throws a 1m$]Z[Y.HX weY-HCfo.HX

The National Weather Service should have put the Astrodome area
under a tornado warning for most of Wednesday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But after being shut down for seven innings by Hideo Nomo _
nicknamed ``The Tornado'' for his corkscrew-like pitching motion _
the Astros made a lightning strike to steal a 6-4 victory from the
Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Down by three runs entering the bottom of the eighth, the Astros
struck for five runs in a rally highlighted by Carl Everett's
two-run double to move back into first place in the National League
Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won their third straight game to move a game ahead of
Cincinnati, which lost 12-6 to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee dropped its fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small margin is better than no margin,'' said Astros manager
Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo took a 4-1 lead to the eighth before the Astros loaded the
bases with no outs on singles by pinch hitter Russ Johnson and
Craig Biggio and a walk to pinch hitter Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   With Jeff Bagwell at the plate, reliever Eric Plunk threw a wild
pitch, scoring Johnson. After Bagwell struck out, Everett lined a
two-run double down the right-field line to tie the game at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Everett stole third base, Lance Berkman walked and Bill Spiers
struck out before Paul Bako hit a bouncer off reliever Bob Wickman
that sailed over the head of second baseman Ron Belliard for the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he wasn't surprised with the decision to pitch to
him _ even though first base was unoccupied and he is hitting .475
with 22 RBIs since returning from the disabled list Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured they pitched to Bagwell, so they would pitch to
me,'' Everett said. ``They rolled the dice and lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the 11th time this season the Astros have rallied to
win in their final at-bat. They had 48 come-from-behind victories
in 1998, 27 in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't had many late-inning comebacks this year,''
Dierker said. ``We have a very good record that has been built
mostly on good pitching and getting ahead and staying ahead. We
haven't had too many dramatic finishes like last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good time to have one because we may need to
have a couple more if we are going to win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams (2-1) picked up the victory in relief of Mike
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner matched his career high with his 30th save in 32
chances, striking out three in the ninth. Wagner has struck out
seven of the eight batters he has faced in the series on only 26
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth inning was a complete reversal from the first seven,
when the Astros were frustrated by Nomo. The Astros regularly
showed impatience at the plate while trying to pick up the
righthander's forkball, and Nomo retired 13 of 14 batters at one
point.
</P>
<P>
   During a stretch in the third and fourth innings, he set down
five batters on five pitches. He ended up allowing four runs and
six hits in seven-plus innings, three of the runs scoring after
Plunk (2-3) took over.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton failed in his second try at becoming the first 17-game
winner in the NL. After a rocky first inning that included three
hits, two walks and two runs, Hampton retired 15 of the next 16
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who has won his last seven decisions, gave up five hits
and tied a season high with nine strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys bailed me out again,'' Hampton said. ``This is
probably one of the most exciting games I've been a part of. The
first inning I fell behind in the count, but I felt as good as I
have all year after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers jumped on Hampton when Belliard led off the game
with a single and Hampton loaded the bases with walks to Mark
Loretta and Dave Nilsson. Alex Ochoa gave the Brewers the lead with
a sacrifice fly, and Marquis Grissom had a run-scoring single for
the 1,500th hit of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom went 3-for-4 with two RBIs. Bako and Gutierrez led the
Astros with two hits each.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros cut the Brewers' lead to 2-1 in the second on a walk
and Spiers' RBI double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five innings, Nomo was in control. He retired the
side on three pitches in the third and six pitches in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee added a run in the sixth inning when Grissom tripled
to the right-field wall and Lou Collier hit an RBI single for a 3-1
lead. Grissom provided the Brewers' final run in the eighth with a
single off Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But then the floodgates opened for the Astros. The five runs
were the most they had scored in an inning since a six-run seventh
inning Aug. 5 against Los Angeles. -%HRP

RED SOX TAKE ADVANTAGE

 SOX-ATHLETICS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox spent months talking about trading for
veteran pitcher Kevin Appier. They talked last December at the
winter meetings in Nashville, last March during spring training in
Florida, and right up to the midnight trading deadline in July,
when Appier was finally dealt by Kansas City to the Oakland
Athletics for three pitching prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's August, and while the Sox may still one day regret
their failure to add a pitcher of his pedigree, especially with
Bret Saberhagen on the shelf, they did not allow Appier to squirrel
their wild-card chances Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, beating the A's, 7-4,
before a crowd of 32,405.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox seized a 4-0 lead against Appier, gave it back in
one swoop after third baseman John Valentin dropped a popup by
Miguel Tejada to start the A's four-run sixth, then drove him out
of the game with three runs in the seventh inning, when Valentin
atoned at least in part for his glaring goof.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin followed that rarest of Fenway Park sights,
back-to-back triples by rookie Trot Nixon and Jose Offerman that
broke a 4-4 tie in the seventh, with a double to the
right-center-field gap that made it 6-4. Troy O'Leary followed an
intentional walk to Nomar Garciaparra, who already had scored one
run and driven in another, with an RBI single to right, the last of
a dozen hits off Appier.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin ended his night by making a leaping catch of Tejada's
liner and throwing out Eric Chavez on a ground ball for the final
out of Boston's ninth win in its last 12 games and second in three
against the A's, who trail by two games in the wild-card race. But
did he go home happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Valentin, who said gusts blowing in from
the northwest carried the ball away from him, back toward the
plate, and ``I must have blinked at the end . . . unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I haven't been swinging the bat well,'' said
Valentin, who was 2 for 19 on the homestand until his double off
Appier. ``I'm not happy about that.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . You always reflect on the negative. Obviously, I'm not
too happy about what happened, although it's baseball, anything can
happen, and obviously it did. It was nice to come up with a guy on
third base and drive him in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox relied on their newly retooled bullpen, now minus its
knuckleball closer, Tim Wakefield, to close out the A's. Rheal
Cormier, the first reliever out of the chute, had faltered during
the A's rally in the sixth, giving up a three-run double to Jason
Giambi, the first batter he faced, after starter Pat Rapp walked
three of the next four batters following Valentin's error. Rapp had
been working on a one-hit shutout until that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying so hard to pick him up,'' Rapp said of Valentin.
``He told me he knew he booted the ball, and asked me to pick him
up. I just couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces, who wound up being credited with the win, worked a
1-2-3 seventh, and Derek Lowe pitched the final two innings,
allowing one hit and hitting a batter, for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said he's now ready to take on the closer role ceded by
Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do get the ball now as closer,'' he said, ``I'm much more
confident now. I wasn't throwing my changeup for strikes early in
the season, and I was walking guys. Now I'm throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, whose wife Rebecca is undergoing a difficult pregnancy
back home in Louisiana, wasn't sure earlier in the week whether
he'd be able to make his start. His wife, who is nearly seven
months pregnant, was hospitalized with high blood pressure and
there was some risk, the pitcher said, of kidney failure that would
have placed both his wife and their unborn child in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife's condition stabilized, Rapp said, to the point
where she was able to return home, and he flew back to Boston
Tuesday night. ``After I talked to her, I called (Jimy Williams)
and told him I was flying back,'' Rapp said. ``But shoot, this is
my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   She remains confined to bed, and Rapp said he may return to
Louisiana Thursday, though after talking to her Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night,
he thought that might be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to make it look like I show up only on the day I pitch,
like Nolan Ryan or Pedro Martinez,'' Rapp said. ``But Jimy knows
family comes first in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had taken a 1-0 lead in the third on Jason Varitek's
single, Darren Lewis's double, and Offerman's sacrifice fly.
Garciaparra opened the fourth by beating out an infield hit, which
shortstop Tejada fielded on his heels. Garciaparra took second on
an infield out and scored on Butch Huskey's two-out double that
caromed off the left-field railing. Varitek then singled home
Huskey, making it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The lead became 4-0 on singles by Offerman, Brian Daubach, and
Garciaparra, though the Sox lost a run when Garciaparra was out
trying to advance to second on O'Leary's fly ball to deep center
before Daubach had crossed the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But both Nixon and Offerman flew around the bases after their
seventh-inning gappers, which for Williams put into context
Garciaparra's aggressive mistake on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty aggressive all night, and that was the one
situation that didn't work out, that's all,'' Williams said.
``Think about those two triples, rather than focusing on something
that didn't work out. Good effort, all the way around.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The exercise meant practically nothing to the Comets, who long ago
wrapped up superlative positioning for the upcoming WNBA playoffs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But their 70-60 victory over the Phoenix Mercury at Compaq
Center on Wednesday night was delivered with all the fervor and
intensity _ particularly on defense _ the Comets showed in their
previous 29 games while racking up the WNBA's best record (now
25-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable that we had everything clinched (for the
playoffs) and we were out there pressing like it was the first game
of the season,'' said Comets coach Van Chancellor, whose team
extended its league record for consecutive home victories to 12.
``That shows you the character of this team. I let 'em play
tonight. I didn't do a very good job of coaching in the second
half, because I got to watching them play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games, I've just enjoyed watching them play. I
mean, when you see (Sheryl) Swoopes, (Cynthia) Cooper, (Tina)
Thompson Lord, is that fun to watch. To press full-court and have
that much energy, boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, but I'm just a little pumped up tonight. And it
doesn't take much to pump me up, by the way. But to press, to run
and jump, to double the ball like we did _ and we had 10 steals.
Not bad for a team that should be tired and all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The final words of Chancellor's statement were a catch-all for
the emotional pall under which the Comets continue to labor with
point guard Kim Perrot on life support at M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets had fed off those emotions Monday night, getting a
WNBA season-high 42 points from Cooper, Perrot's close friend, in
an 80-71 victory over the Utah Starzz.
</P>
<P>
   Those emotions again played a role as the Comets beat the
Mercury for the eighth time in as many meetings at Compaq Center
over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have love in our hearts for Kim, and you know what's
going on with her,'' said Comets reserve center Tammy Jackson. ``So
we just have to come out and do our jobs. That's what Kim would
want us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes (a game-high 24 points), Cooper (16) and Thompson (14)
combined for all but 16 of the Comets' points to throw a roadblock
in the path of the Mercury's late-season rally.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (15-16), a multifaceted outfit the Comets defeated in
the WNBA championship round in 1998, had won two in a row and four
of its last five prior to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is a good team,'' said Thompson. ``They got off to a
bad start this year, had to rebuild. Although they're not the same
team as 1998, the core is still there. So we know if we don't come
out and play hard against a team like that, they can probably beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, however, on a night when Swoopes had another of her
all-around games (six rebounds, four assists, three steals). And
not on a night when Cooper handed out a game-high seven assists and
was 6-for-6 from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly not on a night when the Comets were penning
another chapter for their ongoing instructive manual on how to play
defense. The full-court trap, keyed at different times by Sonja
Henning, Cooper and Janeth Arcain out front, forced the Mercury
into 15 turnovers, a springboard to 23 Comets points.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jennifer Gillom, Phoenix's scoring leader, got 13 points
in the first half. But the Comets' help defense held her to a
single point over the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard playing on the court where there's a lot of
emotion going on,'' Gillom said. ``I think this deal (Perrot's
situation) affected our team almost as much as them. I think we
were really sad after we went to the chapel (services) before the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was not to be totally denied. After trailing 38-29 at
halftime, the Mercury pulled even at 42 on a follow shot by Maria
Stepanova (12 points, 12 rebounds) with 15:08 left in the final
half.
</P>
<P>
   But by outscoring the Mercury 16-2 over the next seven minutes,
the Comets built a 58-44 advantage with 8:25 left in the ballgame.
Phoenix would get no closer after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just amazed,'' said Chancellor. ``I felt we were going to
have a letdown somewhere. I keep saying we're going to have a
letdown. We haven't had one yet.''

APPIER SAYS HE HAD RIGHT STUFF

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, it was time to put a name with a
face. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier, the man with the awkward motion and habit of
appearing in Red Sox trade rumors, finally took his place on the
Fenway Park mound. Wearing the green, gold, and gray of Oakland,
the righthander pitched six-plus innings and picked up his first
loss since joining the wild-card contenders from the West Coast.
The crowd liked what they saw from the new Athletics' ace, who
reportedly held the Red Sox' interest before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But what's not to like when the opposing pitcher allows a
season-high seven earned runs and implodes in the seventh with the
score tied? Then again, neither Appier, Oakland manager Art Howe,
nor pitching coach Rick Peterson saw much wrong with the starter's
part in the 7-4 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I felt fine,'' said Appier. ``I didn't make
horrible pitches. Two balls were struck real well and (Jose)
Offerman hit a ball where nobody was. I felt strong. I thought I
had better stuff (than my last start). Overall, I had pretty good
command . . . It was extremely frustrating. They hit balls hard
where people weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloopers, bleeders, and balls hit to defensive holes doomed
Appier, automatically referencing the seventh inning when
critiquing his performance. From the visitors' viewpoint, bad
breaks and lucky hits hastened the end of the righthander's night.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon led off the decisive seventh with a triple to center.
Offerman followed with a triple down the right-field line. And John
Valentin doubled to right before the Oakland starter handed the
ball over to the bullpen. Appier finished with 94 pitches, 61
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he battled,'' said Howe. ``The only balls hit hard
were in the seventh inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Peterson: ``When you look at tonight's games, they had a
ton of ground ball bleeders in the infield and a couple bloops.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Oakland clubhouse, Peterson and Howe reflected on what
could have been. A call here. A few more inches to the right there.
A blooper that fell in.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans in Fenway would have agreed that everything fell
into place just fine for the win.

SABERHAGEN TO MISS AT LEAST ONE START 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-SABERHAGEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The news was delivered without any drama or delay.
After all, Bret Saberhagen has been unfailingly honest about the
weakened condition of his right rotator cuff. The pitcher has
chronicled the growing pain and inflammation in his throwing
shoulder since the All-Star break, his discomfort on the mound
appearing most obvious during his start Tuesday against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, when Saberhagen matter-of-factly announced he will
miss his next start, the clubhouse reacted with little surprise.
And Saberhagen did not voice false optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss one start and play it by ear after that,'' he said.
``If it's still not up to par after that, we'll take a little bit
more time. I really think we'd get it right if we'd take about a
month, but we don't have a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was the beginning of the season, it might be a different
story. I'd be able to take the proper time. But we don't have a
whole lot of time left in the season and I need to be out there.
We're going to do what we can in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   With a late-season injury to a pitcher considered a medical
miracle after major shoulder surgery in 1996, the phrase ``short
term'' takes on an indefinite meaning. The consummate competitor,
Saberhagen wants to return to mound as quickly as possible and help
the Red Sox in the American League wild-card chase. But he has
little confidence that a mere 10 days rest and rehabilitation will
be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the pitcher would prefer a month off and will push
himself only because of the playoff race, missing two starts
remains a strong possibility. Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield will be
relieved of his duties as closer and moved back to the starting
rotation. The disabled list does not appear a likely option for
Saberhagen, considering the rosters expand Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said (missing) the next start was no problem,'' said
Saberhagen. ``They don't have to make a move or anything. With
September right around the corner, there's really no need for the
DL.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Saberhagen has set his limit at two missed turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, I'll be back _ the longest missing two starts,''
he said. ``If I've been able to pitch with what I have now and if
it doesn't get any stronger, I'm just going to come back and deal
with it the way I have been. I was pitching effectively enough
until Wednesday night feeling like crap. I can be effective without
good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder feels weaker than it has at any point in the
righthander's career. Pain that initially was confined to one spot
now encompasses the entire area. Inflammation has spread and every
time Saberhagen throws the ball, he must deal with an unstable
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break Saberhagen has compiled a 3-3 record
with one no-decision. His most recent win came Aug. 11, when he
pitched eight innings and allowed just four hits against Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing pain, Saberhagen had pitched well
recently. Mid-July losses to Philadelphia and Baltimore were
followed by a no-decision at Toronto. Then he defeated the Yankees
to start this month. Saberhagen followed that start with a
seven-strikeout performance against Anaheim and the victory over
the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   But the positive results came to an abrupt halt Tuesday.
Saberhagen followed his longest start of the season with his
shortest. His 2 innings resulted in six hits, three earned runs,
and just one strikeout. Signs of Saberhagen's trouble came early
and often. The Athletics noticed Saberhagen took longer to loosen
up and never had to face his best fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen knows his time off will be filled with exercises
designed to strengthen the area around his rotator cuff. At the
same time, Saberhagen must balance workouts with rest. He continues
to take anti-inflammatory medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, I'll be 100 percent,'' said Saberhagen. ``I'm not
going to be 100 percent this year. It's not happening. If we were
out of it (I wouldn't be rushing back). There's really no sense in
going out there and pitching if we're not fighting for something.''

PARENTS URGED TO TALK TO CHILDREN ABOUT SEXUAL AWARENESS, SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Preparing children for the school year is a hefty
task. After arming them with school supplies, backpacks and
lunches, parents also are encouraged to counsel their children
about sexual awareness and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so important to talk to children before there is a time
when you won't be with them,'' said a representative from the
Domestic Abuse Women's Network, a support service.
</P>
<P>
   Children have received personal safety information in
Washington's classrooms since the early 1980s. While this
information has helped students, research shows that parent
discussion and reinforcement of these ideas are more successful at
helping children protect themselves from sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents have established good communication with their kids
and continue to remind them, then the kids will see them as a
resource,'' said Debbie Halela, coordinator of sexual abuse
services for Youth Eastside Services.
</P>
<P>
   Schooltime issues can range from choosing a safe walking route
to and from school to dealing with new relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools can give the information to the kids, but parents
know the best way to address the message to their individual
child,'' said Lindsay Palmer, director of education at King County
Sexual Assault Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing an open line of communication allows children to
feel safe asking their parents questions about these new
experiences or problems. But creating this open communication can
be difficult or embarrassing for many parents and kids, Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't talk to a child just one time about crossing the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming that embarrassment can mean prevention from serious
future damage. Of the 41,407 cases investigated last year by the
state Child Protective Services, 6,767 cases involved allegations
of sexual abuse, according to the state Department of Children and
Family Services. The Sexual Assault Resource Center reports that
one in three girls and one in five boys will be sexually assaulted
by the time they are 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are never too young to learn about appropriate
behavior,'' said the Women's Network representative, who didn't
disclose her name, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Each parent will know the best means of communicating with their
child, Palmer said. But all information should be represented
clearly, factually and should help develop children's personal
safety skills and sense of self. Frequently the information can be
given just as any other instruction or conversation would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit down and say `This is the sexual information talk,'
it is going to make it uncomfortable for everyone,'' Palmer said.
``But by having an ongoing conversation, it is more natural and
leaves room for discussion in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no script or cure-all to use in every situation, Palmer
said. But arming children with a strong sense of self, the idea
that their bodies are their own and providing them with a safe
confidant are tools that will help them across the board.
</P>
<P>
   For young children, establishing what is appropriate behavior
can include touching or other personal safety related behavior. For
children just heading off to school, Palmer recommends identifying
issues such as safe travel routes, traveling with buddies and
checking in with a designated adult.
</P>
<P>
   At pre-adolescence children become aware of intimate
relationships and these issues should be addressed. If they are
unwilling to talk, continue to try or find someone they feel
comfortable talking with. For children of all ages, Palmer
recommends telling them to trust their instincts: If something
doesn't feel right, leave and tell someone.
</P>
<P>
   Information on age-appropriate material can be found through the
sexual assault resource center or may be recommended by school
counselors or health teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding this outlet relieves some of the pressure off the
child to handle it by themselves and shows that parents or the
community is willing to help.''

BAKER RE-SIGNS WITH SONICS, VOWS TO `MAKE AMENDS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALIYA SAPERSTEIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vin Baker said he was sorry, it won't happen again, so
the Sonics signed him to a seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who shouldered the blame for the Sonics' disappointing
25-25 record in the shortened 1998-99 NBA season, chose not to take
advantage of his free agent status and instead re-signed with the
Sonics Wednesday. The contract keeps the 6-foot-11 forward in
Seattle through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   No other terms were disclosed, but it is believed he stands to
make as much as $87 million over the duration of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, agent Aaron Goodwin and team president Wally Walker spent
most of the day in Sonics headquarters, drafting formal language on
the contract they had negotiated since July. They signed off on it
about an hour before an evening news conference, called hstily to
allow Baker's return home to Connecticut with his mother, Jean, in
attendance to lend moral support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a happy day ...'' Walker said. ``We won't insult your
intelligence and tell you what a great year last year was, but Vin
has made a commitment (to turn things around).''
</P>
<P>
   Baker took the blame for the Sonics missing the playoffs for the
first time in nine years and said he wouldn't allow himself to be
the reason again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to a tremendous career here, and to
returning to the form of the player I was two years ago,'' the
four-time All-Star said. ``I've made a commitment to this team to
get back to being the player I know I can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big weight off my shoulders,'' he added of closing the
deal. ``I can make amends for last season, get back to the playoffs
and get back to playing as best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he has been doing ``two-a-days'' with a trainer at
home in Connecticut, and he plans to be in Seattle for the next
month to work with Sonics strength and conditioning coach Dwight
Daub. Baker said he weighs 266 but hopes to lose six pounds before
camp opens Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, after the protracted lockout, Baker reported about
20 pounds overweight, missed 16 games with thumb and knee injuries
and averaged 13.8 points and 6.2 rebounds _ his lowest marks since
his rookie season with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month prior to last season, I didn't work out at all,''
Baker said, ``and I suffered for it the whole season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be in the best shape of my career on October 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had the Sonics wanting to include a weight clause in
the contract languagem but neither side would talk specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I will say is that there are bonus incentives in the
contract,'' said Walker, who explained that the clauses were
phrased as positives and not negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said, ``I'm going to be in the best shape no matter what
the incentives or clauses are. The biggest thing for me is coming
back to this gym and coming back to KeyArena.''
</P>
<P>
   The team Baker is coming back to, of course, has a very
different look. Ten players are gone, and Walker signed six
newcomers. Though the Baker contract pushes the Sonics over the
salary cap, Walker said he plans to acquire a few more players
willing to make the league minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great team. We're going to contend and compete.
I'm excited about the people they brought in,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people are going to be disappointed a lot of
veterans are not here, but we've got a lot of good young guys
who're going to make it exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 first-round draft pick out of the University of
Hartford has career averages of 18.1 points and nine rebounds per
game. The Sonics acquired him from Milwaukee in a three-team trade
that sent Shawn Kemp to Cleveland in September of 1997.

DOCTOR ON RELIEF FLIGHT WILL DO `THE BEST I CAN' IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A retired Pierce County physician will be part of a
medical team traveling from Seattle to the heart of
earthquake-ravaged Turkey on Thursday on the maiden flight of a
Boeing 737-800 bought by Turkish Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be facing desperate people, hurting people, many
of whom have lost loved ones,'' Dr. Michael Spiger said. ``It's
something I've never faced before. I will go and do the best I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiger will join four or five nurses and paramedics from Oregon,
Idaho and California in a relief effort coordinated by Northwest
Medical Teams, a Portland-based non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced internal medicine for 22 years in Puyallup, Wash.,
before retiring two years ago, and has long been interested in
international relief work. He has been a full-time volunteer with
Northwest Medical Teams since his retirement, helping to coordinate
shipment of surplus supplies and equipment to needy countries.
</P>
<P>
   This will his first trip as part of a medical relief team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine it will be like a first-aid station, working as a
team,'' said Spiger, who lives in Graham, about 20 miles southeast
of Tacoma. ``You can imagine the need, with thousands and thousands
of people injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will be based in Izmit, the epicenter of Tuesday's
7.4-magnitude quake that killed nearly 4,000 and injured more than
18,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially our team will be working with medical professionals
that are already at work, helping with crush wounds,'' said Eric
Odell, spokesman for Northwest Medical Teams.
</P>
<P>
   Spiger's team, which is bringing a shipment of medical supplies,
also will assist with stemming diseases associated with
contaminated water lines and decaying bodies, Odell said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related effort, the Turkish American Cultural Association
in the Seattle area is planning to load the same Boeing plane with
more than 80 boxes of donated clothing, blankets, sleeping bags and
canned food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even (stop to) eat something,'' said John Gokcen,
vice president of the 1,000-member association, panting after an
afternoon of packing boxes at his Kirkland home. ``If we can help
the people who need it, it will be a relief for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gokcen's group on Wednesday received 55 boxes of canned food
from Fred Meyer stores, 100 T-shirts from Tully's Coffee and
packing containers from the U-Haul Co., in addition to private
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that will carry the relief supplies and medical team
was bought by Turkish Airlines. Its initial cargo was only going to
be 3 tons of textbooks sent by San Diego State University to a new
university in Istanbul. When disaster struck, Thursday's scheduled
delivery of the plane became fortuitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a brand-new airplane is leaving the factory and going to an
area in need, we try to make sure _ with the airline's approval _
that it doesn't go empty,'' said Carol Cella, a Boeing spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the airline delivery schedule,'' she said. ``It's
not often that a delivery will coincide with a disaster, but we're
very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with its airline customers and relief agencies, Boeing
is involved with 30 to 40 international relief efforts a year and
has transported nearly 1,000 tons of supplies worldwide since 1992,
Cella said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Christian relief and development agencies based in the
Seattle area are accepting donations to help earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   World Concern will transfer all donations received in the next
two weeks to International Protestant Fellowship, an organization
already at work in Turkey. Donations can be sent to World Concern,
19393 Fremont Ave. N., Seattle, WA 98133. Checks should be
earmarked for ``Turkey earthquake relief.''
</P>
<P>
   World Vision will use donations to send supplies or to assist
relief organizations in Turkey. Donations can be sent to World
Vision, P.O. Box 9716, Federal Way, WA 98063. For more information,
call 888-56-CHILD.
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to help Northwest Medical Teams can make a
donation to the organization's account at any branch of U.S. Bank
of Washington. Gifts should be designated for the Turkish relief
fund.

PINIELLA PICKS UP 1,000TH WIN AS BIG-LEAGUE MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ On radio talk shows and Internet Web sites in recent
weeks, fueled by a blowout here and a Yankees sweep there,
disgruntled fans had come up with a thousand reasons for Lou
Piniella to lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Mariners manager answered back with 1,000 more
for staying.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella reached a personal milestone, claiming his 1,000th
managerial victory as his club downed Toronto, 5-1, completing a
three-game sweep of the floundering Blue Jays, closing out a 4-2
road trip and climbing back to the .500 mark (60-60) for the first
time since July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days shy of his 56th birthday, Piniella got emotional while
addressing his players in the clubhouse. In return, they drenched
him with champagne. Another bottle on ice awaited him on his office
desk, compliments of the Mariners front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud if it, but at the same time in a very humble way,''
Piniella said, between swigs. ``I thank the organizations that gave
me a chance to manage and I thank all the players who played hard
for me. I know this, you have to manage a long time to get 1,000
wins. I kept the job, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   His 13-year record stands at 1,000-926, 521 of those victories
coming with the Mariners, the rest with the New York Yankees and
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   For those eager to see him go, Piniella apparently has no plans
for an abbreviated departure.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game Wednesday, he sat in the visiting manager's
office mulling the future, giddy about the possibilities. He rocked
back and forth in his chair. He smoked fiendishly. He used words
like ``quality,'' ``depth'' and ``hope'' to sum up his young
pitchers, something he couldn't do 12 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few hours, Piniella, a guy who has built a
managerial career around veteran arms, watched rookie starter
Freddy Garcia claim his 12th victory in 19 deciw) &UR; 9s. The manager
received a crucial out from rookie reliever Steve Sinclair, the
lefty striking out Toronto's Willie Greene to snuff a bases-loaded
threat in the sixth. Piniella got a 1-2-3 inning in the seventh
from rookie Tom Davey, forced to handle the pressure of being a
former Blue Jay, as did Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans chipped in as well. Jay Buhner put the Mariners on the
scoreboard first with a two-run homer in the second. Brian Hunter
made a heroic catch in the seventh, running down a two-out fly ball
with the bases loaded and holding on after crashing into the fence
in left. Reliever Jose Paniagua went five-up, five down to close it
out as Jose Mesa got a day off.
</P>
<P>
   Players said they were glad to see Piniella rewarded, a little
in awe of the time involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a lot of longevity,'' pitcher Jamie Moyer said.
``That's 9,000 innings of baseball. If you want to make it more
ridiculous, how many pitches do you think he has seen? It's pretty
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Buhner: ``To me, it's nice to see Lou do it, to be a part
of it, to get a big hit to get us out in the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Several managers have crossed the 1,000-victory threshold.
Mariners research indicates Piniella is just one of 18 managers who
have collected 1,000 wins and 1,000 hits as big-leaguers, 14 after
the turn of the century. Piniella and Yankees manager Joe Torre are
the only active members of this club.
</P>
<P>
   His hair matted and jersey soaked by champagne, Piniella
reminisced about his first victory as a manager, one that came with
the Yankees, decided by an eighth-inning Butch Wynegar home run.
</P>
<P>
   He paid homage to the late Billy Martin, the former Yankees
manager who made Piniella one of his coaches in 1985. Piniella get
started as a manager the next season, replacing a fired Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my mentor in New York,'' he said of Martin. ``He's the
one who got me prepared for this. You can see I picked up a few of
his (bad) habits.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Piniella said his style is playing percentages, rather
than managing by hunch, which is a sign of the
information-overloaded times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use statistical data more than anybody else,'' he said. ``I
believe in percentages more than anything else. ... I like
information. The more information to me, the better. It avoids a
lot of second-guessing. Everybody's a manager, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has 1,000 wins.

QBS MUST STEP IT UP; HUARD TO SEE ACTION AHEAD OF FOLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ The past. The present. And the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bare bones meaning of the Thursday night's nationally
televised game against the 49ers in San Francisco for the Seahawks
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna will start and play much of the first half at 3Com
Park. In a reversal of roles from the preseason opener, rookie
Brock Huard will follow Kitna and be followed by Glenn Foley, if
time allows.
</P>
<P>
   Each must play better than he did last Saturday night in a 24-10
loss to the Buffalo Bills in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just talking to Jon and I said, `OK, now we take another
step this week, and against a real good football team,''' coach
Mike Holmgren said Wednesday as he left the practice field at
Eastern Washington University after the team's light 35-minute
workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build on what we've accomplished,'' he said.
``There were some good things in the first game, and certainly we
made some errors. Now we have to be better in this game in those
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna and Foley faced the 49ers last year with varying degrees
of success and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   During a preseason game in Vancouver, B.C., last August, the
49ers baited Kitna into throwing a pass that was intercepted and
returned 70 yards for a score by cornerback Marquez Pope in a
three-point San Francisco victory. It was the kind of mistake a
young quarterback could learn from.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Warren Moon had ended his holdout a few days
earlier, so Kitna did not start another game until Week 12 of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Moon is now gone (to Kansas City), and so is the coach who
discovered Kitna but had a difficult time forgiving him for
throwing one bad pass in one preseason game (Dennis Erickson, now
at Oregon State). Also missing Thursday night will be Pope, who
signed with Cleveland in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned more in that game than I did in the five
games I played (and started) at the end of the year,'' Kitna said
this week. ``I think there was somewhat of an overreaction to it.
... That's not something that sticks out in my mind as a negative.
It was just another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern to Kitna, and more important to his team, is
how he reacts Thursday after producing just three points against
Buffalo. The Bills blitzed more than the Seahawks expected, forcing
Kitna to scramble more than he or Holmgren want.
</P>
<P>
   Against the 49ers, Kitna will be staring into the face masks of
a defense that last year collected 51 sacks, third-best in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to move the ball,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound simplistic, but the first thing the No. 1
offense needs to do is eliminate the mistakes that stalled drives
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never established any rhythm against the Bills,'' Kitna
said. ``This week we need to do that, get some first downs, get
some six-, seven-, eight-play drives going so we can establish some
tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are good, but far from infallible. Foley proved that
last year, when as the starter for the New York Jets and threw for
415 yards and three touchdowns against San Francisco in the opener.
Despite his career-best effort, the Jets lost a wild 36-30 decision
in o6e{time.
</P>
<P>
   As with Kitna, Foley, obtained in a March trade for a
seventh-round draft pick, can't be concerned with his last game
against the 49ers. After his three-turnover performance against the
Bills, Foley must play better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled the other night. That's the way it works, when you
don't play well, you're not going to play,'' Foley said of being
leap-frogged by Huard, a left-hander from the University of
Washington and Puyallup High School. ``There's no defending it,
you've got to play better. Until I do that, I'm going to be on the
bench.''

HOLMGREN PATIENT AS YOUNG QUARTERBACKS STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In preparation for a pretend game Thursday night
against the esteemed, venerable San Francisco 49ers, Seattle
Seahawks fans are traditionally urged to be patient and maintain
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But that suggestion is wasted on a lot of seasoned fans, who are
used to and unruffled by the Seahawks' annual preseason bludgeoning
from Steve Young, Jerry Rice et al.
</P>
<P>
   Save the advice for Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   The new coach was so torqued after losing the exhibition opener
to Buffalo Saturday in the Kingdome that his wife, Kathy, had to
talk him off the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home ... I was upset,'' Holmgren said. ``My wife is a
very good listener. Finally she said, `Do you remember how it was
the first couple of games in Green Bay?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a deep breath. She reminded me of several things, which
is all of what I told the team the next day: it was preseason, we
can't lose sight of our goals, that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be that the Seahawks might be overpaying Holmgren and
underpaying his wife. Then again, Holmgren's bloomers were bunched
for a sound reason.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a new offense heavily dependent on intelligent,
experienced quarterbacking, Holmgren has in Jon Kitna, Glenn Foley
and Brock Huard three quarterbacks who have 14 NFL starts among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Anakin Skywalker won the big desert race have pilots
so young been counted on for so much so early. And the Seahawks do
not have the benefit of special effects to vaporize mean, icky
aliens such as the 49ers' Charles Haley.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks offense will not be pretty. Not just Thursday
night, but probably all the way though September and perhaps
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   For public consumption, it is said that all the quarterbacks are
doing well. But there are private doubts that training all three
youngsters simultaneously will persuade many viewers that ``It's
Now Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest offense I've had to learn,'' said Foley, who
at 28 is the graybeard with five seasons and eight starts, all with
the New York Jets. ``It's an aggressive philosophy. I've never been
in an offense that throws this much.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Huard, a rookie from Washington: ``It can be pretty
intense. It's a lot. When you formulate it in a meeting room, it's
enjoyable because it makes sense. But on the field, everything is
done in split seconds. Big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kitna, with six previous NFL starts: ``Every time you learn
something new, it takes time. We'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   But not nearly as fast as a seasoned QB. And not nearly as fast
as local expectations, including the franchise's own hype machine,
would have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, `It's Now Time,' and all that,'' said Holmgren.
``But with young guys, you have to walk before you can run. Even
though it's now time, I'm not taking any shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I have to fight the urge (to take shortcuts). I can't
give them things they're not ready for. I know people might get
impatient with that. It will click in at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's problem parallels the one he had when he took over in
Green Bay in 1992. His three young quarterbacks there were also
blank pages. As it turned out, Brett Favre, Mark Brunell and Ty
Detmer flourished. Brunell and Detmer ended up doing it elsewhere,
and Favre took the Packers to two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situations are similar,'' Holmgren said. ``The difference
there was once Brett got it, he was so physically talented, you
really felt this was going to be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark had great ability as well. Ty was the one who grasped
everything a little sooner. But he wasn't as physical as the other
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has identified the Seahawks QBs as the next Favre
or Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the same way about Jon's ability to grasp the offey

PARENTS URGED TO TALK TO CHILDREN ABOUT SEXUAL AWARENESS, SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Preparing children for the school year is a hefty
task. After arming them with school supplies, backpacks and
lunches, parents also are encouraged to counsel their children
about sexual awareness and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so important to talk to children before there is a time
when you won't be with them,'' said a representative from the
Domestic Abuse Women's Network, a support service.
</P>
<P>
   Children have received personal safety information in
Washington's classrooms since the early 1980s. While this
information has helped students, research shows that parent
discussion and reinforcement of these ideas are more successful at
helping children protect themselves from sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents have established good communication with their kids
and continue to remind them, then the kids will see them as a
resource,'' said Debbie Halela, coordinator of sexual abuse
services for Youth Eastside Services.
</P>
<P>
   Schooltime issues can range from choosing a safe walking route
to and from school to dealing with new relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools can give the information to the kids, but parents
know the best way to address the message to their individual
child,'' said Lindsay Palmer, director of education at King County
Sexual Assault Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing an open line of communication allows children to
feel safe asking their parents questions about these new
experiences or problems. But creating this open communication can
be difficult or embarrassing for many parents and kids, Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't talk to a child just one time about crossing the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming that embarrassment can mean prevention from serious
future damage. Of the 41,407 cases investigated last year by the
state Child Protective Services, 6,767 cases involved allegations
of sexual abuse, according to the state Department of Children and
Family Services. The Sexual Assault Resource Center reports that
one in three girls and one in five boys will be sexually assaulted
by the time they are 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are never too young to learn about appropriate
behavior,'' said the Women's Network representative, who didn't
disclose her name, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Each parent will know the best means of communicating with their
child, Palmer said. But all information should be represented
clearly, factually and should help develop children's personal
safety skills and sense of self. Frequently the information can be
given just as any other instruction or conversation would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit down and say `This is the sexual information talk,'
it is going to make it uncomfortable for everyone,'' Palmer said.
``But by having an ongoing conversation, it is more natural and
leaves room for discussion in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no script or cure-all to use in every situation, Palmer
said. But arming children with a strong sense of self, the idea
that their bodies are their own and providing them with a safe
confidant are tools that will help them across the board.
</P>
<P>
   For young children, establishing what is appropriate behavior
can include touching or other personal safety related behavior. For
children just heading off to school, Palmer recommends identifying
issues such as safe travel routes, traveling with buddies and
checking in with a designated adult.
</P>
<P>
   At pre-adolescence children become aware of intimate
relationships and these issues should be addressed. If they are
unwilling to talk, continue to try or find someone they feel
comfortable talking with. For children of all ages, Palmer
recommends telling them to trust their instincts: If something
doesn't feel right, leave and tell someone.
</P>
<P>
   Information on age-appropriate material can be found through the
sexual assault resource center or may be recommended by school
counselors or health teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding this outlet relieves some of the pressure off the
child to handle it by themselves and shows that parents or the
community is willing to help.''

DREIFORT MAKES PITCH TO STAY IN ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While most of the Dodgers have little at stake
over the next six weeks, Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort is
pitching for his place in the rotation next season.
</P>
<P>
   A few more outings like his seven-hit, 7-0 victory against the
Florida Marlins at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday and discussions of
whether Dreifort belongs in the bullpen or the rotation will be
academic.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his most controlled performances of the season,
Dreifort (10-12) walked none and struck out four. It was the second
shutout of his career. His other came last season against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said players would be
playing for jobs regardless of their contract situation, Dreifort
is on the plus side.
</P>
<P>
   Though he allowed seven runs on 11 hits in six-plus innings in
his last start, Dreifort is 2-2 with a 3.29 ERA in his last four
starts, which also encompasses the time of Johnson's edict.
</P>
<P>
   During that span is a 61/3-inning, one-earned-run gem against
the Mets in which he struck out seven. But more important is
Dreifort's control. After experiencing control problems most of his
career, he has walked just five batters in his last 331/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking toward September: Rosters expand from 25 to 40 on
Sept. 1, and management has started to talk about possible
call-ups. Manager Davey Johnson met with Dodgers assistant to the
GM minor-league director Bill Geivett the past two days to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dual purpose (for call-ups),'' Johnson said. ``You
look and see if a guy should be on the 40-man in the winter, and
look at what kind of role they may have on next year's club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't have many options at the minor-league level,
but Johnson said he expects to go heavy with middle infielders and
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing pitcher is Greg Gagne, who's 12-4
with a 2.71 ERA with Double-A San Antonio. Gagne is the only player
below Triple-A Albuquerque expected to get a late-season look.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Jeff Williams (9-5, 4.66 ERA), Matt Herges (8-3, 4.73)
and Ricky Stone (5-8, 5.41) and infielders Adam Riggs (.286), Alex
Cora (.329) and Juan Castro (.283) are all probables. Also, the
Dodgers are expected to bring catcher Angel Pena back once rosters
expand.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that lefty Carlos Perez, who's in the first year
of a three-year, $15.5 million contract and is the minors'
highest-paid pitcher isn't likely to make it back to the Dodgers
before Sept. 1. Perez, who pitches today, is 1-2 with a 7.94 ERA
with Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Carlos, it looks like he needs a couple more
starts,'' Johnson said. ``Carlos may be a September call-up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Dugout club seats: The Dodgers announced their plans for the
Dugout Club seating that will close the distance between the
catcher and backstop by 25 feet. It's part of the continuing
renovations at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dugout Club Lounge will have a bar, restaurant and bar-style
seating, a buffet area and 23 television monitors, and seat 565
fans. The first row is 58 feet from home plate. Tickets for the
first two rows will be $225. The remaining 485 seats will be $195.
It's expected to be ready for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra bases: Right-hander Robinson Checo will pitch in a
rehab assignment for Class-A San Bernardino today. Righty Antonio
Osuna will accompany Checo, but Dodgers officials said they weren't
sure whether Osuna would pitch. . . . The Dodgers will wear a patch
honoring Pee Wee Reese, who died Saturday at the age of 81. The
black-colored ``Pee Wee 1'' patch is sewn onto the Dodgers uniform
above the existing Dodgers hero patches.

METS CRUSH PADRES, 9-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It has become a sort of race within the race.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves vie daily for the
National League East lead like two thoroughbreds fighting down the
stretch, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura keep piling on the home runs
and runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ventura and Piazza homered on Wednesday night and they both
drove in three runs. The Mets accordingly obliterated the San Diego
Padres, 9-1, at Qualcomm Stadium. And because Atlanta lost, 4-1, in
Colorado, the Mets (74-48) could fly home to New York early
Thursday morning after a 4-2 Western swing in sole possession of
first place. It was their eighth series victory on the road, a
franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for Ventura to reclaim the team lead in
homers with his 28th of the year, a three-run first-inning shot to
right off the San Diego rookie Stan Spencer that set the tone for
the evening's rout.
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman's lead did not last long. Piazza's solo homer
in the third was his 28th of the season, too _ and the All-Star
catcher's fifth in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza cannot seem to make much of a dent in the club rbi lead,
however. Ventura, whose candidacy for the league's most valuable
player award grows stronger by the day, has led the team nearly all
season. He now has an even 100 rbi to 91 for Piazza, with a little
more than six weeks to go in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   While Ventura and Piazza provided the runs, Masato Yoshii made
the most of them. After allowing a run-scoring double to Tony Gwynn
in the first, Yoshii (8-8) settled down to retire the next 16
Padres in a row. In all, he allowed one run on six hits as he
tossed the Mets' second complete game of the season with his second
straight strong start.
</P>
<P>
   The only bad news came in the fifth when Rickey Henderson
strained his left ring finger trying to turn a single into a double
in an 8-1 game. Henderson, who was thrown out by Gwynn, had to
leave the game. There was a touch of irony in that, though. Had
Henderson hustled out his leadoff double in the ninth inning on
Tuesday, he might have had a triple instead _ and the Mets might be
enjoying a two-game lead over the Braves as they flew home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Rickey today,'' Valentine said on Wednesday
afternoon, hours after Henderson had admired the flight of his near
home run on Tuesday. It caromed off the left-field wall and never
reached the seats, as Henderson was hoping. He cruised into second
with a double and was stranded there to end the Mets' 3-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could have been on third, I wish he was,'' Valentine
said. ``We talked and we're fine. We're absolutely on the same
wavelength. If that was a triple, I think he'll be on third base
the next triple he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word was if.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I keep prefacing this thing,'' Valentine said.
``It's over. I don't know if he would have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever know what would have happened had Henderson
been standing on third. But while many people felt Henderson should
have had a leadoff triple, Henderson was definitely not one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wouldn't have made a difference,'' the 40-year-old
left fielder said when he was asked if he could have made it to
third if he was running full-speed. ``I don't get out of the box
that good anymore when I hit a fly ball like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? We're talking about baseball's career stolen base leader
here, the guy who led the major leagues with 66 of them last
season, the same guy who had a respectable 29 steals coming into
Wednesday night. But Henderson has been plagued by nagging injuries
to various quadriceps, hamstrings and knees this season. And this
afternoon, Valentine said Henderson's hip flexor injury is ``not a
thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's flap was, as far as Valentine was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson put it behind him rather quickly, too. He led off
Wednesday night's game with a single, took second one out later on
a John Olerud single, advanced to third on a Piazza line out, then
scored with Olerud on Ventura's three-run first pitch blast.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres rallied for a first-inning run of their own on a
one-out Eric Owens single, a stolen base, and Gwynn's run-scoring
double to left. But the Mets made it 4-1 in the top of the second
on Benny Agbayani's leadoff double and Rey Ordonez's run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   And then Piazza unloaded off Spencer with one out in the third
to tie Ventura for the team lead in homers, as the Mets went up by
5-1. Spencer (0-6) departed for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the
inning, after 75 pitches. Carlos Almanzar fared little better in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza grounded a single between short and third with the bases
loaded in the fourth for his 90th and 91st runs batted in of the
season. The Mets led by 7-1. And they were about to head home all
alone in first after making their first Western swing of the season
a smashing success.

SPARKS USE BENCH IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks got a big boost from
their bench and moved one step closer to their goal of hosting the
first round of the WNBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With reserve forward Allison Feaster leading the way with a
career-high 16 points, the bench contributed 41 points in the
Sparks' 72-54 rout of the Minnesota Lynx in front of 8,943 at the
Forum Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we've been concerned about is getting
our bench involved,'' Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge. ``We're going
to need everybody to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (19-11) are within a win from securing home-court
advantage. They host Western Conference champions Houston Friday
and end the season at Utah Saturday. If they win at least one game
they will host the Sacramento Monarchs in the single-elimination
playoff game Tuesday. The Sparks, second in the Western Conference,
are one-half game ahead of the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   They won it without needing much from Lisa Leslie, who was sick
with a cold. The 6-foot-5 center scored only two points in 14
minutes. But the rest of the Sparks stepped up with everyone
contributing except for Nina Bjedov, who sat out her fourth game in
a row with a strained back.
</P>
<P>
   Tamecka Dixon scored 10 points and Penny Toler had nine, plus
three assists and three rebounds, while Gordana Grubin had 13
points among the starters. Feaster, who averages 12 minutes, played
23 as she went 6 of 9 from the field, including two 3-pointers in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad that coach gave me the opportunity,'' Feaster
said. ``I just tried to be aggressive and make the best of my
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks outrebounded the Lynx 44-16.
</P>
<P>
   The rout started in the midway through the first half when the
Sparks stretched the game out with a 16-0 run to go ahead 38-18
with 2:19 to go before the half. The Lynx (14-16) went seven
minutes without scoring a basket until Katie Smith, who will be
teammates with Leslie and DeLisha Milton on the USA national team,
broke the drought with a 3-pointer from the left baseline a minute
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big impact in the game and we never had an answer
for it,'' Lynx coach Brian Agler said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of reason is because he held leading scorer, Brandy Reed,
out of the lineup for the fourth consecutive game. Reed has been
disciplined for violation of team rules in the past. The Lynx are
2-2 without her.
</P>
<P>
   Agler declined to comment on why he held Reed out again, but he
did forecast the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is the team to beat, but if any team can beat Houston,
it's L.A.''

   He practiced internal medicine for 22 years in Puyallup, Wash.,
before retiring two years ago, and has long been interested in
international relief work. He has been a full-time volunteer with
Northwest Medical Teams since his retirement, helping to coordinate
shipment of surplus supplies and equipment to needy countries.
</P>
<P>
   This will his first trip as part of a medical relief team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine it will be like a first-aid station, working as a
team,'' said Spiger, who lives in Graham, about 20 miles southeast
of Tacoma. ``You can imagine the need, with thousands and thousands
of people injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will be based in Izmit, the epicenter of Tuesday's
7.4-magnitude quake that killed nearly 4,000 and injured more than
18,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially our team will be working with medical professionals
that are already at work, helping with crush wounds,'' said Eric
Odell, spokesman for Northwest Medical Teams.
</P>
<P>
   Spiger's team, which is bringing a shipment of medical supplies,
also will assist with stemming diseases associated with
contaminated water lines and decaying bodies, Odell said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related effort, the Turkish American Cultural Association
in the Seattle area is planning to load the same Boeing plane with
more than 80 boxes of donated clothing, blankets, sleeping bags and
canned food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even (stop to) eat something,'' said John Gokcen,
vice president of the 1,000-member association, panting after an
afternoon of packing boxes at his Kirkland home. ``If we can help
the people who need it, it will be a relief for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gokcen's group on Wednesday received 55 boxes of canned food
from Fred Meyer stores, 100 T-shirts from Tully's Coffee and
packing containers from the U-Haul Co., in addition to private
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that will carry the relief supplies and medical team
was bought by Turkish Airlines. Its initial cargo was only going to
be 3 tons of textbooks sent by San Diego State University to a new
university in Istanbul. When disaster struck, Thursday's scheduled
delivery of the plane became fortuitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a brand-new airplane is leaving the factory and going to an
area in need, we try to make sure _ with the airline's approval _
that it doesn't go empty,'' said Carol Cella, a Boeing spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the airline delivery schedule,'' she said. ``It's
not often that a delivery will coincide with a disaster, but we're
very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with its airline customers and relief agencies, Boeing
is involved with 30 to 40 international relief efforts a year and
has transported nearly 1,000 tons of supplies worldwide since 1992,
Cella said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Christian relief and development agencies based in the
Seattle area are accepting donations to help earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   World Concern will transfer all donations received in the next
two weeks to International Protestant Fellowship, an organization
already at work in Turkey. Donations can be sent to World Concern,
19393 Fremont Ave. N., Seattle, WA 98133. Checks should be
earmarked for ``Turkey earthquake relief.''
</P>
<P>
   World Vision will use donations to send supplies or to assist
relief organizations in Turkey. Donations can be sent to World
Vision, P.O. Box 9716, Federal Way, WA 98063. For more information,
call 888-56-CHILD.
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to help Northwest Medical Teams can make a
donation to the organization's account at any branch of U.S. Bank
of Washington. Gifts should be designated for the Turkish relief
fund.

DREIFORT MAKES PITCH TO STAY IN ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 WRITETHRU (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Darren Dreifort doesn't want to broach the subject
of bullpen vs. starting rotation. He has heard it for too long.
</P>
<P>
   A few more efforts like the seven-hit, 7-0 shutout the Los
Angeles Dodgers right-hander threw against Florida on Wednesday and
Dreifort won't have to worry about being banished to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dreifort's second shutout and second complete game of his
career. It also helped the Dodgers avoid being swept three games by
the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might make a starter yet,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said with a chuckle. ``He stayed in a good grove, threw some
quality breaking balls against a good fastball-hitting club. That,
to me, is what I call an outstanding pitching performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive start of Dreifort's career came in
front of his dad, John, who flew in from his Kansas home to see his
son pitch at Dodger Stadium for the first time since his rookie
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, plagued by control problems for most of his career,
did not walk a batter. He has walked just five in his last five
starts. Dreifort (10-12) struck out four, didn't allow a Marlin
past second base and had four perfect innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a double-edged sword,'' Dreifort said of
pitching so well. ``It feels good to get it, but I wish I would
have gotten it a couple of months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's other shutout came in May 1998, when he beat Arizona
5-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking toward September: Rosters expand from 25 to 40 on
Sept. 1, and the Dodgers have started to talk about possible
call-ups. Johnson recently met with Dodgers farm director Bill
Geivett to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dual purpose (for call-ups),'' Johnson said. ``You
look and see if a guy should be on the 40-man in the winter, and
look at what kind of role they may have on next year's club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't have many options at the minor-league level,
but Johnson said he expects to go heavy with middle infielders and
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing pitcher is Greg Gagne, who's 12-4
with a 2.71 ERA with Double-A San Antonio. Gagne is the only player
below Triple-A Albuquerque expected to get a late-season look.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Jeff Williams (9-5, 4.66 ERA), Matt Herges (8-3, 4.73)
and Ricky Stone (5-8, 5.41) and infielders Adam Riggs (.286), Alex
Cora (.329) and Juan Castro (.283) are all probables.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Dodgers are expected to bring catcher Angel Pena back
once rosters expand.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that lefty Carlos Perez, who's in the first year
of a three-year, $15.5 million contract and is the minor's
highest-paid pitcher, isn't likely to make it back to the Dodgers
before Sept. 1. Perez, who pitches today, is 1-2 with a 7.94 ERA
with Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Carlos, it looks like he needs a couple more
starts,'' Johnson said. ``Carlos may be a September call-up.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow:!Dugout club seats:The Dodgers announced their plans for
the Dugout Club seating that will close the distance between the
catcher and backstop by 25 feet. It's part of the continuing
renovations at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dugout Club Lounge will have a bar, restaurant and bar-style
seating, a buffet area and 23 television monitors, and seat 565
fans. The first row is 58 feet from home plate. Tickets for the
first two rows will be $225. The remaining 485 seats will be $195.
It's expected to be ready for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra bases:Right-hander Robinson Checo will pitch in a rehab
assignment for Class A San Bernardino today. Righty Antonio Osuna
will accompany Checo, but Dodgers officials said they weren't sure
whether Osuna would pitch. . . . The Dodgers will wear a patch
honoring Pee Wee Reese, who died Saturday at the age of 81. The
black-colored ``Pee Wee 1'' patch is sewn onto the Dodgers uniform
above the existing Dodgers hero patches.

MORE NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS EXPECTED TO BE FOUND AT BLAINE, WASH.,
SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLAINE, Wash. _ Archaeologists expect to find more skeletal
bones among dirt excavated from Blaine's waste-water treatment
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lummi Tribe continues to wait for an apology from
the city, which failed to notify the tribe when workers dug up
skeletal remains of 28 Native Americans and allowed some of the
bones to be shipped out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is determining who and where best to send it (the
apology),'' said John Hobberlin, the mayor of Blaine, a city of
3,500 located near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal prosecutors are investigating whether the
city, its contractor or hired archaeologist violated criminal and
civil laws when they did not report initially finding the remains
July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, government officials and tribal leaders were among
three dozen people who Wednesday visited the excavation site at
Semiahmoo, located a few miles southwest of Blaine.
</P>
<P>
   City officials were not invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions,'' said Timothy
Ballew, chairman of the Lummi Indian Business Council, the tribe's
elected ruling body. ``It's frustrating that they (city officials)
haven't talked to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe is pushing for criminal charges, Ballew said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney General Susan Roe said investigators are
looking into whether federal laws protecting archaeological sites,
and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting was called to determine how to proceed,
particularly with repatriating other remains.
</P>
<P>
   State, federal and tribal archaeologists believe more skeletal
bones will be found amid mounds of dirt piled at the site and a
nearby landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Kinley's grandfather and great-grandmother were born and
reared in the coastal village where the waste-water treatment plant
now stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our family,'' Kinley said, gesturing toward the site
where dirt is piled 15 feet high between dormant yellow and red
cranes. ``So it's very difficult. The people who were buried here
and who were disturbed were our family.''
</P>
<P>
   City, federal and tribal officials signed an agreement in
January requiring the city to notify the tribe should remains be
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The city discovered that the site was a Native American burial
ground when it built the first phase of the waste-water treatment
plant in the 1970s. At the time, skeletal remains and artifacts
found at the site were sent to researchers at Western Washington
University in Bellingham without the tribe being notified.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe fought several years to repatriate the remains and
signed an agreement this year to prevent that from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that there were remains here,'' state senator Georgia
Gardner said as she visited the site Wednesday. ``Instead of making
sure that history didn't repeat itself, we've allowed it to happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the $7.6 million project was halted two weeks
ago. State and federal officials said they did not know when it
would resume.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe first learned of the skeletal remains when a member
visited the site two weeks ago and heard that bones had been found.
The remains could be from 150 to 4,000 years old, the tribe said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two tribal officials flew to the Denver offices of Golder
Associates, the archaeological consultant firm, and discovered some
of the remains in boxes and paper bags in the back of a pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the city should be held accountable for its
actions, Hobberlin declined to comment. Blaine and Golder
Associates have both retained an attorney, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the city is waiting to hear from all the agencies
involved to figure out what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we find out what we're supposed to do, we'll take the
appropriate action,'' Hobberlin said, adding that the city also had
heard from the White House on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The remains discovered at the construction site come from 28
burials and range from bones of individuals to full skeletons. The
remains were removed between July 26 and Aug. 2, Ballew said.

PIGGY BANKS CAUSE NATIONAL SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wells Fargo Bank is having a hard time getting
its hands on some cash. Pennies, specifically.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based bank was going to award 1 million
pennies -- along with a number of other prizes -- to its millionth
Internet customer today, but can't scrape together enough copper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get 1 million pennies,'' Kathy Shilkret, Wells
spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A multibillion-dollar bank doesn't have 1 million pennies?
Apparently, an increased national demand for the coin is leading to
a shortfall. It was first felt on the East Coast, but the shortage
finally has made its way to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? Circulation, according to Calvin Naito, spokesman
for the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While there are plenty of pennies around -- 312 billion have
been made by the U.S. Mint -- only 114 billion are in use. That
works out to 426 pennies for every man, woman and child in America.
</P>
<P>
   The rest probably are stored in jars, hidden under sofa cushions
or accidentally dropped between the cracks of car seats.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities are urging the public to cough up their
bronze Abes, even as the U.S. Mint increases production to probably
top its 1994 record of 19 billion pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is there are too many people with piggy banks at
home with pennies in them,'' Naito said. ``We need more people to
carry their piggy banks to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint is working at least six days a week, 24 hours a
day to churn out more pennies. The mints in Philadelphia and
Denver, which are the largest in the world, have increased penny
production by one-third from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America spokeswoman Jane Goodman said the penny supply
is tight for the Los Angeles area, but that the bank has been able
to meet customer demands.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there is no penny shortage at a Los Angeles
location of the 99 Cents Only Stores. One would assume customers
need a penny in change for every dollar they spend.
</P>
<P>
   But the store manager has a simple explanation why they don't
give out as many pennies as one would think: sales tax.

 &HT;    Patchwork Reds can't be ignored
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves are locked in a divisional chase with the
Mets, and yet the Mets aren't the immediate threat. The Braves can
finish five games behind New York and still reach the World Series.
Danger lies elsewhere. Danger sits in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Figure it this way: The Mets and Astros, high-salaried clubs
dotted with name players, will make the playoffs. Their star
wattage dimmed by injury, the Braves mightn't fend off both
worthies over the course of 162 games. Fine. That isn't required.
To qualify for postseason the Braves must stay ahead of the
second-best team in the NL Central, which most years would be a
simple task. But this isn't most years, and the Reds aren't most
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds entered the season with the 11th-fattest payroll in a
16-team league. The Braves' three priciest pitchers will earn a
collective $25.3 million this season. Cincinnati's entire
opening-day roster was slated to make $33.2 million. Yet the Reds
awoke Wednesday to find themselves tied with Houston atop the NL
Central, owners of the fewest losses among NL teams.
</P>
<P>
   On talent, the Astros should nose past the Reds to take the
Central, but this band of overachievers can still author the
ultimate in overachieving by wresting the wild card from Atlanta or
New York. Small-market franchise trumps big-ticket rival: It'd be a
nice story for baseball, a sport annually cheapened by its monetary
imbalance. If you're Cleveland, where's the glory in winning a
division in which nobody else is trying?
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are trying. The Reds are playing beyond their meager
means. Aaron Boone, the third baseman, earns one-tenth what older
brother Bret does, but Boone the younger is outhitting his sibling
by nearly 50 percentage points. Sean Casey is hitting .341 and
making $220,000. Right field is a cobbled-together collective _
Jeffrey Hammonds, Dmitri Young and erstwhile Brave Michael Tucker _
that has produced 84 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about this team seems dazzling, nothing save the
results. Tuesday's game can stand as a case study. The unheralded
starter Ron Villone left after six innings, the score tied.
Relievers Danny Graves, Scott Williamson and Gabe White limited
Pittsburgh to two hits and no runs over the next six innings. Chris
Stynes, hitting .176 at the time, won it with a homer in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   A bullpen that looked shaky three months ago _ remember, the
Reds were desperate enough to trade for Mark Wohlers _ has been
Cincy's salvation. The Reds have gotten 33 saves and 19 wins from
Graves and Williamson, who together are making $482,000 less than
Russ Springer. Collectively the Reds' relief has propped up a
rotation that, with the addition of deadline tradee Juan Guzman and
the return of Denny Neagle from injured reserve, has recently
solidified.
</P>
<P>
   Even in their weakened state, you wouldn't pick the Braves to
finish behind the Reds. (Behind the Mets, you probably would.) This
is baseball, where generally teams get what they pay for. But there
is about these Reds a look that should be unsettling to their
richer brethren. It's a look seldom seen in this sport anymore.
It's a lean and hungry look.

GRANT YOU THIS, HUGH IS UNASSUMINGLY CHARMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In interviews promoting the gangster romantic comedy ``Mickey
Blue Eyes,'' Hugh Grant has often been quoted as saying that he
rewrote his character and his lines to make both funnier. He might
as well say that he rescued the film, because without him, it would
have sunk like a pair of cement boots.
</P>
<P>
   Even with him, it just barely keeps its humorous head above
water. Although the screenplay has its share of funny moments, it's
so slight and contrived that its plot sequencing seems to be held
together by paper clips. It's also so similar to this spring's
``Analyze This,'' which was just released on video, that it even
features some of the same actors. Like ``Analyze This,'' Mickey is
about a ``civilian'' who gets mixed up with the mob. Like ``Analyze
This,'' ``Mickey'' features the teaming of a comic star and a
``Godfather'' series alumnus. And, as in ``Analyze This,'' a
wedding hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the two you prefer will probably depend on your taste
for pacing and for Grant's diffident acting style. ``Mickey'' is a
less frantic film than ``Analyze This,'' and director Kelly Makin _
who made the drastically uneven ``Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy'' _
handles it with a steady, journeyman style that places the movie
completely in its actors' hands. It's not like Makin has a sense of
vision so much as it's like he knew that with a talented cast, all
he had to do was make sure the cameras were running.
</P>
<P>
   Grant plays Michael Felgate, an art-house auctioneer who's
happily involved with schoolteacher Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn, more
appealing than usual because she turns down her shrillness a
notch). Everything is going fine till Michael proposes to her (in a
Chinese-restaurant scene that's funny despite its racial
stereotyping), and she freaks out. It's only after she freaks that
Michael _ who's a little slow on the uptake _ discovers that Gina's
father (James Caan) is a big guy in the mob. Michael also gradually
discovers that ``family ties,'' in this case, has more than one
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between ``Analyze This'' star Billy Crystal's
acting style and Grant's shtick is the difference between an actor
saying ``Aren't I cute?'' and an actor saying ``I know I'm cute,
but I'm embarrassed about it,'' and it's Grant's sheepishness that
makes ``Mickey'' preferable to the earlier film. Grant has an
offhand way with a punch line that makes it seem unscripted, so
that you don't think you're watching a movie that's designed to
have a laugh track. Caan teams with him with such ease that you
forget it's Caan up there; when he tries to teach Michael some
Brooklynese, it's a highlight, even though it's a direct steal from
a bit in ``Donnie Brasco.'' Other funny bits come in an
Italian-restaurant scene and in the movie's climax, although sharp
viewers will be able to figure out how things will end up.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Makin and screenwriters Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn
deserve at least a little credit for the movie's funniest moments,
and character actors Burt Young and James Fox offer solid support
as bosses of different types (former ``Kid in the Hall'' Scott
Thompson, a very funny guy, is wasted in a straight role as an FBI
agent). But this is Grant's show; he and longtime love Elizabeth
Hurley took a lot of care in their production work on it, and his
affection for the material shows. It's as charming and lightweight
as Grant's on-screen persona, and in this season of comedies that
try to ram themselves down your throat, one that's this
ingratiating is a welcome albeit not overwhmlling sight.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hey, it's the Son of Sam hour!
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 22, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of those channel-surfing nights. Weary of the
slam-bam action movies, the silly sitcoms and sports events that
held no interest, I surfed over to ``Larry King Live'' on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And who was it Larry was talking with? I couldn't believe it.
David Berkowitz, a.k.a. Son of Sam; murderer of six women, fiend.
In Texas or Florida, he's dead meat by now. In no-death-penalty New
York, however, he gets to spend an hour on the air with Larry King
while waiting out his 300-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, many have accused King of throwing up
marshmallows to his guests. I don't think that; what I really
believe is that King asks decent questions but accepts marshmallows
for answers.
</P>
<P>
   This was the case with King and Berkowitz. Example: King asks,
``But for people watching, especially younger people who don't
know, why _ first, what was it like to kill someone first time you
killed someone? We all wonder about something like that. What was
it like?''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz clutches his Bible. ``Larry, I don't want to dwell on
that much, and _ I don't dwell on it at all. It was a horrible
thing. It was a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, I feel so sorry for Berkowitz, that horrible thing he had
to go through. It must have been rough shooting all those women.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the interview was atrocious, if not promotional.
Spike Lee's film version of Berkowitz's rampage hit theaters a few
weeks ago, much to the horror of the victims' survivors who had to
relive their most dreadful memories. Now, seemingly riding
piggyback on the movie's notoriety, CNN and King gave Berkowitz the
air time. The message of the hour: Poor old David, he had his bad
days but that's all behind him now. He's in touch with a forgiving
God.
</P>
<P>
   King lets Berkowitz get away with the tiresome alibi of a lousy
childhood. It's not King's questions that are appalling; it's
Berkowitz's answers. And always, Berkowitz is referring to the
Scriptures. Sometime in his 22 years in prison, the fiend found God
and Jesus. Guys in the slammer for a long time usually do. The
trick is to find God before you do the things that put you in the
slammer.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, I'm glad Berkowitz listens to God now. When he was
doing his murdering, he said he was acting on orders of his
neighbor's dog _ Sam.
</P>
<P>
   I've known King since his days in the 1950s when he'd show up at
the Miami baseball park with his pack of cigarettes rolled up in
the sleeve of his T-shirt, when he was doing sports for a one-lung
radio station. When I was managing editor of The Miami News, I
hired him to write a notes column for the newspaper. I often was a
guest on his Miami radio interviews, and never really had a
marshmallow tossed at me. We talked about controversial subjects
and he kept me on my toes.
</P>
<P>
   But this Berkowitz thing. Why did they foul the air with Son of
Sam? Who's CNN and King going to give air time to next? How about
the guy who shot up the Jewish Community Center and killed the
mailman? He's going to find God any minute now.
</P>
<P>
   As King prompted to his last commercial, he left us with this
astonishing utterance:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back with our remaining moments. We'll have a prayer
as well _ stay with us _ after this.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't get to the TV set fast enough. Click!
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to have David Berkowitz sermonizing to me. I've
already had enough of his implying that God had forgiven him for
what he had done. I don't think the victims have forgiven him,
though. And neither have I and neither have you.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, out of curiosity, I went to CNN's online site
and read the text of Berkowitz's prayer. It was from Second
Chronicles, Chapter Seven, about humbling yourself and turning from
your wicked ways. Nice passage, David, but years too late to help
six women.
</P>
<P>
   As the bizarre program closed, Berkowitz proclaimed, ``God bless
you, Larry. You're in my prayers.'' And Larry answered back: ``God
bless. Thank you, David.''
</P>
<P>
   And I wondered to myself, what in hell are some of our media
coming to?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Execution as a solution to mental illness
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death has taken a rare holiday in the Texas criminal justice
system, but don't expect it to stay long at the beach. The Texas
death penalty has a work ethic like no other.
</P>
<P>
   By a one-vote margin the state's Court of Criminal Appeals has
delayed an execution until a lower court decides whether the
murderer, Larry Keith Robinson, is competent to be killed _ that
is, is not so crazy he doesn't understand he is being executed.
</P>
<P>
   That Robinson is mentally ill, and gravely so, is not in serious
doubt. His mother had tried for years to have him committed to a
mental hospital for treatment of his paranoid schizophrenia, only
to see him bounced out within weeks each time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Robinson, in a particularly revolting rampage,
repeatedly stabbed, beheaded and sexually mutilated his roommate,
then killed four neighbors, including an 11-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Texas ranked 48th among states in mental health
services and it has not been exactly setting speed records to catch
up since then.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any one humane principle that ought to restrain
capital punishment, it is that we will kill no one so profoundly
impaired they could not stop themselves. Instead, states typically
rely solely on the very narrow issue of whether a murderer could
tell right from wrong, even if he or she was unable to act on that
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Politics runs strongly contrary even to that baseline decency.
Remember when Bill Clinton, first seeking the presidency, flew home
to preside theatrically over the execution of a man so impaired he
asked that his last-meal dessert be saved so he could have it after
the execution?
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the turn of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, running for the
presidency, to shrug off even the most dubious executions, as he
has in all but one case; as he did again in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is especially energetic in its death chamber. It has
killed 184 people since 1974, 98 just since January 1995, 21 so far
this year. Executions have become so commonplace that little notice
was taken when four were carried out in short order early this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Texans are simply worse people than other Americans,
though there's no reason to think so. In any event, they are not
better people for all their killing. There is no more respite from
crime in Texas than in most states.
</P>
<P>
   The courts and prisons are our mental health system of last
resort _ in a nation where there often isn't a first resort. We
have failed to establish a broad-based, easily accessible and
determined mental health system. We substitute prison for
treatment, with execution as the ultimate cure.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's crimes were hideous almost beyond imagining,
pathological by their very nature. But figure this: If he is now
found incompetent to be executed, Texas will finally labor like the
very dickens to make him sane enough to understand execution _ and
then it will kill him.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than one pathology at work here.

   QUAKE-PREDICTION (San Francisco) _ Earthquake forecasters
apparently predicted Tuesday's devastating earthquake in Turkey two

Still, if it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one. By KEAY

   HISPANICS-PAY (San Francisco) _ The wages of Hispanic workers in
California lag far behind those of other ethnic groups, and a

$14,560 a year, Latinos make about $8,000 less than the next-lowest
group, African Americans, according to the report. By EMILY GURNON.

 &HT;    An idyllic trip back to a far cooler climate
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPKINTON, N.H. _ It is 45 degrees at 5:30 a.m. on the 10th of
August as I begin my walk-jog down Farrington Corner Road. I am
wearing a sweatshirt and shorts, the sweatshirt purchased in the
old ship-building town of Portsmouth the day before, when I
realized my East Texas-thinned blood was actually cold while
walking around.
</P>
<P>
   A novel feeling: cold in August.
</P>
<P>
   For five days, I've reveled in being somewhere you can see
breath vapors during the dog days while exercising, the Walkman
broadcasting NPR news, fog rising off Boutwell Pond across the road
from my grandmother's house _ the pond where I ice skated as a
child and once nearly died when I fell through the ice into the
frigid water. My cousins hauled me out like I was a sack of
potatoes and got me back to my grandparents' house, where I sat
shivering in front of the fire for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe death wasn't imminent when I fell through the ice, but it
felt that way to me, a chill seeping through me, their disembodied
voices calling frantically from above as I thrashed about, looking
for a handhold.
</P>
<P>
   The pond that tried to kill me is low this summer because of the
drought. This spot of land is now a wildlife refuge maintained by
the Audubon Society, after a generous resident saved it from being
turned into a subdivision. The John Brockway Nature Preserve is
home to beavers, though they've apparently taken a summer vacation,
their felled trees piled up against a man-made stone dam; to black
bears who on occasion raid my uncle's garden or my grandmother's
bird feeder; to deer and even an occasional moose. On this trip,
though I make a point at the end of each dawn hike to walk through
the preserve, the only four-legged wildlife I see are deer.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better walk I've found than Farrington Corner Road
in August when you've escaped an East Texas summer for a few days.
So little has changed since I left 30 years ago to become a
transplanted Texan. The prettiest farm in America is still down the
road from my grandmother's _ Maplewood Farm _ with its stone fence,
verdant pasture, saltbox house and munificent barn, both painted
yellow. It is the end point of my walk each morning, just so I can
drink in its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother is waiting for me when I return about 6:30,
reading The Concord Monitor and munching on a piece of toast. As
she has every morning for 43 years since my long-dead grandfather
built this house, she sits at the tiny chrome-dinette table in
front of a picture window that looks out over a modest brook
(that's what we call a creek in East Texas) and an explosion of
flowers. A pair of chickadees peck at the bird seed on the feeder
just outside the window. Since I was a child, there has been a pair
of chickadees eating bird seed at that feeder. I figure this must
be the 105th or so generation to feast at the Bourque window.
</P>
<P>
   Hedwig Bourque, my grandmother, is 92, and lives by herself
though son Emil lives next door, and two other children are just
minutes away. It's strange to think of my aunts and uncles as
children, since all my grandmother's offspring are in their 60s or
pushing 70.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy has shrunk a bit since my last visit three years ago, her
spine more curved as the day progresses so that I positively tower
over her by nightfall, me at an exceedingly modest 5'6''. She's a
little harder of hearing, but she still has a sparkle in her eye, a
work ethic that won't quit and a French-Canadian accent that seems
to get thicker with age. She's cute as a bedbug.
</P>
<P>
   She is happy to have her three grandsons from Texas visiting,
though she at times forgets which one is which and refers to the
one temporarily absent as ``the other one.'' As in, where did ``the
other one go?''
</P>
<P>
   When we get in each night from visiting or sightseeing, Grammy
is propped in front of the TV, watching sports and crocheting an
afghan. She has made untold numbers of afghans for grandchildren,
great-grandchildren and even generations beyond that. Grammy loves
to watch golf, basketball, baseball and pro wrestling. She says it
beats the heck out of all that ``gossip'' on the soap operas and
prime-time shows. I can't argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   As the vacation ends, we all hug and head to Boston to catch
planes to our three different homes in Texas. Grammy smiles and
tells us to come back anytime. We promise to be back next summer,
and she says in her broken French accent that she plans on being
around.
</P>
<P>
   I believe she will be there next summer and summers after that,
feeding the chickadees in the morning and watching the Red Sox at
night. She's a tough one.

 &HT;    ?Que paso? It turns out I'm passe
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I've been many things in my life. I've been a
Latin, Latin American, Spanish boy, a Mexican American, Chicano _
and these days people think it's trendy to call me Hispanic or
Latino.
</P>
<P>
   (Q: When does a Mexican become a Hispanic? A: When he marries
your daughter.)
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, I read in no less a publication than Time
magazine that we were all about to embark on the Decada Hispana _
the decade of the Hispanic. Things worked out for me, more or less,
but that good fortune was not universally shared, unfortunately.
Demographic data reveal some economic progress but not the boom
that was predicted. The progress was hindered, of course, by that
economic bust that got everybody, but was particularly hard on
those at the bottom of the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Now I read in no less a publication than Newsweek about how
bright a future Hispanos have. We are hip, we are trendy, we are
what's happening in entertainment, politics, business. Ay, Dios
mio, the picture painted was so bright, I reached for my Ray-Bans
halfway through the piece. Had to give that up, though, because I
couldn't get my reading glasses back on.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just as well, because Newsweek wasn't talking either
to or about me, or anyone who has passed over the dreaded 30-, 40-
or 50-year threshold in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   That piece focused on Hispanics in their 20s, who, Newsweek
pronounced, are going to reshape America. Newsweek, it seems,
reported that Time's prophecy was to come true _ just a few mananas
late.
</P>
<P>
   I have to confess to having mixed feelings about that.
</P>
<P>
   I'm excited by the prospects projected by Newsweek. I cheer the
move toward political and economic independence. I rejoice that
Latino entertainers like Ricky Martin are achieving the crossover
success that largely eluded artists like Little Joe and Sonny
Ozuna.
</P>
<P>
   Both those Texans (Little Joe is from Temple and Ozuna is from
San Antonio) had brushes with crossover fame. Little Joe and Willie
Nelson teamed up on an English/Spanish version of ``Solamente Una
Vez'' and Ozuna had a crossover encounter in the 1950s with ``Talk
to Me,'' but the attention they got was minimal when compared with
the adulation heaped on Martin and Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Good for them, though. I wish Martin, Lopez and every other
Latino entertainer great success. The same goes for that generation
of young Latinos of all endeavors who are going to enter their own
in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Newsweek article moved me to mutter a
barrio-ism: ``?Y yo, que?'' That translates roughly to ``What about
me?''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from all those other things I've been (and those are just
the printable ones), I'm now over the hill _ or bien veterano _
written off by a national magazine. I guess the time has come and
gone for Chicano Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Darn, just when things are getting good, we get run off again.
La madre, as they say.
</P>
<P>
   Guess I'll call Gonzalo Barrientos, the senator, Jesus Garza,
the city manager, Amalia Rodriguez-Mendoza, the Travis County
district clerk, Ricardo Romo, president of the University of
Texas-San Antonio, Al Gonzales, the Supreme Court Justice, Tony
Garza, the railroad commissioner, Ernest Garcia, the state district
judge, Olga Garza, the school board member, Gilberto Ocanes, the
businessman, and some others who are of my generation, and invite
them to come over and listen to Little Joe CDs and talk about the
Hispanic Decade that Newsweek implies we are going to miss.
</P>
<P>
   It will be news to them.

 &HT;    Authenticity shines through in tale of cowboys and Indians
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Olden Daze, as my grandkids like to call it, when I was a
youngster, playing cowboys and Indians was the thing to do.
Nowadays, best I can tell, the kids are playing like they're space
cadets or aliens or they don't play anything at all and spend their
time on computers and Nintendos, or however you spell it and
whatever that is.
</P>
<P>
   In the above mentioned Olden Daze, picture shows were often
about cowboys and Indians and TV shows were too, when that medium
came along. There were John Wayne, Buck Jones, and later
``Gunsmoke'' and ``Bonanza'' and all them on TV. These daze there
aren't any cowboys shows at the movies or on TV. The ones that are
on TV feature women doctors and such as that and most of the cowboy
shows are silly, with the hero getting beat up all the time. Boy,
you never saw Buck Jones or any of them get beat up, that's for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   And there used to be lots of books about cowboys and Indians,
and the old Street and Smith magazines had those good short stories
and rugged looking cowboys on their covers. Now there are few books
and no magazines starring cowboys and Indians. And the ones that
are, the books, are usually about cowboys in today's time frame
that are depressed about the passing of the Good Old Days.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few exceptions, of course, to prove the rule. Larry
McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove'' series is about as good as cowboy
books get, although they are kind of bloody and gory and the heroes
are always getting beat up or worse. Then, there's the books about
modern day Indians in New Mexico by Tony Hilleman, but they aren't
really cowboy and Indian stories in the traditional sense.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains in the foreground of American fiction at least
one cowboy author who has the respect of just about everyone who
loves good books _ our own Elmer Kelton, the San Angelo, Texas,
writer who never disappoints.
</P>
<P>
   Kelton has recently come out with another humdinger, ``The
Buckskin Line,'' a Forge Press of New York book that tells a dandy
story while reminding us of a lot of early day Texas Ranger
history.
</P>
<P>
   The story is set on the Texas frontier in the 1840s through the
early 1860s. The main character is a red-haired youth whose family
was massacred by Comanche raiders when he was four years old. He is
rescued by Mike Shannon, a Mexican War veteran riding with a
``ranging company'' of Texans loosely organized to protect settlers
from Indian raids. The Shannon family adopts the lad and he grows
up as a member of that family by the name Rusty Shannon. In 1861,
Rusty's adoptive father is murdered and he follows in his footsteps
as a member of a Ranger troop stationed near the Red River to keep
the Indians from raiding south out of the reservation in what would
one day be Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   It is a riotous time in the new Republic of Texas, that has
recently joined the USA and is now torn apart by the looming War
Between the States. Some Texans want to secede from the Union and
others, a minority, are just as dedicated to the idea of sticking
with the union. Kelton is particularly good at developing
characters that are sympathetic and real.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Kelton is probably the most honored contemporary Western
author. He has written over 40 books and is a six time winner of
the Spur Award and four Western Heritage Awards from the Cowboy
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I prefer his books to those by the late Louis
L'Amour. They are more authentic.

   TRAVEL-LLAMA _ PISGAH NATIONAL FOREST, N.C. _ B.B. the llama is
famished. Or so it seems. The 13-year-old, 400-pound pack animal
that trails me through a deliriously lush stretch of maintain
wilderness in the Pisgah National Forest is snarfing every
chlorophyll-producing thing in sight _ pine needles, hemlock
leaves, clumps of pungent sassafras, you name it. It's part of the
charm of English Mountain Llama Treks, unusual guided excursions
begun four years ago. Drawing from a stable of 30 llamas, the
owners add an element of animal magnetism to day hikes through
Pisgah and overnight hikes through the nearby Nantahala National
Forest. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH COLOR PHOTOS.

   COXNET ENTERTAINMENT 0819 -- You can understand why KISS once
held a nation of teen-age boys in its black-fingernailed grasp. Now
Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Peter Criss and Ace Frehley are
powdering 50-year-old faces. And their most devoted followers are
pushing middle age with no sign of surrendering their allegiance to
the KISS army. (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post) Art includes 4-column

</P>
<P>
   WITH: HOLOCAUST ANALYSIS -- Author Peter Novick, a historian at
the University of Chicago, has written ``The Holocaust in American
Life,'' trying to explain how the Holocaust has taken center stage

``perverse sacralization.'' (Rothstein, N.Y. Times News Service)

   BOOK-NOTES _ When Communism collapsed, a lot of techno-thriller
writers began scrambling for new material and new villains. For
some, like Stephen Coonts (``Flight of the Intruder''), they
weren't hard to find. ``The collapse of Communism didn't lower the
level of tension in the world, it raised it,'' says Coonts, who new
novel, ``Cuba,'' is about what happens in that country once Castro
dies. Other items: Georgia writer Terry Kay has signed a two-book
deal with Morrow; Not only is ``A Man in Full'' being published in
paperback in October, but look for new editions of all of Tom
Wolfe's prvious works. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

</P>
<P>

Turturro's weirdo turn of the century tale of a playwright. Grade:
B-. (Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 12.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-TINGLE _ Movie review of ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle.'' Kevin
Williamson (Hollywood's Mr. ``Scream'') is writer/director of this
schizoid high school movie about a trio of teens who hold their
devilish history teacher (Helen Mirren) hostage. The film can't
seem to find its groove. Is it a horror flick? A nasty-nice Disney
flick in disguise? One thing it's got for sure is a very grown-up
sex scene between young stars from ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Seventh
Heaven.'' Grade: C-. (Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 11.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-TRICK _ Movie review: ``Trick.'' A gay story of simple

Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS. MOVED WEDNESDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-GOLFSTYLES _ Every day, more and more Americans are heading
to the fairways and greens, and although most golfers don't have a
problem choosing the right club, the choice of wardrobe may be a
little more difficult. ``There is a high percentage of people who
just change their shoes to play golf,'' said PGA golf professional
Denny Biller at Dick's Sporting Goods on Springboro Pike. Yet
because most golf clubs have strictly enforced codes indicating
what attire is appropriate for their course, how should you dress?

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ HOPKINTON, N.H. _ It is 45 degrees at 5:30 a.m.
on the 10th of August as I begin my walk-jog down Farrington Corner
Road. I am wearing a sweatshirt and shorts, the sweatshirt
purchased in the old ship-building town of Portsmouth the day
before, when I realized my East Texas-thinned blood was actually
cold while walking around. A novel feeling: cold in August. I'm

<P>
   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Should pols' drug use be
forgiven? Is it our business? Can George W. Bush refuse to discuss
drug use? If Bush's answer was no, we'd probably have heard it long
ago. Oddly, Bush gets some cover from Clinton's tryst with Monica
Lewinsky. Americans got so sick of having the details rubbed in
their face that a majority may agree the question is irrelevant.
But can he turn what some politicians and reporters think is big
stuff into a nonissue? Over the next 15 months, we'll find out.

   BOOK-NOTES _ When Communism collapsed, a lot of techno-thriller
writers began scrambling for new material and new villains. For
some, like Stephen Coonts (``Flight of the Intruder''), they
weren't hard to find. ``The collapse of Communism didn't lower the
level of tension in the world, it raised it,'' says Coonts, who new
novel, ``Cuba,'' is about what happens in that country once Castro
dies. Other items: Georgia writer Terry Kay has signed a two-book
deal with Morrow; Not only is ``A Man in Full'' being published in
paperback in October, but look for new editions of all of Tom
Wolfe's prvious works. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   1 GORBACHEV'S SAD MISSION : TO SOOTHE HIS AILING WIFE, RAISA
Giulietto Chiesa, Moscow correspondent of the Italian daily
newspaper La Stampa, has become, over the years, one of the closest
friends of Mikhail Gorbachev. Chiesa spent two days with Gorbachev
in Munster, Germany, where Raisa Gorbachev is receiving hospital
treatment for a serious disease. ``I've told her the truth since
the beginning,'' says Gorbachev. ``She closed her eyes and for 40
minutes remained silent.'' In his conversations with Chiesa,
Gorbachev speaks about his private tragedy, the messages he
received from Clinton, Bush, Eltsin, Thatcher and many others.
``When we get out of here,'' said Raisa to Gorbachev, ``I would
like to live in a little house near the sea, where there is a lot
of sunshine, so that we can enjoy these last years we have.'' By
Giulietto Chiesa. From La Stampa. 3,000 words. (English translation
available.)

scenario foresees a war between Western Europe and its neighbours
over scarce water resources that leaves 25,000 people dead. Yet

 6 Venture Capitalists Gut Firms, Form Own
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Firing a generational shot across the bow, six young Silicon Valley
venture capitalists are splitting from their high-profile,
diversified firms to launch an Internet-only venture firm.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Yang of Institutional Venture Partners and John Walecka of
Brentwood Venture Capital, two golfing buddies who are known in
Silicon Valley as hotshot Web investors, have recruited four
colleagues to create a new, Internet-only venture firm.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the executives, who are all between the ages of
39 and 45, is notable because it sounds a death knell for Brentwood
and IVP, two venerable old Menlo Park firms.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not uncommon for young VCs to leave established
firms and start their own, this is the first time the leading
lights of two firms have joined forces and effectively killed their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   IVP and Brentwood will continue to manage their existing funds _
each has three _ but will not launch any new projects. The
departing partners will continue their oversight of the funds, the
last of which matures in 2008. At that point, IVP and Brentwood
will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Brentwood was founded in 1972, and IVP has been around since
1980. Since most old-line VC funds are controlled by their founding
partners, ``that has kept some of the guys who joined later from
making their own mark,'' said Reyes. ``They can do some deals, but
at end of the day ... (the founding partners' name) is still on the
front door.''
</P>
<P>
   IVP is currently the 20th-largest venture fund in the United
States, with $845 million under management, and Brentwood is 26th,
with $715 million, according to Venture Economics, a New Jersey
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Both are ranked in the top 25 percent of VC firms as measured by
net return on investment, said Jesse Reyes, Venture Economics'
director.
</P>
<P>
   Brentwood's investments include Apple Computer, WebTV and
Stamps.com, while IVP's portfolio has included Seagate, Excite and
Ask Jeeves.
</P>
<P>
   The new partnership, which will operate under the nickname
Project T-Rex until its formal launch in the fall, reflects two
fundamental splits in the venture capital sector, said people
familiar with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Young, entrepreneurial VC executives are growing tired of
working in the shadow of older partners. At the same time, many Web
VCs feel they are being held back by diversified funds that also
invest in &UR;  &LR; less-robust sectors such as biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating when the area you're in is making all the
returns and is where all the excitement is happening,'' said a
local venture capitalist who is friends with several members of the
Project T-Rex group. ``You think, `Why am I paying all this
overhead''' to support the less-profitable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, some of Brentwood and IVP's biotechnology partners
will announce a combination similar to the one disclosed today &LR; 
 &LR; yesterday by the Internet group. Its code name is Project
Pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Brentwood and IVP's information-technology
specialists is less clear, but they may also combine to form a
spin-off, said a person involved in Project T-Rex.
</P>
<P>
   Project T-Rex was hatched on the Sharon Heights country club in
Menlo Park. ``John and I were on the golf course saying, `Wouldn't
it be terrific if we could put these organizations together and
have a dream team?''' said Yang in an interview yesterday. Each of
the six executives, which include Jeff Brody and Tom Dyal from
Brentwood and Tim Haley and Brad Jones from IVP, specializes in a
different aspect of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling was that by putting the best of the firms together
and forming a focused Net tech fund and a focused life sciences
/health care fund, each could be one of the dominant few firms in
their respective industries,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to attract the top entrepreneurs with the hottest Web
startup ideas, said Walecka. ``They'll think, `These are powerful
people who can add the most value,' and that's the name of the game
in our business.`'
</P>
<P>
   The new group hopes to raise $500 million for its first fund.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the new venture believe Yang and his
partners are capable of reaching their lofty goals. But while
focusing narrowly on the Web may seem to make sense now _ many
other funds are doing the same thing _ it is a riskier strategy in
the long run than remaining diversified.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when the Net gets to be mainstream, like
microprocessors and PCs (two previously hot sectors for venture
capital) are today?'' said the venture capitalist familiar with
Project T-Rex. ``Then they will have to expand their field of
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   IVP founding partner Reid Dennis and Brentwood co-founder Kip
Hagopian will have ``advisory partner'' status with the new
company. Sam Colella, another longtime IVP partner, will be a
special partner and will help manage the biotech group.

 &UR; KALEIDOSCOPE CRAZE: Store Takes a Closer Look &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; BURLINGAME, Calif. _  &LR; The owner of  &UR; Kaleido &LR; , a new store in
Burlingame, is a woman obsessed. ``It's not a business, it's an
addiction,'' says Mary Wills. ``I sell kaleidoscopes to feed my
habit. I have 154 scopes just in my bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The store carries the work of 75 kaleidoscope makers. The
pictured ``It's a Wrap'' kaleidoscopes ($235) are wrapped in
colorful fabric, and each has a glass cell on the end filled with
charms suspended in fluid. The scope's inner mirrors reflect the
charms in a dynamic five-pointed star pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will enjoy the ``It's a Wrap'' series, although most of
them really appeal to adults, Wills says. One called ``Chinese
Takeout'' reflects prismed images of miniature chopsticks, rice and
fortune cookies, while ``Concerto'' has tiny images of musical
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new thing to collect. Scopes are left-brain and
right-brain objects; they appeal to people who like both finely
tuned machines and art,'' says Wills.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you're ready to start a collection, the store is
a bit like an old-fashioned laboratory, with elegant wood cabinets
and beautiful, well-crafted instruments to look through and marvel
at.

 EDITORS NOTE: This story includes an optional tip bar at the end.   Two Into One: Flat combines furnishings from an Arts and Crafts 
 house and a city loft  
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Jo Wunderlich bends toward a hallway shelf holding
seven photographs, her eyes softening as she peers into the gilded
frames.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These are all pictures from Ireland,'' she says, scanning
green hills hugging a church, fenced pastures snuggling the feet of
a lighthouse. ``We lived in Ireland a couple of months. They're all
from Donegal. My family's from Donegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip, part of a yearlong business assignment, brought
Wunderlich to her ancestral home but began a journey she and her
husband, Dennis Stradford, have just completed. In July, they moved
into a 2,200-square-foot flat in the Duboce Triangle area of San
Francisco, combining the familiar, comforting objects of the past
with new furnishings for a new urban lifestyle. This picking and
mixing confront everyone from newlyweds furnishing a first
apartment to retirees downsizing for simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the flat was perfect, but our living
requirements were different from the previous owner's,'' says
Wunderlich, who runs a food bank in Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done with it is a great combination of our
history,'' says Stradford, chief executive officer of Supplybase, a
San Francisco software startup.
</P>
<P>
   Wunderlich and Stradford lived in London in 1997, and the
excitement of city life bit hard. When they came home, the empty
nesters' 1913 Arts and Crafts house in Alameda seemed stodgy, and
the 700-square-foot Asian-inspired South of Market loft they bought
for fun weekends in San Francisco felt cold and cramped. The
furniture and accents were homey, but the places weren't. They
didn't seem to fit the couple's spirit anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living abroad changed everything,'' Wunderlich says.
</P>
<P>
   She and Stradford, missing city life, decided to roll their
house and their loft into one. They fell in love with the hilltop
flat, which has a view of the Bay and plenty of sunshine, thanks to
the fog-splitting hill in Buena Vista Park.
</P>
<P>
   They were ready to leap to a new home. ``In Alameda, we were
entrenched,'' Wunderlich says. ``We bought that house six months
after we were married, and we had lived there 24 years. The people
we knew there we'd known since our daughter, Karen, was a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   To help make a successful transition, the couple called on the
decorators who had helped them plan their loft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted us to help them define their aesthetic,'' says
Marion Philpotts, president of the San Francisco design company
Your Space Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Philpotts and Jonathan Staub, the company's vice president,
first interviewed Wunderlich and Stradford, asking how they
envisioned their new lifestyle, what their budget was and which
services they needed _ from color consulting to full-service
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Then the designers delved into personality. The starting point
of design, Staub says, is knowing the homeowners' heads and hearts,
helping them understand how their living space reflects and
enhances their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw they wanted some newness in their life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to be more stylish, a little more elegant,''
Philpotts adds.
</P>
<P>
   The next step: developing a furniture plan. Wunderlich and
Stradford decided which pieces they no longer needed _ called
``editing'' by interior designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the choices were dictated by space, like leaving the
dining set,'' Wunderlich says. ``It was a big Arts and Crafts-style
table that just went with perfectly with our old house, and we sold
it to the new owner. Some other pieces had outlived their life
expectancy.'' Bye-bye to an outworn couch; hello to a new dining
set for the flat's spacious dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Philpotts helped choose where the pieces would go in the
new scheme. She designated such changes as moving artwork by Plein
Air-style painter Jack Cassinetto to the new master bedroom from
the old living room. ``It was fun to watch her go through the house
and say, `This will work here' and `That will work there',''
Wunderlich says.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture required more precise decisions. ``For example, the
piano,'' Philpotts says. ``We made a big paper template of it in
Alameda and took it to the new flat to see how it would fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steinway grand piano ``is the heart of Dennis,'' she says.
He poured out classical compositions from the piano's perch in a
bay window at the Alameda house. Now it sits bathed in light from
the flat's broad front window, his favorite place in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Philpotts gave Wunderlich and Stradford homework; she advised
them what type of piece they needed and where they might find it,
but it was up to them to pick it out. ``She sends me out on
errands,'' Wunderlich says.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the designers encouraged nontraditional uses for
home accents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the couple wanted something to do the work of a
table next to a red mohair chair that's one of Stradford's
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Get something Asian' to go next to the chair. So I
went in this store in Chinatown, past all the tourist things, to
the back and found this.'' The flat-top set of three stacking
baskets fills the gap perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Wunderlich and Stradford found a low, wide chest to
use as a coffee table in the music room and a smaller chest for a
coffee table in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Philpotts and Staub also advised the couple to add fresh touches
_ a casual couch for the living room, one wall in the master
bedroom painted dramatic deep gold.
</P>
<P>
   The designers helped Wunderlich and Stradford streamline their
home. For example, they advised the couple to use low-care sisal
rugs in the high-traffic music room and living room.
</P>
<P>
   Yet pieces of the past surround Wunderlich and Stradford: a
library table and two bedside tansu from the Alameda house, a bar
from the loft. A painted Asian screen from the loft, which used to
add interest to a long, high wall, now enlivens the space behind
the mohair chair. In the guest room _ Wunderlich's office _ a
Japanese gate hangs over the bed; it used to hang over the couple's
bed in Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   Wunderlich's collection of Limoges boxes, some from a favorite
Paris shop and others received as gifts, used to sit on a tiered
table in the living room. The table didn't make the move; now the
boxes stay on a window shelf in the butler's pantry, away from the
danger of errant knees and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   On the balcony, a tabletop fountain reminds Wunderlich the new
yard needs renovation; she'd like to build a pond like one she had
in Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Wunderlich and Stradford contemplate the garden-to-be _
and much of their new city _ from the balcony, where two chairs
from the house face the bay. ``This really feels good,'' Wunderlich
says. ``It really feels like home.''

 &UR; TRICKS OF THE TRADE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Here are tips for combining two homes into one from San Francisco
interior designers Jonathan Staub and Marion Philpotts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edit'' before you move. Get rid of objects that are outdated,
worn out and no longer relevant to your life. Start with a clean
plate, and keep it simple.
</P>
<P>
   Think outside your normal box. Mix up your furniture from its
previous settings. Consider new combinations; move your old dining
room table into the entry hall or arrange your artwork in different
combinations or locations.
</P>
<P>
   Play with floor plans. Use tape or paper cutouts to get the feel
for the space and how your furniture will fit into it. Try
arranging your pieces at an angle; pull them off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Reupholster or slipcover key pieces to give them a new look.
</P>
<P>
   Use paint to give old furniture a new backdrop, or use color as
an accent on a wall to offset an area without undertaking an entire
paint job. Take into consideration the light quality in your new
space. Use saturated colors to add drama.
</P>
<P>
   Consider purchasing new furniture to show off your new home or
style.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, life is not fixed and your environment is no
exception. Reinvent yourself and have fun with the process.

wire. Questions? Please call Holly Ocasio Rizzo at 415-777-8811. &HT;      San Francisco _ COMBINE _  Jo Wunderlich bends toward a hallway
shelf holding seven photographs, her eyes softening as she peers
into the gilded frames. ``These are all pictures from Ireland,''
she says, scanning green hills hugging a church, fenced pastures
snuggling the feet of a lighthouse. ``We lived in Ireland a couple

area of San Francisco, combining the familiar, comforting objects
of the past with new furnishings for a new urban lifestyle. This

 New Angina Drug Getting High Marks
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
CV Therapeutics, the Palo Alto biotech company, yesterday announced
encouraging results for an experimental drug that apparently makes
weak hearts pump more efficiently for people with angina.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock jumped $1.25 to close at $8.88 yesterday,
even before the firm released the results of a Phase III, or
late-stage, study of a new drug called Ranolazine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is designed to ease the symptoms of angina, a pounding
chest pain that occurs when cholesterol clogs the arteries that
supply blood to the heart muscle. Deprived of blood, the heart
muscle, in effect, suffocates for lack of oxygen, causing pains
that can numb the chest _ or be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The 7.2 million Americans who suffer from angina now spend about
$6 to $9 a day on medications to control the pain, according to Dr.
Louis Lange, chairman of CV Therapeutics.
</P>
<P>
   Lange explained how Ranolazine would differ from current angina
drugs, like nitroglycerin, beta blockers or calcium blockers.
</P>
<P>
   The difference all begins with the pumping action of the heart.
Angina occurs when a heart, weakened by oxygen deprivation, is
asked to pump harder during stressful situations like climbing
stairs or lifting groceries. Current drugs relieve angina pain by
cutting down the pumping action of the heart, Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   But that action can have a variety of negative side effects, he
said. People who use nitroglycerin can get low blood pressure or
headaches. Calcium blockers or beta blockers may take away the
angina chest pain but leave a person so weak or lethargic that they
can't perform ordinary tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said Ranolazine tries to curb angina pain in a novel way _
by allowing weak heart muscles to make better use of their limited
oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
   The heart's muscles are fueled by a mix of fat, sugar and
oxygen. To prevent angina pain, Ranolazine adjusts the ratio of
these three fuels so they produce more pumping energy for each unit
of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Parker, a Canadian cardiologist who participated in the
study results that were released yesterday, said the 175 patients
studied showed ``dramatic'' improvements in their ability to
exercise before the exertion caused angina. Patients also had far
fewer side effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique drug,'' he said. ``It seems to have more
potency and fewer drawbacks than current remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although yesterday's news was encouraging, CV has at least
another year's worth of tests to perform before it can even ask the
Food and Drug Administration for permission to sell Ranolazine,
Lange said.

 _ SF CHRON   Grinch Virus Arriving for Christmas Day 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Ever heard about the computer virus that stole Christmas? You will.
On December 25, a newly discovered computer virus could wipe out
all data on machines running Microsoft Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most malicious virus I have ever seen,'' said
Keith Peer, president of Central Command Inc., an Ohio firm that
makes antivirus protection products.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus, dubbed Win32.Kriz.3862, or Christmas for short,
invades computers that use either the Windows 95, Windows 98 or
Windows NT operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The virus can be contracted by computer users who download
software applications, such as screen savers or computer games,
over the Internet and then install them on their personal
computers. The virus can then be transmitted to many more people
via e-mail attachments, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger date for the Christmas virus is December 25, which
means it can harmlessly lurk within a PC for months before it
begins to wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   If the virus remains undetected, on Christmas Day it will attack
all the drives on a computer, erasing all data from Word files to
e-mail documents, as well as wiping out data that resides on a
network to which the infected computer is attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This virus has real evil intent,'' said Peer. ``You won't even
be able to turn your computer on. This makes the recovery of the PC
very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Christmas virus is even more malicious than the
infamous Chernobyl virus, which knocked out about 300,000 computers
across Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernobyl only worked on Windows 95 and Windows 98, and not
NT,'' he said. ``Plus Chernobyl only went after a computer's
C-drive. Not this one, it erases data on all your computer drives,
including the network.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey Nachenberg, an antivirus expert at Symantec Corp., said he
first became aware of the Christmas virus last week. He said his
company, which makes antivirus software, was contacted by a
customer who discovered the virus on one of its computers.
</P>
<P>
   While he admitted the virus poses a serious threat to computer
users, he said there is no need to panic. That's because users have
at least four months to detect the Christmas virus.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that this is a more ``visible'' virus than
Chernobyl and easier to detect before it causes damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer users can actually see this virus in that it occupies
hard-drive space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Command Central and Symantec said they have updated their
detection software and databases to identify and disable the
Christmas virus. Users can download patches that recognize the
virus from www.avp.com and www.symantec.com.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, for its part, said it was unware of the latest threat
to its operating system. ``Software is a powerful tool that allows
you to do incredible things,'' said Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn.
``But the bad side is that sometimes you can use it to do malicious
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He said users should regularly update their antivirus software,
and they should not open any program or attachment unless they know
its original source.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 200 known Windows viruses in existence,
according to Nachenberg.

 _ SF CHRON   Shell Using MoJo Wire To Woo Public 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Odd couple of the year: MoJo Wire, the online companion to
muckraking magazine Mother Jones, and megalithic corporation Royal
Dutch/Shell, the epitome of Big Oil.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Mother Jones and the MoJo Wire
(www.motherjones.com) generally portray Shell as evil. The
accusations include destroying the environment and colluding with
Nigerian dictators in terrible human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, Shell is buying ads on the MoJo Wire in an effort to
improve its relations with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The basic message: Never mind what you've read in mags like
Mother Jones, Shell really cares about the planet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the kinder, gentler Shell ads features water rising up
and over polar icebergs, asking ``Ignore? Ignore again?'' before
concluding, ``Too late.'' The kicker: ``Can we afford to ignore
Global Warming? Click here to see how we're cleaning up our act.''
</P>
<P>
   Another features newspaper headlines about torture and people
held under suspicion, ``No-one cq  &LR; can ignore Human Rights. Read
our commitment here.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell ``had become public enemy No.1 to a lot of people,'' said
Tom Kearney of Fishburn Hedges in London, Shell's communications
consultants. ``Shell had some catching up to do in the way it
behaved in stakeholder society.''
</P>
<P>
   The company not only posted a Web page about its environmental
principles but actively promoted it with ads on Web sites for such
media companies as CNN, the Financial Times, the New Zealand Herald
_ and Mother Jones' online outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Jones? Mother Jones doesn't run tobacco ads. Mother Jones
implicated Shell in the murder of Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Jones was not sure if it could take Shell's advertising
offer seriously _ or if it could accept. Publisher Jay Harris said
he was concerned the ads could ``make it seem like Mother Jones was
selling out to this oil company.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, Harris figured, ``We want to make Mother Jones
a home for debate of important current issues. ... We believe in
free expression and we take ads from companies that are
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not making any judgment by taking the ad,'' Harris said.
``The only judgment we make is, their commercial presence is not
going to stop us from printing anything we deem appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He did praise Shell for its aggressive steps in trying to reach
its critics, rather than merely preaching to the choir.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Kearney, the Shell representative, the old
battles with the media had left Shell feeling ``so bloodied and
battered, you just want to pull away and stop people from hitting
you. We're trying to rebuild that dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NO FANGS: A hot rumor swept the city's media circles earlier this
week: Ted Fang, publisher of the San Francisco Independent, was
about to buy the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not true,'' Fang said Monday night. ``I'm not
interested in making any offer. ... I'm not looking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was stirred in this column last week, when analyst
David Cole identified Fang as the most likely buyer. After all, the
Independent already publishes neighborhood editions throughout San
Francisco, has its own printing and delivery apparatus, and could
easily buy the bargain-basement Examiner from Hearst Corp. (Hearst
is selling its flagship paper to ease antitrust objections to its
purchase of The Chronicle.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my 15 minutes of fame,'' Fang said. ``It seems to be
time to put an end to it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FATE OF THE GATE: When Hearst announced its deal to buy The
Chronicle, included in the $660 million price was SF Gate, the
newspaper's Web site. The site posts content from The Chronicle,
Examiner, KRON-TV and BayTV.
</P>
<P>
   What the transition will mean to the 40 people working at SF
Gate remains uncertain. SF Gate General Manager John Coate said
Hearst officials can't make plans for the site until the deal
closes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publisher and the head of the newspaper division came to
see us,'' Coate said. ``They welcomed us, and told us they have a
tradition of autonomy in their properties, and are very excited
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a deep commitment to new media, a lot of resources
in their system _ and they can't discuss strategy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   SF Gate is likely to keep its offices in the KRON building on
Van Ness Avenue for up to a year _ even after KRON, which is for
sale, has a new owner _ and it's likely to keep KRON content on the
site for the time being, depending on the new buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the buyer of KRON is known, there's no way to know what
kind of strategy will be mutually acceptable,'' Coate said. ``We're
just trying to do the best we can with what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NO NO NOLAN: And now, the piece we've all been waiting for is on
newsstands today: Chris Nolan's essay in Fortune, describing the
easy money she made in her infamous ``friends and family'' stock
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who until last month was a star tech columnist at the San
Jose Mercury News, has in the past week written about the Woodside
town council race, the opening of a youth center in San Carlos, and
a flap over multiscreen theaters proposed in San Mateo and Redwood
City.
</P>
<P>
   Her banishment to the paper's Redwood City bureau came about
because she made $9,500 by trading in Autoweb.com's stock at its
initial public offering, thanks to her friendship with Autoweb CEO
Dean DeBiase. And that deal only reached the public because Nolan
agreed to write about it in Fortune, and then talked about the
Fortune article before its publication to a Wall Street Journal
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune, in its September 13 issue, notes that Nolan pitched the
story to the mag after she already made her money. ``While Fortune
has strict guidelines governing its employees' stock trading, we
commissioned Nolan's story because it offers a fascinating glimpse
into Silicon Valley's money culture,'' says an editor's note that
accompanies the story.
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Nolan says she felt qualms about her
participation, but ``these weren't qualms about the journalistic
ethics,'' because she was comfortable that DeBiase was a longtime
personal friend and that she'd informed her editors of the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Nolan wrote, ``the whole process seemed too easy. ...
For this one deal, you see, I was considered special.''
</P>
<P>
   The people on DeBiase's list, she wrote, were ``a small but
influential group. And if they make money, they may be tempted to
return the favor.''
</P>
<P>
   We may never know if Nolan had adequate permission from editors
to participate in the Autoweb stock deal (that aspect of the case
is now the subject of a union grievance).
</P>
<P>
   But I'm inclined to think that if Nolan would give her own story
one more reading _ especially the part about favors given and
expected _ she may understand why her bosses made an example of
her.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOODBYE GROKKER: The Industry Standard bids a fond farewell to Mark
Glaser of San Francisco, who helped launch its popular Media Grok
e-mail newsletter that critiques newspaper and online coverage of
the big high-tech stories.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser is off to Topica, a Multimedia Gulch company that plans
to turn e-mail newsletters into a big business. Topica offers a
free service making it easy to find, join or start an e-mail list.
At its Web site, one can sign up for any of hundreds of lists in
dozens of categories including jokes, women entrepreneurs, art
museums and safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The Grok still lives; Glaser was one of four contributors and
the others remain.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Standard, which is looking mighty fat and healthy,
went on a hiring binge. Most notably, the mag hired pundit James
Fallows _ a famed press critic and former top dog at U.S. News and
World Report _ to file a column every other week. But it also
snagged journos from Brill's Content, the Wall Street Journal, the
San Jose Mercury News, the New York Daily News, Inc. magazine and
PC World. And it's establishing a London bureau with Polly
Sprenger, late of Wired News.

 Tips on Choosing a Back-to-School Computer
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Henry Norr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
It's back-to-school season, and for many families that means not
only new shoes and lunch boxes, but also a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're buying your first home machine, replacing an
aging clunker or adding a second system upstairs, you'll find that
this year's computer crop delivers more bang for fewer bucks than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most important thing parents shopping for
technology this fall need to know is that any new PC or Mac will
meet the computing needs of most students, whether they're in
kindergarten or in college. Even the cheapest models provide more
than enough processing power, storage space and communications
capability for the tasks typical of student computing: word
processing, Web research, e-mail, and also basic graphics,
multimedia and educational software.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll still have choices to make. Over and above the
forests of technical mumbo jumbo and marketing hype, selecting the
setup that's best for your family means answering some basic
questions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; High-end or low-end?  &LR; If bargain-basement models can do
everything your budding scholar is likely to require, is there any
point in considering higher-end configurations?
</P>
<P>
   Only if you expect Junior to take on some extra-demanding
applications _ things like speech recognition, 3-D modeling, MP3
encoding or digital-video editing.
</P>
<P>
   If your kids will be spending a lot of time with the latest 3-D
action games and if you're willing to support or even join them in
this habit, you'll all be happier with hardware that offers faster
graphics and more processing power than a lowball system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Processor and memory.  &LR; Today's PCs use a much wider range of
microprocessors than in past years: Intel Pentium II and III and
Celeron; K6 and now Athlon from Advanced Micro Devices; and the
Cyrix MII. Clock smWeds (megahertz) range from 300 MHz to twice as
many.
</P>
<P>
   For the home user, any of them should be fine. The newest chips,
the Pentium III and Athlon, have some multimedia-oriented
enhancements the others lack, but so far, there's little software
that takes advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   More megahertz are always nice, but don't waste a lot of money
on them.[U )Wk W;H:WRnualYN]SIti77sB]oted above about advanced
applications, ylENGl probably find that any chip running at 300 to
400 MHz is more than fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Main memory, or DRAM, is the one area where today's cheapest
systems fall a little short. Most now come with 32 megabytes of
memory.
</P>
<P>
   That's plenty to run most applications by themselves, but not
enough to keep more than a couple of them in memory at once. If you
have, say, Microsoft Word, Outlook, America Online and a CD-ROM
encyclopedia open simultaneously, the system will have to shuffle
data between memory and hard disk every time you jump from one
program to another, resulting in some annoying delays.
</P>
<P>
   With 64 megabytes of RAM, which is standard in Compaq's Presario
5300 series _ even the $499 Presario 5304 _ and some other low-cost
systems, operations are noticeably more fluid. If you end up
choosing a model with only 32 megabytes, consider asking the dealer
to add another 32 megabytes (around $75 extra, including
installation).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Windows or Mac?  &LR; Now that Apple's future seems assured, the
choice basically is a matter of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap PCs are still cheaper than any new Mac _ though the gap
isn't as large as it seems when you remember that the iMac has a
high-quality monitor built in. And many software programs,
particularly specialized applications but also some popular games
and new Web plug-ins, still aren't available on the Mac, or they
arrive long after and with fewer features than the Windows version.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is a lot of good software _ more than
most students need _ available for the Mac, especially in the
graphics category. The Apple user interface is still easier to
learn, more consistent and more aesthetically pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to plug in a new peripheral, try out a new program
or update your system software, you'll probably encounter fewer of
the time-wasting, sanity-jeopardizing hassles that still are too
common with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of Apple's renewed strength in the
consumer-computing category: FamilyPC, a monthly magazine that's
generally Windows-oriented, recently declared that the iMac ``may
not be the perfect back-to-school system, but (it) is pretty darned
close.'' According to Robin Raskin, the magazine's editor in chief,
the iMac is now one of the publication's three top picks, along
with the Compaq Presario 5300 and Gateway's much more expensive
Profile.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Desktop or notebook?  &LR; Most major manufacturers now offer
lower-cost models pitched as consumer products. ``Lower-cost,''
however, means relative to business notebooks, not consumer
desktops. Even with low-cost chips such as the Intel Celeron or AMD
K6, they generally cost at least $1,600 for a base configuration _
two or three times as much as a desktop PC and monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can afford the premium, notebooks have many
advantages for students, especially in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``For college, you can't go wrong with a notebook,'' says Bob
O'Donnell, author of ``Personal Computer Secrets'' and host of the
``O'Donnell on Computers'' radio show (Saturdays 1 to 4 p.m. on
KSFO-AM). ``It becomes your digital notepad _ you can take it to
class or the library to take notes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded dorm room or student apartment, the space a
notebook saves is another important consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, increasing numbers of college students are buying into
those arguments. According to April Roy, general manager of the
Scholar's Workstation, the official campus computer store of the
University of California at Berkeley, about 60 percent of the
systems the store sells to students are notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   If you or your college-bound offspring opt for a laptop,
remember that risks of theft and accidental damage are much greater
than for desktop systems. Use a security cable to keep the machine
attached to a desk or other relatively immovable object. And carry
it in a plain carrying case or backpack rather than one emblazoned
with the manufacturer's logo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Peripherals. &LR;  Beware of ultracheap monitors, especially those
bundled ``free'' with low-cost PCs. A monitor that's fuzzy or
distorted around the edges is no bargain, especially if young eyes
are going to spend many hours in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's no easy way to tell a good monitor from a
bad one by the specs. Look for a ``dot pitch'' of .28 millimeters
or less, but that, in itself, is no guarantee of image quality.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to spend some time at the computer store
considering the alternatives, or to look closely at recently
acquired monitors at your workplace or friends' homes. Don't just
look at the pretty pictures you're likely to find on screen on the
showroom floor _ open up a word processing program or spreadsheet
and see how normal text and numbers look.
</P>
<P>
   With printers, the risks aren't so great _ nowadays even the
lowest-cost models, retailing for as little as $49 or bundled with
systems, generally produce decent text. But if you expect your
child to be printing lots of pages and especially graphics, you'll
be much better off with a printer in the $150 to $300 range. (We'll
have more advice about printers in an upcoming article.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Software. &LR;  In most cases, it's not worth choosing a PC just for
its bundled software, because you can add software later. But if
you're debating between two closely matched packages, a good bundle
deal might make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Look for antivirus software, such as Norton AntiVirus or Network
Associates' VirusScan.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also want a good suite of basic productivity programs,
including a word processor, spreadsheet program and database, or at
least a strong word processor. Many colleges sell such programs to
students at very low cost, but you'll need to provide for younger
students.
</P>
<P>
   Check with the school to see if there's a standard format that
teachers require for assignments handed in electronically.
</P>
<P>
   If the choice is yours, all of the major commercial programs _
Microsoft Office and Word, Corel Office and WordPerfect, or the
less-powerful but still versatile Microsoft Works _ have more
features than your child is likely to need. None is as easy to
master as kids deserve, but they'll all do. (IMacs come with the
former ClarisWorks, now AppleWorks, which offers a nice balance of
features and ease of use.)
</P>
<P>
   As for educational and reference programs, the big problem with
bundled software is that it may not match your children's grade
level and interests. This year, though, Compaq and Radio Shack have
come up with an innovative approach to the issue: With selected
Compaq PCs sold at the electronics chain, you can try out as many
as 38 separate educational programs and take home the 12 you like
best.

 Publish Magazine Merging With Rival
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Dan Fost  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Publish magazine, a San Francisco technology monthly, is merging
with its rival Desktop Publishers Journal and relocating its
editorial operations to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines, which report on the software that enables
millions of ordinary people to become publishers themselves, have
struggled in recent years as the graphics software market shrinks,
leaving them with fewer ad revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Harrigan, the president of Desktop Publishing Institute,
based in Topsfield, Mass., said his organization will oversee
publication of the newly merged venture.
</P>
<P>
   Uniting the two magazines under Publish's name could enable them
to cash in on a new opportunity: selling to corporations who are
now de facto publishers by virtue of their Web sites, Harrigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a marriage of necessity,'' Harrigan said. As his
Desktop Publishers Journal tried to compete with Publish, which was
owned by magazine powerhouse International Data Group, ``we might
have followed them over a cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. IDG, based in Framingham,
Mass., retains a majority interest in Publish; Desktop Publishing
Institute has a minority interest.
</P>
<P>
   Both magazines had mostly free circulations. At 95,000, Publish
eked out Desktop Publishers Journal by about 5,000 copies a month.
The overlap between the readership was about 30 percent, Harrigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 to 15 people in Publish's San Francisco offices at
Second and Bryant streets have lost their jobs; the remainder of
the staff of 25 will stay on, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales and marketing will be run out of San Francisco, said
Publish Publisher Wesley Walton, who is staying on. The magazine
will retain an editorial and a Web presence in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``By bringing in the assets of Desktop Publishers Journal, we're
actually making our magazine bigger and stronger,'' Walton said.
``We're going to offer a deeper level of expertise and a broader
span of market coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan will take on the editor in chief title but will start
looking for a permanent editor immediately, he said.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A/DAVID EINSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A Free PC? Read the Fine Print &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Several major computer stores are offering a $400 rebate on
practically any PC if you sign up for three years of Internet
access. This sounds like a terrific deal, since you need an
Internet provider anyway. What's your opinion of this offer?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: In general, I'd say that any time you can get a $400 rebate
you should take it. But there are a couple of potential drawbacks
to this ``free PC'' deal:
</P>
<P>
   _You could end up with lousy Internet service. Although the
companies involved are generally well known, including Prodigy,
CompuServe and the Microsoft Network, there's no guarantee they
will provide reliable access in your area. Over the past few years,
I've suffered busy signals and even no signal at all from several
ISPs (remember how unreliable AOL was for a while?).
</P>
<P>
   _In the next year or so, cable modem and/or DSL is going to
become available in most well-populated areas. You'll have to hope
that the ISP with whom you sign up now starts to offer one of these
high-speed options earlier rather than later. Also, when you
convert to high-speed, your monthly rate will go up, and you won't
have the luxury of being able to shop around for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   A few more words of warning: Read the fine print before you sign
up for a ``free PC,'' especially one being offered by a PC-maker,
since those companies tend to lump unnecessary add-ons and service
agreements into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is Micron. Its Micronfreeware.com offer charges
you extra for Microsoft Works _ a program that comes free with many
PCs _ and makes you sign up for a three-year repair service and a
three-year e-Additions Club membership, whatever that is. Bottom
line: Your free PC, including Internet access, ends up costing you
$1,087 ($1,308 if you pay by the month).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Clearing Shortcuts
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I delete a Microsoft Word file, it's still listed in the
Documents folder that's on the Windows start menu. If you click one
of these files, it searches for the file and finally reports that
the Shortcut has been changed or moved. The problem is that I can't
find a way to get these files out of Documents. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The Documents folder doesn't actually contain documents. It just
lists links to documents that you've used. But it's a pretty goofy
feature, because when you delete a document from your hard drive,
the link _ also known as a Shortcut _ stays in the Documents
folder, where it sits uselessly.
</P>
<P>
   To remove a Shortcut from the folder, right-click on it and
choose Delete. Or, you can empty the Documents folder entirely like
this: Click the Windows Start button, then point to Settings and
choose Taskbar &AMP; Start Menu. Tab over to Start Menu Programs and
click on the button labeled Clear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Busy Signal
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work online and have one phone line. Is there anything that
will tell me that people are trying to get through on the phone
while I'm online?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in luck, my friend, because there are a bunch of
solutions for your problem. The first thing you should do is check
with your telephone company and your Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   One or the other may offer Internet Call Waiting as an optional
feature that won't require you to buy any hardware. Expect to pay
about $5 a month for such a service.
</P>
<P>
   If Internet Call Waiting isn't available directly from your
carrier or ISP, you may be able to get it another way.
InfoInterActive, a Canadian company, has made its Internet Call
Manager service available in many parts of the United States. Go to
www.infointeractive.com to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   You can also solve your problem with gadgets like the $60 Call
Pending Indicator from Human Electronics
(www.humanelectronics.com), or the $80 HotCall HC2000 from Command
Communications (www.command-comm.com).
</P>
<P>
   These small devices work with the Call Waiting feature from your
phone company to make it possible to field incoming calls. However,
if you answer a call and talk for more than a few seconds, you're
going to lose your Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know what I think? Cough up the $18 a month for a second
phone line and write it off as a business expense if you can.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you want to delete a program from your PC, but the
program didn't come with an uninstall option. Don't fret.
</P>
<P>
   You can get rid of most programs made for Windows 95 or Windows
98 like this: Go to the Windows Start button, point to Settings and
Choose Control Panel. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon. On
the page titled Install/Uninstall, select the name of the program
you want to remove from the list and click Add/Remove.

HOW TO BLACKEN WITHOUT SCORCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Paul Prudhomme stood in front of the portable
stove on stage and said, ``Blackening is not burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years earlier Prudhomme had popularized blackening, a
method of cooking that, as Prudhomme described it, caramelized
sugars and seared spices onto foods. Ever since, people have been
setting off smoke alarms and ruining perfectly good cuts of meat,
poultry and fish.
</P>
<P>
   While Prudhomme is adept at cooking over extremely high heat, it
seems that many Americans (including a large number of chefs) are
not. The result was a lot of food burned to a shiny ebony on the
outside but raw on the inside. Fortunately, there is a way to
``blacken'' and get edible results.
</P>
<P>
   Buy ``blackening spices,'' which have sugar listed as an
ingredient. Dry the meat before starting and heat the oven to 325
degrees. Coat one side of the meat with the spices, then place,
spice-side down, in a very hot cast-iron skillet. The meat will
sizzle and smoke but not to excess. Leave in the pan 30 seconds to
1 minute, just long enough for the sugar in the spice mixture to
caramelize and turn dark brown. Turn meat and sear lightly on the
uncoated side. Place skillet in the oven and bake until meat is
cooked to desired doneness (time depends on what you're cooking).
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly Prudhomme's method, but it's not burned. I
think he would approve.

 DOWNLOAD TASTE, NUTRITION WITH THESE `PCs'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ These days a grilled cheese sandwich has about as
much appeal as a rotary phone. Oh, it's filling enough, but it
won't put you on the superhighway to good nutrition. What you need
is a hand-held PC (power combo), a sandwich that will output more
vitamins and proteins than fats and carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, a sandwich made with pork or chicken or most any other
protein is going to contain some fat. But you can downgrade fat
content while augmenting flavor using these processes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy the leanest cuts of meat you can find. Lean pork chops,
chicken and turkey breast, and lean roast beef slices are all good
choices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trim visible fat from the meat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add flavor and tenderize meat simultaneously by marinating in
citrus juices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use seafood such as fish fillets or crab meat as sandwich
fillers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cook without added fat. Grilling, steaming, poaching and
blackening are all good methods to use. Skip frying and sauteeing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pile on the vegetables. Tomatoes, bell peppers and onions have
exuberant flavors, but don't forget less obvious vegetables such as
portobellos, jicama, cucumber, carrot and radishes. These add
texture and interest to your sandwich. For a more subtle flavor,
grill vegetables before adding them to the sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reserve the sandwich bread for peanut butter and jelly.
Instead, try some of the many specialty breads in supermarkets
these days, including Tuscan, seven-grain, pita bread and
Portuguese rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of ingredients make creating a hand-held PC as easy
as dialing the phone, but the combinations are as endless as sites
on the Web. Here are a few suggestions to get you surfing for a new
sandwich:
</P>
<P>
   _ Blacken one chicken breast per person. Slice chicken breast
and toss with julienned red bell peppers and onions. Line a pita
bread with lettuce and stuff with chicken mixture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poach a 4-ounce tuna steak for each sandwich. Cut into cubes.
Toss tuna with diced cucumber, diced red onion, grated carrot,
sliced black olives and feta cheese. Mash 1 clove garlic to a
paste. Whisk with 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons
lemon juice and 3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard. Drizzle in 1/3 cup
olive oil while whisking. toss with tuna and vegetables. Stuff
mixture into a pita.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN PORK SANDWICH
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   4 center-cut, boneless pork chops
</P>
<P>
   1 cup lime juice plus more for avocado
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 large tomato
</P>
<P>
   1 Haas avocado
</P>
<P>
   4 Portuguese rolls
</P>
<P>
   Hot sauce
</P>
<P>
   Trim all visible fat from sides of pork chops. Butterfly each
pork chop by laying on a cutting board. Cut from one side, almost
to the other, as close to the center as possible. Pound the chops
lightly with a meat mallet to make the chops as even in thickness
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Combine lime juice and cumin in a resealable plastic bag. Add
chops and marinate, refrigerated, 2 hours. Slice tomato. Peel and
slice avocado. Coat avocado slices with lime juice to prevent them
from browning.
</P>
<P>
   Light coals or gas grill and bring to medium-high heat. Toast
rolls on grill. Remove pork from marinade and grill until cooked
through, about 2 minutes per side. Place pork on rolls, top with
tomato and avocado. Serve with hot pepper sauce on the side.

CLICHE MOB COMEDY HAS GRANT'S CHARM, LITTLE ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' follows in the
fish-out-of-water, mob comedy footsteps of this spring's ``Analyze
This,'' where an innocent gets recruited for wise guy duty against
his own better instincts. It's as if Hollywood screenwriters have
been watching marathons of ``The Godfather'' movies and were
particularly inspired by hearing Al Pacino bellow, ``Just when I
thought I was out, they keep pulling me back in!''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of effectiveness, ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' falls somewhere
in between the manic vitality of ``Analyze This'' and the rote
send-ups in ``Mafia!'' It coasts by largely on the droll charms of
its star, Hugh Grant, but the winsome actor can only do so much in
a movie hampered by poor comic pacing and gags stolen from better
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Grant plays Michael Felgate, an Englishman enjoying a productive
career (he runs a posh New York auction house) and a dizzying
romance with an attractive schoolteacher named Gina (Jeanne
Tripplehorn). Things are going so well that Michael decides to
propose, but Gina, much to his surprise, rejects him. It's not that
she doesn't love him, but, well, she just can't marry him.
</P>
<P>
   Michael decides to learn why and discovers that Gina's father is
mobster Frank Vitale (James Caan). Marry Gina and Michael would be
marrying the mob. He thinks it could work. Gina has her doubts, and
it turns out those concerns are pretty well-founded when her
relatives begin to use Michael's art house to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movie's funniest moments comes early, contrasting
the debonair Michael and future ``Family'' members Vinnie, Carmine,
Louie and Uncle Vito. Grant's comic timing is, as always,
impeccable, and later, when he must force his English accent to
bend around ``Donnie Brasco'' banter, he displays an eerie ability
to channel Elmer Fudd.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, little else in the movie works. The screenplay by
Adam Scheinman (``Little Big League'') and Robert Kuhn (Grant
apparently did a rewrite as well) offers too few laughs and too
many gangster cliches. Once it moves beyond its initial set-up, the
movie goes nowhere fast, lapsing into a creaky, ridiculous story
revolving around murder and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Caan certainly seems comfortable enough playing a mobster, but
Kelly Makin's (``Brain Candy: Kids in the Hall'') weak direction
gives the veteran actor little to do and no real chemistry with
Grant. In fact, besides Grant, no one here fares particularly well.
Tripplehorn virtually disappears after the movie's initial half
hour, and the various members of the Vitale family are stereotypes
struggling for identities.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences looking to see mob foibles played to better effect are
advised to rent ``Analyze This'' (out this week) or catch ``The
Sopranos'' on HBO.

MEET MRS. TINGLE, THE TEACHER FROM HELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This week's teen movie, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,''
is far from a total waste of celluloid. It's not very good, but at
least it keeps crudity to a minimum and exhibits something
resembling sardonic wit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional intelligent flourish, though, the story
is irredeemably dumb. The movie never quite overcomes its
sophomoric premise, which is normally to be expected of one of
these things. But not this particular one; ``Mrs. Tingle'' marks
the feature directing debut of Kevin Williamson, the writer whose
``Scream'' movies and ``Dawson's Creek'' television series have
supposedly set new standards of smarts for youth-skewed
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But the only really canny aspect of ``Mrs. Tingle'' is the title
character herself. Played by the great British actress Helen Mirren
(``The Madness of King George,'' PBS' ``Prime Suspect''), she's a
small-town history teacher with an ingenious sadistic streak. Her
ability to criticize a student in the most devastatingly personal
way is her demonic glory _ kids actually dive out of her path when
she walks down the hall, and dignity is the only thing that
prevents fellow faculty from doing the same _ and Mirren plays her
with delectably cruel hauteur and relish.
</P>
<P>
   One of Tingle's least-deserving victims is smart, industrious
Leigh Ann Watson (``Creek's'' Katie Holmes). With an absent father
and a waitress mother, Leigh Ann needs the college scholarship
she's worked so hard to get. But Tingle's unfair disdain for her
carefully constructed history project jeopardizes that; when the
evil teacher discovers inaccurate but damning evidence that Leigh
Ann might be cheating, the girl's future fate is sealed.
</P>
<P>
   But when Leigh Ann and two friends, dim-bulb hunk Luke (``7th
Heaven'' heartthrob Barry Watson) and overdramatizing would-be
actress Jo Lynn (Marisa Coughlan) visit Tingle at home to plead for
leniency, things get out of hand. Before they know it, they've got
the teacher tied to her bed with a minor head wound. As the ensuing
hostage situation intensifies, however, Tingle's manipulative
faculties prove unhindered. What little suspense the film generates
rests on just how she'll psych her captors into turning on one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a number of Mirren's deft insinuations, the ensuing
complications range from unconvincing to lame. A ``comic'' bit with
an amorous, easily deceived coach (Jeffrey Tambor) makes for
particularly misfired burlesque. Overall, the universal fantasy of
revenge-on-teacher doesn't receive the cleverness needed to make it
feel fresh here. And the cautionary aspect _ no, kids, don't try
this at your school _ gives way to cliched, teen triumph pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is adequate, though unfortunately saddled with the burden
of having to be the girl who thinks seriously about this nonsense.
Watson proves deft at playing dumb. Coughlan, who'll appear in
Williamson's upcoming TV series ``Wasteland,'' is energetic and
bright. Her one-woman replay of greatest moments from ``The
Exorcist'' is an impressive interpretation of a really desperate
idea.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' dithers on, you appreciate moments
like that more and more. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN ANTONIO -- Last May I visited Harvest Fellowship Community
Church, where my son, Adam, worships. I immediately saw why
independent evangelical churches like his are booming across
America, while many traditional liturgical churches are slowly
eroding down to a loyal band of the white-haired, bald and stooped.
 &HT;    First, the atmosphere is open and inviting. Somewhat startling
to this easterner, no man had a tie on but me. People were dressed
not in their Sunday best, but Saturday casual -- shorts and
T-shirts. The message: Come as you are.
 &HT;    Except for one hymn, ''Amazing Grace,'' all the rest were praise
songs with snappy rhythms, backed up by guitars and drums, not an
organ.
 &HT;    The words flashed on a user-friendly screen so we had no need of
hymnals. People stood and sang for an astonishing 25 minutes.
 &HT;    Mothers were told there was a room in the rear if they were
nursing or had wiggly kids, and a children's ministry for infants,
and Sunday School for all in a new building next door.
 &HT;    The place simply doesn't look like a church. There is no cross,
no pews, no stained-glass windows, in fact no windows at all. It
resembled a dinner theater, which, in fact, it once was.
 &HT;    There was no liturgy, no standard prayers repeated every week.
Often, at the beginning, there is a 5-7 minute skit, a modern
parable, on the theme of the sermon that engages the 90's mind. A
bunch of songs followed by a sermon, the height of informality.
 &HT;    When a visitor attends Harvest Fellowship, a church member drops
by their home with a loaf of bread on a board, as a gift. Why? ''We
have become a society of disconnected people,'' observes Pastor
Peter Spencer, 45. ''This is a way of greeting people, of being
gracious in a genuine way. If they ask us to come in, we say, `No,
we are not Jehovah's Witnesses. Enjoy the bread.'''
 &HT;    Unlike Catholic and mainline Protestant churches, which follow a
''lectionary'' in which the same Gospel and Epistle readings are
repeated over and over, which can become numbing over the years,
evangelical sermons draw from a much wider range of Scripture,
which makes them inherently more interesting.
 &HT;    Harvest Fellowship goes a step further to preach practical
messages of hope on the toughest issues. Christian dating, marriage
and divorce are not avoided, as at most churches. The sermon I
heard was on John 10:10: ''I have come that they may have life, and
have it abundantly.''
 &HT;    ''If that is God's desire, why is it that most people are not
having an abundant life?'' asked the associate pastor, John Cannon.
Good question.
 &HT;    His answer: Many are waiting for life's conditions to change,
rather than realizing that they have to change first. Many find
their feelings about God change with circumstances, rather than
realizing that God gave us a spirit of wisdom and revelation (Eph
1:1-17) that will enable us to be obedient, with unwavering faith.
God will sustain us through changing circumstances.
 &HT;    In an evangelical church, worshipers are constantly looking up
Scriptures and underlining their Bibles. Therefore, they are
learning. In the liturgical churches, no one even brings a Bible.
 &HT;    What was most striking, however, was the deep faith and
transparent spirit of those who spoke. These are people for whom
faith had made a difference in their life. They radiate both a joy
and conviction.
 &HT;    Exhibit A is Pastor Peter, who had his own ad agency and from
1976-1981 he was the lead singer in such musicals as ''Fiddler on
the Roof'' at the Fiesta Dinner Playhouse in San Antonio.
Apparently on top of the world, he and his Brazilian wife quit and
became missionaries in Sao Paulo, working with orphans. They
returned in 1985.
 &HT;    The Fiesta was bankrupt. Peter walked through a kicked-down
door, went on the stage where he had sung hundreds of times. A
vision came that one day he would preach the Gospel there.
 &HT;    He was leading a small church of 100 people in 1992 when the
opportunity came to buy the building for $1.5 million. He offered
$300,000 and got it for $315,000. At the first service, 500 people
showed up. Today, 2,100 attend weekly.
 &HT;    ''The purpose of church is not to show up,'' he says. ''but to
grow up, be impacted and change.''

BEVERAGE MAKER LOOKS FOR NEW MARKETS WITH FRESH JUICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Six months after completing its $19
million purchase of New Jersey-based Fresh Juice Co. Inc., Saratoga
Beverage Group Inc. is ready to roll out a product that's meant to
blend the best of both companies: Fresh-squeezed juice in a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultimate Juice is expected to hit store shelves soon, chief
executive Robin Prever told about 30 shareholders Wednesday at
Saratoga Beverage's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The product combines Fresh Juice's strength _ high-quality
fresh-squeezed juices _ with Saratoga Beverage's expertise in
marketing bottled products.
</P>
<P>
   The new product won't stay on the shelves long, even if it
doesn't sell _ the quick expiration time of fresh, all-natural
juice is one of the challenges the company faces in distributing
it. Fresh Juice had sold the fresh-squeezed product primarily at
high-quality restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The other big challenge of bottling the juice is distribution,
Prever said. With fresh orange juice, no more than 48 hours should
elapse between when the oranges are picked and when the juice is
bottled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prever told shareholders that the company, which she rebuilt
after purchasing it in 1992, was ready for the new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it before,'' she said. ``We've learned how to fight
and kick in a competitive industry.''
</P>
<P>
   New product launches and plans to leverage the Saratoga brand
name were key topics at the company's annual meeting. It also
continues to look for future acquisition targets.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Beverage is a far different company than it was at last
year's annual meeting. The purchase of Fresh Juice brought it
plants in New Jersey, Florida and California, and increased its
annual revenues from about $12 million to about $40 million. Prever
predicted sales would hit $60 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now a key competitor in the fresh-juice business,
while it had been a niche player in bottled water, Prever said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to The Ultimate Juice, the company is also rolling
out new iced tea and lemonade drinks intended to stand out from the
competition by featuring all-natural ingredients. Saratoga Beverage
failed once with lemonade and fruit drinks called Toga, but company
officials attribute the problems to marketing. The drinks were
promoted using characters on the bottles instead of an effort that
would have focused on the quality of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   It also recently launched a line of pureed fruit drinks, or
smoothies, under the name ``Saratoga Fruit for Thought.'' As for
its labels, Saratoga Beverage also is hoping to promote its name
more. It is negotiating to sell the name of one of its Fresh Juice
products on the West Coast, and add the century-old Saratoga brand
name there, for instance.

NEW YORK DAIRY FARMERS STRUGGLE WITH HEAT, DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The good luck didn't last for New York's dairy
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the best year for Northeast dairy farmers in a
long time, according to new statistics. This year is another story.
Milk production is off because of the heat, prices paid to farmers
have been erratic and sporadic drought conditions are hurting some
operations that grow their own feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the best year in a decade,'' said Peter Gregg,
spokesman for the New York State Department of Agriculture and
Markets. ``It's the complete opposite this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices paid to farmers were good last year, and production costs
were stable, according to a new report from Connecticut-based First
Pioneer Farm Credit. That yielded a profit of $438 per cow in the
Northeast, up sharply from 1997's ``humbling figure of just $42,''
according to the release accompanying the report, and even from the
$167 per-cow average over the past five years. The same report puts
the average milking-herd size at 161.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 has proved so complicated that profit projections are
cloudy at best, said Tom Borden, a dairy farmer in Easton,
Washington County, He has a milking herd of 160 Holsteins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dry weather has been quite variable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers have gotten enough rain to grow the hay and corn
they need to feed the livestock throughout the fall and winter, but
just a few miles away others have missed out on some crucial
thunderstorms, Borden said.
</P>
<P>
   Borden has enough hay, but it's not the same quality as last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corn crops can also be hurt by the drought, with some stalks
failing to yield an ear of corn _ the protein source the animals
need.
</P>
<P>
   If the supply of feed is low or of poor quality, some farmers
are going to have to buy feed elsewhere to supplement. But the
drought conditions _ while spotty _ have spread so far across the
Northeast that farmers ``are not going to be able to go to the next
county to buy hay,'' predicted Gary Dake, who, as vice president of
Stewart's Ice Cream, is in charge of buying milk directly from some
50 farm producers in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is it going to come from?'' Dake said. And the next
question would be, how much more expensive is hay going to be if
there is a shortage? That's not clear at all yet, and that's why
Borden described the profit picture as cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the prices paid to farmers this year for milk have
varied more erratically month to month than in 1998, partly because
of a national over-supply this spring. The price paid per hundred
pounds of milk will probably reach $15 to $16 in the fall, when
school increases milk demand, observers said. But prices were below
$12 in April, severely cutting into farmers' sales.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, farmers like Borden say milk production is off
because of the heat. The cows simply don't feel like eating as much
when it's hot, and so they produce less milk.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers aren't likely to have cash reserves left over from
1998's plump profits, Gregg said. After so many poorer years,
farmers are apt to have used the money to pay down debt or make
repairs to equipment and buildings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farm advocates said there will be less money circulating for
those kinds of things in 1999 and 2000 in New York _ still the
nation's third-largest dairy producing state after California and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agricultural support economy is quite extensive,'' said
Chuck Randall, a part-time dairy farmer in Saratoga Springs with a
milking herd of 15. Sales of hardware and building materials, for
instance, will fall when farmers have less money, he said.

WEB ZANINESS BEHIND THE GOLDEN GATE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You know your town is in deep trouble when the
virtual mayor's race is more interesting than the so-called real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the most fun in the San Francisco mayor's race was the
revelation that challenger Clint Reilly had registered such Web
Wide Web domain names as williebrown.com, frankjordan.com and even
williesucks.
</P>
<P>
   This sent supporters of Mayor Willie Brown into a tizzy, while
Reilly supporters accused Brown of being behind the times and out
of touch with the dot-common people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real story. It took them five months to find out,''
Reilly spokesman Tom Pier said.
</P>
<P>
   The downside for the new, squeaky-clean Clint Reilly is that his
cybersquatting may remind people of the old Clint Reilly, back when
he was a down-and-dirty campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, Brown and former Mayor Frank Jordan finally
created Web sites to try to catch up to clintreilly.com.
Unfortunately, because of Reilly's coup, Brown and Jordan are stuck
with the unwieldy reelectwilliebrown.com and mayorfrankjordan.org.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to make typos, if for some reason you want to call
them up. For some reason, I called them up.
</P>
<P>
   Let me say that I would no sooner pick a mayor by the coolness
of his Web site than by the cut of his suit _ just to pick a
comparison. A candidate can go out and buy a Web site the way he
can buy television advertising. But it is curious how those TV ads
and those Web sites seem to indicate something.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is far ahead in the cyberspace race. His 4-month-old Web
site is good-looking, offers detailed position papers, names all
his campaign contributors and has a feature that allows people to
rank issues in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Reilly's campaign won the award for Web site of the
month from Campaigns and Elections, a magazine I'll look for in my
dentist's office next time I'm having a root canal.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's recently launched Web site is a worthy second to
Reilly's, with zippy graphics touting Brown's accomplishments.
Maybe he'll have to arm-wrestle President Clinton for some of them.
Brown takes credit for three years of budget surpluses and a 40
percent reduction in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some of these claims rotate in a little ad space
on the top of the site, giving it the appearance of an
old-fashioned political flier fluttering on your doorknob.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also has a couple of nice stories about Brown by
community activists, one of whom denies he's arrogant. The feature
I really like, though, is one called ``Ask Willie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to a handsome man. Send him your question, and ``your
e-mail will be answered personally within five days.''
</P>
<P>
   Answered personally by whom?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jordan's new Web site is so low-tech it's almost charming
instead of embarrassing. Almost. It's a short letter in early
Selectric typeface that begins ``San Franciscans will no longer
stand for a City Hall that supports special-interest greed over
neighborhood priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Jordan doesn't support special interests like Web
site designers. Sadly, he missed his chance to attract people to
his site with a teaser of wet skin.
</P>
<P>
   That famous picture is available on an out-of-date mayoral
fashion critique Web site which popped up when I searched with the
key words ``Willie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the madness began in earnest. I found critiques of
Brown in WillieWatch and The Usual Suspects, as well as satirical
letters from ``the Imperial Poohbah of San Francisco'' addressed to
``Dearest Minions.''
</P>
<P>
   I found something called the ``Pieman's Homepage,'' which is a
delirious screed about every stuffed shirt in the world ever hit
with a pie _ accompanied by synthesized music more ominous than
anything ever piped into Marie Callender's.
</P>
<P>
   When I searched for ``Frank Jordan,'' the first thing that came
up was something about Ballpark Franks and Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   No, I wouldn't judge a candidate by his Web site any more than
I'd judge Ballpark Franks by the failed baseball player who
advertises them. But Web sites do tell you something.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished sending my e-mail to ``Ask Willie Brown,'' and
checked the calendar to see when to expect a personal reply, I went
to the official City of San Francisco Web site. This is where you
can judge the efficiency of government departments.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has a great site that gives up-to-date
block-by-block crime statistics. You might want to call it up
before you walk to the corner store.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Commission has an informative and gorgeous
site. The section that refers to gay, lesbian and transsexual
rights is bracketed by rainbow flags flapping in an electronic
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority's Web site looks like meaningless scrawls
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   I avoided the site for the Department of Parking and Traffic
because I didn't want to get a ticket for double-clicking.
</P>
<P>
   Muni, the public transit system, has a great Web site designed
by its pricey consultants, Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton. Like those
electronic sign boards in the stations, it shows moving Muni Metro
cars. I almost ran to the Powell Street station to see if a train
really was pulling in.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is, at least the mayor and Muni make those blips
run on time.

LINUX GAMESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Backers of the upstart Linux operating system like to joke
that their ultimate goal is world domination. They're getting
there. In fact, anyone with a Linux computer can create an
interplanetary empire, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   All the Linux user needs is a copy of Civilization: Call to
Power, a popular new computer game that lets the player launch a
campaign of cosmic conquest. Granted, it's a make-believe empire,
but the very fact that companies are releasing Linux versions of
their new computer games demonstrates how much market power Linux
has acquired in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent LinuxWorld trade show in San Jose, Calif., Linux
devotees lined up to play Civilization and two other popular
computer games _ Myth II and Railroad Tycoon II. Meanwhile, Linux
versions of the immensely popular Quake series of combat games are
now on sale.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Linux games is still small, but Scott Draeker
plans to change that. Draeker, a software licensing attorney, is
president of Loki Entertainment Software, a Tustin, Calif., company
that produced the Linux versions of Myth II and Railroad Tycoon II
and plans to keep rolling out Linux versions of major games.
</P>
<P>
   Draeker, a former customer support worker at Apple Computer
Inc., was a long-time fan of Apple's Macintosh computer. But after
years of slow Mac sales, most leading game makers stopped producing
Mac versions of their products. ``People were constantly
complaining that there were no games,'' Draeker said. At the same
time, Draeker grew disenchanted with Apple's management. ``I wanted
to leave the Mac behind,'' he said. Draeker switched his loyalty to
Linux because of its ``open source'' policy, which lets Linux users
modify the software to fit their own needs. Apple's Macintosh
software generally doesn't allow this.
</P>
<P>
   Draeker realized that when it came to games, Linux was in the
same boat as Macintosh _ virtually no major game companies offered
Linux versions of their products.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Loki to redress the balance. Draeker negotiates
licensing deals with the companies that created the original games.
These companies provide the original ``source code'' _ the raw
programming instructions that control each game. This code is then
modified so that it will run on a Linux machine, a process known as
``porting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's far easier to port a game than to build one from scratch.
Top-quality games can cost millions of dollars to produce and
require dozens of workers. By licensing existing games, Loki can
get into the business on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The game producers also profit from royalties on the sales of
Linux versions of their games. They get to sell their games to
Linux users, without having to bear the expense and complexity of
creating Linux versions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how large a market there is for Linux games. Linux
is mainly popular as an alternative to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT
operating system for running powerful server computers. Few people
run Linux on the home machines on which they play games.
</P>
<P>
   But Draeker said Linux is spreading beyond corporate server
machines and onto home desktops, in place of Microsoft's Windows 95
or Windows 98 software. He cited a report from Corel Corp. that a
million people have downloaded the Linux version of Corel's
WordPerfect word processing software. ``They're not running that on
a server,'' Draeker said.
</P>
<P>
   Loki is working on Linux versions of eight more games and is
constantly looking for new products to port to Linux. Draeker said
most game software makers are quite interested in working with his
company _ with one major exception: Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approached their booth at E3 (a leading electronic-industry
trade show) and asked them about porting Age of Empires,'' one of
Microsoft's most popular games. The response? ``I got a belly
laugh,'' said Draeker.

RE-CREATING A NEIGHBORHOOD FOR KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My grandkids are attending Camp Fun-on-the-Rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The campers, dressed in matching yellow T-shirts that have
``Summer '99'' on the front pocket and a picture of a tide pool on
the back, set off Monday morning to explore Salem's Pioneer
Village. Later this week they'll visit a petting zoo, have lunch on
a ferry, and go to the beach. Apart from field trips, the eight
campers, raging in age from 5 to 9, will hear a storyteller, do
arts and crafts projects, keep a journal, and have a day of
noncompetitive games.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Fun-on-the-Rocks isn't listed in any camp directory. It is,
in fact, an invention of my daughter and her neighbors, who came up
with a creative solution to the challenge of keeping their kids
occupied for two weeks this summer. Luckily Valerie, a favorite
baby sitter who's now a special education teacher, was available to
be head counselor for two weeks. Two neighborhood teenagers are
sharing the role of junior counselor, and I volunteered to tell
Br'er Rabbit stories, usin' mah awthentic Suthin accent. The camp
is headquartered in one family's shed, temporarily furnished with
tables and chairs borrowed from a school. The stay-at-home moms
take turns driving.
</P>
<P>
   And so my granddaughter, Jessie, and grandson, Danny, and DT and
Amy, Philip and Natalie, Tucker and Claire will have the
opportunity to become a smoothly functioning team, regardless of
age or sex or family ties. The bigger kids will help the smaller
ones and act as mentors, which is, of course, exactly what the
littlest campers long for in their hearts. The skills they learn _
in sharing, cooperation, and mutual respect _ will hopefully
continue to deepen their friendships as the years go by.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has been the season for more than one homemade
recreational opportunity. Jessie got invited to join a book group
formed by parents who wanted to make sure their children actually
read a substantial number of books on our local elementary school's
recommended second grade reading list.
</P>
<P>
   Since Laura was busy one evening, I took Jessie to a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The kids sat in a circle on the floor while the moms formed an
outer circle on the couches. The seven girls wanted a chance to
read out loud, and so they each got a chance to read a page from
the first selection, ``Betsy Ross,'' and to discuss the meaning of
words they'd had trouble with, like ``Continental Congress'' and
``Colonel.''
</P>
<P>
   Their collective judgment? ``Too many facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the discussion, there was a craft project _ making a
flag windsock out of white stars, blue construction paper, and red
paper streamers. After a snack, the girls put their heads together
to choose for themselves the titles that looked most interesting.
One of the moms took responsibility for ordering copies of each
book. The group will be meeting one evening a week until school
starts.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the media are deploring the decline of the family,
I can't help but admire moms who are giving real thought and energy
to the quality of their children's lives. Although most of these
kids will also take part in privately organized activities this
summer, these parents are committed to a level of participation
that didn't exist in my mother's generation. I'm impressed that
they have the confidence to design and execute programs without
feeling they need the guidance of experts.
</P>
<P>
   In a world that is becoming increasingly more fragmented, I'm
also impressed that these moms are trying to create an
intergenerational, neighborhood-based community for their children.
Instead of locking themselves into individual family units, these
mothers are willing to extend their sphere of nurturance outside
the nuclear family's confining walls. They're making the effort to
know and interact with kids other than their own, and as a result,
they're exposing their own children to the influence of other
caring adults. They're strengthening their own friendships as well
as modeling for their children the idea that there's nothing
standing in the way of creating something special for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Laura where she got the idea of starting a camp from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fondest memories are of spending lazy summer days, playing
with kids of all ages from this neighborhood,'' she says. ``I moved
back here in part because I wanted my kids to have that same
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there some experience you treasured as a child that
modern-day life no longer offers? Do you want to find a new way to
interact with your children and their peers? Put your imagination
to work. I would be surprised if you couldn't figure out a way to
make it happen.

HEAR THAT WHISTLE? STANLEY STEAMERS STRUT THEIR STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   It was like time passing time. The thundering diesel engine
pushed a line of railroad cars through an intersection near the
paper mills of Berlin, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting at the crossing in his hissing 1922 Stanley Steamer sat
David Nergaard of Littleton, Mass. What the modern diesel and the
old car had in come was their whistles. Except that when Nergaard
pulled the cord to unleash steam through his whistle, and the big
train replied in kind, it was clear in the mountain air that the
Stanley's whistle was the louder.
</P>
<P>
   Steam is powerful. It has driven our industry, our mills,
trains, ocean-going ships, lake launches, and cars. In 1906, it
powered a Stanley called the ``Rocket'' to 127.6 miles per hour on
a Florida beach.
</P>
<P>
   Steam is also ephemeral, here and then gone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are those who have found a way to hold onto steam, and
in more than 80 steam cars, they plied the notches, valleys, and
mountains of northern New Hampshire all last week. What brought
them there was the 100th anniversary of the first automobile ascent
of Mount Washington. Where they came from was all over the United
States and Europe. What their owners had in common was the clutch
of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steam is a bad disease . . . once you get it, you can't get
rid of it,'' says Nergaard.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered first at the base of the Mount Washington Auto
Road and, in this driest of summers, were met with rain. Weather in
the Whites can be like that _ unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   It did not stop hundreds of spectators from coming to the public
exhibit, and they moved among the cars and their hisses, whistles,
and gasps. Some of the cars, puffing steam, sounded like a panting
dog would on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Here was Arthur Edlredge of Peterborough, N.H., with his 1901
Lane, one of two Lanes known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Here were Robert and Eulalia Collins of South Amherst, Mass.,
with ``Yellow Legs,'' the 1911 Stanley Model 71 that they saved
from beneath a tree on a chicken farm in 1958. Eulalia's father
found the car, Robert and Eulalia did their own work restoring it:
woodwork, leather upholstery, pinstriping. They have been driving
it since.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Richard of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., came in a 1910 White;
William Handley of Manchester, N.H., in a 1932 Derr American _
again, one of two known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for some of the cars to climb Washington on Monday,
but Monday was the mountain's day: early August, yet, as Washington
can be, 32 degrees at the top in winds up to 76 miles per hour.
Re-enacting the first ascent _ by F. O. Stanley and his wife, Flora
_ would have to wait for another day.
</P>
<P>
   So historical reenactment became social event and tour as
participants shifted gears.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gilheeney, the maintenance manager for the Mount Washington
Summit Road Co., worked to get the company's 1899 Locomobile
running, even though it would not attempt to re-create the climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you all to step back, it's like a fire-spittin'
dragon,'' he warned of the process of warming and lighting the
gasoline that heats the water that turns to steam that runs the
auto.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd only recently grown his eyebrows back from one such
flaming spit and then told of seeing a man a day earlier burn the
hair off one side of his head.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes of warming and fiddling, Gilheeney had the
Locomobile, which may be the one the Stanleys used to climb the
mountain, up and running. Minutes after that, backed from the
garage, it was spitting flames because it was getting too much
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The steam crowd is an eclectic bunch, beards abound, as do
period clothes, bug-eyed goggles and strange hats. And as in any
eclectic bunch, stories, tales, and myths abound.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley invented the steamer, some said, because his wife was
twice thrown from a horse. No, no, said others. It was because she
could not learn to ride a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn Benson of Limerick, Maine, raced through notch and valley
in his 1906 Stanley racer, baseball cap on backward, beard flowing
in twin wings up over his face, goggles fastened tight, giving him
the look of a speeding bug.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of what may have been the largest gathering of
steam cars ever held, and as they made their way along roads among
heavy summer tourist traffic they were centers of attention. Other
drivers waved to them; some looked at them curiously, perhaps
mistaking the steam that occasionally poured from beneath them for
the smoke of an engine gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they stopped, crowds formed: children goggle-eyed,
elderly couples holding hands and walking around them in reverence
or remembrance or both.
</P>
<P>
   They toured through the week, inspected one another's cars, were
gracious to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're leaving, some on trailers, some, like Nergaard's
Stanley, being driven all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   And 100 years after the first car, a steamer, climbed Mount
Washington, they will be gone _ like steam.

STUDY NOTES HUGE GAP IN PAY, EDUCATION FOR HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The wages of Hispanic workers in California lag
far behind those of other ethnic groups, and a corresponding lack
of education is the main culprit, according to a report done for
state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   With a median income of $14,560 per year, Hispanics make about
$8,000 less than the next-lowest group, blacks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the wages of Hispanics, who will make up the state's
largest group of workers by 2025, will mean big dividends for
California, said state Senate Majority Leader Richard G. Polanco, a
Democrat from Los Angeles, who requested the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are able to realize a long-term goal of raising the
level of educational attainment of Latinos to that of non-Latinos,
the result would be $28 billion in increased earnings circulating
in our economy,'' Polanco said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics comprise 28 percent of the 15.6 million workers in the
state and their numbers are growing daily. ``The earnings and the
tax base that they represent, therefore, are vital to the state's
economy,'' the authors of the report wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the California Research Bureau, an
office of the state library, was presented to the Senate Education
Committee, the Latino Legislative Caucus and the Hispanic
Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor in the relatively low earnings of Hispanic
workers is education, said Elias Lopez, one of the authors of the
report that was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, which was based in part on a U.S. Census
Bureau survey of 13,000 Californians in March 1998, more than 45
percent of Hispanic workers do not have a high school diploma, and
41 percent have only a high school diploma. Just 8 percent have a
bachelor's degree or higher.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, 33 percent of white workers have a bachelor's
degree or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is we've provided Latinos with prison
opportunities rather than educational opportunities,'' said Robert
Gnaizda, policy director for the Greenlining Institute, a public
policy and advocacy center based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prison system has eaten up a huge amount of discretionary
money that could have gone to the expansion of higher education,''
said Gnaizda, who was not involved in the study. Since the early
1980s, California has built 23 prisons and no new universities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of education is not limited to recent immigrants, but
persists even for third-generation Hispanics, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors recommend that California:
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to increase the numbers of Hispanic students who graduate
from high school and enroll in a four-year university.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage Hispanics currently in the work force to further
their educations.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Becerril, a member of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, said the study was ``hardly a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues of low wages and dropout rates have been pointed
out over and over again,'' she said. ``There is a growing gap
between Latino families and other groups. It's an issue that should
be of concern, not just for Latinos, but for all Californians. It
will have an impact on the future of the quality of all our
lives.''

SWITCHING THE STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago we told you we were thinking about taking our
column, Boston Capital, public. Our motivation was simple: We
wanted to get rich fast.
</P>
<P>
   Our goal hasn't changed but our strategy has. Our new plan? We
are going to sell ourselves to Lucent Technologies or Cisco Systems
or any of the other technology giants who seem to have an
insatiable appetite for small Massachusetts companies.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't been paying attention, these firms have been
devouring local businesses the way a bird gobbles up worms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Lucent paid $1.7 billion for Excel Switching Corp. in
Hyannis, the sixth time this year Lucent has purchased a
Massachusetts company. Cisco Wednesday paid $143 million for
MaxComm Technologies of Chelmsford; Cisco also paid $49 million for
a 4 percent stake in Akamai Technologies of Cambridge. If you are
doing the math, the Cisco investment puts Akamai's market value at
better than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Siemens, the German telecom company, spent
just over $1 billion on three tiny Massachusetts tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? To paraphrase James Carville, ``It's the
Internet, stupid.'' The rise of the Internet has touched off a mad
scramble to boost the speed and power of the networks that carry
voice and data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a revolution that is analogous to the industrial
revolution,'' says James Dolce, cofounder of Redstone
Communications. Dolce sold his Westford company in March to Siemens
for $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   All of the world's big telecom companies want to win this race
to the future and none want to risk falling behind. In theory, the
companies could develop the necessary technology themselves. In
practice, that would take too long. And in this race, time is
money. If you are late to market with the latest gizmo, the cost
could be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the little Massachusetts companies come in. Think
of them as research labs with expertise in communications, much of
it gained in the region's computer and networking companies. The
little guys develop new products quickly, test them, and prove that
they work. Then they sell out to the giants, often for astounding
amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollars involved are really small potatoes,'' insists
Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a Boston
consulting firm. The giants make most of the purchases with stock,
says Anderson, and in the case of Cisco and Lucent, that stock has
been steadily rising in value in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson makes a second point: By waiting, the big companies
face the prospect of paying even higher prices tomorrow. Example
number one: Lucent's January purchase of Ascend Communications for
$19.6 billion. Had Lucent acted a few years sooner, says Anderson,
it could have had Ascend's critical technology for a fraction of
that price.
</P>
<P>
   The curious economics of this competition explain why the local
companies sell out so early in the game. At one time young
technology firms hoped to grow into mighty oaks. Today they are
happy to sell themselves in the seed stage.
</P>
<P>
   When Dolce sold Redstone, the company had 70 employees and had
yet to ship a product.
</P>
<P>
   Like Redstone, Boston Capital is small. There are just the two
of us here. We too haven't shipped any product. We are in the
communications business and we do use the Internet on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be enough. We've noticed that many of the local
firms that attract big offers make switches _ switches that hook up
one network to another. We don't know a heck of a lot about
switches, but that shouldn't stand in our way.
</P>
<P>
   We'll go down to the local Home Depot store and buy some
switches _ garage-door switches, light switches, any kind of
switches we can get our hands on. We'll pick the one we like best,
call it an Internet switch, and put the company up for sale. Our
slogan will be: ``Boston Capital: Throw the Switch, Make Us Rich.''
</P>
<P>
   We'd prefer to sell out to Lucent or Cisco to keep the business
in America, but, in truth, we'd accept a foreign bid too. We're
patriotic but not excessively so.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need $1.7 billion. We'd take less, a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of voice and data convergence, we'll be waiting by
the phone and computer for an offer.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Midway through their 11-on-11 drills
Wednesday morning, the Patriots lined up wide receiver Terry Glenn
to the far right. Opposite the offense's best was the defense's
best, cornerback Ty Law.
</P>
<P>
   The call was for Glenn to run a deep post pattern. The receiver
that quarterback Drew Bledsoe calls ``the most talented guy I've
ever thrown to'' quickly zoomed into overdrive and easily opened up
three or four steps on Law and neither Law nor anyone was about to
catch up to Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The question _ the only question _ was whether Bledsoe's pass
would be on target. That's because if Bledsoe the passer has had a
weakness over the years, it has been with the accuracy of his deep
throws, especially deep throws near the sidelines. More than a few
times, Glenn and other New England receivers have had a free step
or more as they roamed deep, and Bledsoe's passes might or might
not be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Throwing the deep ball) is something that I don't feel I've
been extremely efficient at in my NFL career,'' said Bledsoe. ``I
feel I need to be more consistent in getting the deep ball and
taking advantage of those big plays. That's something that I will
continue to focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bledsoe's pass was perfect. Glenn still had three or
four strides on Law as the ball arrived deep downfield and Glenn
never had to break stride as he made the catch. For several reasons
_ Glenn easily slipping into overdrive and Bledsoe's perfect pass _
Patriots fans could forget the many defensive questions the team
has and dream on.
</P>
<P>
   A play or two later, Shawn Jefferson lined up on the far left,
with Steve Israel the cornerback on Jefferson. Over the last few
days, the receivers' legs have come back to them after the
inevitable heavy legs that follow the opening of camp, and it was
time to test them.
</P>
<P>
   The call for Jefferson was the same as it had been for Glenn _
run a deep post pattern. Just as Glenn had done, Jefferson zipped
past the cornerback and slipped into the open by two or three
steps. And once again, Bledsoe's long pass was perfectly on target
and Jefferson, like Glenn, never had to break stride for the
easiest of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe thought long and hard about this chink in his passing
armor. His short and medium passes are, as Jefferson put it, ``just
beautiful,'' but his long passes were not. Finally, Bledsoe
concluded, he was trying too hard to make the perfect pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come out of college and you have a strong arm, you
try and throw everything real hard,'' said Bledsoe, ``and make the
perfect throw all the time. The thing that I had to learn'' was not
to try and throw the perfect pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you take it and put more air in the ball (throw it
higher), then you have more room for error,'' explained the
quarterback. ``And with the talented guys we have (at wide
receiver) I feel if I give them an even chance to make the play,
then they're going to come down with the ball. Like if I give Terry
Glenn a 50-50 chance with a defensive back, then I feel he's going
to make the catch. Tony Simmons is the same way . . . Troy Brown,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   What all this means for the Drew Bledsoe of 1999 ``is that I'm
not always going to try and make the perfect throw right on the
sideline all the time. I'm going to leave it inside a little bit
more and rely on them to go up and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots ``are going to put more emphasis on the deep ball''
this season, said Jefferson. And the key for a quarterback to
complete that deep ball ``is to know your personnel,'' said
Jefferson. ``Like Terry . . . Drew can throw his arm out trying to
get the ball to Terry. And Tony, too, the young guys. But if a guy
might not be as fast as Terry, the thing is to know your guys. Then
maybe hang the ball up and give the guys a chance to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the strengths of this Patriots team are far, far,
far, and away its receivers, its tight end, and its quarterback.
And Bledsoe, now in his prime, is the key to all.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he has ``extremely high expectations for my
performance now'' because he has seen virtually anything and
everything a defense can show. ``In just about every situation,''
he said, ``I at least expect myself to make the right decision. I
might not always make the exact right throw, but I expect to be
almost perfect in my decision-making with the experience I have.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception of Bledsoe changed last season with his
come-from-behind wins over Buffalo and Miami in the last seconds
while playing with a severely damaged finger. ``I think the guys
who I've played with the last few years know what I'm about,'' said
Bledsoe. ``I think they've had confidence in me. I think the
perception change is more on the outside than it is within the
team. ``I expect us to win the division this year, it's as simple
as that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems, early in the exhibition season, that if that is to
happen, the Patriots may have to score points and more points and
then even more points.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is now into his second season of running Ernie Zampese's
offense ``and we're ahead in our offense simply because we've
worked with the same system for two years,'' he said. ``The bread
and butter of our offense is timing on the out routes, curls, and
posts, and I feel we're much more efficient with that stuff than we
were in the past. That's what Ernie hangs his hat on _ the timing
stuff _ and if we can be efficient with the quick timing stuff,
it'll open up more of the field for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With a receiving corps so deep, it might be tempting for the
Patriots to consider the Vikings' approach, which is to intimidate
defenses with so many threats in the passing game. Indeed, Bledsoe
envisions sending Glenn deep on one play and then maybe having the
speedy Simmons in from the bench on the next before defenders can
get their legs and wind back from running downfield with Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   But few are giving the Patriots much chance this season. And, as
Bledsoe noted, New England seldom has done what it has been
expected to do _ either good or bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to be the underdog,'' said Bledsoe of the early
predictions that the Patriots will finish no better than fourth in
the AFC East. ``From the time I've been here, we've responded well
when we've been the underdog. Maybe it'll be a rallying point for
us this year and a motivation point to prove people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it'll have to be Bledsoe doing the most.

EXPLORING A VIRAL TIE TO BREAST TUMORS  
 SNACKING AT NIGHT, AND WHY THEY DO IT  
 WEIGHING THE RISKS OF HORMONE THERAPY

 Exploring a viral tie to breast tumors
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious
mononucleosis, related to breast cancer?
</P>
<P>
   In the current Journal of the National Cancer Institute,
European researchers report that they found the virus in 51 of 100
breast cancer tissues studied, particularly in more aggressive
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon to say cause and effect. It is a correlation,''
Irene Joab, one of the authors of the paper and a researcher at the
Saint Louis Hospital in Paris, said in an interview. ``We have to
do more work.''
</P>
<P>
   While this study confirms some earlier researchers' findings, at
least five other groups of scientists have looked for the virus in
breast cancer and not found it, according to an editorial
accompanying the article, by two National Cancer Institute
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the virus does not turn out to be a cause of breast
cancer, the cancer institute's scientists said that it could still
serve as ``a useful prognostic indicator'' or target for cancer
therapy. And if it does turn out to be a cause, efforts to develop
a vaccine against the virus should be stepped up, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its role in mononucleosis, popularly known as the
``kissing disease,'' the virus has been linked to Burkitt's
lymphoma, which is usually found in Africa and causes a jaw tumor,
and a rare nose-and-throat cancer usually found in China.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Snacking at night, and why they do it
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45 years ago, night-eating syndrome was first described,
but it had never been subjected to careful study _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   As first identified in 1955 by Dr. Albert Stunkard and
colleagues, the syndrome consists of morning anorexia, evening
overeating and insomnia, and is found to occur during stressful
periods and to be linked with failed efforts to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Journal of the American Medical Association,
Stunkard joins colleagues from the University of Tromso in Norway
and the University of Pennsylvania to further elucidate the
behavioral and hormonal characteristics of the night-eating
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing the behavior of those who suffer from night-eating
syndrome and those who do not, the researchers found that those who
have the syndrome consumed 56 percent of their calories between 8
p.m. and 6 a.m., while those who do not consumed only 15 percent in
that time period.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 10 night eaters in the study woke up 178 times in a
week, and more than half of those awakenings led to a
carbohydrate-rich snack. The 10 people who did not suffer from the
syndrome experienced a total of 13 night awakenings, and none of
them led to a snack.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the researchers found the night eaters' moods
got worse as the day progressed.
</P>
<P>
   On the hormonal front, the researchers found that night eaters
were out of synch for melatonin, leptin, and cortisol, compared
with non-night eaters.
</P>
<P>
   These findings suggest that night-eating syndrome ``appears to
represent a new eating disorder,'' different from the already
recognized eating disorders of anorexia, bulimia, and binging,
wrote the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weighing the risks of hormone therapy
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the controversy over hormone replacement therapy for
postmenopausal women, several medical organizations urge physicians
to counsel women about the risks and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study by researchers from Harvard Medical School and
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care found that the organizations'
guidelines for physicians are inadequate at meeting the needs of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the American College of Physicians recommends that
women be actively involved in the decision making, but provides few
specifics to doctors on how to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The group's physician guidelines even fail to steer clinicians
toward the group's own patient-oriented brochures on hormone
replacement therapy, according to the report in this week's Annals
of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. Maureen T. Connelly, involved in-depth
interviews with 26 Harvard Pilgrim patients who had received
prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy.

WEB SITE (PLUS) ROCK STARS (PLUS) ACTIVISM (EQUALS) ACTIVISM

<P>
   It's an unlikely scenario: Pop stars meet computer geeks meet
United Nations development workers. Together, these unusual
partners come up with an ambitious plan to fight world hunger and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it sounds, that's precisely the strategy behind NetAid, a
project that aims to combine the communications power of the
Internet with the celebrity lure of such rock stars as U2 singer
Bono and Bush. The initiative will make a splash on Oct. 9 with
simultaneous concerts in Geneva, London, and the Meadowlands, N.J.,
that will be broadcast on television, radio, and over the Internet.
The lineup so far includes both Bono and Bush, the Corrs and the
Counting Crows, Celine Dion, Jewel, the Eurythmics, Wyclef Jean,
George Michael, Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend, and Robbie Williams.
About a dozen additional acts are expected to be announced in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity-studded concerts are designed to raise awareness
of a new activist Web site, www.netaid.org, a joint project of the
computer networking company Cisco Systems and the United Nations
Development Program. The organizers want the site to serve as a
sort of global portal for social activism, providing information on
such issues as hunger, refugees, the environment, and human rights.
When the site is in full operation, it will provide ways for
individuals to hook up with relief and aid organizations, either to
donate funds or volunteer services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary goal isn't to raise money, it's to raise
consciousness and get people engaged,'' says Don Listwin, executive
vice president of Cisco Systems. ``It's like the eBay concept: You
are able to match up your desire with the right thing. In this
case, it doesn't happen to be a Furby; it happens to be a social
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Malloch Brown, the UN Development Program's administrator,
likens the site to a ``sophisticated dating service,'' matching
individuals with the needs of nongovernmental organizations. ``The
Net is a great constituency-building tool,'' he says. ``In the old
days, you could only get this kind of information by traveling or
joining the Peace Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerts _ at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, Wembley
Stadium in London, and the Palais des Nations in Geneva _ provide
the big splash to attract attention to the site: They will be
broadcast by VH1, MTV, and the BBC, with streaming video on line.
Listwin bills the event as the ``largest fully integrated global
multimedia event'' in history; thanks to technology from Akamai
Technologies, the Cambridge, Mass Web site can handle up to 10
million viewers during the event and 125,000 simultaneous video
streams _ 10 times the capacity for the 1998 Olympics and the 1998
men's World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be launched on Sept. 8, the same day as the debut
performance of a NetAid single, ``New Day,'' written by Bono and
hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean, who will play it at the United Nations.
The single, Listwin says, may be available for free digital
download, a proven way to attract viewers to a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But this effort isn't simply ``We Are the World'' with
computers; Unlike other one-time-only musical events like LiveAid
or FarmAid,'' NetAid is not simply a feel-good, knee-jerk response
to social issues, Brown says. It is a sustainable project with
three long-term goals: to build a global constituency to fight
poverty; to build a public-private partnership that Brown says will
``get the UN out of its hidebound, bureaucratic environment''; and
to bridge the digital gap between developed countries and the Third
World. ``At the moment, about 2 billion people have not even placed
a telephone call, much less (gone) on line,'' says Brown. ``But I
want to raise this as a challenge to the information technology
industry: How do we meet the challenge of providing connectivity?
The Internet, we know, can be a great equalizing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, the Internet industry has hardly been
a model of philanthropic largesse, despite huge profits and rapid
growth. ``That's one of the great possibilities here,'' says Brown.
``This new industry has been growing up out West without a sense of
social responsibility, but now they're starting to come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Web site, there will also be a NetAid
Foundation that will donate the proceeds from the concerts to
refugees in Kosovo and Africa. And when the music stops, the site
will live on. ``Five years ago, we didn't have any idea how rampant
e-commerce and the Net would be,'' Listwin says. ``Now if the Net
could only have one-tenth the impact on social change as it is
having on business, we could do great things.''

<P>
   While Crosley ``Pappa'' Green sat on death row in Raiford, Fla.,
private detective Joe Moura studied long into the night, flipping
through pages and pages of documents chronicling the 10-year-old
Florida murder case from his office in Stoughton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   After many nights poring over old testimony, Moura, 46, along
with three other top investigators from Chicago, Denver, and San
Diego, came to a conclusion: Green may die for a crime he never
committed. This weekend, Moura met the other detectives outside of
Orlando where they tracked down witnesses who recanted statements
as a camera crew from the television show ``48 Hours'' recorded
every word.
</P>
<P>
   Though their work is far from completion, they already believe
they have enough evidence to prove that Green, 41, was wrongly
convicted of killing Charles ``Chip'' Flynn in April 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It a belief that innocent men are being sent to their deaths
because of unequal representation in the nation's court system that
has launched Moura and his friends on a crusade that has landed
them in the small town of Titusville, Fla., fighting for the life
of a man they have never met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say this,'' Moura, who is working pro bono on the
case, said Wednesday from Florida. ``I've been in this business for
26 years, and this is one case in which the facts prove this man
should not be in prison for murder . . . I firmly believe that
Pappa Green is going to walk out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Moura believes that, like many poor, black men with little or no
money for a good defense, Green never had an equal chance to prove
he didn't kill the 22-year-old Flynn, who was white.
</P>
<P>
   A Portuguese immigrant who grew up in Stoughton, Moura has been
investigating crimes and fraud cases ever since he was 14.
</P>
<P>
   Most times, Moura travels all over the world assisting
high-powered private clients or helping Boston police crack cases.
But the Florida case has convinced him that men like Green are
fighting a losing battle when the best lawyers and investigators
are all on the prosecution's side.
</P>
<P>
   Green's case, said Moura, should be a lesson to Massachusetts to
stay away from the death penalty. It should also indicate to states
like Illinois, where 12 men have been released from death row, that
a case should be investigated exhaustively before sending a man to
his death.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the addresses of witnesses, including Green's sister,
Moura and an old friend, Chicago detective Paul Ciolino, who helped
a Northwestern professor gather enough evidence to free a Chicago
man days before he was scheduled to be executed last September,
knocked on doors and interviewed people who now say they were
pressured by police and the prosecution to lie. Furthermore, both
men argue that there never was any physical evidence _ blood spots,
finger or shoe prints _ that tied Green to the crime or the crime
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Holmes, an assistant state attorney in Brevard County,
said the key eyewitness picked Green out from a stack of
photographs, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Now Green's case is up for appeal. If new evidence can prove he
was falsely accused, that there are new witnesses, or that his
lawyer was insufficient, Green could be granted a new trial. But
Holmes insists such claims are typical of death-row defendants _
that Moura and his friends are grasping at straws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems happy with their counsel after they didn't walk
free,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be 15 years before Green is executed, said Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   According to news and court records of the notorious murder
case, Green, of Titusville, Fla., kidnapped and robbed Flynn and
his girlfriend, Kim Hallock, on the night of April 3, 1989. Police
said he stole the truck the two were sitting in and forced them to
ride along as he drove to a remote area. Green tied Flynn's hands,
but Hallock was able to hand him a gun.
</P>
<P>
   When Green stopped the truck, he yanked Hallock out. Flynn fired
a shot before falling to the ground. Hallock testified she was able
to hop in the truck, drive away, and call police. But Flynn had
bled to death before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Hallock picked Green out of a photo lineup, and then testified
against him at trial. Green's defenders, however, insist that the
photo lineup was ``suggestive'' _ that Green was the only
dark-skinned black man in the bunch, and that Hallock's
identification was influenced by the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tim Curtis, a Florida car dealer who was Flynn's best
friend, now says he may have been mistaken in testifying against
Green. Curtis said he was so angry that a black man could have
killed his pal that he now worries that maybe he was blinded from
the truth, and somehow altered Green's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there are a few things that got my heart and mind
troubled,'' said Curtis, who was also interviewed by Moura.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990 trial, he testified that he saw Green hours
before the murder, a statement he still believes to be true. But
Curtis, who months before sold Flynn the truck Green is accused of
hijacking, now also believes Green is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Green's fingerprints were not found inside or outside the truck,
a fact that Curtis said was kept from him, though court and news
reports show it was entered into court. ``It's virtually impossible
to drive that truck without leaving fingerprints. I knew that
truck. You had to manhandle it. It was my truck,'' he said. ``I
have a whole sick guilt feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis knew Green and said he was no angel but he shouldn't die
for a crime he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in Titusville, said Ciolino, the Chicago detective,
thought Green _ who came from a tumultous background _ was headed
for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   His father killed his mother and turned the gun on himself. His
nine brothers and sisters were raised on the streets, and his
nephew landed on death row, too. Green was a drug user and had a
rap sheet dating back to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely this background, Moura and his fellow
detectives say, that caused police to focus on Green as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an insignificant criminal and also happened to be poor,
black, and had the reputation of a big mouth,'' said Ciolino. ``His
family had a bad reputation, so to make him the bad guy was not
only convenient but healthy.''

FOR ZOO'S DOCTORS, GORILLA BIRTH IS ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KRISTIN VAUGHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He is in the midst of both people and gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   It makes no difference to Dr. Machelle Seibel, a reproductive
endocrinologist, who balances being on-call at a suburban clinic
with answering the call of the wild at the Franklin Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Seibel, and two other doctors who typically work with humans _
Dr. Ralph Philosophe and Dr. Boris Swarztman _ formed an emergency
response team recently to help Kiki, a pregnant gorilla, in case
she experienced complications from childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, their expertise wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, the 17-year-old western lowland gorilla gave birth to
a healthy 4-pound baby _ Franklin Park Zoo's first gorilla birth.
</P>
<P>
   The baby has been nursing and progressing well and has remained
healthy despite last week's threat from the extreme diarrhea that
afflicted the five older gorillas in the troop _ including Kiki.
All have recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo visitors can catch the first glimpses of the new baby
gorilla with its mother Thursday as they go on exhibit from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekdays or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The gorilla birth wasn't the first time that Seibel, who works
with human reproductive disorders at the Fertility Center of New
England, has volunteered to make his medical knowledge available to
patients of a hairier kind.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on the same night that Kiki delivered, Seibel had been
at the zoo earlier to perform an ultrasound on a pregnant,
cat-sized primitive monkey called a potto.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past, he's done everything from removing a vaginal
tumor from a 220-pound gorilla named Gigi to prescribing birth
control pills for a painted-face primate called a mandrill, who was
experiencing excessive bleeding during her menstrual cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I called in the prescription, I said, `I'm
calling this in for `Mandy the mandrill' and the pharmacist asked,
`What's her insurance?' '' said Seibel, who seems tickled when his
animal and human worlds meet.
</P>
<P>
   Although using doctors trained for human beings to treat zoo
animals might seem odd at first glance, Seibel said that some
physiological differences between these zoo animals and people are
so small that it doesn't make sense not to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certain anatomy that is similar, like there is only a
small difference in the pelvis and the size of the babies at birth.
The length of pregnancy is about 8 1/2 months. . . . If you are
familiar with humans, then primates, particularly gorillas, are
really quite similar,'' Seibel said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorillas are also susceptible to many of the same illnesses as
humans and they receive human vaccination shots for such diseases
as measles and polio. Females have menstrual cycles, although they
don't always bleed.
</P>
<P>
   The normally 230-pound Kiki was even given a human pregnancy
test and would have had a Caesarean delivery conducted by the
emergency response team if there had been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   A ``tag team'' system was developed in case one of the doctors
was on vacation during the projected delivery period _ anytime
between July 15 and mid-September. Zoo officials and an outside
veterinarian worked with the team, who ran through emergency
scenarios and got updates on Kiki's condition from the zoo staff,
who were on a rotating 24-hour watch for weeks leading up to the
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Seibel, who worked with the first test-tube human babies born in
Massachusetts, said zoo officials first approached him about six
years ago to help them improve the fertility of their six western
lowland gorillas, an endangered type found in thick jungles in
coastal western Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in captivity and there is a limited number of male
and female'' gorillas, which leads to a lot of inbreeding. Seibel
said. Zoos across the US share data about the genetic history of
their gorillas in captivity and then loan the animals to each other
so they can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exciting and it's extremely interesting,'' Seibel said
of the opportunity he has to volunteer with the zoo. ``I'm learning
about animal behavior and it's a way to get to be a part of the
zoo's health and development.''
</P>
<P>
   Seibel said his colleagues at the fertility center also ``think
it's kinda neat.''

PUNISHED FOR PRAYING IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The City of Boston is shocked _ shocked! _ to find praying going
on at the Keys of Life Bible School. And not only praying, but
Bible reading. And as if those weren't bad enough, there are
religious emblems in plain view _ crosses and spiritual posters
right out in the open where anyone might see them.
</P>
<P>
   This is intolerable, the city says, and Keys of Life must be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Keys of Life is a summer day camp run by the Mason Cathedral
Church in Boston's low-income Dorchester neighborhood. It is a
modest operation _ a large room in the church's lower level
outfitted with tables and chairs, a few computers, a pile of books,
and a large screen TV. The church has no athletic facilities of its
own, but Franklin Field, a public park, is just down the street and
there's a pool at the nearby Boys and Girls Club. As camps go, it
isn't much. But it's run by people who care deeply about their
community, and it helps keep 30 city kids, many from homes with no
fathers and few luxuries, off the streets and out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The doors open at 7:30 every morning; some children don't leave
until 6:30 p.m. Most of those 11 hours are taken up with physical
activities and recreation _ swimming, drawing, ballplaying,
video-watching. But the first order of business every day is a few
minutes of devotion and Bible study. The children usually recite
the Lord's Prayer. Sometimes a child mentions that he is praying
about something specific _ a lost pet, a sick grandmother.
``Mostly,'' says Kenya Cross, who directs Keys of Life, ``we ask
God to let us make it through each day in peace. And He does.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that peace has been torn.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month the camp's seven teen-age counselors,
participants in a federally-funded summer jobs program, were yanked
from Keys of Life and sent elsewhere. City officials accuse the
church of asking the counselors to pray, in ``direct violation'' of
the federal Job Training Partnership Act, which pays for the summer
jobs. But that law merely requires that participants not be
employed ``on the construction, operation, or maintenance'' of a
place of worship. That restriction has never posed a problem for
Keys of Life; its counselors spend their day taking care of kids,
not building churches.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the camp has repeatedly been praised by Action for
Boston Community Development, the agency that administers the jobs
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five years they've been saying I do good work,'' says Rev.
Thomas Cross, Kenya's father and the pastor of Mason Cathedral.
``This year, everything changed.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, ABCD sent a letter to Mason Cathedral, warning the
church not to involve the counselors in ``religious activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These include but are not limited to the following: praying,
reading Bible stories, drawing Bible pictures, and cleaning in the
areas of the church where there are religious symbols.... All
religious activities must cease immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   To Rev. Cross and his daughter, this was preposterous. Ban
prayer at a church-run summer camp? But the city was adamant. Larry
Smith, the official who supervises ABCD's operation of the summer
program, came to the church to insist that the Crosses toe the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat right here in my office,'' Cross says in amazement,
``and told me, `My job is to make sure those kids don't pray.'''
According to Cross, Smith also told him to remove any religious
symbols visible to the children _ including the crucifix on the
pastor's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I've got two Stars of David and the Ten
Commandments on the facade of the church,'' Cross relates. (The
building used to be a synagogue.) ``He said, `They'll have to come
down too.' Well, I am not tearing down my church.''
</P>
<P>
   The city isn't budging, either. When it isn't claiming
erroneously that its hands are tied by the Job Training Partnership
Act, it is pointing to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a total separation of church and state in this
country,'' Constance Doty, director of the city's Office of Jobs
and Community Services, told The Boston Globe last week. ``This
program is funded with federal dollars, and it's very clear that
the youths ... cannot participate in religious or political
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't a total separation of church and state in
America, and there never has been. God is mentioned four times in
the Declaration of Independence. Congress hires chaplains, as do
most state legislatures and the military. Presidents take the oath
of office with a hand on the Bible. Every piece of US currency
proclaims, ``In God We Trust.'' The same words are mounted over the
Speaker's rostrum in the US House of Representatives. By law, the
pledge to the flag includes the words ``one nation under God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution says nothing about a ``separation of church and
state.'' The words come from a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote in
1802 to the Danbury Baptist Association. The Baptists had suffered
much persecution, and Jefferson wanted to reassure them that under
the First Amendment, the government had no authority to hinder or
control their activities. The First Amendment, Jefferson was
saying, is designed to (ital) protect (unital) religious
establishments, not to hassle and harass them.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the Constitution requires pastors to take down the
crucifix from their office door or bars teen-agers from helping
little kids say a brief morning prayer. The federal dollars that
paid the Keys of Life counselors were not being used to promote
religion. They were being used to enable a humble summer camp to
provide a safe summer haven in a neighborhood that badly needs such
havens.
</P>
<P>
   Will nobody reverse this decision? The kids at Mason Cathedral
still say their prayers, but they miss their counselors.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer business has saddled us with many a confusing
acronym: SDRAM, JPEG, WYSIWYG. Well, here's the most dismaying one
yet: UCITA. What's really scary about this one is that it was
dreamed up by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws
is a band of legal experts who write ``model statutes'' that can be
enacted by all 50 states. That way, the law stays roughly the same
between here and Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the conference served up its latest effort, the
Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, or UCITA. It's a
model statute that's supposed to govern purchases of computer
software, and the commissioners want to see it become law in every
state. So do the world's leading software companies. UCITA is
backed by the industry's biggest lobbying groups _ the Business
Software Alliance and the Software and Information Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a winner, until you learn that attorneys general
from 26 of the 50 states (not including Massachusetts, alas) have
denounced the proposed law. So has the Federal Trade Commission,
the publishers of Consumer Reports magazine, the Association of
Computing Machinery, the American Library Association, and even the
American Law Institute, which had worked with the commission to
draft earlier versions of UCITA.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because UCITA takes some of the worst aspects of the
software business and etches them permanently into the law.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: Do you actually own the software you buy? Probably
not. Read one of those nearly unreadable contracts that come in the
box. There's a good chance that what you really bought is a license
to use the software, not outright ownership of your copy of it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the programming know-how in your copy of Microsoft
Word still belongs to Microsoft, just as the contents of the novel
``Rainbow Six'' belong to Tom Clancy. But imagine Clancy telling
you that he owns your copy of the book, and you need his permission
to resell it, or even lend it to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The book publishing industry actually tried to pull such a stunt
early in the century, until Macy's department store took it to the
US Supreme Court and won the right to sell used books. The courts
have not yet settled the issue whether consumers own the software
they buy. UCITA would settle it, and the answer would generally be
``no.''
</P>
<P>
   This might not be too bad if the license terms are reasonable.
Lots of companies grant permission to resell software, for
instance. But how will you know before you buy? Under UCITA, the
full license doesn't have to be provided until you've purchased the
software. Yes, you're allowed to return it if you don't like the
terms, but that's still a considerable stumbling block. There's a
cheap, simple solution: require companies to publish their licenses
on a Web site. UCITA doesn't bother with this.
</P>
<P>
   Under UCITA, software companies can dream up just about any
licensing scheme they want, as long as they provide the consumer
with ``conspicuous'' notice of the terms. Companies already try to
blow these terms past us, but UCITA would provide them with an
extra layer of legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Network Associates Inc. forbids users of its
McAfee antivirus software from publishing reviews of the product
without permission? It's right there, ``conspicuously'' displayed
in one of those licenses virtually nobody takes the time to read.
Under existing law, such a provision is probably unenforceable, and
it might also be unenforceable under UCITA. But it could take a few
years of plodding through federal courts to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Raise these concerns with software industry folks, and they
wonder about all the fuss. ``Quite frankly, why should the attorney
general care about UCITA?'' said Mark Nebergall, counsel for the
Software and Information Industry Association. Nebergall told me
the state attorneys general who signed an anti-UCITA letter didn't
know what they were doing. He figures the AGs were goaded into
signing by the states' consumer protection lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, Mark. That's why states have consumer
protection lawyers _ to blow the whistle on laws that threaten to
injure consumers. Laws like UCITA that, in its current form, should
be sent to wherever acronyms go when they die.

BELL ATLANTIC DSL STUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``D'' in ``DSL'' is supposed to stand for digital. The other
two letters stand for the words ``subscriber line,'' which is
telephone company jargon for the wires that run from the firm's
central office to your home and business. Together, the letters DSL
stand for a new technology that is bringing high-speed Internet
access to many homes and businesses nationwide and, increasingly,
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are basically two ways to get DSL service in Boston. The
first is through an established Internet service provider, such as
Harvard Net or Shore Net. Call one of these ISPs, which are
marketing mostly to businesses, and it will order you a second
telephone line for the DSL connection.
</P>
<P>
   Getting this second phone line can take anywhere from one to two
months _ and sometimes longer. The price of the connection depends
on how fast you wish to connect to the Internet: Typical prices are
$200/month for a connection that can send 384 kilobits per second,
or $300/month for a connection that runs at 768 kbps.
</P>
<P>
   The second way to get DSL service in Boston is directly from
Bell Atlantic, using the new InfoSpeed service introduced earlier
this year. Bell Atlantic is initially targeting residential
subscribers, aggressively marketing DSL as a high-speed alternative
to dial-up Internet access. The company says InfoSpeed is a secure
alternative to cable modems, which it refers to as a ``party
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has a distinct advantage in offering DSL: It
already has a telephone line in practically everybody's home. So
when you order DSL from Bell Atlantic, you don't need to wait for a
new wire to be installed. Instead, the company merely clips the DSL
equipment on to your existing telephone line, which is then used
for both voice and data.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has priced its DSL service at roughly $50 per
month _ about the same as my MediaOne cable modem, and a quarter
the cost of a DSL connection from Concentric or Shore Net. To avoid
cannibalizing its own data services, however, Bell Atlantic has put
an interesting restriction on the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although download speeds can allegedly go as fast as 640 kbps,
the upload rate is limited to 90 kbps. This restriction is designed
to prevent people from running high-traffic Web servers or other
Internet services on their home networks. By comparison, my
MediaOne cable modem delivers 300 to 600 kbps in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   I've gotten an incredible amount of e-mail from readers in
recent months about Bell Atlantic's DSL offering, so I decided to
try it. As things turned out, I was one of the first customers in
Massachusetts allowed to ``self-install'' the DSL equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having a Bell Atlantic technician come to my house
and hook up the equipment, the company just mailed me a box. I
plugged it in and turned it on. Within a few moments, a little
green light appeared on the box indicating that the DSL line was
operational. Unfortunately, it was also misconfigured: It took me
two phone calls, and an hour waiting on hold, to get things
working.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first differences I noticed between the DSL and the
cable modem was the speed. Although the DSL is supposed to run
faster than the cable modem, in my side-by-side comparison tests I
found that overall, the cable modem Internet connection was between
30 percent and 50 percent faster than the DSL.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it took me 4 minutes and 54 seconds to download the
180-second trailer from the movie ``The Matrix'' over my cable
modem; over the DSL connection, the same download (at exactly the
same time of day) took 8 minutes and 3 seconds. The overall rate
for the cable modem was 592 kbps, vs. 346 for Bell Atlantic's DSL.
I had similar results downloading a copy of Netscape Navigator: 1
minute 27 seconds by cable modem; 4 minutes 27 seconds by DSL.
</P>
<P>
   These download times aren't necessarily the fault of the DSL
technology. Instead, they are likely caused by congestion at Bell
Atlantic.NET, the phone company's own ISP. Unfortunately, while
Bell Atlantic promises that other companies will ultimately be
allowed to offer Internet service over its lines, right now there
are no other choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant difference between the cable modem and the
DSL connection involves security. Since both connections provide
``always-on'' access to the Net, it's important that your computer
be relatively secure so bad guys can't break into it. As I've
written in the past, one of the easiest ways to break into a
Windows 95 or NT computer over the Internet is to use Microsoft's
file-sharing protocols: Many people inadvertently make their home
computer's hard drive available for remote access without a
password.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for cable modem customers is that MediaOne
automatically blocks Microsoft's file-sharing protocols on cable
modems in the Boston area. MediaOne programs each of its cable
modems to work like a mini ``firewall.'' Unfortunately, Bell
Atlantic puts no similar blocks on its DSL service. Instead, it
includes with the modem a brochure explaining the dangers of file
sharing and advising customers to turn off file sharing before
connecting to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I'm rather disappointed by Bell Atlantic's DSL
service. The company's one advantage is deployment: DSL is likely
to be available in many communities not served by MediaOne or
another cable modem provider. But given a choice between DSL and
cable, I would choose the latter _ at least until Bell Atlantic
gets more experience in offering high-speed Internet service.

 IPSWICH, Mass.: ... Old Sturbridge Village.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But his crowning achievement, and the one that kept his Boston
firm solvent through the Depression, was building the gardens and
grounds of Colonial Williamsburg for the Rockefellers. Shurcliff
started with next to nothing and made a re-creation that looked the
way he thought an 18th-century town should look. Which was
tasteful.
</P>
<P>
   So when a genuine 17th-century building (not a reproduction!)
landed just up the road from his summer house, Shurcliff couldn't
resist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, he presented the historical society with a landscape
design. A few years later, he drew up an even more extravagant plan
to turn the Whipple House into a mini-Williamsburg, complete with
outbuildings _ including a row of slave cabins that would have been
more appropriate for a Southern plantation. (The Whipples of the
17th and 18th centuries owned several slaves, including a native
American, but they lived inside the main house.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the society adopted only the basic layout for a
kitchen garden, which includes six raised beds separated by walks
of crushed clamshells. Shurcliff planted them with his favorite
Harrison's yellow roses, which were pretty but wildly out of
period.
</P>
<P>
   Then the house suffered one of its worst episodes. It was found
to have termites, and it was closed for several years during the
last and most damaging of three ``restorations.''
</P>
<P>
   When the house was reopened to visitors in 1955, shortly before
his death, Shurcliff passed the baton to his good friend and
neighbor Isadore Smith, asking her to replant the garden beds
``authentically and symmetrically.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith ran with it, plunging into original research to discover
exactly what herbs housewives grew in the 17th-century Bay Colony,
reading old medical and herbal manuals and wills. In the process,
she became something the property badly needed: a champion for
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   She learned so much that she wrote a book, published in 1970.
``Early American Gardens: For Meate or Medicine'' documented the
plantings of 17th-century housewives' gardens, with herbal dyes and
recipes tested by Smith's friend Elizabeth Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Two more books followed, each covering a different century:
``American Gardens in the Eighteenth Century: For Use or Delight''
in 1976 and ``American Gardens in the Nineteenth Century: For
Comfort and Affluence.'' The first two were published by Houghton
Mifflin. The last was published in 1986, the year after her death,
by the University of Massachusetts Press, which still keeps all
three volumes in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about (the Whipple garden) is that it
started her writing the first of those three books,'' says garden
historian Ruthanne Rogers, who knew Isadore Smith briefly. ``She
was a very strong-minded woman. We formed a committee to do a
little park garden. I asked her to be a member. Wow! She was very
opinionated! You had to walk carefully around her at times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She wrote standing up, not sitting down,'' recalls her son
Jim. ``She worked on an old-fashioned four-poster bed. She'd have
her old Royal manual typewriter on the bed and pile all her sources
on the bed. And, at night, she'd clean the bed off and go to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Smith use a pen name? Jim Smith theorizes: ``If your
name is Smith, it's hard to find you in the index. My father was
also a writer, and when I ask my book collector friend to find me
copies of his old novels and tell him my dad's name was A. W.
Smith, well, my friend just grinds his teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Isadore Smith, a.k.a. Ann Leighton, oversaw maintenance of the
Whipple House garden as a collection of 17th-century herbs until
she collapsed, a year before her death, from the effects of Lyme
disease. ``If you're going to do gardening in that part of the
world, you're going to get Lyme disease. It comes with the
territory,'' her son says, matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even after she was moved to Florida to live with
relatives, the enfeebled author continued to write. ``She didn't
have the strength to push the keys on her old Royal. So she bought
a laptop computer and learned how to use it, at age 84, so she
could write until she died,'' says her son.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Whipple House garden is maintained by a dedicated crew
of volunteers, many of whom used to pull weeds alongside Isadore
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But the Leighton books are far better known and more influential
than the actual garden, according to some historians. And through
the books, the house that suffered so many historical indignities
has, with a measure of poetic justice, helped other historic
properties to enjoy more tender treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those books are fabulous. I use them all the time,'' says
Betsy Igleheart, director of landscapes for the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities. ``I also refer people to
them when they call and say they have an early house and ask what
to plant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isadore Smith is recognized as an important figure in garden
history today. Her 19th-century book was her best book,'' Rogers
says, adding, ``I've used all of them, and every garden historian
has.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    
 &HT;     Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Cher in HBO
Special ``Cher: Live in Concert.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's the queen of re-invention.
 &HT;    Just when you think she's finished, she bounces back.
 &HT;    Now, in the summer of '99, she's more popular than ever, with an
eye-popping live show that's receiving the reviews of a lifetime.
 &HT;    The Washington Post calls her ``the eternal diva'' whose
extravagant tour appearances are filled with ``glitz and glamor the
likes of which we seldom see anymore.''
 &HT;    Her enormously popular single ``Believe'' has been called a
masterpiece of technopop and became her biggest hit in a
four-decades-long recording career.
 &HT;    As she sweeps her way through the United States and on to
Britain in the fall, television viewers will see the full extent of
Cher's top-this theatrics on her HBO special airing on Aug. 29.
 &HT;    And while she seems to enjoy the almost universal acclaim, Cher
says the pernennial stories about an eternally reincarnated disco
queen are just good press.
 &HT;    ``I'm just the same old, same old,'' she says. ``I always laugh
when people say I'm reinventing myself. It's just a matter of being
popular or not popular.
 &HT;    ``And every time I've had a time of not being popular and then
being popular again, people say I've reinvented myself ... To tell
you the truth I'm pretty much the same person I've always been, and
I'm doing pretty much the same things.''
 &HT;    In truth, Cher has enjoyed more comebacks than Bill Clinton.
 &HT;    She's gone from pop to disco and back, from network icon to
movie star.
 &HT;    Her highly respected work alongside Meryl Streep in ``Silkwood''
(l983) was followed up by her portrayal of a biker mother in
``Mask'' (1985), which in turn led to her role as a lawyer in the
thriller ``Suspect'' (l987).
 &HT;    In 1987 she won an Academy Award for her work in the bittersweet
comedy ``Moonstruck.''
 &HT;    And in between, she's made a fortune starring in hair product
infomercials, squeezed in some Las Vegas-style nightclub dates and
played the trashy rocker in concert.
 &HT;    ``I do what's in front of me at the moment,'' she says
defiantly, looking trim and wearing an eye-straining, plum-colored
wig in a satellite interview from New York.
 &HT;    ``This is my work and all facets of it are the things that I do
best, things I've done all my life. So at the same time, I have my
tour and my new movie `Tea with Mussolini' (a Franco Zeffirelli
film in which she plays a free-spirited art collector in the
1930s.)
 &HT;    ``I'm an artist. This is just what I do and I don't care how
it's wrapped or when it comes out,'' Cher says.
 &HT;    Dressed in a 1930's designer suit and coiffed to perfection as a
grande dame, she certainly looks re-invented. At 53, she's had
extensive plastic surgery and appears to have recaptured the
fountain of youth.
 &HT;    She has announced that she is celibate after a string of very
public relationships with younger men, personal choices that she
admits have been less successful than her professional ones.
 &HT;    ``Look, I don't do real life so well. But I don't believe an
artist's life is supposed to go smoothly. It's only after years
after you're dead that your life makes any sense or has any real
meaning,'' Cher says.
 &HT;    ``My life is not smooth or neat and tidy. I don't care about
that kind of stuff.''
 &HT;    From the 1960's ``I Got You Babe'' (a duet with her late
ex-husband Sonny Bono) to ``Half Breed'' and ``Dark Lady'' in the
1970s, from the 1980s' ``If I could Turn Back Time'' to this
spring's lavish ``Believe,'' Cher is the only female singer to have
enjoyed a top ten hit in each of the last four decades.
 &HT;    And she's still wowing them on the concert circuit, where each
show features eight costume and wig changes, three video film
retrospectives, flying acrobats, a man on stilts, a huge inflatable
lava lamp ... and Cher's exhausting workout.
 &HT;    ``For me every night it's aerobics for an hour and a half.
Because you can sing and stand or you can run around, but you mix
the two together and it's really a brand new experience.''

nightly on the concert circuit, but the veteran performer says
she's not ready to slow down yet.

finished yet.''

WOMEN'S SOCCER STARS JOIN ELITE CEREAL THRILLERS

   One man's breakfast of champions is another's breakfast of
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Making it onto the front of the Wheaties box is as much a part
of media-age folklore as adorning the cover of Time, being chatted
up by Barbara Walters, or, for that matter, showing up at the post
office on an FBI most-wanted poster.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, General Mills announced that five members of the 1999
US women's soccer team will each be appearing on special-edition
boxes of the breakfast cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Akers, Brandi Chastain, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, and
Briana Scurry join a select company of athletes who since 1958 have
found their faces on the famous orange box.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to regional editions and such promotional gambits as
``Search for Champions'' boxes, some of the Wheaties elect aren't
exactly household names. Still, just as much as Joe Montana and
Babe Ruth, Peter Gagarin and John Lugbill have a place in what
might be described as the breakfast nook in America's favorite hall
of fame.

TALK ISN'T CHEAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not exactly sticker shock. But Talk isn't so cheap anymore.
Having debuted with a newsstand price of $2.95, Tina Brown's hot
new chronicle of the cultural zeitgeist is shattering the record
for the quickest price hike in publishing history. When the second
issue of Talk magazine hits the stands in mid-September, readers
will have to cough up $3.50. The early buzz on the magazine _
generated largely by Hillary Rodham Clinton's remarks about her
husband's philandering _ convinced Talk to print an additional
300,000 copies and is probably responsible for the price inflation.
Says Talk spokeswoman Hillary Bass: ``We think the marketplace can
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For an operation that's been criticized for bureaucratic inertia
_ and been the subject of incessant rumors that it is looking to
unload its 105 local newspapers _ Fidelity's Community Newspaper
Company is about to unveil a dramatic move. Starting the first week
in October, all of the group's 76 tabloid publications will be
transformed into broadsheets, including the 20-year-old chain of
Tab newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea _ which has been test marketed to numerous focus groups
_ is ``to provide a better package for the readers and
advertisers,'' says the company's editor and vice chairwoman Mary
Jo Meisner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Readers responded very favorably to the broadsheet prototypes
we've established,'' adds president Kirk Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Community Newspaper Company executives point out that they are
not trying to change the character of their local publications. But
they do say the broadsheet format will allow for better design,
organization, graphics, and sectioning. And the new unified format
will allow for more standardized and improved ad placement and ``be
much easier to sell to advertisers,'' says Davis. In addition, the
broadsheets will each contain a separate ``Community Classified''
section. (Skeptics could wonder whether this might make it easier
to sell the Community Newspaper Company empire in a single package
since a buyer would no longer be getting a hodgepodge of formats
and the accompanying corporate identity and advertising problems.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the trickiest transformation will involve the 16 weekly
Tab newspapers. Given that the chain originally derived its name
from its tabloid format, will the new full-sized papers now be
called the ``Broads?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of joked about that,'' says Meisner. But given that
focus groups revealed that readers considered the Tab a newspaper
``brand'' rather than shorthand terminology for its size, no name
change is planned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You might imagine that a newspaper that has redivided its
newsroom into journalistic teams called ``neighborhoods'' would
literally chase its reporters into the neighborhoods. Beginning
this week, reporters at The Orange County (Calif.) Register are
being handed their Toshiba laptop computers and told to take it to
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a Register effort to base its reporting resources
in the community and provide the technology to routinely produce
stories from there. The laptops ``are meant to allow people to move
into the community,'' says executive editor Ken Brusic. When asked
if this plan will eventually render the newsroom obsolete, Brusic
says, ``I don't know . . . we're planning for people to have work
stations. But the idea is once you're on the network . . . you can
do all the things you normally could do at what you think of as
your work station.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispersing of reporters outside the office is beginning with
business staffers, a department that ``has a history of being
guinea pigs'' at the paper, Brusic says. ``I saw a couple of them
last night carrying their little laptops with them. They were a
little confused.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Go Net, young man. That's the advice for journalism students in
the wake of the University of Georgia's Annual Survey of Journalism
and Mass Communications Graduates. The study of about 2,400
students found that the median salary for bachelor degree
recipients who took jobs in Web publishing was $30,000 _ $6,000
higher than the median salary for all journalism and communication
school graduates. (This less than overwhelming remuneration may
explain why only 20 percent of the graduates expected to stay in
the information business.)
</P>
<P>
   According to survey director, professor Lee Becker, nearly 60
percent of J-schools now provide specific courses in on-line
journalism. ``Students come into the classes pretty much demanding
some (on-line) awareness,'' he adds. ``And I think the salary tells
you why.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In her first published piece since she resigned from The Boston
Globe after fabricating characters and quotes in her column,
Patricia Smith expounds on that bitter experience and her
subsequent battle for redemption in the September issue of Essence
Magazine. Typical of Smith's work, ``Journey Back From Shame'' is a
powerful story certain to provoke responses ranging from outrage to
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   In tone, the article is eerily familiar to the farewell column
she penned to Globe readers in June 1998. It begins with
confession. (``I'd created them (the false characters), lied about
their lives . . . Of course, I had to be fired.'') And it moves
into anger. (``For the time, it seemed the world was obsessed with
me, addicted to the mechanics of my destruction. No one would just
let me go and be gone.'')

THERE'S JUST NO ACCOUNTING FOR BRUINS' DELAY ON DAFOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There is a huge difference between a cheap date and a
stingy one. Cheap Date: You're being treated to an all-you-can-eat,
$3.95 buffet dinner. Stingy Date: You might actually make it to an
upscale restaurant, but your date will constantly remind you of the
hard work it took to afford a night out like this.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave the Bruins?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not cheap,'' Harry Sinden says, ``we're responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that depends on whom we're discussing. The Bruins were
certainly not being cheap this week when they elected to cut Dmitri
Khristich instead of paying him $2.8 million. ``Players always say
it's not about the money,'' Sinden, the team's president, said.
``Do I get the chance to say that now about this case? It was the
principle of the thing. We didn't think he was worth the money
($1.95 million) he made last year.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, we'll give him that. Khristich may have been the
team's top goal scorer, but he was soft in the playoffs. He played
timidly in the corners, as if he expected to see a mouse once he
got to them. I don't think Khristich will come back to haunt the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder if the Bruins are trying to save a few dimes by not
picking up the phone and making a local call. It's been a month
since they last talked contract with Byron Dafoe. They said what
all dates say _ ``I'll call you'' _ and didn't follow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent talked to them on July 16,'' Dafoe said. ``We haven't
heard from them since. I'm waiting to hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   If you care about the Bruins, the month-long silence between the
team and its top goaltender should make you nervous. Training camp
begins in two weeks. Dafoe is a restricted free agent without a
contract. Sinden was asked if he expects any problems in his
negotiations with Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said Wednesday. ``His demands and our proposal are
far apart. Usually that spells trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the cheap/stingy line becomes blurry. Dafoe won 32
games last season and had a goals-against average of 1.99. He says
he has no desire to be paid as well as Dominik Hasek, who bounced
pucks off his head last season as if he were Briana Scurry on ice.
The Bruins want to pay Dafoe about $3 million a year for three
seasons. Dafoe wants somewhere around $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm being fair,'' Dafoe said. ``I'm not comparing
myself to the top guys in the league, like Hasek and (Curtis)
Joseph. I don't want $6 million a year. I'm restricted, so I
realize that this isn't going to be my big payday. That will come
when I'm unrestricted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he hasn't thought of leaving Boston. He is one of the
most productive and popular athletes in town. But, he was asked, is
his employer cheap?
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has a reputation among other players,'' he said. ``Guys
talk about it. But there is also a history of competitive and
winning teams here.'' He paused and said, ``Was that a politically
correct answer?''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Bruins have good reason to be so obsessive
about their budget. The NHL recently signed the richest television
contract in the history of the league. The Bruins' share, about $4
million, is only enough to cover the contract of Dafoe. Sinden
calls the NHL ``a gate-receipt league,'' which partially explains
why the team's least-expensive ticket is $20 and its priciest is
$77.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any TV income,'' Sinden said. ``That's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But if team owner Jeremy Jacobs and Sinden truly want to win the
Cup, they are going to have to make a sacrifice. They have made
money for years with the Bruins. Now they are going to have to give
some back. They are going to have to lose a little if they want to
win. If that means paying Dafoe $500,000-$800,000 more than they
want to, they'll have to do it. The alternative is a holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Think of how the Kyle McLaren and Anson Carter holdouts affected
the team last season. The Bruins began the season with a 4-6-2
record; they ended with a 8-3-2 flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure makes life easier when we're all there at the start of
camp,'' Dafoe said.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Bruins aren't exactly cheap. Ray Bourque is one of the
highest-paid defensemen in the league. And Joe Thornton and Sergei
Samsonov were given fair rookie contracts in 1997. Are the Bruins
stingy? Yes. Sinden is not ashamed to tell you how difficult it is
to make money in the NHL, the same league in which the Colorado
Avalanche nearly went bankrupt in their pursuit of the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough position,'' Sinden said. ``You're trying to
manage a team and make a business out of it. We want to win, but we
don't want to lose (money).''
</P>
<P>
   That position will have to change soon. If it doesn't change
this offseason with Dafoe, it will change when Thornton and
Samsonov go to the restricted free agency land where Dafoe now
waits. You can present the NHL version of your Stop &AMP; Shop card,
save a few dollars, and make it to the playoffs. But you can't do
that and win a Cup. And you can't win a Cup without a good
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here,'' Dafoe said, ``but my phone hasn't been
ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an obvious compromise to all of this. The Bruins can
call Dafoe _ collect _ and announce that they are going to give him
the contract he deserves.

DESIGNING THE VACATION GARDEN, TASTING TOMATOES, SAVING TREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The garden dreams of May have become the happy or sad realities
of August. Each year is different, and each individual plant has
either a year of exuberant extravagance or a year of shame and
sadness. It all depends on the weather and how a garden is
designed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vacation home gardens &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People with second homes like to fuss with their vacation
gardens. It's always amazing how city folks, even apartment
dwellers, come alive as gardeners when they go to their familiar
summer spot.
</P>
<P>
   However, this back-to-nature mentality shouldn't become just
another chore. Vacation home gardens need to be carefully planned
for low maintenance and to flower during the months one is likely
to be in residence. And the plants should survive neglect because
you're not always there to baby them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most perennials are very high maintenance and are
finished blooming by mid-July or don't really start until late
August. Summer folks want plants that bloom during summer.
</P>
<P>
   To find those that survive neglect, look for ones that return
each year, then divide them and spread them around. Some good
candidates are hosta, especially H. grandiflora, which has fragrant
white blooms during August. Old-fashioned phlox is another
candidate, which will self-seed if you leave things a little messy
underneath. Oenothera, also called sundrops, is a tough July
blooming survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Late-blooming day lilies as well as the really tough
old-fashioned orange one (that blooms in July) will fill big spaces
with flowers and foliage. When flowering becomes sparse, the
foliage is useful as a ground cover. Or to get more blooms, dig up
the bed, divide them, fertilize the soil, and replant (in August).
It's a lot of work, so you may mean to do it but not actually get
around to it. A shortcut is to apply some liquid fertilizer and
hope they'll flower more.
</P>
<P>
   Ferns give that rustic look we all think of when, in our mind's
eye, we picture Cape Cod, Maine, or the islands. Hay-scented fern,
which grows in sun or shade, may be planted along the foundation or
lining paths. Easily divided, it's a tough survivor once
established.
</P>
<P>
   Summer-flowering bushes are useful, too, particularly hydrangea
and althea (also called rose of Sharon). Old-fashioned varieties of
althea can make a nice tall, unpruned summer hedge between two
properties or to screen a bad view.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent plantings such as these will provide a basic
landscape. Then, when you arrive for the season, buy some annuals
already grown to a good size by the nursery. Maybe throw in some
tomatoes. If the annuals die, just buy a few more.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply must have roses by the sea, pick vigorous ones
like `Bonica,' `Betty Prior,' `The Fairy,' `Carefree Beauty,' and
tall-growing `New Dawn.' They need sun, fertilizer, and some
pruning. Next spring, replace those that don't survive.
</P>
<P>
   In summer the living should be easy and laid back. One doesn't
need another house with a compulsive maintenance schedule.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
Threatened trees &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of the severe drought, plus the coming hurricane season,
it's worth giving some thought to tree preservation. First and
easiest, give the roots a good, deep soaking, and I do mean good
and deep. If you have no town water restrictions, put the hose on a
good drip and let it soak into the root system overnight. One good
August watering will really help tree health and long-term
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service is predicting several severe storms
this season. A full head of thick leaves acts like a sail and
catches the wind, which can break branches or blow over the tree.
However, if strong winds can blow through the leaves, the tree is
less likely to be toppled.
</P>
<P>
   Call an arborist to check your trees and to ``open the crown''
for safety. This means some of the branches will be removed so you
can see through (and the wind can blow through). Tree pruning is
expensive, so if you can only afford to do a few you may need to
prioritize. Choose your favorite specimen trees and those that
might fall on your house. &QL;

RECONSIDER A PATIO INSTEAD OF A DECK FOR OUTDOOR LIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The patio, a paved, ground-level place for outdoor living, has
yielded to the raised wooden deck as the playpen and dining room of
backyard America.
</P>
<P>
   Decks are cleaner and neater, and being at floor level of the
house, more convenient than a patio. At least that is the claim of
the deck people.
</P>
<P>
   But decks are not the be-all and end-all for backyard living,
say the patio people. Decks get dirty; they might splinter and
sometimes decay; and with all the fancy treatments that don't last
more than a year or so, their claim to low maintenance is
ridiculous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No maintenance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, reconsider the patio. It may be on ground level and a bit
inconvenient to get to, but once it is in, it needs no maintenance,
except an occasional sweeping or hosing off of leaves and yard
detritus. There is no need to seal it, paint it, stain it, or
fiddle with it in any other way. Oh, it might get dirty, but it can
be pressure-washed when you feel like it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, what shall we pave the patio with?
</P>
<P>
   Popular for patios is any kind of paving material set in sand or
stone dust: flagstone and slate are nice but difficult to set
because their shapes are irregular, creating wide joints.
</P>
<P>
   Patio blocks of concrete in various shapes and sizes are easy to
lay in sand but quite ordinary, and their large size makes them
unstable in sand.
</P>
<P>
   A good cover is paving stones, blocks of cut granite usually
rescued from very old city streets. They are excellent, but
expensive, and they look old. Also, there are concrete pavers, not
made of regular concrete that doesn't last very long, but of
pressurized concrete, making them last as long as a hard brick.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete pavers of the hard type are shaped like bricks and
tiles. There are many colors and styles to choose from, all easily
set in sand or stone dust. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Try for hard brick &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That leaves bricks as the pavement of choice. If you opt for
brick, make sure it is a hard brick. Avoid the ``antique,''
salmon-colroed bricks, usually from old houses. They will
deteriorate in months.
</P>
<P>
   The pavement of choice is brick, give or take an opinion or two,
and the brick of choice is City Hall Pavers, a very hard, molded
brick that is not quite even in shape. At about 50 cents each, they
are more expensive than other hard bricks because they are molded
in the old-fashioned way, a technique that increases their cost.
Less costly hard bricks are cut.
</P>
<P>
   They could last forever, or maybe 100, or 1,000 years. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Good for do-it-yourselfers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A good thing about bricks and other small pavers is that they
are not only relatively inexpensive, but also can be installed,
single-handedly, by even the greenest handyman.
</P>
<P>
   All he needs is sand, lots and lots of bricks (there are five
standard-sized bricks to the square foot), a tamper, a
rubber-headed mallet for tamping bricks, a string, a straight edge,
a level (a four-footer is better and more accurate than a
two-footer), and brick chisels for cutting brick.
</P>
<P>
   And, a lot of time and energy. Building a patio of brick is hard
work, but the rewards are worth all that sweat equity.
</P>
<P>
   It takes five bricks for each square foot. To figure how many
bricks you need, determine the area of the patio, say 20 by 20
feet, or 400 square feet, and multiply 5 by 400 to get 2,000
bricks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A simple underlayment &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crushed stone and sand for the patio base is sold by the scoop
or by the cubic yard.
</P>
<P>
   How much base material you need depends on how deep you make it.
Instead of trying to figure out exactly how much you need, order a
scoop or two. If you run out, you can always order more.
</P>
<P>
   Stone dust, by the way, can be substituted for sand. It is an
excellent base because it packs down readily. One problem is that
it is difficult to sweep into a tight joint because it becomes
rather pebbly as it is swept. It is a minor problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're ready to start. Outline the patio area with little
fences of string on stakes. If the area is curved, outline it with
a garden hose. If you want the patio to be flush with the ground,
dig out earth deep enough to accommodate the thickness of the
brick, about 2 inches, and the thickness of the base material, 2 to
6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   There are two recommended bases for a brick patio: 2 inches of
sand or stone dust, or 4 inches of crushed stone topped by 1 or 2
inches of sand or stone dust. The latter is slightly better because
the crushed stone allows for good drainage under the patio;
drainage will keep water from under the brick that would otherwise
freeze in winter and heave the bricks out of position. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Borders needed &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the patio is flush with the ground or not, you will
still need to put in a border of some kind after excavating.
Without a border, bricks will tend to ``walk'' over time,
separating and getting all out of skew.
</P>
<P>
   For a flush patio, use soldier bricks, bricks set lengthwise
into the earth, or 8- by 16-inch concrete patio blocks on their
long edge, or pressure-treated timbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a homeowner will raise his patio to help distinguish
it from the rest of the yard. It also might be to be level over
uneven ground. You might also want to raise a patio to avoid
cutting and digging into tree roots close to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   If you are raising the patio just a few inches, the border must
be deep enough to hold the bricks in place without leaning over
from the pressure of the bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated timbers are a good choice for such a raised
border.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can set in the crushed stone and sand topper, tamp it
thoroughly and smooth it out. Rent a plate tamper, or, simpy walk
over the stone and sand until it is as tamped as it will ever get. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Finally, the laying of the brick &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smooth out the tamped sand and start laying the bricks. The
easiest pattern is a common or running bond, each row of bricks
offsetting its neighbor by a half-lap.
</P>
<P>
   Others are also attractive, as illustrated, but with more
elaborate designs, more cutting is needed.
</P>
<P>
   To cut a brick, score it at the proper place with a cold chisel,
chip the score mark a little deeper with the chisel, then set a
wide chisel on the mark and whack it with a hammer. You will
succeed maybe 90 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Set a brick in a corner, tap it lightly with the rubber mallet
or the handle of a mason's hammer to set it in the sand, making
sure its top is level with the border. Set the bricks so they are
touching each other, creating a minimal joint.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to line up bricks with a border, but when you get into
the interior, you have to line them up with each other. It is easy
to go astray.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent uneven bricks, stretch a taut string along the length
of the patio from border to border, at the level of the tops of the
bricks.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a good guide, but be careful that you don't raise
the string as you place the brick. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Straight edge to the rescue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A straight edge will help keep bricks even with each other.
</P>
<P>
   If the patio is next to the house, you must slope it so water
will drain away from the house. While water will soak through the
brick joints, the sloping patio will handle a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   So, put a straight edge on the bricks as you continue to set
them. And, put the edge at right angles to the brick rows.
</P>
<P>
   If you see a gap in the middle of the straight edge, the bricks
are too low in that area. Take them up, add a little stand, and
relay them. If the straight edge rocks on the bricks, the middle
bricks are too high; take them up, take a bit of the sand away,
resmooth the sand, and relay the bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sweep dry sand into the joints between the bricks. Wet down
the patio with a fine spray from the hose. After a day or so, sweep
in more sand. Eventually there will be enough sand to fill the
joints and stabilize the bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, enjoy that tall, cool drink on your new patio.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR UNVEILS PLAN TO OVERHAUL MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis, proposing an overhaul of
managed health care in the waning days of the state legislative
session, is calling for a new system that includes second opinions
from doctors, a state agency to review disputed medical decisions
and the right to sue if something goes seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But with just three weeks left in the session, dozens of
questions remain unanswered by the governor's office, such as how
much the system would cost taxpayers and managed care providers,
and whether health plans would be forced to pay for medical
treatments that currently are not covered.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, met privately with angry Democratic lawmakers
on Tuesday to make peace over his recent comment that their job was
to ``implement my vision.'' At the same time, however, he was
unveiling a rough draft of his vision for changes.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday was important because it gives
lawmakers and the public their first glimpse from Davis about what
he wants in the way of overhauling managed care. Armed with polls
showing little public support for major changes, the governor only
recently got around to making the issue a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats were elated at the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this plan is ambitious and bold, and consumers are big
winners,'' said state Sen. Jackie Speier of Daly City.
</P>
<P>
   Davis administration officials said the plan was not the final
word on managed care. His staff has been meeting with consumer
groups, lawyers, lawmakers and representatives of the managed care
industry, which recently gave the governor more than $100,000 at a
political fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, as outlined Wednesday, would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a new state review process if someone is denied
treatment by a managed care provider, known in the industry as
health maintenance organizations, or HMOs. The service would be
free, and managed care providers would be subject to $5,000-per-day
penalties for non-compliance with the panel's ultimate order for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Managed care providers would be required to tell patients
within five days if they are denied coverage for something. There
are no time limits now. If coverage is denied, the state review
panel would be required to make a decision in 30 days or less.
Emergency medical cases would be expedited.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a new consumer advocate to represent the 17 million
Californians under managed health care. A new department would be
created with added enforcement powers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow patients the right to a second opinion and the right to
sue providers for harm caused by ``denying, delaying or modifying''
a doctor's recommendation. Patients, however, could sue only if
there were also ``substantial physical harm, such as death, loss of
limb or bodily functions.''
</P>
<P>
   This section is certain to cause the most problems in all
segments of the health care debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan looks like it was drafted behind closed doors with
HMO executives and no patients, doctors or nurses present,''
consumer lobbyist Jaime Court said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of Health
Plans, said he was concerned about this section but noted
restrictions would be placed on who got to sue and when.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis administration said this section was balanced between
the two forces.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kennedy, the governor's cabinet secretary, said ``the
concept is to have a high threshold of harm (before someone can
sue). The purpose is to get treatment. ... We just don't think
litigation is the answer to our health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   With little time left in the session, which must end Sept. 10,
Senate President pro tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said it
might be too late to figure out what Davis really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he might just send the governor reforms that
Democrats had been working on for years, and see what he would do
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Those may include items Davis has not yet asked for, such as
requiring managed care providers to pay for mental health drugs,
diabetes medicine and contraceptives. Davis' staff said such
mandates remained under discussion and that the entire reform
package was a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who has represented Davis in health care discussions
with lawmakers, said the governor and his staff had not yet taken a
position on mandates. She said that mandatory coverage of
contraceptives, for example, appeared to be a ``no-brainer'' but
the administration wanted to be careful before mandating any
coverage.

THE BEST ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many, many times over the years I've received letters, phone
calls, e-mails recounting the $250 Nieman Marcus/Mrs.
Fields/Marshall Fields cookie recipe story. Each person has told
the story with fresh enthusiasm, and each has suggested that it
would be a good subject for a column.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good story, so good it falls under the heading ``Too
Good To Be True,'' which is the title of Jan Harold Brunvand's most
recent book, subtitled ``The Colossal Book of Urban Legends''
(Norton, $29.95). Brunvand, professor emeritus at the University Of
Utah, has spent years collecting and writing about these tales, and
attempting to track them to their sources. Some have ancient roots,
back to the Middle Ages and perhaps even beyond. Others are as new
as ``The Blair Witch Project.'' But they all have one thing in
common, they're too good to be true, and thus irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The cookie story has varied slightly in the telling, but the
most popular version has a shopper enthusing about a special cookie
served at the Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas. She asks for the recipe
and is told that it costs ``two-fifty.'' Some time later her credit
card statement arrives, and she finds she has been charged $250.
</P>
<P>
   This story, cookie recipe appended, has been widely circulated
for years via chain letter and more recently on the Internet. It
refuses to die, no matter how many times it's debunked, because
it's a good story, and the recipe, while perhaps not worth $250, is
a winner. You can't keep a good urban legend down. Any minute now I
expect to hear from someone who'll say, ``But it really happened,
to a friend of a friend of my mother's . . .'' (The ``friend of a
friend,'' FOAF to folklore scholars, plays a crucial role in the
spread of urban legends.)
</P>
<P>
   Brunvand traced the cookie story back to prototypes in the
1940s, when it featured expensive recipes for candy, fudge, ice
cream, or cake. He thinks its longevity is rooted in our mistrust
of big business, a mistrust that has fueled the spread of other
familiar urban legends about fast-food fried rodents and
worm-burgers and satanic symbols in company logos.
</P>
<P>
   Urban legends are woven into popular culture. They turn up on
television, in movies, fiction, songs, comics, supermarket
tabloids, newspapers. The Internet has speeded their progress and
broadened their range. According to Brunvand, the stories have also
been a source of fascination, and material, for writers such as
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carson McCullers, John Steinbeck, Truman
Capote, and Toni Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 200 urban legends in ``Too Good To Be
True'' are so familiar that just a few words suffice to evoke the
entire story. ``The Killer in the Back Seat.'' ``The Choking
Doberman.'' ``Alligators in the Sewers.'' ``The Kidney Heist.''
``Spiders in the Hairdo.'' These, and so many others, are
appealingly weird, which accounts in part for their appeal. They're
also neatly plotted, too neatly plotted, Brunvand observes. That
concision is one of the earmarks of an urban legend.
</P>
<P>
   If a story seems too good to be true, probably it's exactly
that. But there are exceptions, as Brunvand notes. ``The Baby on
the Roof'' is one. A parent leaves a baby in a car seat on the car
roof and drives away. The baby flies off the car, but is uninjured.
This is no legend, unfortunately. Most of us have seen it in the
news at least once. ``The Pregnant Shoplifter'' is in the same
category. In 1985, the Washington Post reported that an employee in
an Arlington, Va., sporting goods store forced a pregnant woman to
prove she wasn't shoplifting a basketball. She sued the store for
punitive damages. She lost. That's how you can tell it's not an
urban legend. If it were, she would have won.

DEALING WITH MOSS ON THE ROOF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I had to scrape moss from the asphalt-shingle roof of my
summer place in New Hampshire. It was 1/4-inch thick and came off
easily enough, but I am afraid I'll damage the shingles. Is there
an easier way to take it off, and keep it off?
</P>
<P>
   BARRY SIMPSON, Warren, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. You did the right thing in scraping the moss off, because it
is relatively easy to get off. You might also sweep it off with a
large push broom. After you remove it, treat the area with a
solution of 1 part household bleach and 3 parts water. This will
kill any residual roots or moss, but it won't do much in keeping it
from coming back, sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   However, while looking desperately in catalogs for an item he
did not find, the handyman came across this product: Moss and
Mildew Killer in the Improvements catalog. The blurb says it will
not harm plants, so it is probably not bleach, and inhibits growth
for a year. Anyway, it is item 174129, $12.99 for 1 1/2 pounds of
powder concentrate that treats up to 1,500 square feet. It may be
worth a call, 800-642-2112.
</P>
<P>
   While the Improvements catalog carries interesting and useful
things (if they work), one still has to approach such catalogs with
a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that will inhibit the growth of moss, as well as
mildew and algae, is a zinc strip called Shingle Shield, sold in
hardware and lumber stores and home centers. It is a strip of zinc
that is tucked under the shingles of a roof, near the ridge,
leaving a few inches of the zinc exposed. Rainwater washes over the
zinc, distributing traces over the entire roof and deterring the
growth of any fungus or green plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find Shingle Shield, call the maker, Chicago
Metallic, at 800-638-5192. Another brand is Z-Stop, by WESPAC of
Seattle, Wash., 206-244-4013.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My pressure-treated deck was painted, and I would like to
stain it. How can I get the old paint off? How can I treat the ends
of the boards, where it is difficult to get off any paint?
</P>
<P>
   CARL DETTMAN, West Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Chemical paint remover will do it fast and safely. You could
use regular remover such as Stripeeze or 5F5. Or, a milder one that
may take more work to remove the paint: Citristrip.
</P>
<P>
   Also safe, if you do not char the wood, is a hot-air gun. But
since such a gun fires a stream of air heated to between 700 and
1,000 degrees, and wood burns at about 500 degrees, you want to be
extremely careful to guard against fire and also against charring
of the wood, because burning pressure-treated wood is the fastest
way to release arsenic, one of the chemicals used in the treatment.
The nice thing about a hot-air gun is that when you scrape off the
softened paint and remove the heat, the scrapings will cool off
quickly and turn crispy, so they can easily be swept up.
</P>
<P>
   Or, sand the paint off. The anti-pressure-treated wood people
will scream at this suggestion, because the sanding dust contains
arsenic. Yes, it does, but if you wear a mask and sweep up the dust
and dispose of it carefully, there will be no harm done. Besides,
there is very little arsenic in the sanding dust.
</P>
<P>
   As for the board ends, leave them painted and let the paint wear
off; or sand to remove the paint. I am not convinced the extra
effort is worth it. And you could paint them to match the stain you
will use and forget about removing the paint. Whatever stain you
plan to use, be sure it is a semitransparent house stain, which
will not peel and will last for three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The grand discussion of the pros and cons of asbestos-cement
siding continues, after initial remarks in the Globe Handyman's
column of July 29. In it, the handyman said there are very few pros
about asbestos siding. In fact, he felt, none.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gutierrez of Arlington, Mass. called to give us two pros:
1. It holds paint wonderfully and for a long time, longer than
paint lasts on wood. 2. It is fire resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Good point. Paint will stick well to asbestos-cement, because it
is mostly cement (concrete). But it will stick equally well to
mineral siding that does not contain asbestos. But this
stick-to-it-iveness works only if the paint job is right;
basically, thin coats of a latex housepaint are required. The
handyman has seen too many asbestos-cement houses with woefully
peeling paint not to feel strongly about this.
</P>
<P>
   As for being fire resistant, that may be more a con than a pro.
After all, most siding materials are not fire resistant, and while
the United States has a lot of fires, wood structures have stood
the test of time; when they do burn, in the vast majority of cases
firefighters have come through to save houses and lives.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the handyman feels such siding is a liability: Most
fire-resistant materials on houses today are asbestos-cement siding
and aluminum siding. Aluminum siding helps make the house more
airtight, and a fire could gut the inside of such a house much
faster than in a wood-sided house, because the fire is contained in
the house, unable to be vented outdoors. The same goes with
asbestos-cement siding.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alex van Es, a systems analyst in the town of
Apeldoorn in the Netherlands, has linked his doorbell,
refrigerator, toilet, alarm clock, and six cameras in his house to
the Internet. The whole world can keep track of him. Visitors to
his Web site can even pick the music that will wake him in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog for ``The Un-Private House,'' Museum of Modern
Art curator Terence Riley, who organized the show, offers Van Es as
example of a brave new attitude toward the home. Once a sanctuary,
it is now permeable. Furthermore, both the MoMA exhibition and its
catalog propose this as a good thing. Is Van Es's lifestyle Big
Brotherish? Riley responds that ``in a world of isolation, having
someone watching can be reassuring . . . the interactive gaze of
the media has now come to represent a comforting presence as much
as an intrusive surveillance.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll get to the part about bathrooms anon, but first, the facts.
``The Un-Private House'' documents, through models, photographs,
diagrams, floor plans, and videos, 26 houses all over the world,
all designed in the last decade. Some are undulating curves, inside
and out; others are strictly rectilinear. All are radical not just
in materials and technology, but in rethinking the way we live.
Amazingly, 16 of these extreme schemes have already been built,
while four are under way. Six remain unbuilt, including the ``Slow
House'' Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio designed for a Long
Island site with a water view. The cornucopia-shaped structure ``is
conceived as an apparatus for producing a view,'' the architects
write. ``The house is a door that leads to a window, physical entry
to optical departure.'' In front of that window, though, and partly
blocking it, the architects would put a video monitor playing the
same view you'd already be looking at _ two ways of framing the
seascape. (Yes, there are bedrooms tucked in there somewhere, but
they're not the point.)
</P>
<P>
   On my two weekday visits to ``The Un-Private House,'' the place
was packed, and primarily with young people. The installation is
tongue-in-cheek homey, with a bed, sofas, and other domestic
furniture. The centerpiece of the show is a huge round table with
eight ``place settings.'' You pick a coaster from a Lazy Susan in
the center and put it down at your place, and an interactive
``place mat'' about a house appears for you to play with. The
table, and the show's woozy, projected ``Welcome Mat'' that warps
toward any presence it senses _ including yours _ are
collaborations with the MIT Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   However whimsical the presentation, the show is a serious
reflection on a moment when a quarter of American households
consist of one person, and half the families in the country are
couples without children under the same roof. These demographics
alter the notion of and need for ``privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a relatively recent concept anyway. Through the
Renaissance, even the wealthy inhabited medieval-style communal
halls, where everybody did just about everything, including giving
birth, in view of everybody else. After the 17th century, when
European merchants became wealthy enough to extricate their
businesses from their homes, those homes became havens. In crowded
towns, the row house became the norm, with a common wall separating
the units. Contemporary architects Bjarne Mastenbroek and MVRDV
deliberately skewed the common wall between the two units of their
``Double House'' in Utrecht, the Netherlands, creating a zigzag
shape that encourages neighbors to be aware of each other's
presence on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, Frank Lloyd Wright designed an idealized ``Home in a
Prairie Town'' for Ladies' Home Journal. Set back from the street,
with a recessed entrance, it was a virtual fortress. Privacy was
political and even patriotic for Wright. ``America,'' he wrote,
``places a life premium on individuality. . . . It means lives
lived in greater independence and seclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, the glass house Mies van der Rohe designed
for Edith Farnsworth in Plano, Ill., caused an uproar for its
perceived lack of privacy. But the Farnsworth house was meant for
solo occupation, and it was set in sizable grounds, a buffer from
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent several nights alone in a glass house, while on
safari in Africa. It was a fabulously liberating feeling, dancing
around naked, showering in a glass cylinder, with only the wart
hogs to watch. Had the house not been secluded and out of sight of
other tourists, though, the experience could have been embarrassing
rather than exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   The MoMA show attempts to vindicate the glass house and push it
even further, by presenting examples built, or being built, in
crowded urban settings. One is Michael Bell's ``Glass House (at) 2
degrees'' in Houston. The glass house has been associated with
sophistication, even wealth, but Bell's project is low-income,
federally funded housing. He uses standard-size sliding glass doors
to control costs, and rationalizes the increased visibility of the
inhabitants by asking, ``Why should an invisible group of people
choose to live behind walls rather than reveal their lives?''
</P>
<P>
   Only the homeless are more exposed than the occupants of Shigeru
Ban's ``Curtain Wall House'' in Tokyo can be. The house angles into
a street like the prow of a ship; its exterior walls are billowing
white curtains that suggest both sails and a variation on the
traditional shoji screen. When the curtains and sliding glass
panels behind them are opened, the inhabitants live their lives in
public. When the curtains are closed, the windowless house is
mysterious; it looks like a Christo ``wrap.'' At night, it glows
from within.

 NEW YORK: ... from within.

<P>
   Another Tokyo design, Kazuyo Sejima's and Ryue Nishizawa's ``M
House,'' is more concerned with privacy. Four double-height
interior light wells bring natural light to the underground level
of the house. The only window facing the street is translucent
polycarbonate covered in perforated metal, which lets in light but
deflects prying eyes. The ``M House'' is one of several in the show
that dive underground, acknowledging that we're running out of room
up above. It's quiet and naturally cool down there, and natural
illumination can be provided by digging light wells. In Joel
Sanders's unbuilt ``House for a Bachelor'' in Minneapolis, an
excavated, subterranean, and hence private backyard becomes an
Astroturf-lined exercise area that flows into the master bath,
creating a spa for one.
</P>
<P>
   The most radical of all the plans in the show is the conceptual
``Digital House'' that Gisue and Mojgan Hariri designed for House
Beautiful magazine. It would consist of a central core and plug-in
rooms, factory-delivered, that could be switched as easily as
appliances. Walls would be made of liquid crystal displays capable
of collapsing time and space. ``In the kitchen,'' Riley writes, ``a
virtual chef from a favorite restaurant could aid in the
preparation of meals, and the residents could entertain friends who
live thousands of miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend that separated workplace from home has now reversed,
thanks to computers, and several ``Un-Private'' houses reflect
that. The downtown Manhattan apartment that Frank Lupo and Daniel
Rowen designed for two currency traders on Wall Street has six
strategically placed video monitors _ including one in the bathroom
_ so the couple can keep track of world markets 24 hours a day,
from various vantage points in their open-plan home. The result,
Riley writes, ``is not some sort of mercantile bedlam breaking out
in the living room but the silent flicker of an aestheticized flow
of information.'' ``Aestheticized'' is a key word here. In these
houses, video monitors and computer screens aren't camouflaged in
armoires; they're flaunted as prime parts of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Video-as-art drove Jacques Herzog's and Pierre de Meuron's
design for the ``Kramlich Residence and Media Collection,'' being
built in the Napa Valley. The owners collect in the new world of
electronic art, and their house/gallery will accommodate Gary
Hill's 47-foot video panorama ``Viewer'' and other huge works, some
in a vast underground gallery animated by moving images. Upstairs,
eccentrically curved glass walls will also serve as screens for
video installations, making the place into a veritable museum.
</P>
<P>
   A museum-like feature in some other ``Un-Private'' houses is the
portable wall, standard equipment now in galleries, where it allows
a reconfiguration of space for each show. In a Manhattan loft that
Thomas Hanrahan and Victoria Meyers designed for a single
professional man, full-height painted panels can float
independently in space or come together to form one or two
completely closed-off guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The show offers other ingenious solutions to design problems.
One apartment has a partition wall whose center pivots to a
horizontal position, becoming a dining table. Simon Ungers and
Thomas Kinslow solved the storage problem of a writer with 10,000
books with the ``T-House.'' On top of, and perpendicular to, a
long, horizontal residence partly burrowed into the earth, they
built a double-height library. The upper level, shelf storage, has
no windows, in order to protect the books. The lower-level reading
room is filled with light. The monolithic design is pleasing. But
aren't books supposed to be replaced by computer screens soon? Will
that render the library obsolete?
</P>
<P>
   I personally like to read something I can touch, stroke, even
smell, a real book whose pages I can turn, listening to the
crinkling sound they make. And in the age of electronic
surveillance, I want more privacy, not less, more freedom from the
tyranny of the screen. Where I particularly want privacy, and where
I think all but the most exhibitionist would as well, is in the
bathroom. I think the Japanese got it right, with each bathroom
function given its own roomlet, so two or more people can use the
facilities at the same time. I've noticed an increase in this sort
of divvied-up design in hotel rooms of late, enabling two people to
prepare for the day without waiting for each other.
</P>
<P>
   There is an erotic element to bathing and showering, to watching
a partner through the kind of translucent bathroom wall some of the
``Un-Private'' houses boast. But sometimes a bath is just a bath,
and all you want is to get clean. So I draw the line at the forced
voyeurism of a Manhattan pied-a-terre designed by Sulan Kolatan and
William Mac Donald. The master sleeping and bathing area are a
single, seamless sweep of cast fiberglass, quite beautiful as
sculpture. But the horizontal plateau of the bed is separated from
the dip of the tub only by a sheet of clear glass. Just give me a
solid door that closes, please.
</P>

AN OLD GARDEN'S MODERN CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IPSWICH, Mass. _ The 1655 Whipple House, which is celebrating
its centennial this year as one of the country's first house
museums, has many lessons to teach _ not the least being how
preservationist thinking has changed. In its hundred years of
ownership by the Ipswich Historical Society, the old house has been
greatly loved, and occasionally violated, by an extraordinary
collection of Bay Staters who have become part of its story.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the garden! It's less than 50 years old, yet
its history is just as interesting as that of the 344-year-old
house.
</P>
<P>
   The front garden was the pioneering project of two indomitable
Ipswich residents: Arthur A. Shurcliff, who also designed the
gardens of Colonial Williamsburg, and Isadore Smith, a garden club
lady and the heroine of this tale. Her original research for the
garden, in search of herbs actually grown by Colonial housewives
for cooking and remedies, led her to write several books (under the
pen name Ann Leighton) that have become classics of the flourishing
garden restoration movement.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first people on the scene were the Whipples
themselves. They were all named John. John the Elder, a devout
Puritan, built a half-house with a great chimney in the heart of
fledgling Ipswich around 1655. His son, Captain John, was a
flamboyant businessman and cavalry officer who made money, doubled
the size of the house to six rooms, and turned it into a showpiece,
with vermilion trim, a painted interior, and luxurious imported
furnishings. His son, Major John, completed a saltbox addition of
nine more rooms before the end of the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Then the son-less house went to three generation of Crockers,
through the female side of the family. It also went through a
remodeling in the Georgian style, before being purchased by Abraham
Bond, a stocking weaver from Nottingham, England, in 1841, a time
when Ipswich was shifting from lace-making to hosiery production.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1890s, the Whipple House was in run-down but sturdy
condition, thanks to the durability of its rich building materials,
which included foot-wide chestnut and oak beams. It was serving as
a tenement for immigrant families working in the hosiery mills that
had sprung up around it when Ipswich minister and historian Thomas
Franklin Waters convinced the nine-year-old Ipswich Historical
Society to buy the house from the son of Abraham Bond, James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   The opulent Whipple furnishings were long gone, but the house
was soon filled with antiques from society members. It opened to
the public July 5, 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many people who loved the Whipple House was young
Isadore Leighton Luce, who would look forward to glimpsing it on
train rides between Boston and her native Portsmouth, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Then she went on a world tour. By the time she returned, the
Historical Society had moved the house to its current site, a more
spacious lot that was also near busy Route 1A, where people
traveled by car and, it was hoped, would stop to buy an entrance
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But then Isadore Luce's vacation had been a long one. It was
while she was touring a teak lumber yard in Rangoon, Burma _ one
that still used elephants as live forklifts _ that Luce met British
Colonel A. William Smith. Actually, he was conducting the tour. But
as soon as it was over, he asked her for a date. They were married
in Bombay in 1925, then lived in India and Burma until coming to
the United States in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Smith was a writer who turned out adventure novels and
short stories for popular magazines, mostly about the Raj. One
summer weekend, while Isadore was away visiting her sister, Bill
bought a large house on Essex Marsh on Argilla Road. This was a
colony of a different sort, where Boston bluebloods summered near
Crane's Beach. Bill Smith hadn't had much experience with New
England winters, and his purchase turned out to be a summer house,
completely devoid of insulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Smiths lived there year-round anyway, raising three
children. In 1939, the colonel, who had already served in World War
I, was called up by the British military for World War II. Lonely
Isadore wrote her first book, a novel, during the six years he was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   But just up Argilla Road was delightful company. There Arthur A.
Shurcliff, one of the most influential American landscape
architects of the 20th century, had his summer home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good friends, Mom and Arthur. They got along very
well, though he was awfully old,'' her son Jim Smith recalls. His
own favorite was Mrs. Shurcliff. ``Margaret was a live wire. She
was one of the first suffragettes. My brother and I used to listen
to her stories about marching in Boston and being arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many esthetes of his time, Arthur Shurcliff was fascinated
with the decorative arts of 18th-century America. Until the
centennial of the American Revolution in 1876, Victorians had been
throwing out their antiques and going ``modern.'' But suddenly the
tide turned, and Americans started to make a fetish out of all
things associated with the Colonial era.
</P>
<P>
   Though Shurcliff and his contemporary designers thought they
were creating landscapes and architecture of true Colonial
elegance, their creations were so romanticized that they were in
fact creating something new, something that would much later be
dubbed the Colonial Revival style.
</P>
<P>
   Their ``Colonial reproductions'' were cleaner, more opulent, and
more beautiful than the real Colonial era ever was. Reeking of old
money and ``good'' bloodlines, the Colonial Revival style became
wildly popular with the aspiring middle class, resulting in an
America still dotted today with millions of so-called
Colonial-style homes. When pitted against the perceived demands of
good taste, historical authenticity never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Few things illustrate these priorities better than the
relocation of the Whipple House in 1927 to a more genteel
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move was very controversial. William Sumner Appleton,
founder of the Society for the Preservation of New England
Antiquities and a great friend of the Rev. Waters, attended all the
meetings, saying that this is not what he would have wanted,'' says
James Kyprianos, present-day curator of the Ipswich Historical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a nationwide letter-writing campaign by leading
architects orchestrated by Appleton, the Whipple House was ripped
from its archeological foundations (which now lie under a parking
area). So a town house that had originally been sited sideways on a
small downtown lot now sat like a country squire on 5 acres near
Argilla Road.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it needed landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Shurcliff was drawn to it like a cat to catnip.
</P>
<P>
   An eminent Bostonian with Harvard and MIT credentials, Shurcliff
was prodigious, one of the last great public park builders in the
vigorous Victorian tradition of Frederick Law Olmsted. In fact,
Shurcliff began his career studying under the wizard of the Emerald
Necklace and worked in his firm, an even better credential than
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   During his very busy career, Shurcliff redesigned Boston Common,
the area where Storrow Drive was built, and other Boston parks. He
designed more than 50 private estates, some of which, such as
Castle Hill in Ipswich, have been preserved as elegant open land.
He fashioned town plans for Fort Worth, Texas, and many other
communities across the country, and was the campus planner for many
colleges and schools, including Tufts, Brown, Amherst, Mount
Holyoke, Colgate, Groton, and St. Paul's. He loved antique
re-creations and assisted in the development of Old Sturbridge
Village.

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ In Iran, nothing is what it seems to be.
There are layers upon layers of meaning attached to every word, to
every gesture, to every action.
</P>
<P>
   Take makeup. It is as fraught with political meanings and
intentions as it has ever been. Women use it to signal their
political ideology or to defy authority. I learned this lesson in
July on a visit to Iran, when I found myself caught in the midst of
riots in Teheran.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by my friend Mariam, I had gone to the main bazaar
to purchase a rug. After we finished our shopping, we decided to
have a kebab at an old and established restaurant in the heart of
the bazaar. We had not even touched our food when the restaurant's
owner suddenly snapped off the lights and locked the door. A sense
of horror filled the air. The walls of the restaurant were shaking
as if there were an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vigilantes have come to the bazaar; they're here,''
screamed one woman. Immediately I knew that the self-appointed
morals police, ever so obsessed with the dress code for women, had
attacked the bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   While I sat paralyzed with fear, Mariam was deftly wiping off
her lipstick with a paper napkin. One woman was covering her
painted nails with thick, dark gloves. Another was covering her
colorful head scarf with a black one she pulled out of her handbag.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman next to me was putting on knee-length socks to
hide her impeccably colored toenails, which showed through her
sandals. Another middle-aged woman, with highlighted hair showing
through her scarf, yelled: ``I am sick and tired of all this. We
have to free ourselves or die.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a fight between supporters of the hard-liners
and supporters of the reformers broke out in the men's section of
the segregated restaurant. I felt trapped and terrified. Leaving
the rug behind, we rushed to the door and persuaded the owner to
let us out.
</P>
<P>
   All the shops had closed, turning the beautiful bazaar into a
wicked maze. After what seemed like an eternity, we reached a major
street, hailed a cab and offered the driver an exorbitant fee.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of that summer day, covered head to toe in my
Islamic garb and drenched in sweat and panic, I found the locked,
unair-conditioned cab a safe haven. Once we broke through the
traffic gridlock and the bazaar district receded into the
background, I sighed with relief and looked over my shoulder at
Mariam.
</P>
<P>
   I could not believe my eyes. She was reapplying her lipstick.
Only half an hour ago she had frantically wiped off all traces of
it. The skill and speed with which she had removed her lipstick and
her haste and zeal now in reapplying it were astounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lipstick is not just lipstick in Iran,'' Mariam explained.
``It transmits political messages. It is a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend was right. In the political history of modern Iran,
doubts about modernity, about change, about relations with the West
have always been projected upon a woman's body. In 1936, the shah
forced women to unveil themselves, and this was considered a mark
of progress. In 1983, the Islamic Republic veiled women, and this
signaled the reconstruction of an Islamic-Iranian identity.
</P>
<P>
   Today, women still have to cover themselves, but they have
become a vibrant political force. More and more of them are behind
steering wheels, on motorcycles, in universities, in mosques,
ascending the rungs of government. Their pictures are in newspapers
and on television. Their participation in the artistic and literary
arena is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian women have successfully invaded male territories,
although a dab of lipstick can still land them in jail. Perhaps the
next victory will be ownership of their own bodies.

   What a stupid year this has been for American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic was launched this spring when Minnesota elected
former wrestler and professional bigmouth Jesse Ventura to the
governor's chair _ thus rendering Garrison Keillor impotent as a
satirist.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to chuckle about cute little Lake What's-It's-Name
when the real citizens of the region are being captained by a
chrome-domed trash-talker in a fringe jacket?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more ridiculous than the election of Ventura was
the reaction from the media. Sure, a cartoon character winning a
gubernatorial slot in a big cold empty state made for an
interesting feature story _ but the press acted as if Batman had
been elected president of the free world. I mean, how much power
does the governor of Minnesota wield, even in Minnesota?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the tone was set for '99. Nothing was too silly to
be taken seriously. When Ventura's former adversary, the aging and
frighteningly oily-trunked Hulk Hogan, made noises about running
for president, he garnered an inordinate amount of attention _ as
if the guy could actually wrestle the electoral college majority
away from George W. Bush or an Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another wrestling match has been dominating headlines
for weeks _ make that months. Even though the residents of at least
49 states couldn't care less about the Senate race in New York _
which is still more than a year away _ the Time and Newsweek
magazines and ``Hardballs'' of the world have been breathlessly
covering the Rudy Giuliani-Hillary Clinton matchup as if it were
the ultimate in Wrestlemania excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Both potential candidates have been acting like goofs _ Hillary
with her Yankees cap and her coy interviews and her pompous
``listening tour,'' Giuliani with his grandstanding campaign jaunt
to Arkansas and his acerbic remarks about the first lady. Gosh, New
Yorkers will be lucky to have either of these dignified greats
representing them in Washington, won't they?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the press is dying for this fight to happen. The
talking heads keep telling us that if Giuliani and Clinton do
square off, it'll be the most fascinating political race in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that Kennedy squeaker over Nixon in 1960 didn't contain
any drama or change the course of world events or anything.
</P>
<P>
   If the above follies aren't stupidity enough for one year,
consider that Jerry Springer's name was floated as a potential
candidate for the Senate in Ohio _ until Springer's office issued
an official denial last week.
</P>
<P>
   Could I be dreaming, or did I actually hear Springer say: ``Of
course I won't be running. I've spent the better part of this
decade overseeing the worst carnival freak show this country has
ever known, and I'm too ashamed of myself to take a walk in public,
let alone run for office. What's wrong with you people!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe imagining things. Just kidding. What Springer
actually said was that it was ``impractical if not impossible for
me to make a run for the Senate at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't count me out in the future, America.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Springer was issuing his denial, the media was
working itself into a lather over the possibility of Warren Beatty
running for president _ perhaps the stupidest of all the stupid
stories of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I love Warren Beatty's work as a Hollywood hyphenate. When
not seducing just about anyone worth seducing in the 213 and 310
area codes, he has produced an incredibly versatile and compelling
body of work, from ``Shampoo'' to ``Heaven Can Wait'' to ``Reds''
and ``Bulworth.'' But have you seen this man try to communicate
without a script? He's about as articulate as a bag of potato
chips. This guy couldn't win a debate with a mime.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty reportedly won't make a final decision until next month.
If he does decide to throw his charm into the ring, it'll be
interesting to see how he responds to the ``Have you ever used
cocaine?'' question the New York Daily News has thrown at all the
candidates. (George W. Bush refused to answer. Everyone else has
replied in the negative.) One imagines the elliptical Beatty
replying, ``For what purpose?''
</P>
<P>
   Topping off all this nonsense: the always-irrelevant Iowa straw
poll, a non-binding popularity contest in which candidates can
legally wine and dine their supporters and then either embrace the
poll as proof of their momentum or dismiss it as a fund-raising
gimmick, depending on how they finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa straw poll is like a strip club _ whoever spends the
most money gets the most attention from the regulars. But it's also
like a strip club in that you'd have to be a fool to interpret that
affection as genuine.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to believe we've had our fill of stupid political
stories for 1999 _ but we're only two-thirds of the way through the
year, and Matt Drudge, your favorite mainstream-media basher, is
reporting that another famous politician might have been caught on
tape cooing to his mistress.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make one long for the days of Ford vs.
Carter, when the biggest question was who was more boring.

 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In November last year, unnamed CIA officials told The New York
Times that in 1995 they had compiled a large dossier on Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister. They sent the
material to Vice President Al Gore, co-chairman of the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, in which much of the
government-to-government business between the two countries was
handled.
 &HT;    It came back, said the officials, with what was described as ``a
barnyard epithet'' scrawled on it. The lesson they reportedly took
away was that evidence of high-level corruption was not wanted.
 &HT;    Thus, when they established that a German businessman had been
asked for $1 million to see Chernomyrdin, they did not circulate
the report.
 &HT;    But Chernomyrdin was for years a key interlocutor with Gore, the
man who seeks to prolong Democratic rule in the White House.
Dismissed by Boris Yeltsin as prime minister in March 1998,
Chernomyrdin is back now as president of Gazprom, the energy
monopoly he created and partially privatized and whose huge
revenues, vast holdings and large exemptions from taxes make it a
state within the Russian state.
 &HT;    Gore was deeply involved in Russian policy through the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which dealt with economic, security
and scientific issues. He was a strong advocate of more aid and
assistance to Russia, harshly criticizing the World Bank and IMF's
reluctance to lend. He exhorted American business to invest in the
country and lauded Chernomyrdin, whose personal fortune, held
abroad, is estimated by Russian security sources in the billions of
dollars _ an allegation he denies.
 &HT;    When this checkered record is eventually held up to the light
during a presidential campaign, Gore will have much to answer for.
Already, these issues are boiling up in political circles. U.S.
politicians such as Curt Weldon, a Republican representative from
Pennsylvania, now barrage the administration with questions and
criticisms on their handling of Russia.
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state. Billions of dollars
of aid have poured into its reforms. Bitter struggles have been
waged between Russia's free-market radicals and their Communist or
nationalist foes, most significantly in 1993, when armed struggle
broke out between the Parliament and Yeltsin. Great privations have
been visited on the country in the name of necessary sacrifice.
Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better?
 &HT;    Russians, free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their
nation has shrunk _ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by
the people. The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of
the state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year of its
freedom, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it grew, at best, by less
than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially nonexistent in Soviet
times, is now officially 12 percent and may really be 25 percent.
Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed. ``There was a debate
about institutions and infrastructure back in 1990,'' says Joseph
Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, whose earlier work
on imperfect information and markets has put him in line for a
Nobel prize.
 &HT;    ``I remember talking to a conference in Prague in 1991 on the
theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards
themselves?') in a situation of rapid privatization. There were
already differences between us then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation following his success in
breaking Bolivia's 24,000 percent inflation rate. In Warsaw in
1989, he explained market economics to the Solidarity activists
about to be thrust into power. That December, the first
post-Communist government was quailing before price liberalization.
 &HT;    Late at night in the office of Poland's finance minister, Sachs
had got on the phone and harangued American officials until they
promised to nudge the IMF into providing $1 billion in support for
the Polish currency. His myth as the economic liberator was born,
and with it a mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery. The young reformers in
Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs and his mechanism their way
forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall. Both men
proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and impatiently,
and Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed the IMF and the
World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to government as acting prime minister. But he needed
much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any other
Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy; however,
the release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with its effect
of wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough
_ without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
was to observe later, any therapy. The shock was such that by April
1992 the slender parliamentary majority the government commanded
for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has characterized
Russian reform ever since _ a guerrilla struggle with a hostile,
often violently hostile, legislature. The reformers had hoped that
the West would back them as soon as they took office. But it did
not. This, for many insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in. When South Korea ran into
difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six months. And what
did go in were loans that now have to be paid back or export
credits tied to goods from the country giving the credits. The
intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people were better
placed than the reformers to make the changes. The problem was the
financial scale.''
 &HT;    Here, at the very beginning of reform, is an early charge that
we lost Russia _ and it is made by the economic radicals, East and
West. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision; Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed for
this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with him and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War. The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it
wasn't going to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was
the Russians themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do,
the absence of a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the 1993 battle with Parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the Parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    ``The IMF should have shown more guts in resisting political
pressure,'' one official said. ``The big mistake was not realizing
soon enough that the reformers lacked the levers of power to do
what they had agreed and to keep on lending. We should have been
tougher.''
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say that this is the Russia we
have lost _ lost through our own actions and mistakes. Lost because
we pursued agendas that were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost
because we encouraged and supported precisely those men in the
government dacha, who were hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    Some of the people who are making these charges want the
critique to be part of the election campaign of George W. Bush. It
is already becoming one of the most charged foreign-policy debates
in America.
 &HT;    The case that we lost Russia begins with America's insistence on
exporting the free market to Russia and takes in everything up to
the NATO bombing of Serbia, an act that seems to have completed
Russia's retreat from Washington. The claim that we have lost
Russia, in short, is a proxy for Clintonite failure to reshape
Russia as an idealized America.
 &HT;    In Russia, the charge is that the New Russian reformers, abetted
by the West, have destroyed the country's economy while enriching
themselves. Many of those who make these charges (and who would
like to see those they judge guilty locked up) will be candidates
for the Duma (parliamentary) elections in December.
 &HT;    And this critique may well be a major plank in the platform of
one or more contenders for Yeltsin's mantle in the presidential
elections next July. At the end of a century in which Russia has
been raped by Bolsheviks, the country now seems to have been raped
by capitalists. The stakes in this debate are very high.
 &HT;    The main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza
Rice, former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make
the charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Rice, who will shape Bush's policy and probe Gore's weak spots,
poses a special danger for the Democrats _ she has been an expert
on Russia for decades. Rice admits to the difficulty of the
transition from Soviet communism, that the fault lies largely with
the Russians. She also acknowledges the hazards of retrospective
wisdom.
 &HT;    ``When all that's said,'' she says, ``you are left with a policy
that leaned very far toward accepting the mere rhetoric of reform.
It didn't recognize how mercurial Yeltsin is. It didn't react to
the fact that an awful lot of money has been siphoned off. This
gave a false sense of security to the Russians. They felt that no
matter what reforms they didn't do, they would get the IMF money.
No matter what behavior they showed, they would get friendship. ...
What we now face in international politics is a Russia more
dangerous than it has been, because it is coming apart. And so one
must ask, given what we tried to do and hoped for in 1991, What
went wrong? How could it have happened? What is our
responsibility?''
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us. The NATO action in
Kosovo has produced a bitter reaction, the more so for emphasizing
to the Russians their relative weakness.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies _ as Rice advises _ would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.'' Its re-entry into
the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says, but one to which we
are if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation. Russia never was ours to lose. It must find
itself; until then, we can do little more than watch, offering an
occasional bit of encouragement from the sidelines.

were debating how they should be managed. ``There was a debate
about institutions and infrastructure back in 1990,'' says Joseph
Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, whose earlier work
on imperfect information and markets has put him in line for a
Nobel prize.
 &HT;    ``I remember talking to a conference in Prague in 1991 on the
theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards
themselves?') in a situation of rapid privatization. There were
already differences between us then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation following his success in
breaking Bolivia's 24,000 percent inflation rate. In Warsaw in
1989, he explained market economics to the Solidarity activists
about to be thrust into power. That December, the first
post-Communist government was quailing before price liberalization.
 &HT;    Late at night in the office of Poland's finance minister, Sachs
had got on the phone and harangued American officials until they
promised to nudge the IMF into providing $1 billion in support for
the Polish currency. His myth as the economic liberator was born,
and with it a mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery. The young reformers in
Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs and his mechanism their way
forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall. Both men
proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and impatiently,
and Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed the IMF and the
World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to government as acting prime minister. But he needed
much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any other
Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy; however,
the release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with its effect
of wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough
_ without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
was to observe later, any therapy. The shock was such that by April
1992 the slender parliamentary majority the government commanded
for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has characterized
Russian reform ever since _ a guerrilla struggle with a hostile,
often violently hostile, legislature. The reformers had hoped that
the West would back them as soon as they took office. But it did
not. This, for many insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in. When South Korea ran into
difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six months. And what
did go in were loans that now have to be paid back or export
credits tied to goods from the country giving the credits. The
intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people were better
placed than the reformers to make the changes. The problem was the
financial scale.''
 &HT;    Here, at the very beginning of reform, is an early charge that
we lost Russia _ and it is made by the economic radicals, East and
West. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision; Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed for
this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with him and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War. The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it
wasn't going to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was
the Russians themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do,
the absence of a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the 1993 battle with Parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the Parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    ``The IMF should have shown more guts in resisting political
pressure,'' one official said. ``The big mistake was not realizing
soon enough that the reformers lacked the levers of power to do
what they had agreed and to keep on lending. We should have been
tougher.''
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say that this is the Russia we
have lost _ lost through our own actions and mistakes. Lost because
we pursued agendas that were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost
because we encouraged and supported precisely those men in the
government dacha, who were hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    Some of the people who are making these charges want the
critique to be part of the election campaign of George W. Bush. It
is already becoming one of the most charged foreign-policy debates
in America.
 &HT;    The case that we lost Russia begins with America's insistence on
exporting the free market to Russia and takes in everything up to
the NATO bombing of Serbia, an act that seems to have completed
Russia's retreat from Washington. The claim that we have lost
Russia, in short, is a proxy for Clintonite failure to reshape
Russia as an idealized America.
 &HT;    In Russia, the charge is that the New Russian reformers, abetted
by the West, have destroyed the country's economy while enriching
themselves. Many of those who make these charges (and who would
like to see those they judge guilty locked up) will be candidates
for the Duma (parliamentary) elections in December.
 &HT;    And this critique may well be a major plank in the platform of
one or more contenders for Yeltsin's mantle in the presidential
elections next July. At the end of a century in which Russia has
been raped by Bolsheviks, the country now seems to have been raped
by capitalists. The stakes in this debate are very high.
 &HT;    The main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza
Rice, former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make
the charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Rice, who will shape Bush's policy and probe Gore's weak spots,
poses a special danger for the Democrats _ she has been an expert
on Russia for decades. Rice admits to the difficulty of the
transition from Soviet communism, that the fault lies largely with
the Russians. She also acknowledges the hazards of retrospective
wisdom.
 &HT;    ``When all that's said,'' she says, ``you are left with a policy
that leaned very far toward accepting the mere rhetoric of reform.
It didn't recognize how mercurial Yeltsin is. It didn't react to
the fact that an awful lot of money has been siphoned off. This
gave a false sense of security to the Russians. They felt that no
matter what reforms they didn't do, they would get the IMF money.
No matter what behavior they showed, they would get friendship. ...
What we now face in international politics is a Russia more
dangerous than it has been, because it is coming apart. And so one
must ask, given what we tried to do and hoped for in 1991, What
went wrong? How could it have happened? What is our
responsibility?''
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us. The NATO action in
Kosovo has produced a bitter reaction, the more so for emphasizing
to the Russians their relative weakness.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies _ as Rice advises _ would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.'' Its re-entry into
the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says, but one to which we
are if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation. Russia never was ours to lose. It must find
itself; until then, we can do little more than watch, offering an
occasional bit of encouragement from the sidelines.

 By FRANK RICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    You almost have to feel sorry for Bob Woodward. Yes, he is a
best-selling millionaire author who has been deified by Robert
Redford and satirized by ``Dick'' on-screen, but even millionaire
authors sometimes must cry all the way to the bank.
 &HT;    With each passing year, Woodward gets less respect. The reviews
of his books have become more dismissive, with this summer's best
seller, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,''
even coming in for harsh criticism on the op-ed page of his own
newspaper, The Washington Post.
 &HT;    Woodward's previous book, an account of the Dole-Clinton race
titled ``The Choice,'' was deconstructed by Joan Didion as
``political pornography'' in The New York Review of Books. Other
critics routinely argue that while Woodward's facts almost always
hold up, they are spun and slanted by his sources or distorted by
you-are-there re-creations of ``actual'' dialogue that is as human
as the audioanimatronic presidents at Disney World.
 &HT;    Woodward's most hyped recent revelations _ Hillary Clinton
communing with Eleanor Roosevelt, Bill Clinton's anguish over his
daughter reading the Starr report _ are hardly smoking guns to
rival those with which he and Carl Bernstein nailed Richard Nixon
back in the heady era of ``All the President's Men'' a
quarter-century ago.
 &HT;    Yet a strong case can be made for Woodward's value as a
chronicler of the capital, and his newest book may be essential as
we navigate the post-Clinton age. If ``Shadow'' adds little to our
knowledge of the five presidents it purports to investigate, it
can't be topped as a comprehensive, up-to-date, inside look at the
Washington establishment.
 &HT;    It reveals the mind-set of the highest caste of Beltway
insiders, Woodward himself among them, who are increasingly
determined to rebel against the occupant of the White House, no
matter who it is. However unintentionally on Woodward's part,
``Shadow'' is itself a smoking gun of sorts, Exhibit A of the
arrogance of this clique.
 &HT;    The legacy it truly reveals is not that of Watergate but of
Monicagate. Woodward has codified the Great Disconnect of '98, in
which those hermetically sealed in the Beltway bubble expressed
daily shock and bafflement that the great unwashed did not follow
their moral example and political prognostications by guillotining
a president who had soiled his office.
 &HT;    More ominously, Woodward shows us that 1998 is no aberration.
Clinton and Starr may soon leave town, but the insular
establishment they leave behind is still on the warpath. It's this
establishment, not Watergate, that casts a shadow over future
tenants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as the new century arrives.
 &HT;    As long as there has been a Washington, there has been a degree
of disconnect. But the disconnect went off the charts last year,
when polls showed an unvarying chasm between Washington's and the
rest of the country's perception of the Lewinsky scandal. As the
gap refused to narrow, the insiders repeatedly scolded ``the
American people'' for having sold their souls to a booming Dow
Jones average.
 &HT;    By fall Sally Quinn, the city's hostess with the mostest, was
driven to write a 3,500-word ``cri de coeur'' in The Post's Style
section that, while meant as a circle-the-wagons defense of her
crowd and its higher wisdom, came across to many as an indictment
of the masses handed down by a late-20th-century Marie Antoinette.
 &HT;    ``Shadow'' reads like an unofficial post-impeachment sequel to
Quinn's manifesto. Though purporting to write in a
just-the-facts-ma'am deadpan, Woodward takes the same high moral
tone as Quinn did, but, most revealingly, applies it to every
president since Nixon. An accurate alternative title for the book,
and an apt summation of the current Beltway insider mind-set, might
be ``All the Presidents Stink.''
 &HT;    Woodward's official thesis, culled from what he calls
overwhelming evidence, is that the ``five presidents after Nixon
didn't understand'' the lessons of Watergate _ the prime lesson
being, in his view, that they must ``release the facts, whatever
they are, as early and completely as possible'' about any
``questionable activity,'' preferably (one assumes) to Woodward
himself. In other words, all five presidents are liars.
 &HT;    But another lesson of Watergate, his book makes clear, is that
the Nixon scandal, having knocked the presidency off its pedestal,
liberated Woodward and his fellow insiders, many of whom had looked
the other way at John Kennedy's misbehavior, to note and decry all
presidential sins, whether private or public, major or minor.
 &HT;    In ``Shadow,'' Woodward enumerates every ``questionable
activity'' he can find in or near the executive branch since
Nixon's resignation, yet makes scant distinctions among them, from
the lawbreaking of Iran-contra to the carousing of John Tower. In
his Puritanical scheme, one size of crime or misdemeanor fits all.
It's the same lack of proportionality in assigning moral weight to
sins that put non-Washingtonians at odds with the Beltway
establishment last year.
 &HT;    Consider Woodward's treatment of poor Gerald Ford. Ford is
chastised for bringing into the White House ``a Congressional
lifestyle, which often included alcohol at lunch.'' Woodward
uncovers one scandalous occasion in Denver when the president
``skipped several dozen pages of his remarks because he had what
his aides called a few 'marts,' for martinis, before speaking.''
 &HT;    You'd think that Ford's skipping several dozen pages of luncheon
remarks would be a blessing for those in attendance, or at least
something less than an indictable offense. But in ``Shadow,'' it's
another cue for Woodward to seize the moral high ground and condemn
a benighted president Who Did Not Escape the Shadow of Watergate.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Carter administration becomes an excuse for
Woodward to rehash ancient charges of cocaine possession against
the White House aide Hamilton Jordan. Though Jordan was ultimately
cleared, he was not ``totally innocent'' after all _ for he ``liked
to drink beer and loved chasing women'' and ``did go to places like
... Studio 54,'' where other patrons might have behaved naughtily,
thereby making Jordan ``a magnet for allegations.'' Jordan, it
seems, is guilty by association with nightspots.
 &HT;    Under Woodward's moral tutelage, Jordan recants his past in
``Shadow,'' belatedly seeing the errors of his partying ways of two
decades ago. But Jordan's real problem back then, Woodward suggests
without irony, may have been partying with noninsiders. ``Shadow''
reports that Jordan ``stiffed the Washington establishment and its
dinner-party circuit with particular relish'' _ apparently a
hanging offense.
 &HT;    The punishment, Woodward reports, was a long 1977 article in The
Washington Post Style section ``about the strain between the
Carterites and Washington.'' In it, Jordan was cited for making a
risque remark to the wife of the Egyptian ambassador at the rare
establishment dinner party he did attend.
 &HT;    Though Woodward's research now reveals that ``five others at the
table, including the ambassador's wife'' denied the account, he
puts the crude, musty anecdote back into circulation anyway, since
the Post story was confirmed by a bona fide Washington insider at
the table, the ABC newsman Sam Donaldson, and written (the reader
learns in a footnote some 450 pages later) by Sally Quinn. Two
insiders apparently trump five eyewitnesses at a D.C. crime scene,
even if the alleged victim is among the majority pronouncing the
defendant innocent.
 &HT;    Woodward's treatment of George Bush is haughtier still. When the
former president writes a letter declining to give an interview for
``Shadow,'' Woodward responds with an attack more sustained, severe
and personal than any prompted by the substantive failings of the
Bush presidency _ condemning Bush for having ``never seemed to
reach a stage of peace, relaxation or happiness'' either when in
office or in ``the years afterward.''
 &HT;    Even if this is true, so what? It's a matter for a psychiatrist,
not a journalist. The real Bush scandal was his refusal to ratify
Woodward's self-importance.
 &HT;    Even as Woodward condescends to presidents, he has little but
praise for Washington insiders, many of them wealthy white lawyers
and often, it seems, his sources. Joseph Califano is ``a cool
Washington operator.'' Michael Deaver is ``a man of natural
kindness and good will.'' Lloyd Cutler is ``perhaps the most senior
and experienced fixture of the Washington legal establishment,''
while William Hundley is merely ``one of the most experienced
figures in the Washington legal establishment'' and Plato Cacheris
``the ultimate good old boy of the Washington legal fraternity.''
Jacob Stein is ``one of the lions of the Washington legal
establishment.''
 &HT;    Even David Kendall, not a Woodward favorite, is gratuitously
praised for his anomalous (by Washington-insider standards)
``genuine interest in culture, music and art.'' Abner Mikva, Gerald
Rafshoon, Bryce Harlow, Bob Bennett and the rest are all smarter
than the presidents they advised. They saw the disastrous scandals
coming (and knew just how to avert them) long before the clueless
chief executive of the moment wised up, invariably too late to
avoid being fitted for either a journalist's or an independent
counsel's noose.
 &HT;    From ``Shadow,'' it's evident that the country would be far
better off if it were run by these insiders directly from the Palm
_ as long as they don't have too many ``marts'' _ without the
intrusions of presidents, those bozo middlemen who gum up the
establishment's affairs. No post-Nixon president is worthy of the
job _ and most pre-Nixon presidents wouldn't measure up to
Woodward's absolute lie-free, alcohol-free, womanizing-free
standard either.
 &HT;    While Woodward's point of view may sound smug or elitist, the
Beltway establishment sees itself as patriotic, pious and selfless.
In an aside in ``Shadow,'' Woodward sermonizes that the
octogenarian Gerald Ford spends so much time on private jets and
playing golf that he has become woefully out of touch with
``millions in poverty, children hungry, the wrenching despair and
horror of life for many.'' (Woodward, apparently, is in touch with
these impoverished millions, though as yet his only non-Washington
book was about John Belushi, who flamed out amid the wrenching
despair of West Hollywood.)
 &HT;    Woodward might argue that the proof of his ``objectivity'' is
that he is equally contemptuous of presidents whether liberal or
conservative, Democratic or Republican. He's simply practicing
let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may investigative journalism and
exposing wrongdoing to light. But that's not quite the case
anymore.
 &HT;    Woodward has come a long way from Watergate, when he and
Bernstein were Washington outsiders who would fearlessly follow a
lead wherever it took them in the corridors of power. In
``Shadow,'' no previously unreported scandal of any weight is
exposed.
 &HT;    Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek correspondent and author of
``Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story,'' is who Woodward used to
be. A reading of his book in tandem with Woodward's reveals the
difference between an investigative reporter and an insider
protecting the Washington establishment. Isikoff produced many of
the bigger Monicagate revelations, and he challenges authority,
including The Washington Post, where he so annoyed his editors (as
Woodward and Bernstein once did) that they were glad to see him
jump ship to Newsweek.
 &HT;    Isikoff is also far more scrupulous about identifying sources
than Woodward is, and he at least asks himself circumspect
journalistic questions that no longer seem on Woodward's radar
screen (as they were during Watergate), such as ``What happens when
you become beholden to sources with an agenda?'' (The answer is
demonstrated by how ``Shadow'' burnishes Mike McCurry and others
seen more objectively in ``Uncovering Clinton.'')
 &HT;    When the Washington dinner-party values of a society gossip
columnist become interchangeable with those of political
journalism, political journalism can become a trivial and at times
toxic culture of cynicism and sycophancy. While there have always
been notable snobs in the higher reaches of the Washington media,
usually they were pundits, not self-proclaimed objective reporters
dealing in ``facts.''
 &HT;    The old rules of the game, already blurred, may have been
abandoned for keeps during the second term of the Clinton
administration, when there were more Washington reporters like
Woodward obscuring the line between reporting and punditry than
ever before _ starting with Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, who are
billed by ABC News as White House and congressional correspondents,
not as pundits.
 &HT;    There were also more Beltway insiders visible to the public than
ever before. This explosion of insiderdom had less to do with the
Clinton scandals than with the rapid expansion of the mass media at
the end of the 20th century, and their seemingly irresistible pull
for a Washington establishment that has thrown open its salon doors
to embrace the narcissistic rewards of celebrityhood.
 &HT;    In his promotional tour for ``Shadow,'' Woodward made it clear
that his crowd is by no means chastened by the Great Disconnect of
'98. In interviews with Larry King and Tim Russert, he has put the
next invading governor, George W. Bush, on notice that his refusal
to answer questions about any past misbehavior ``just doesn't
fly.'' Any hidden fact _ what if Bush has covered up a past of
drinking, drugs and making jokes about ambassador's wives? _ may
inspire a new scandal that will reveal the bad character of a
possible president.
 &HT;    If Bush and his rivals don't ``put out the truth,'' Woodward
warns, he just may have to ``put out a new volume of this book _
'Six presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,' or 'Seven presidents
and the Legacy of Watergate.'''
 &HT;    It's too early to tell if Al Gore, a Washington insider by
birth, whose father never dissed Woodward, will get this same
treatment, but either way the Disconnect isn't evaporating in
election year 2000. The struggle between Clinton and the capital's
establishment, explosive and finite as it seems, may in retrospect
have only been a particularly raucous battle in a protracted and
bitter war.

as the audioanimatronic presidents at Disney World.
 &HT;    Woodward's most hyped recent revelations _ Hillary Clinton
communing with Eleanor Roosevelt, Bill Clinton's anguish over his
daughter reading the Starr report _ are hardly smoking guns to
rival those with which he and Carl Bernstein nailed Richard Nixon
back in the heady era of ``All the President's Men'' a
quarter-century ago.
 &HT;    Yet a strong case can be made for Woodward's value as a
chronicler of the capital, and his newest book may be essential as
we navigate the post-Clinton age. If ``Shadow'' adds little to our
knowledge of the five presidents it purports to investigate, it
can't be topped as a comprehensive, up-to-date, inside look at the
Washington establishment.
 &HT;    It reveals the mind-set of the highest caste of Beltway
insiders, Woodward himself among them, who are increasingly
determined to rebel against the occupant of the White House, no
matter who it is. However unintentionally on Woodward's part,
``Shadow'' is itself a smoking gun of sorts, Exhibit A of the
arrogance of this clique.
 &HT;    The legacy it truly reveals is not that of Watergate but of
Monicagate. Woodward has codified the Great Disconnect of '98, in
which those hermetically sealed in the Beltway bubble expressed
daily shock and bafflement that the great unwashed did not follow
their moral example and political prognostications by guillotining
a president who had soiled his office.
 &HT;    More ominously, Woodward shows us that 1998 is no aberration.
Clinton and Starr may soon leave town, but the insular
establishment they leave behind is still on the warpath. It's this
establishment, not Watergate, that casts a shadow over future
tenants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as the new century arrives.
 &HT;    As long as there has been a Washington, there has been a degree
of disconnect. But the disconnect went off the charts last year,
when polls showed an unvarying chasm between Washington's and the
rest of the country's perception of the Lewinsky scandal. As the
gap refused to narrow, the insiders repeatedly scolded ``the
American people'' for having sold their souls to a booming Dow
Jones average.
 &HT;    By fall Sally Quinn, the city's hostess with the mostest, was
driven to write a 3,500-word ``cri de coeur'' in The Post's Style
section that, while meant as a circle-the-wagons defense of her
crowd and its higher wisdom, came across to many as an indictment
of the masses handed down by a late-20th-century Marie Antoinette.
 &HT;    ``Shadow'' reads like an unofficial post-impeachment sequel to
Quinn's manifesto. Though purporting to write in a
just-the-facts-ma'am deadpan, Woodward takes the same high moral
tone as Quinn did, but, most revealingly, applies it to every
president since Nixon. An accurate alternative title for the book,
and an apt summation of the current Beltway insider mind-set, might
be ``All the Presidents Stink.''
 &HT;    Woodward's official thesis, culled from what he calls
overwhelming evidence, is that the ``five presidents after Nixon
didn't understand'' the lessons of Watergate _ the prime lesson
being, in his view, that they must ``release the facts, whatever
they are, as early and completely as possible'' about any
``questionable activity,'' preferably (one assumes) to Woodward
himself. In other words, all five presidents are liars.
 &HT;    But another lesson of Watergate, his book makes clear, is that
the Nixon scandal, having knocked the presidency off its pedestal,
liberated Woodward and his fellow insiders, many of whom had looked
the other way at John Kennedy's misbehavior, to note and decry all
presidential sins, whether private or public, major or minor.
 &HT;    In ``Shadow,'' Woodward enumerates every ``questionable
activity'' he can find in or near the executive branch since
Nixon's resignation, yet makes scant distinctions among them, from
the lawbreaking of Iran-contra to the carousing of John Tower. In
his Puritanical scheme, one size of crime or misdemeanor fits all.
It's the same lack of proportionality in assigning moral weight to
sins that put non-Washingtonians at odds with the Beltway
establishment last year.
 &HT;    Consider Woodward's treatment of poor Gerald Ford. Ford is
chastised for bringing into the White House ``a Congressional
lifestyle, which often included alcohol at lunch.'' Woodward
uncovers one scandalous occasion in Denver when the president
``skipped several dozen pages of his remarks because he had what
his aides called a few 'marts,' for martinis, before speaking.''
 &HT;    You'd think that Ford's skipping several dozen pages of luncheon
remarks would be a blessing for those in attendance, or at least
something less than an indictable offense. But in ``Shadow,'' it's
another cue for Woodward to seize the moral high ground and condemn
a benighted president Who Did Not Escape the Shadow of Watergate.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Carter administration becomes an excuse for
Woodward to rehash ancient charges of cocaine possession against
the White House aide Hamilton Jordan. Though Jordan was ultimately
cleared, he was not ``totally innocent'' after all _ for he ``liked
to drink beer and loved chasing women'' and ``did go to places like
... Studio 54,'' where other patrons might have behaved naughtily,
thereby making Jordan ``a magnet for allegations.'' Jordan, it
seems, is guilty by association with nightspots.
 &HT;    Under Woodward's moral tutelage, Jordan recants his past in
``Shadow,'' belatedly seeing the errors of his partying ways of two
decades ago. But Jordan's real problem back then, Woodward suggests
without irony, may have been partying with noninsiders. ``Shadow''
reports that Jordan ``stiffed the Washington establishment and its
dinner-party circuit with particular relish'' _ apparently a
hanging offense.
 &HT;    The punishment, Woodward reports, was a long 1977 article in The
Washington Post Style section ``about the strain between the
Carterites and Washington.'' In it, Jordan was cited for making a
risque remark to the wife of the Egyptian ambassador at the rare
establishment dinner party he did attend.
 &HT;    Though Woodward's research now reveals that ``five others at the
table, including the ambassador's wife'' denied the account, he
puts the crude, musty anecdote back into circulation anyway, since
the Post story was confirmed by a bona fide Washington insider at
the table, the ABC newsman Sam Donaldson, and written (the reader
learns in a footnote some 450 pages later) by Sally Quinn. Two
insiders apparently trump five eyewitnesses at a D.C. crime scene,
even if the alleged victim is among the majority pronouncing the
defendant innocent.
 &HT;    Woodward's treatment of George Bush is haughtier still. When the
former president writes a letter declining to give an interview for
``Shadow,'' Woodward responds with an attack more sustained, severe
and personal than any prompted by the substantive failings of the
Bush presidency _ condemning Bush for having ``never seemed to
reach a stage of peace, relaxation or happiness'' either when in
office or in ``the years afterward.''
 &HT;    Even if this is true, so what? It's a matter for a psychiatrist,
not a journalist. The real Bush scandal was his refusal to ratify
Woodward's self-importance.
 &HT;    Even as Woodward condescends to presidents, he has little but
praise for Washington insiders, many of them wealthy white lawyers
and often, it seems, his sources. Joseph Califano is ``a cool
Washington operator.'' Michael Deaver is ``a man of natural
kindness and good will.'' Lloyd Cutler is ``perhaps the most senior
and experienced fixture of the Washington legal establishment,''
while William Hundley is merely ``one of the most experienced
figures in the Washington legal establishment'' and Plato Cacheris
``the ultimate good old boy of the Washington legal fraternity.''
Jacob Stein is ``one of the lions of the Washington legal
establishment.''
 &HT;    Even David Kendall, not a Woodward favorite, is gratuitously
praised for his anomalous (by Washington-insider standards)
``genuine interest in culture, music and art.'' Abner Mikva, Gerald
Rafshoon, Bryce Harlow, Bob Bennett and the rest are all smarter
than the presidents they advised. They saw the disastrous scandals
coming (and knew just how to avert them) long before the clueless
chief executive of the moment wised up, invariably too late to
avoid being fitted for either a journalist's or an independent
counsel's noose.
 &HT;    From ``Shadow,'' it's evident that the country would be far
better off if it were run by these insiders directly from the Palm
_ as long as they don't have too many ``marts'' _ without the
intrusions of presidents, those bozo middlemen who gum up the
establishment's affairs. No post-Nixon president is worthy of the
job _ and most pre-Nixon presidents wouldn't measure up to
Woodward's absolute lie-free, alcohol-free, womanizing-free
standard either.
 &HT;    While Woodward's point of view may sound smug or elitist, the
Beltway establishment sees itself as patriotic, pious and selfless.
In an aside in ``Shadow,'' Woodward sermonizes that the
octogenarian Gerald Ford spends so much time on private jets and
playing golf that he has become woefully out of touch with
``millions in poverty, children hungry, the wrenching despair and
horror of life for many.'' (Woodward, apparently, is in touch with
these impoverished millions, though as yet his only non-Washington
book was about John Belushi, who flamed out amid the wrenching
despair of West Hollywood.)
 &HT;    Woodward might argue that the proof of his ``objectivity'' is
that he is equally contemptuous of presidents whether liberal or
conservative, Democratic or Republican. He's simply practicing
let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may investigative journalism and
exposing wrongdoing to light. But that's not quite the case
anymore.
 &HT;    Woodward has come a long way from Watergate, when he and
Bernstein were Washington outsiders who would fearlessly follow a
lead wherever it took them in the corridors of power. In
``Shadow,'' no previously unreported scandal of any weight is
exposed.
 &HT;    Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek correspondent and author of
``Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story,'' is who Woodward used to
be. A reading of his book in tandem with Woodward's reveals the
difference between an investigative reporter and an insider
protecting the Washington establishment. Isikoff produced many of
the bigger Monicagate revelations, and he challenges authority,
including The Washington Post, where he so annoyed his editors (as
Woodward and Bernstein once did) that they were glad to see him
jump ship to Newsweek.
 &HT;    Isikoff is also far more scrupulous about identifying sources
than Woodward is, and he at least asks himself circumspect
journalistic questions that no longer seem on Woodward's radar
screen (as they were during Watergate), such as ``What happens when
you become beholden to sources with an agenda?'' (The answer is
demonstrated by how ``Shadow'' burnishes Mike McCurry and others
seen more objectively in ``Uncovering Clinton.'')
 &HT;    When the Washington dinner-party values of a society gossip
columnist become interchangeable with those of political
journalism, political journalism can become a trivial and at times
toxic culture of cynicism and sycophancy. While there have always
been notable snobs in the higher reaches of the Washington media,
usually they were pundits, not self-proclaimed objective reporters
dealing in ``facts.''
 &HT;    The old rules of the game, already blurred, may have been
abandoned for keeps during the second term of the Clinton
administration, when there were more Washington reporters like
Woodward obscuring the line between reporting and punditry than
ever before _ starting with Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, who are
billed by ABC News as White House and congressional correspondents,
not as pundits.
 &HT;    There were also more Beltway insiders visible to the public than
ever before. This explosion of insiderdom had less to do with the
Clinton scandals than with the rapid expansion of the mass media at
the end of the 20th century, and their seemingly irresistible pull
for a Washington establishment that has thrown open its salon doors
to embrace the narcissistic rewards of celebrityhood.
 &HT;    In his promotional tour for ``Shadow,'' Woodward made it clear
that his crowd is by no means chastened by the Great Disconnect of
'98. In interviews with Larry King and Tim Russert, he has put the
next invading governor, George W. Bush, on notice that his refusal
to answer questions about any past misbehavior ``just doesn't
fly.'' Any hidden fact _ what if Bush has covered up a past of
drinking, drugs and making jokes about ambassador's wives? _ may
inspire a new scandal that will reveal the bad character of a
possible president.
 &HT;    If Bush and his rivals don't ``put out the truth,'' Woodward
warns, he just may have to ``put out a new volume of this book _
'Six presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,' or 'Seven presidents
and the Legacy of Watergate.'''
 &HT;    It's too early to tell if Al Gore, a Washington insider by
birth, whose father never dissed Woodward, will get this same
treatment, but either way the Disconnect isn't evaporating in
election year 2000. The struggle between Clinton and the capital's
establishment, explosive and finite as it seems, may in retrospect
have only been a particularly raucous battle in a protracted and
bitter war.

 By NINA MUNK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's a hot day in Palm Beach. A dark car with tinted windows
stops at a polished gate, and the driver leans toward the intercom:
``Mr. Despont has arrived,'' he announces. The gate slides open;
our car slowly moves up a long driveway made of 500,000 hand-set
pebbles.
 &HT;    It took a crew of eight men two and a half months to set those
pebbles. It took even longer for the pebbles to be gathered from a
beach along the Pacific coast of Mexico. The pebbles were then
sorted and bagged and trucked here.
 &HT;    Chosen because their natural color and texture compliment the
princely home we are approaching, the 500,000 pebbles were to be no
smaller in diameter than two inches, no bigger than four inches _
this by edict of the man who designed the driveway and accompanying
mansion, Thierry Despont.
 &HT;    As an immense limestone palace comes into view, Despont,
architect and raconteur extraordinaire, turns to me and says,
``Once you arrive here you step into your own world.''
 &HT;    Actually, the 21,000-square-foot limestone Palm Beach mansion is
meant to be the world of Sidney Kimmel, a man worth around $1
billion, take or leave a few tens of millions. Kimmel founded and
controls Jones Apparel Group, which, among other things, owns the
Nine West chain of shoe stores, the Todd Oldham trademark and the
license for Polo Jeans.
 &HT;    At the moment Kimmel is not home, or rather he is at one of his
other homes. Which is fine; there is only one person to lead you
through the place, and that person is Despont.
 &HT;    Despont's list of clients reads like the Forbes 400 list. After
all, other architects have rich clients too _ architects such as
Richard Meier and Robert A.M. Stern and Frank O. Gehry. But Despont
is not like other architects _ a point made by both detractors and
admirers.
 &HT;    ``Thierry designs houses that are an hommage to the client,''
says Martha Stewart, who seems awed by her friend Despont. ``To
some degree, Peter Marino does this too. Mark Hampton did it,
somewhat. But this guy does it like no one else. He's really
designing for a king.''
 &HT;    Fortunately for Despont, 51, there's no shortage today of
recently crowned kings. Bill Gates, for example, the co-founder of
Microsoft (net worth, about $95 billion); Millard (Mickey) Drexler,
CEO of Gap Inc. (net worth, $900 million); Leslie Wexner, founder
of the Limited (net worth, $2.8 billion); Calvin Klein, celebrity
fashion designer; Terry Semel, outgoing co-chairman of Warner
Brothers; Conrad Black, CEO of Hollinger, owner of The Chicago
Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and The London Daily Telegraph; Peter
Morton, founder of the Hard Rock Cafe. Every one of these men is a
Despont client.
 &HT;    Other big-name architects have developed styles that are easy to
recognize. Despont, on the other hand, has no discernible style. He
builds neo-Gothic manors and wood-shingle beach houses, Georgian
mansions and limestone villas _ whatever the barons and titans of
late-20th-century America fancy. What Despont is known for is
creating follies, fin-de-siecle exercises in excess, houses blown
up to outrageous proportions _ they sprawl from 20,000 to 60,000
square feet and cost perhaps $20 million to $50 million.
 &HT;    Architects are often paid 10 percent of a project's cost. Though
Despont receives a flat fee agreed on before a project begins, his
take is said to be higher _ say $4 million or $5 million on a $35
million project. ``I do not,'' he says proudly, with a French
accent that seems unaffected by 20 years in America, ''design
shelter.''
 &HT;    Like the Newport mansions built for Cornelius Vanderbilt and
Jacob Astor at the turn of the last century, Despont's homes
address a desire for permanence and recognition among those who
have just arrived _ that is to say, among the newly rich. These
houses are not simply status symbols, signs of conspicuous
consumption; they are bids for immortality, lies against time.
 &HT;    A canny therapist, Despont plays to the culture of narcissism.
When he insists that a house should not reflect its architect, he
is really saying that a house should reflect and flatter its
owners, as well-lighted mirrors do.
 &HT;    ``To be successful at my job, one must be very good at
understanding not only a client's needs, but also a client's dreams
and memories,'' he explained to me. ``One must know where the
client comes from and what they desire. Part of the craft is
learning to read people, to see things they are sure about, the
things they are unsure about; the things they don't convey
verbally, but express through their surroundings.''
 &HT;    Before starting a project, Despont visits his client's home,
meets the children, looks through the photo albums. All the while
he is taking mental notes, weighing the matter: Do they ski in
Aspen or in Gstaad? Do they collect Fernand Leger or Jasper Johns?
 &HT;    The architect Richard Hayden, of the big Manhattan firm Swanke
Hayden Connell, is one of Despont's dear friends. When asked to
name Despont's single greatest talent, Hayden replies without
hesitation, ``Thierry is one of the greatest storytellers I've ever
met.''
 &HT;    A Despont house is the story of its owner's life, real or
imagined. Black, the publishing baron for whom Despont built a
neo-Georgian mansion in Toronto, told me: ``Without being intrusive
or indiscreet, he makes an effort to understand the personality of
the client _ to make sure that whatever he designs for them is
distinctly adapted for them.''
 &HT;    Some of Despont's clients are clear about what they want from
their architect. Others haven't a clue; they expect Despont to
guide them. ``I said, 'I see a house centered on an atrium,'''
Kimmel recalled recently. ``'The only other request I have is a
dumbwaiter in my bedroom and a balcony where I can sunbathe in
privacy.''' Despont and his staff of 40 took it from there.
 &HT;    Unlike most architecture firms, the Office of Thierry W. Despont
Ltd. offers a full range of client services including the sort of
esthetic hand-holding commonly associated with interior decorators.
For Kimmel's limestone villa in Palm Beach, Despont and his staff
supervised construction, designed most of the furniture and bought
the china (four complete sets), glassware and cutlery.
 &HT;    They chose the linens, stocked the bars (indoor and outdoor),
created the gardens, had a security system installed, supplied fine
English soap for the bathrooms and even recruited the household's
major-domo _ a handsome, efficient steward from South Africa named
Gordon, whose many skills include the ability to make a delicious
cheesecake.
 &HT;    Time after time, the upholstered love seats in Kimmel's home
theater were adjusted _ a half-inch here and there _ until at last
they accommodated their owner's ample frame. Just before Kimmel
moved in, a Palm Beach florist was summoned by Despont, who told
him which vase, which flowers went where. Finally, the major-domo
received detailed manuals that anticipated household disasters: For
example, a falling coconut might chip the limestone wall.
 &HT;    In architectural circles there's a story about Despont: that he
won the contract to design Gates' home by teaching the billionaire
how to use a fish knife. The story is almost certainly apocryphal.
It does, however, suggest how Despont is perceived by many of his
peers _ not as an artist, but as a tutor to wealthy philistines. To
such observers, Despont's homes are vulgar anachronisms, out of
place, out of time, out of scale.
 &HT;    Two years ago, when the new Getty Museum, in Los Angeles, opened
to the public, critics were horrified by the marriage of Richard
Meier's stark modernism and Despont's bloated interiors. Robert
Hughes pronounced Despont's period rooms ``a flop.'' ``They are
pure Vegas kitsch,'' added Jed Perl in The New Republic.
 &HT;    ``I am not interested in debate,'' Despont says with disdain,
waving away the architectural elite. True, he is not one of the
world's great architects, but he also does not pretend to be.
Rather than appear in Architectural Record, his homes are profiled
by W and by Harper's Bazaar. ``There is much talent among
architects,'' he notes. ``But there is not always the discipline or
the business sense needed to run a successful practice.''
 &HT;    In the early 1980s, Despont built for Black a Georgian mansion
in Toronto, with a circular, two-story, 26-foot-high domed library
inspired by Palladio's Villa Rotonda. Black granted Despont access
to his social circle, seating him next to Princess Diana at one
party, and inviting him to the annual Hollinger dinners, where the
rich and powerful gather.
 &HT;    Adept at using a fish knife, Despont had no trouble fitting in.
Or spotting an untapped market. ``I looked around and said, Where
are the residential firms? Yes, Richard Meier was doing a few
houses. There was Bob Stern. But there was almost no firm dedicated
to residential projects,'' Despont recalls. ``It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to read the Forbes 400 list and to realize that
there are at least 400 people in America who can afford such
homes.''
 &HT;    Before long, Despont's list of clients (or patrons, as he likes
to call them) included John and Susan Gutfreund, Oscar de la Renta,
Calvin and Kelly Klein and so on.
 &HT;    Then came the project completed in 1992 for Leslie Wexner,
founder of the Limited (which owns or has spun off Henri Bendel,
Express, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Victoria's Secret). For Wexner,
Despont constructed a 60,112-square-foot manse (three-quarters the
size of the White House) on 340 goodly acres three hours from
Cleveland.
 &HT;    One remarkable feature of the 50-room manor is the ballroom
floor, part of which, like a mammoth dumbwaiter, can be lowered to
the cellar, where servants may set the dining table before it's
raised into place.
 &HT;    This beautiful, absurd production marked the beginning of
Despont's current reign. And these days money alone will not buy
you access to him _ he can pick and choose his clients.
 &HT;    Recently, a very successful San Francisco financier considered
hiring Despont: ``I called Thierry and, in that French accent of
his, he says, 'Tell me, do you want to build an impooortante
house?' I understood right away that 'impooortante' was a proxy for
expensive. So I said, 'I don't know.' Then he asks me, 'What do you
dooo for a living?' And I thought, Wait a second, I'm thinking of
hiring him and he's interviewing me?'' Needless to say, they did
not work together.
 &HT;    ``With experience,'' Despont says, ``you can read if people are
going to be exciting and challenging and fun to work with. And the
ones who are not, I do not want to do a house with those people.''
Such haughtiness does not seem to harm Despont's business. On the
contrary, it appears to make him more desirable.
 &HT;    ``It's so unfair,'' cries an architect at one big New York firm.
``He's French, so, naturally, to these people, he's seductive.''
Another peer puts it more sharply. ``He's perfect for people who
have an inferiority complex and need to be acculturated,'' says
this New York architect _ who then proceeds to repeat to me the
myth of Gates and the fish knife.
 &HT;    ``I like to think I have reinvented the Palm Beach house,''
Despont announces, as we walk through the dotrance doors to
Kimmel's limestone palace. It's the comment of a man who is
thinking beyond the criticisms of the moment and dreaming, like his
clients, of immortality.
 &HT;    During the four years it took Despont to build the Palm Beach
mansion, Kimmel had his doubts. He worried that the house would be
too ostentatious. A man who rose from modest means, Kimmel has
never felt comfortable displaying his wealth. To quote Despont,
``He said, 'It's OK, Thierry, we'll finish it, then I'll sell it
and we'll start over.'''
 &HT;    In truth, selling the home would not be easy. The Palm Beach
Appraisal Department has placed a value of $20 million on Kimmel's
house, probably a little more than half of what was actually spent.
The land alone is worth $10 million.
 &HT;    ``We assess at market value,'' explains John Fable, a longtime
appraiser who works only oceanfront property. ``Nobody's going to
pay what he put into it because most of it isn't what anyone else
would want. It's a showplace.''
 &HT;    So far, only one of Despont's properties, a country manor built
in the early 1990s for the Canadian department-store heir George
Eaton, has been put on the market. According to the listing agent,
at $12 million, the 25,000-square-foot house is a steal; it could
never be duplicated for that price. Yet after seven months on the
market, it hasn't sold.
 &HT;    Despont wrinkles his nose at my vulgar questions about resale
value. ``My houses are not investments,'' he says, as if money was
somehow beneath him. ``They are investments in joie de vivre.''
 &HT;    Making our way carefully across the limestone floor of Kimmel's
palace, we enter the atrium, a vertiginous space 26 feet high. On
one side is the ocean; on the other side, a long pool is lined with
exquisite fragments of blue Murano glass. Looking out to the sea,
one is enchanted by the blue pool, the sculpture by Henry Moore,
the formal gardens and playing fountain.
 &HT;    On a beautiful evening last November, Despont invited Kimmel to
view the house, which had just been completed. Upon his arrival, a
butler, holding a simple sterling salver, offered him a flute of
Dom Perignon.
 &HT;    ``I was in shock,'' Kimmel recalls. ``It came out so much better
than I could ever have dreamed. I knew it would be good. I just
didn't know how good.''
 &HT;    He had never dared to imagine that such an edifice might be his.
That night, walking across the limestone floor into the atrium,
gazing out toward the ocean at sunset, Kimmel had tears in his
eyes. ``I'm the son of a cabdriver, a boy from the slums of
Philadelphia,'' he said. ``How did I get here?''

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ It is difficult to respect a
presidential candidate who lacks the courage to say whether he or
she believes in biological evolution. George W. Bush, Elizabeth
Dole and Steve Forbes ducked the question, saying they would leave
it to the states rather than the scientific community to decide
whether Charles Darwin was a jerk. Such ignorant mush could be
expected of Forbes, who is pandering to the religious right, but
Dole promised us she would give us straight talk. She's a big
disappointment. By MARIANNE MEANS

   OLDER-WORKERS (Washington) _ Gene Nelson, an experienced

irked at the claim of the computer industry that 400,000 software
engineering and programing jobs go unfilled in the United States.
``There's no shortage of high-tech workers,'' Nelson says.
``There's a shortage of high-tech workers under the age of 35.'' We

an industry that favors the young. By MARK HELM. (Also filed in the

   BOMBING-RANGE (Vieques, Puerto Rico) _ Puerto Rico's political
leaders and allies in Congress point to Hawaii's ouster of the U.S.
Navy from a bombing range on the island of Kaho'olawe in 1994 as a
precedent for Puerto Rico's campaign to evict the Navy from a
58-year-old bombing range on the island of Vieques. The future of
Vieques is headed toward President Clinton's desk. By STEWART M.
POWELL.

`YELLOW SUBMARINE' RESURFACES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ROBERT SELTZER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
``Once upon a time _ or maybe twice _ there was an unearthly
paradise called Pepperland.'' 
_ From the movie ``Yellow Submarine'' 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It was mayhem with a melody _ the chaotic but
lyrical ``Yellow Submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is back.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years after it charmed the world, the animated
movie is returning, its colors so rich they seem to drip down the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Available for the first time in 11 years, MGM Home Entertainment
is rereleasing ``Yellow Submarine'' on videocassette and DVD Sept.
14, each version digitally renovated, with the soundtrack remixed
in Dolby Surround Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The film boasts footage that was not seen in the original movie,
including a scene featuring ``Hey Bulldog,'' the roughest song on
the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Yellow Submarine itself, one of the most famous
vehicles in rock 'n' roll history, the movie takes you back in time
_ to a decade when the Beatles captivated the world with their
humor and whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   As the cartoon version of John Lennon says, ``It's all in the
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the music, or the images, the plot is simple: The
adventure is set in a psychedelic world called Pepperland, where
the Beatles have vowed to rescue the citizens from the Blue
Meanies, who have declared war on all that is good.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles may not be warriors, but they wield a weapon, their
music, which reduces the Blue Meanies to whimpering nasties.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the music, raucous one minute, ethereal the next _ the
soundtrack to a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The movie features such classics as ``Eleanor Rigby,'' ``Nowhere
Man,'' ``All You Need Is Love'' and ``Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   As they cavort their way through this adventure, the Beatles
meet giant apes, flying fists and a pair of disembodied feet with
floppy socks that do not match.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is a magical mystery tour. ... No, wait a minute
_ different album, different movie.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Yellow Submarine'' DVD, available in the original
wide-screen format, features the theatrical trailer and a
behind-the-scenes short, ``The Mod Odyssey.'' The videocassette is
$19.98, while the DVD sells for $29.98.

   It was like time passing time. The thundering diesel engine
pushed a line of railroad cars through an intersection near the
paper mills of Berlin, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting at the crossing in his hissing 1922 Stanley Steamer sat
David Nergaard of Littleton, Mass. What the modern diesel and the
old car had in come was their whistles. Except that when Nergaard
pulled the cord to unleash steam through his whistle, and the big
train replied in kind, it was clear in the mountain air that the
Stanley's whistle was the louder.
</P>
<P>
   Steam is powerful. It has driven our industry, our mills,
trains, ocean-going ships, lake launches, and cars. In 1906, it
powered a Stanley called the ``Rocket'' to 127.6 miles per hour on
a Florida beach.
</P>
<P>
   Steam is also ephemeral, here and then gone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are those who have found a way to hold onto steam, and
in more than 80 steam cars, they plied the notches, valleys, and
mountains of northern New Hampshire all last week. What brought
them there was the 100th anniversary of the first automobile ascent
of Mount Washington. Where they came from was all over the United
States and Europe. What their owners had in common was the clutch
of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steam is a bad disease . . . once you get it, you can't get
rid of it,'' says Nergaard.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered first at the base of the Mount Washington Auto
Road and, in this driest of summers, were met with rain. Weather in
the Whites can be like that _ unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   It did not stop hundreds of spectators from coming to the public
exhibit, and they moved among the cars and their hisses, whistles,
and gasps. Some of the cars, puffing steam, sounded like a panting
dog would on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Here was Arthur Edlredge of Peterborough, N.H., with his 1901
Lane, one of two Lanes known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Here were Robert and Eulalia Collins of South Amherst, Mass.,
with ``Yellow Legs,'' the 1911 Stanley Model 71 that they saved
from beneath a tree on a chicken farm in 1958. Eulalia's father
found the car, Robert and Eulalia did their own work restoring it:
woodwork, leather upholstery, pinstriping. They have been driving
it since.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Richard of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., came in a 1910 White;
William Handley of Manchester, N.H., in a 1932 Derr American _
again, one of two known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for some of the cars to climb Washington on Monday,
but Monday was the mountain's day: early August, yet, as Washington
can be, 32 degrees at the top in winds up to 76 miles per hour.
Re-enacting the first ascent _ by F. O. Stanley and his wife, Flora
_ would have to wait for another day.
</P>
<P>
   So historical reenactment became social event and tour as
participants shifted gears.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gilheeney, the maintenance manager for the Mount Washington
Summit Road Co., worked to get the company's 1899 Locomobile
running, even though it would not attempt to re-create the climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you all to step back, it's like a fire-spittin'
dragon,'' he warned of the process of warming and lighting the
gasoline that heats the water that turns to steam that runs the
auto.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd only recently grown his eyebrows back from one such
flaming spit and then told of seeing a man a day earlier burn the
hair off one side of his head.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes of warming and fiddling, Gilheeney had the
Locomobile, which may be the one the Stanleys used to climb the
mountain, up and running. Minutes after that, backed from the
garage, it was spitting flames because it was getting too much
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The steam crowd is an eclectic bunch, beards abound, as do
period clothes, bug-eyed goggles and strange hats. And as in any
eclectic bunch, stories, tales, and myths abound.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley invented the steamer, some said, because his wife was
twice thrown from a horse. No, no, said others. It was because she
could not learn to ride a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn Benson of Limerick, Maine, raced through notch and valley
in his 1906 Stanley racer, baseball cap on backward, beard flowing
in twin wings up over his face, goggles fastened tight, giving him
the look of a speeding bug.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of what may have been the largest gathering of
steam cars ever held, and as they made their way along roads among
heavy summer tourist traffic they were centers of attention. Other
drivers waved to them; some looked at them curiously, perhaps
mistaking the steam that occasionally poured from beneath them for
the smoke of an engine gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they stopped, crowds formed: children goggle-eyed,
elderly couples holding hands and walking around them in reverence
or remembrance or both.
</P>
<P>
   They toured through the week, inspected one another's cars, were
gracious to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're leaving, some on trailers, some, like Nergaard's
Stanley, being driven all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   And 100 years after the first car, a steamer, climbed Mount
Washington, they will be gone _ like steam.

RUSSIAN MOB MAY HAVE FUNNELED BILLIONS THROUGH N.Y. BANK 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (nk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER with TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billions of dollars have been channeled through the Bank of New
York in the last year in what is believed to be a major money
laundering operation by Russian organized crime, law enforcement
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   From October through March some $4.2 billion, in more than
10,000 transactions, passed through one account, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the account has remained open to help a continuing
investigation by the federal authorities, investigators estimate
that as much as $10 billion may have flowed through the bank in
that account and related ones since early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the transactions seem to add up to one of the
largest money laundering operations ever uncovered in the United
States, with vast sums of money moving in and out of the bank in a
day. But they are quick to point out that the inquiry is still in
its early stages and that they do not yet know the full scale of
the operation or where the money ended up.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Bank of New York said it had suspended two
employees whose names had surfaced in the investigation. Both are
officers in the bank's Eastern European division and are married to
Russian businessmen, one of whom is believed by investigators to
have controlled one of the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions of the two women, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky
of New York, and Lucy Edwards of London, followed an inquiry by The
New York Times. The employees have been suspended pending
completion of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bank of New York has been cooperating with the office of
the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in
a confidential investigation of the use of bank facilities to
transfer funds from Russia to other countries,'' the bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no allegations of wrongdoing by the bank,'' it said,
adding that no customer or bank funds had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   An American government official who follows money laundering and
Russian organized crime said, ``What we have here is the
penetration of a major U.S. organization by Russian organized
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   American and European officials have been concerned about the
possibility that organized crime syndicates from Russia and other
countries could infiltrate financial markets and institutions in
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators here and abroad have been examining cases where
front companies have tried to raise capital in North America for
organized crime activities in Russia through stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Russian financial system last year,
the flight of money out of the country has accelerated, and
investigators have been on the lookout for activities they suspect
are ``laundering'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is a legal catch phrase that refers to the
criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains and moving them
through a sequence of bank accounts so they ultimately look like
legitimate profits from legal businesses. The money is then
withdrawn and used for further criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts under scrutiny at the Bank of New York have been
linked by investigators to a man who Western law enforcement
officials say is a major figure in Russian organized crime, Semyon
Yukovich Mogilevich. Mogilevich is involved in a wide range of
activities from arms trafficking and extortion to prostitution,
American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies
say.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich, 53, is considered smart, ruthless and vastly
wealthy. A recent British intelligence report said he was worth
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and European intelligence agencies have been intensely
monitoring his activities for five years, an American official said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI report on Russian organized crime said that when the
Soviet Union withdrew its forces from East Germany, many Russian
generals sold their weapons to Mogilevich, who in turn sold them,
at much higher prices, to countries like Iraq, Iran and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   British authorities, investigating the financial activities of
Russian organized crime, alerted the FBI to the suspected money
laundering at the Bank of New York more than a year ago. The FBI
said Wednesday that it would have no comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   An initial round of federal subpoenas issued to the Bank of New
York produced 3,500 pages of transactions for one account in the
name of a company called Benex, said investigators. They would say
little about what information they have about Benex, its location
or its activities.
</P>
<P>
   British intelligence reported that some of the money from the
Benex account went to pay contract killers and some went to drug
barons, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after an American journalist, Robert Friedman, wrote
a long expose of his criminal career in the Village Voice,
Mogilevich put out a contract on the reporter's life, the Central
Intelligence Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said it had picked up the threat by monitoring
Mogilevich's phone. A European law enforcement official said
recently that the contract was for $100,000. Friedman went into
hiding for a while and has resumed writing.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to take many months before investigators sift
through the documents and penetrate the complex web of offshore
companies and holding companies to determine precisely where the
money came from and where it went.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York state
Banking Department declined to comment on whether they had begun
their own investigations of the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While sifting through boxes of documents that turned up in the
British investigation, investigators found references to Benex,
which was linked to an American company, YBM Magnex, which was a
front for Mogilevich, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   YBM, based in Philadelphia and once traded on the Canadian stock
exchange, was an operating company _ it made and sold industrial
magnets _ and a money laundering vehicle for Mogilevich, American
and British officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   In June YBM pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud in
federal District Court in Philadelphia, and the U.S. Attorney's
office there is still considering whether to indict Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   The YBM case was one reflection of the success of Russian
organized crime in infiltrating Western financial markets, American
and European officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``it's a drop in the bucket'' compared to what has happened
at the Bank of New York, said an American official.
</P>
<P>
   The account at the Bank of New York was opened by a
Russian-American last year, an investigator said. He declined to
give the person's name.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of transactions through the accounts has been
extraordinary, officials said, and often the money came in and went
out quickly. This should have made the bank suspicious, said an
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   But according to investigators, but the bank has filed only one
``suspicious activity report'' with the federal authorities and
that was after the authorities began investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the bank would not discuss the filing of any reports
with the authorities.
</P>

 &UR; UNDATED: the authorities. &LR;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   If unusual activity occurs in an account, banks are required to
file ``suspicious activity reports,'' or SARs, into a system
monitored by the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network, as well as the country's five main banking regulators. The
reports are confidential and the Treasury's network declined to
comment Wednesday on whether it had received any such report from
the Bank of New York recently.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At one time, American authorities froze the Benex account, which
had $34 million in it, an investigator said. But they quickly
unfroze it, when they realized that it was just the tip of a very
large operation and it would aid the investigation to keep the
account active, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts had been handled by Ms. Kagalovsky, a senior vice
president of the bank in New York, according to government
officials in New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Russia, she emigrated to the United States in 1979, and
after earning a masters degree at Princeton joined a management
training program at the bank, according to articles in The American
Banker and Bankers Monthly in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, after the collapse of Communism, Ms.
Kagalovsky was put in charge of bringing in new business from
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, she married Konstantin Kagalovsky, who has been
an economic adviser to the Russian government and from 1992-1995,
was Russia's representative to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky, 44, declined to answer any questions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking at the role played by Lucy
Edwards, a vice president of the bank in London working on Eastern
European accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Ms. Edwards spoke at a two-day conference on
international financial services for Scandinavia, Eastern Europe
and Russian clients. She was the first speaker on the second day.
Her topic: ``Money Laundering: Latest Developments and
Regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards was also born in Russia and acquired American
citizenship by marriage, an American official said. After a
divorce, she married a Russian, Peter Berlin, and he subsequently
became an American citizen, the official added. Investigators
believe that Berlin had authority over the Benex account at the
bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin could not be located.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards' assistant in London, who gave her name only as
Rachel, said that Ms. Edwards was traveling. She added that it was
bank policy that no one on the staff could speak to reporters.
After being told more details of the money laundering
investigation, she referred questions to Ms. Kagalovsky.

THE VIGGEN: LOTS TO LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE SAABS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a Saab guy, I go back to the late '60s, and through three
decades I owned several of them, from the popcorn poppers to the
900 turbos, and they lost me only when they came out with the 9000,
which just didn't feel like a Saab.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I learned in driving these slightly quirky cars is
that if you take front-wheel drive and add power, you get torque
steer, a tendency of power transmitted to front wheels to give
those wheels wandering minds of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the low-powered Saabs, this meant you could make the front
wheels actually chatter if you turned hard and accelerated from low
speeds. In the mid-'80s turbos, it produced an offline tug that
could be sensed even when accelerating from higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Saab company guy stood before us to unveil the Saab
Viggen, the line's new hot rod, I was skeptical when I heard him
say that, despite 225 horsepower and 252 lb-ft. of torque, this
Lightning Blue wedge of a rocket did not have torque steer.
</P>
<P>
   Weight shift, he called it. Wait a minute, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. There is a lot to like about this car. But
Saab should just admit that, hey, it's got torque steer and that's
part of the quirkiness that has made so many folks so loyal to
Saab.
</P>
<P>
   Round a sharp, climbing left-hand curve at 60 miles per hour,
drop to third and kick in the turbo, and the Viggen pulls out to
the right. In the same turn, there is a disquieting shift of weight
to the right rear wheel even as the front wheels unweight. Hit
bumps at speed and those front wheels start thinking on their own
again, a hop here, a skip there, and hold that steering wheel. Even
when accelerating straight ahead, there are times when you sense
competing forces at work up there in the front.
</P>
<P>
   As David Crosby sang:
</P>
<P>
   (itals) ``It's like one of those nights you drive by your own
street; and you wonder who's running your hands and your
feet.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   That said, for Saab loyalists, this souped-up version of the 9.3
is the best Saab yet. It's got power, it's got performance (0-60 in
6.5 seconds), it's wonderfully comfortable, and in trained hands it
can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   One thing it doesn't have is the turbo lag of old. Its
2.3-liter, four-cylinder engine _ with reinforced pistons and oil
jets pumping from beneath to cool those pistons _ barks to the
commands of an electronic throttle. Stomp the gas and the throttle
opens wide, sucking in air for a lean, turbo-boosting leap even
before extra fuel starts to flow.
</P>
<P>
   To limit torque steer at the lower end, the engine's torque is
limited in first and second gears. But when the Mitsubishi turbo is
free to run, the car leaps ahead in a way that makes clear why they
named it after the Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. There is power to
spare here and it jumps from 60-80 miles per hour in a flash,
cruises at 75 m.p.h. in fifth turning just under 2,800 rpms. And
even with all this power, I got just over 23 miles per gallon
driving the Saab on country lanes and major highways.
</P>
<P>
   Saab has stiffened the suspension well beyond what is standard
in the 9.3 _ MacPherson struts, shortened coil springs, tube shocks
and antiroll bar up front; a torsion beam axle, coil springs, tube
shocks, and antiroll bar in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Yet my sense is it should be stiffer still, considering all the
power Saab has given us to play with in the Viggen. The ride is
softer than it should be and in a performance car, this translates
into body roll.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also like stiffer clutch performance and I remain baffled at
Saab's continued insistence on putting out long-throw, sloppy
sticks for shifting. In a car like this, you want a transmission
you can click through, up and down, for all five gears _ not one
that has you reaching for some distant correct spot with each
shift.
</P>
<P>
   What this whole setup means is that, to drive this car out on
the edge _ where I assume Saab means for us to drive it _ you have
to know its quirks and you have to be aware when they kick in.
</P>
<P>
   In true Saab fashion, the Viggen is built to protect its
occupants: dual front airbags, side airbags, active head
restraints, and a braking system, with ABS, that brings it to fast,
shoulder-belt tightening stops. Key to this fine braking system are
four ventilated rotors with enlarged calipers to squeeze the Viggen
to straight, sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, all is elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Black and blue leather seats with firm thigh pads and bulging
lateral supports make you feel like you're strapped into a racecar.
These are some of the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in and,
in what is not really a large car, the rear seat legroom is
remarkable. Even the door inserts are rich, blue leather.
</P>
<P>
   The dash and controls are a fine lesson in simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges packaged simply in a single semicircle; climate controls
easy to read and easy to use _ red arrow up for heat, blue arrow
down for cool _ up and down arrows abound, in easy to understand
universal language.
</P>
<P>
   The curved, light-gray dashboard allows all-black switches to
stand out and a night panel system lets the driver turn off any
distracting lights and instruments.
</P>
<P>
   With its sloping hood, the Saab gives the driver a clear view of
the road ahead and with this car's power and quirks, you'll want to
pay attention to that view and to the feel of the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Saab offers Viggen buyers two free days of driving school at
Road Atlanta, and if you buy one of these, I'd recommend you take
the course. For the relatively cheap price of $38,000 _ there are
virtually no options on the Viggen _ you are getting a lot of car
that needs a trained hand to use it right.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The rubber toggle switches that control the direction of all
vents in the dash.
</P>
<P>
   --The in-dash cupholder that folds out, wafer thin, looking like
a CD holder until the catch drops down to hold the cup.
</P>
<P>
   --The driver's left foot rest. Why doesn't everybody do this?
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The AM radio reception is atrocious. I expected to here Ol'
Dead Wolfman Jack crackling through the night air, ala a la 1960s,
as the signals of skipping stations faded in and out.

RESEARCHERS FORESAW QUAKE ACTIVITY IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the
devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific
journal in 1997. It might have been just a lucky guess. Still, if
it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one.
</P>
<P>
   In the scientific article, two U.S. Geological Survey
researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a
small possibility of ``a large event south of the major western
port city of Izmit,'' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault,
within the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles
south of Izmit. Early indications are that the epicenter was on the
Sapanca Fault, which stems from the larger North Anatolian Fault
system.
</P>
<P>
   The article, published in Geophysical Research International and
titled ``Progressive Failure on the North Anatolian Fault Since
1939 by Earthquake Stress Triggering,'' was written by veteran USGS
researchers Ross S. Stein and James H. Dieterich and Aykut A. Barka
of the department of geology at Istanbul Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earthquake occurred right in this area that we
described,'' Dieterich said in an interview Wednesday. ``This
earthquake does fit what we had roughly described in this paper.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ``I'm a little bit reluctant to claim
that we forecast the earthquake,'' mainly because they assigned
only a 12 percent probability to it.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, Dieterich and Barka based their forecast partly on their
study of a remarkable long-term trend in Turkish earthquakes. Since
1939, 11 quakes have occurred at sites along the North Anatolian
Fault that are almost always progressively farther to the west with
each occurrence, ``like falling dominoes,'' as the scientists
described it.
</P>
<P>
   The quake sequence along the North Anatolian Fault zone is
unusual in that no other fault zones on Earth show such a neat,
domino-style pattern of occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   According to geological theory, a quake changes crustal stress
in a region and might increase the possibility of a future quake in
that region.
</P>
<P>
   According to the calculations by the scientists, a 1967 quake
immediately to the east of Izmit increased stress in that region.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, they forecast that the increased stress could
eventually cause a major quake on the Sapanca Fault.
</P>
<P>
   On this basis, the three scientists proposed in their article
that over the next 30 years, there was a 12 percent probability for
a large event south of Izmit, which lies farther west than the 1967
quake.
</P>
<P>
   They also forecast a 15 percent probability of a quake measuring
at least 6.7 magnitude east of the eastern center of Ercinzan. The
Ercinzan region is far from the site of the Tuesday quake.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their forecast was a true prediction or just a lucky
guess, it reinforces Dieterich's confidence in an emerging paradigm
of earthquake science: the importance of crustal stress changes in
triggering or inhibiting future quakes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, quake specialists have developed computer
models to understand how quakes change the stress on Earth's crust.
Some research suggests that past California quakes have been either
triggered or inhibited by stress changes induced by quakes
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake
of 1906, USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said. ``The 1906 earthquake
was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault
in the Bay Area,'' Simpson said Wednesday. As a result, for most of
the 20th century California was relatively quiet, quake-wise,
compared with the shaky 19th century.

DIRECTING AND SCREENWRITING: D-MINUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his writing for ``Scream,'' ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer'' and ``The Faculty,'' Kevin Williamson
has made a career out of irony. Not content with employing it, he
is now defining irony for us. In his directorial debut, the
teen-age dark comedy ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' he tells us (over
and over) that irony is ... an outcome different from what was
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an outcome different from what was expected: That a
once-promising screenwriter like Williamson would turn into a
sanctimonious bore, giving us in ``Mrs. Tingle'' shallow, unlikable
characters doing illogical things in overdone situations as he
tries to teach ``us'' a lesson about respect.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the movie's lead character, Leigh Ann
(''Dawson Creek's'' Katie Holmes). She's the smart daughter of a
waitress, and she pins her hopes for a scholarship on getting an
``A'' in Mrs. Tingle's history class; if she doesn't get it, she
won't be valedictorian. Uh, hello? Did colleges stop handing out
scholarships to people just because they were ``second'' in their
class? (Judging from the intelligence level at this school, by the
way, all grades are on the curve.)
</P>
<P>
   Or take Mrs. Tingle herself, a teacher loaded with such
bitterness at being stuck in a small town that she wants even her
best students to fail and be stuck there with her. She browbeats
the kids during class, but this isn't the sort of tough-love John
Houseman showed in ``The Paper Chase''_ it's a particularly
vindictive form of teaching, one that has nothing to do with giving
hard lessons and everything to do with spite. Again, what's keeping
her in this podunk town? She certainly seems to have enough money
to get out, judging from her Gothic house.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Leigh Ann and Mrs. Tingle escalates when
Leigh Ann is falsely accused of cheating. The Noxzema-faced teen
shows up at Tingle's home to mount a defense with a couple of dense
buddies (Marisa Coughlan as the best-friend/sidekick who's a
wannabe actress, ``7th Heaven's'' Barry Watson as the rebel stud
who attracts both girls), and one thing leads to another. Next
thing you know, the kids have tied Mrs. Tingle to her bed, she
plays mind games with the kids and vice versa, and Coughlan does
bad Linda Blair impersonations.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many of this year's teen movies, the ghost of John
Hughes haunts this one (just when you're thinking, ``Hey, this
looks like a John Hughes movie,'' Molly Ringwald's name pops up in
the opening credits). Holmes, Coughlan and Watson make up such an
Ally Sheedy-Ringwald-Judd Nelson sort of trio you keep wondering
when Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall are going to walk in.
As Mrs. Tingle, Helen Mirren acts rings around the rest of the
cast, even though she spends a good deal of the movie bound and
gagged; the big question is why an actress of her caliber decided
to be in something this lame. The supporting cast is peppered with
Hughes-ish adults such as Michael McKean (thoroughly wasted as the
school principal) and Jeffrey Tambor (as a lascivious coach).
Williamson treats these characters as crumpled-up waste paper _ he
tosses them out, unwrinkles them when he decides he needs them
again, then throws them away once more.
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Williamson is simply routine, letting many scenes
run on too long, leaning too much (as always) on his pop-culture
knowledge and getting the most mundane performances from everyone
except Mirren and, to a lesser extent, Holmes. It's time Williamson
grew up _ his work here and in ``The Faculty,'' which also involved
vindictive teachers but in a more amusing way, shows that this guy
is still stuck on his high-school issues. And he's 34! His biggest
mistake with ``Mrs. Tingle,'' though, is the number of times he
shows characters yawning or complaining that they're bored. Here's
an irony, Kev: This time, your audience is likely to agree.

THE PLAY-WITHIN-THE-PLAY'S THE CONFOUNDING THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For movie fans who want something a little more sophisticated
than ``American Pie,'' John Turturro's theater-world satire
``Illuminata'' is a textbook example of ``Be careful what you ask
for _ you might get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a film that's smart, often funny, unconventional and
unpredictable. It's also pretentious, often boring or crude,
bizarre and meandering. These virtues and flaws are not mutually
exclusive. Consequently, your tolerance for the movie depends, more
than usual, on the mood you're in when you go to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Illuminata'' is, in part, a comedy about a writer's
difficulties in staging his new play, don't expect the exuberance
of ``Shakespeare in Love.'' This is a movie that's stagy and
cynical, and it makes no bones about possessing either quality. The
real-life actors playing the fake actors say all their lines as if
the words were among the most profound ever spoken. Even the
funniest lines sound as if they are meant to be written in italics.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro _ who directed, produced and with Brandon Cole co-wrote
this adaptation of Cole's play _ plays Tuccio, the playwright for a
motley repertory company. He's trying to get an unfinished play,
``Illuminata,'' produced but is having trouble with stubborn
theater owners who believe the play isn't ready. During his
attempts to get the show produced, he'll have to deal with a
flamboyant drama-queen critic (Christopher Walken, hamming it up
but looking like death warmed over), a scheming diva (Susan
Sarandon, hamming it up but looking great), a
not-always-understanding lover/actress/theater manager (Katherine
Borowitz, in one of the film's few subtle performances), and with
the bawdy antics of the company's actors.
</P>
<P>
   The film was obviously as much a labor of love for Turturro as
its play-within-a-play was for Tuccio. But unless you're absolutely
obsessed with theater, you're likely to find it a little
irritating. Even though it's scarcely an hour-and-a-half long, the
movie gives you the feeling that Turturro never had an idea he
wanted to throw out _ the movie echoes commedia dell'arte and
theater of the absurd, with cinematic hints of Bergman (watch how
Turturro stages a deathbed scene) and Fellini, and Turturro has
also cited visionary filmmakers Jean Renoir and Michael Powell as
influences. That's a lot to stuff into 95 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The result is one of the darnedest movies to come out this year,
with a script so wordy that its best lines seem to be beneficiaries
of the law of averages and performances so florid that they defy
criticism. And yet, for all its farcicalness, it shows every sign
that Turturro took it way too seriously. The climactic scene, which
drags on and on, is merely the screenplay's way of saying that,
sometimes, art and life overlap. Not exactly a new statement, but
Turturro stages it as if he were delivering an earth-shattering
prophecy.

more than he had before. The substance of this more detailed

GRANT TELLS ALL _ AND SOME OF IT'S TRUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The heat index outside is over 100 degrees, and even
inside Hugh Grant's two-story hotel suite, it is uncomfortably
warm.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, dressed head to toe in black, has his shirt sleeves
rolled up above his elbows, and the top buttons of his shirt open.
But he seems relaxed as he plops down into an easy chair, slips off
his loafers, and puts his stockinged feet up on a coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bumbling, overshy impression many people have of
Grant from his performance in ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' he
does not act cute or coy or lovably inept in person. He doesn't
even run his hands through his famously floppy hair. Most of that
is just acting, and Grant is rather tired of the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about me being an English wimp,'' he says. ``As you
know, we're all homosexuals. Tea-drinking homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new film, ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' Grant plays an Englishman
living in New York. He finds himself mistaken for a gangster called
``Mickey Blue Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone will think of me as a wimp after this,
because I'm pretty damn hard in it,'' he says. ``Don't you think?
Pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   He's kidding. In interviews, Grant jokes, exaggerates and
embellishes stories with a dry humor and an almost perpetual grin
that he struggles vainly to suppress. It's not the listener he is
trying to amuse, but himself, by trying out this or that new
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Take the story about the London house that his longtime
companion, actress and model Elizabeth Hurley, insisted they buy,
despite his protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made me do it,'' Grant says. ``And then swindled me.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really?
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we'd share it, and when it came time to write this
massive check, she pulled the old `I don't have my checkbook on me'
stuff. With amazing bare-facedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks later she was sitting with her checkbook in front
of her. I said, `Any chance you could pay me back?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And she said `You know, I've decided not to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Grant's answers, this sounds, frankly, like more
lie than truth. He savors the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he says, chuckling. ``You're right. I like to sprinkle
little falsehoods like currants on a cake. That's actually another
lie _ that last one.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep that in mind, whatever Grant says. You may not be able to
see the grin in print, but most of the time, it's there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' and the recent ``Notting Hill'' mark
Grant's return to romantic comedy after four years. In fact, except
for the flop drama ``Extreme Measures,'' Grant had not made a new
film since 1995, when he was arrested in Los Angeles for lewd
behavior with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Grant had plenty of acting offers after that incident, he says,
but he just couldn't find a script he liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got a bit too picky,'' Grant says. ``I mean, I'm not
the world's most enthusiastic actor anyway. I've never been one of
those people who thinks I have to be out there acting, otherwise
I'd die. In fact, I'm quite delighted when I'm not acting.''
</P>
<P>
   With only the slightest prodding, Grant admits the arrest also
affected his decision not to make more films for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in no hurry to go back out there,'' he says.
``Careerwise, I don't think it affected me that badly, because I
was offered `101 Dalmations' the very next week. (He turned it
down.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But in terms of me being even less inclined to be in the
public eye, I think that may account for one of the reasons I took
so much time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reluctance to be in the limelight, Grant is working
hard promoting ``Mickey Blue Eyes.'' For one thing, he produced it
(although he declined a screen credit) along with Hurley, through
their own company, Simian Films. More important, this film is an
important comeback for Grant after his long absence.
</P>
<P>
   True, ``Notting Hill'' made more than $240 million worldwide,
but Grant is not taking credit, since the movie co-starred Julia
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, she could do a romantic comedy with Mussolini and the
script could be written by my mother, and $35 million would change
hands the first weekend,'' Grant says. ``It kind of detracts from
any contribution one might make to the film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' was written by Richard Curtis, who also wrote
``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' with Grant in mind. He was signed
before Roberts was asked, but he admits it was a relief when she
decided to co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' was shot before ``Notting Hill'' but held
for release to benefit from Notting Hill's expected success.
</P>
<P>
   As Grant tells it, at least today, working with Hurley is a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the kind of nightmare you would imagine working
with your nearest and dearest. It's amazing we still talk to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a combination, the two of us, because she's very,
very opinionated and enthusiastic and just plain terrifying to
people _ which is a very useful characteristic on a film.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrifying? Hurley?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of her wrath. (He pronounces it `roth.') Which has to
be seen to be believed. You've got mobsters trembling at her every
word. I'm much quieter and more affable. Inside I'm seething.''
</P>
<P>
   The British press _ famous for being nasty, especially to Grant
and Hurley _ portrays them as constantly fighting. But they have
been together for 12 years, since long before either was famous.
They met while they were making a Spanish film, ``Rowing With the
Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You find someone you kind of click with,'' Grant says of their
mutual attraction. ``We knew from the outset. We just laughed at
the same things and happened to have read the same books. We had
incredibly similar upbringings. Her father was an ex-soldier, and
her mother was a teacher. My father was an ex-soldier, and my
mother was a teacher. On a number of levels we were exactly the
same. Our tastes in many things,'' he says with a short, private
chuckle, ``were similar. I'm very attracted to naughty girls, and
she had a very, very naughty look in her eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's pet name for Grant is Monkey Boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please!,'' he says, squirming again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, she does call me Monkey Boy. It's quite interesting
because she's been doing that for years and no one can see any
monkeylike features in me. But I think with her it's gone much
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her the other day on a plane, `When someone says
`Hugh,' what do you see?' And this was her serious answer. She
thought about it a long time and said, `I definitely see your face.
And a monkey's body'.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of this is true or not, Grant is almost out of
breath from laughing at the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little stooped chimp,'' he gasps. ``It just
shows the true depth of her insanity, which has never been
sufficiently recognized by the press. She's out of her tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their new home, Grant says he has kept their old
apartment, so he can sneak away to it and sit around drinking beer
and watching sports in his underwear. (When Grant's cell phone
rings, it plays `Take Me Out to the Ball Game.' ``I thought that
was a good American tune,'' he says. ``I've got Scotland the Brave
on my British one.'')
</P>
<P>
   Grant says Hurley would not like to see him watching TV in his
underwear. He, on the other hand, would never complain about her
lying about in her underthings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. That's what all girls should be doing,'' he says with
glee.
</P>
<P>
   With Hurley recognized as one of the most beautiful women on the
planet, does he ever feel the need to stay in shape?
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to do a little exercise recently, because I was
getting old and repellent. But that's for my own vanity, because
I'm quite certain that girls are not really interested in what men
look like. At all. Not even slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant has already shot his next film. He has a leading role in
Woody Allen's unnamed next project. He has been quoted as saying he
plays a villain, but that got him in trouble with the secretive
Allen, so he begs off confirming it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's no secret that he longs to play things that get him
away from his boyish image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put that in the patronizing category _ especially when
you're 38. I'd like to be cool and dangerous and sexy rather than
boyish and lovable.''

   BROOKLYN-BLACK-CULTURE (New York) _ In villages across Africa,
storytelling has long been an integral part of daily life. At
nights, even to this day, people gather in circles in courtyards
illuminated by a full moon and bright stars to hear gripping tales
from wise men and indelible stories from adventurous young men who
have returned to their hamlets from faraway places. This and other
African traditions are being kept alive in Fort Greene, Brooklyn,
which for years has been a mecca for black life but which within
the last three years has experienced an extraordinary burst of
cultural energy. The 135-year-old Brooklyn Academy of Music, which
has made its name as a center for cutting-edge arts programs like
the Next Wave Festival, has reached out to the surrounding
neighborhood with programs on black culture. By Garry
Pierre-Pierre.

   BOSTON-SARGENT (Boston, Mass.) _ Boston is in a tizzy over
Sargent this summer. A traveling retrospective, ``John Singer
Sargent,'' already seen in Washington and London, is making its
final stop at the Museum of Fine Arts, and three smaller shows are
on view elsewhere. Even enthusiastic natives are finding it all a
bit much. By Holland Cotter.

<P>
   SHELBURNE-FARMS (Shelburne, Vt.) _ I had been enumerating the
glories of the Inn at Shelburne Farms, a country estate on the
banks of Lake Champlain, practically since the day my friend Nate
and I had met, and now, on a summer evening three years later, we
were finally on our way, driving through the Green Mountains. We
turned onto the long, winding gravel road that marks the beginning
of the estate, at the southern end of Champlain, seven miles
outside Burlington. But as we left behind Route 7, with its
dispiriting artificial lights, fast-food outlets and strip malls,
we found the countryside illuminated by a full moon: the lake on
one side; pastures, woodlands and huge barns on the other. In the
distance, rising above a grassy hill, just as I remembered it, was
the rambling, Queen Anne-style, stone and red-brick building, with
its turrets, towers and 13 chimneys. Inside the curved and
diamond-shaped windows, the lights glowed. Nate reacted on cue:
``Wow.'' By Sara Rimer.

TUNE IN FOR FUN WITH `EDTV' COMEDY 

</HEADLINE>

   `EDTV' &QL;

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 1999, PG-13, Universal, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $34.98
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds like ``The Truman Show.'' But ``EDtv'' is
different _ and better.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey is Ed, an affable, scrappy guy getting by in
San Francisco, where his dysfunctional family also lives.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the blue, Ed is chosen to star in a 24-hour, reality-TV
show that will follow his life _ which is more interesting,
humorous and romantic than many soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely hit show comes with a price: Ed's budding romance
with Sherry (Jenna Elfman) suffers in the glare, and his family's
skeletons start clattering from the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv's'' concept is closer to Albert Brooks' 1979 film ``Real
Life'' than to ``Truman,'' in large part because Ed knows he's on
camera and often plays to it. But director Ron Howard and a fine
cast add new dimensions to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey and Elfman make a terrific couple, and Ellen
DeGeneres and Rob Reiner stand out as combative TV execs.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson puts his annoying nature to good use as Ed's
annoying brother. But Elizabeth Hurley, still more model than
actress, is irritating as a model (who wants to be an actress) who
seduces Ed.
</P>
<P>
   But that's minor static on ``EDtv's'' screen. It may sound
overly familiar, but this film is fun, full-bodied entertainment
that's worth tuning in. Disregard the overrated ``Truman'' and give
Ed a chance.

   An unsung winner, this works as a period piece, as a comedy and

</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo, Paul Rudd, Christina Ricci, Jay Mohr, Kate
Hudson, Dave Chappelle, and Ben and Casey Affleck are among the
young people trolling Manhattan for parties, sex and sensation with
varying degrees of success and desperation on New Year's Eve 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are sympathetic, the situations ring true, and
the almost nonstop music should give you a new appreciation of '80s
pop-rock. Heck, even the dated fashions have a certain pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, this film has an infectious affection for its
characters for all their faults. Think ``American Graffiti'' 20
years later and ask, ``Where were you in '82?''

   Robert De Niro can play gangsters in his sleep, but he's no
comedian, and his crass belligerence bogs down a cute premise about
a mobster (De Niro) hiring a shrink (Billy Crystal) to cure his
unseemly fearfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Needlessly bullying and violent, De Niro takes over Crystal's
life just as Crystal is nearing the altar with Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   The film's mob menace is heavy-handed and all too real,
especially when sinister rival Chaz Palminteri enters the picture.
</P>

   Too many murderers and ruthless criminals _ not enough of
Crystal's haplessness.

 SANDWORMS AND GUERILLAS: RESURRECTING SCI-FI'S CLASSIC `DUNE'

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., AUG. 23, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of co-writers
Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Revisit the ``Dune'' universe.
 &HT;    On a desert planet thousands of years in the future, where giant
sandworms provide the spice of life, the House Atreides faces off
against the forces of House Harkonnen.
 &HT;    The classic science-fiction saga ``Dune'', with its rich mix of
quasi-religious space adventure, guerilla combat and ecology, lay
dormant for years after the death of its creator, Frank Herbert.
 &HT;    While Herbert's son Brian, an author in his own right, had long
suppressed the temptation to recreate the wildly popular series,
Kevin J. Anderson, a prolific sci-fi author, yearned to pick up
where the elder Herbert had left off.
 &HT;    The two made first contact in January 1997. They swapped
concerns and ideas during several conversations.
 &HT;    ``Kevin and I are `Dune' fans and we knew `Dune' was sacred
ground,'' Herbert says by telephone from his home in Washington
state. ``We had to be very careful. We wanted to nurture the seeds
Dad had already planted and not disturb what was already there.''
 &HT;    Anderson suggested dipping back to the period just before the
events of ``Dune.''
 &HT;    Herbert imagined a ``Dune'' sequel set 10,000 years after
``Chapterhouse,'' the sixth and last ``Dune'' novel by Frank
Herbert, who died in 1986,
 &HT;    Herbert bought into Anderson's notion and they began in earnest,
bolstered by Herbert's access to his father's extensive notes and a
stroke of luck: weeks into the process, computer disks hand-labeled
``Dune 7'' by Frank Herbert were discovered in a safe deposit box.
They provided the younger Herbert and Anderson with even more
thematic material and guidance.
 &HT;    The authors assigned themselves individual chapters based on
personal interests and individual writing strengths, then sent
disks back and forth. Herbert reworked Anderson's text and vice
versa.
 &HT;    And so it went until their two distinct voices became one _ and
echoed Frank Herbert's.
 &HT;    The result is ``Dune: House Atreides'' (Bantam Books; $27.50),
the fall's most hotly anticipated sci-fi title and, arguably, the
season's most anticipated novel of any kind.
 &HT;    Talk about pressure. -----
 &HT;    ``I think `Dune' fans will have high expectations,'' says
Anderson by telephone from his home in the Rocky Mountains, near
Denver.
 &HT;    He and Herbert are on the line together via conference call.
 &HT;    ``But the pressure the fans are putting on us cannot even come
close to the pressure Brian and I are putting on each other and on
ourselves ... `Dune' is my favorite sci-fi book of all time and
it's such a legacy for Brian,'' Anderson says.
 &HT;    Anyone who read ``Dune'' knows it's not a ``start and finish''
book. Herbert devised an entire universe and the first novel barely
scratched the surface. ``House Atreides,'' part one of a planned
trilogy, builds upon the ``Dune'' history by setting that history
in motion.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to go back to the core ideas, subjects and
characters, to the elements everyone fell in love with in the first
place,'' Anderson says.
 &HT;    Thus, ``House Atreides'' introduces readers to younger versions
of Baron Harkonnen, planetologist Pardot Kynes, Master of Assassins
Thufir Hawat and Leto Atreides.
 &HT;    It whisks readers back to Arrakis and weaves fresh tales of the
spice, the melange.
 &HT;    Herbert and Anderson had their respective preferences.
 &HT;    ``Pardot Kynes is a fascinating character, and exploring Leto
was fascinating to me,'' Herbert says.
 &HT;    ``He's a man of honor who's not always accessible to Jessica.
And he's (`Dune' hero) Paul's father, so there will be complex
interactions between Leto and Paul, which I can relate to because
my father was so complex.''
 &HT;    ``The villains were a lot of fun, too,'' Anderson says. ``We
spend a lot of time with Baron Harkonnen and his nephew, Beast
Rabban. We really tried to flesh them out.''
 &HT;    Though both Herbert and Anderson are busy with various solo
projects, ``Dune'' will be a part of their lives for eons. They're
currently writing ``House Harkonnen,'' due out in October 2000,
tossing around ideas for book three, due out in October 2001, and
contemplating penning as many as 10 ``Dune'' novels, including
``Dune 7.''
 &HT;    All of the novels, the writers insist, will benefit from Frank
Herbert's notes and research, as well as from the 40,000 words of
ecologically-themed storytelling Herbert excised from ``Dune'' for
fear of ``preaching'' to readers.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, there are naysayers who argue ``Dune'' died along
with Herbert and that reviving the saga is heresy.
 &HT;    ``Again, `Dune' is sacred ground and I didn't want to do this in
a cavalier fashion,'' Brian Herbert says. ``As far as misusing the
property, the way I see it is that Dad created a family business
and I'm carrying on the tradition.''
 &HT;    Anderson says the resurrection of ``Dune'' could entice novices
to pick up the original series.
 &HT;    ``What we're doing by calling attention again to `Dune' is
bringing in new readers. A lot of people saw the (1984) movie and
never read the book, and we may convince people to read Frank
Herbert's work.
 &HT;    ``We're also giving something new to the millions of Frank
Herbert fans who kept `Dune' and the `Dune' universe alive for 35
years. What we're doing in no way diminishes from what Frank
Herbert created, and we hope we're adding to it.''

BOY MEETS BOY, AND THE REST IS REDUNDANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Trick'' is tricky. On the one hand, this gay romantic comedy
about two guys falling in love as they attempt to have a one-night
stand is sweet and amusing. On the other hand, it's kinda ordinary.
The odd thing is, the ordinariness works for it as well as against
it.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows a night in the life of Gabriel (Christian
Campbell, Neve's brother), a young, shy, frustrated musical writer
so fresh-faced that he could give Howdy Doody a run for his money.
Although Gabriel acts like he's comfortable with his sexuality, he
acknowledges that he has never felt quite like he fits in with the
gay scene _ but that doesn't stop him from visiting a few clubs. In
one, he meets Mark (John Paul Pitoc), a go-go boy with whom Gabriel
eventually pursues romance after a later encounter on a subway.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, things keep getting in the way of this liaison. Or,
more accurately, people get in the way: Gabriel's straight roommate
is too selfish to give up the apartment for the night. Gabe's best
friend (Tori Spelling) is a whiny actress with a clinging tendency
(and yes, she and Gabe used to date before he came out). A drag
queen (Clinton Leupp, humorously dolled up as Spelling) spreads
nasty rumors about Mark. And for some reason, Mark doesn't want to
go to his own place. We don't learn the reason till late in the
film, because if we learned it early, well, we'd have no film. Of
course, if these guys just checked into a motel, we'd have no film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trick'' appears to be advancing the cause of ``mainstreaming''
gay films, because it tells its story casually, without trying to
make any strident points, just like a straight-oriented movie
would. In fact, it tells it with more charm and subtlety (it's like
a much less raucous and crass ``Booty Call''). It's good to see a
movie showing gays and straights getting along together, but
``Trick'' still portrays its straight characters as irritating
and/or buffoonish (although Spelling and Dallas' Lorri Bagley, as
the roommate's helium-voiced but common-sensical girlfriend, score
a couple of affecting moments).
</P>
<P>
   But if this were a boy-meets-girl story instead of a
boy-meets-boy story, would anyone care? Campbell's presence helps
immensely _ his boyish looks belie a performance that finds depth
in Gabriel's questing and confusion. Pitoc is also good as the stud
with a sensitive heart, and Stephen Hayes is amusing as an
emotional friend of Gabriel's. But their performances and Jim
Fall's pleasantly sympathetic direction, which favors mellow wit
over chaos, hide the fact that we've seen this story way too many
times before. Just because the orientation is switched doesn't make
it anything new.

A PAINFUL LIFE, BEAUTIFULLY FILMED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not every movie set in the '70s has a cast lifted from
Entertainment Weekly's list of hot young actors, peeking through
bad shag wigs and coping with the angst of being different, man!
``Xiu Xiu, the Sent Down Girl'' _ the directing debut of actress
Joan Chen (''The Last Emperor'') _ reflects another kind of exile.
It's the story of a teen-aged girl in China, the smart, curious and
free-thinking Xiu Xiu (Lu Lu), who's shipped off to the countryside
_ sent down _ for Communist indoctrination. And, in a low-key way,
it has an almost painful directness. The dialogue tends to point
things out, as if it were actually written by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that bent _ and sometimes in spite of it _ ``Xiu
Xiu'' is moving. It's a standard story of a kid trying to figure
out her place in the world, but it's also a blunt depiction of a
young person undergoing oppression. It's crude and powerful; Lu
Lu's enormous camera presence gives the movie an extra fillip of
pain, as she starts to realize exactly what it will take to get out
of the Tibetan outpost to which she's been exiled. Her girlish
innocence is compromised as she has to trade sex for the
possibility of freedom. Meanwhile, the cold herdsman (Lopsang) to
whom she was apprenticed and who first loomed as a sexual threat _
it's made clear why he is not _ becomes more sympathetic as it
becomes obvious that there's nothing he can do.
</P>
<P>
   Chen surrendered narrative complexity for a methodical depiction
of hope getting crushed. Shot with breathtaking and unspoiled
natural beauty as a backdrop, the movie thus takes on a fuller
poignancy. Perhaps the psychological primitivism can be explained
by the fact that Chen and her team shot the film on the run in
Tibet, without official permission from the Chinese government. As
a result, the Shanghai native was denounced and banned from filming
again in China. Despite its occasional crassness, ``Xiu Xiu'' is
worth the risk she took. Lu Lu's broken spirit stays with you, as
does Chen's burgeoning talent. She has an instinct for using
actors' faces for their strength and honesty.

SCOUTS MAY RECONSIDER POLICY ON HOMOSEXUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even as it prepares to defend its anti-gay
policies in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Boy Scouts of America is
quietly considering a study into what causes homosexuality and
whether it should change its 89-year-old practice of excluding
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that increasing legal and public attacks on the
organization's anti-gay stance is hurting the image of scouting,
the BSA relationships committee will consider in October whether to
launch the year-long study.
</P>
<P>
   The study was proposed by the Minnesota Boy Scout council at the
Scouts' national council meeting in San Diego in May.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution called for the BSA National Council's executive
board to establish ``a representative commission to examine the
relevance and appropriateness of the present membership
requirements'' and to review ``the scientific and medical basis for
the determination of sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Further delay in addressing this issue may result in the
diminution of scouting's leadership as one of the nation's most
effective character-building programs for youth,'' the resolution
said in part.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also advised that if the BSA itself fails to act,
decisions on membership standards ``may ultimately be dictated by
the courts or by the most powerful or most vocal among BSA's
constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive board, led by Council President Edward E. Whitacre
Jr., will review the committee's findings next spring and decide
whether to discard or affirm scouting's anti-gay position.
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre is chairman and chief executive of San Antonio-based
SBC Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not embarked on a study of homosexuality,'' Gregg
Shields, spokesman for the BSA national headquarters in Irving,
Texas, said Wednesday. ``This was a resolution that was read at the
national meeting. ... The resolution was forwarded to committee and
that's where it stands today. The board has not taken any vote on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed study would come as the controversy over the
organization's anti-gay practices and legal challenges to them.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court two weeks ago unanimously ruled
against the Scouts for dismissing Eagle Scout-turned-scoutmaster
James Dale after discovering he was gay. The Scouts plan to appeal
the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Chicago judge ordered the Boy Scouts to stop
barring gay applicants in hiring decisions.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Yawgoog in Rhode Island, one of the nation's premier
Scout camps, a scoutmaster was kicked out after using Dale's
photograph for target practice on the camp's rifle range. Shields
said the scoutmaster ``has been removed from the camp and his
future in scouting is to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts also refused to give a gay Eagle Scout his summer job
back at the camp, but relented when the teen-ager filed a complaint
with the Rhode Island Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The study, if approved by the Boy Scouts, would focus on three
issues: the moral and religious basis for defining homosexuality as
a moral issue; the scientific and medical basis for the
determination of sexual orientation and its effect on youths in
dealing with their own sexuality; and the consequences of current
policies, such as the loss of financial support from United Way,
public schools and other sponsors and contributors.
</P>
<P>
   If definitive, the study would go to the core of the Scouts'
long-held belief that the ``morally straight'' requirement in the
Boy Scout oath means a Scout can't be gay. But the resolution
conceded that many in the scouting community view the morally
straight requirement to refer to behavior, not sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way the organization lands, it will offend key
supporters on one side or another.
</P>
<P>
   The explanatory statement accompanying the BSA resolution
outlined the organization's quandary: ``The chartering
organizations of traditional BSA programs are a broad and diverse
group. Many are religious institutions that proscribe homosexual
orientation as immoral. Others proscribe homosexual conduct as
immoral. Still others accept homosexual orientation as an existent
condition within the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many traditional chartered organizations, religious and
secular, advocate maintaining existing requirements as do many
parents of Scouting youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a real effort to redefine (membership requirements)
in terms of up-to-date scientific knowledge (and) the real
religious understandings of the issue, then I think it's going to
be a good thing,'' said Dave Rice, of Petaluma, Calif., who is the
president of Scouting for All, an advocacy group for more inclusive
membership policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a very good thing. But if it's just a whitewash
where the Boy Scouts have predetermined what the outcome will be,
then we're nowhere.''

bright-eyed, germ-free and ready to ace every course.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a ridiculous scenario. It could happen to you, Dad
and Mom.
</P>
<P>
   But first hear this (again): Children see and copy your eating
habits. Maybe they don't babble before a daybreak jolt of caffeine.
But they see you tear off without breakfast. They eye you avoiding
broccoli and adding the second scoop of Vanilla Bean Vanilla to the
peach cobbler. They know everything on your plate is fried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat your breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Dad didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   So, behave.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to your dreams, food is not broken into the two food
groups of chocolate and not chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   The main basic food groups are: breads, cereal, rice and pasta;
vegetables; fruits; milk, yogurt and cheese; and meat and other
protein sources, including poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs and nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Basic guidelines for school children, according to Joy Bauer in
``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Total Nutrition'' (Alpha, $18.95),
are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Six or more servings per day from the bread and grain group.
These provide carbohydrates, B-vitamins and iron. One serving
equals 1 slice bread, 3/4 cup cereal, 1/2 cup cooked rice or pasta,
or half a small bagel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three or more servings of vegetables for Vitamin C, vitamin A,
folic acid, magnesium and fiber. One serving equals 1/2 cup cooked
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two or more servings of fruit for vitamin C, vitamin A,
potassium and fiber. One serving would be 1 small piece of fruit, 1
cup berries, 3/4 cup fruit juice or 1/4 cup dried fruit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three or more servings from the milk group for calcium,
riboflavin and protein. Until age 24, young folks are growing
strong, healthy bones that will last them a lifetime. Boys and
girls ages 9-13 need 1,300 milligrams of calcium daily. One cup of
skim or 2 percent milk or of calcium-fortified orange juice has 300
milligrams; 1 ounce of Monterey Jack cheese has 212 milligrams; 1/2
cup ice cream has 88 milligrams. One serving is 1 cup of milk or
yogurt, or about 2 ounces of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two servings from the meat group for protein, B-vitamins, iron
and zinc. One serving is 2 to 3 ounces cooked lean meat or poultry,
1 egg, 2 tablespoons peanut butter or 1/2 cup cooked beans.
</P>
<P>
   The family cook and lunch maker can divide the servings in any
way. But notice how difficult it would be if your student skipped
breakfast and ate 1 slice of pepperoni pizza with a soda for lunch.
Dinner would need to consist of 2 fruits, more than 3 glasses of
milk, 1 egg, 1 piece of chicken, 2 1/2 cups pasta and 2 cups
spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Make breakfast count.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Worst Things To Do With Breakfast, according to
Virginia Van Vynckt in ``Feed Your Kids Right'' (Macmillan,
$12.95), are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Skip it. Your kids will be hungry and distracted by
midmorning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Define it as a doughnut and soft drink. That's sure to induce
midmorning ``crash.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Confine it to nothing but eggs, cereal and toast. Come on, be
creative.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests these inventive alternatives: rice cakes and
yogurt; leftover noodles reheated in the microwave and tossed with
a little cottage cheese and some pineapple chunks; a bagel with
peanut butter; or a frozen whole-grain waffle with fruit and a
small slice of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as long as we're nagging: Turn off that TV and get some
exercise.

STUDY NOTES HUGE GAP IN PAY, EDUCATION FOR HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Refiling to fix slug)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The wages of Hispanic workers in California lag
far behind those of other ethnic groups, and a corresponding lack
of education is the main culprit, according to a report done for
state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   With a median income of $14,560 per year, Hispanics make about
$8,000 less than the next-lowest group, blacks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the wages of Hispanics, who will make up the state's
largest group of workers by 2025, will mean big dividends for
California, said state Senate Majority Leader Richard G. Polanco, a
Democrat from Los Angeles, who requested the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are able to realize a long-term goal of raising the
level of educational attainment of Latinos to that of non-Latinos,
the result would be $28 billion in increased earnings circulating
in our economy,'' Polanco said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics comprise 28 percent of the 15.6 million workers in the
state and their numbers are growing daily. ``The earnings and the
tax base that they represent, therefore, are vital to the state's
economy,'' the authors of the report wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the California Research Bureau, an
office of the state library, was presented to the Senate Education
Committee, the Latino Legislative Caucus and the Hispanic
Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor in the relatively low earnings of Hispanic
workers is education, said Elias Lopez, one of the authors of the
report that was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, which was based in part on a U.S. Census
Bureau survey of 13,000 Californians in March 1998, more than 45
percent of Hispanic workers do not have a high school diploma, and
41 percent have only a high school diploma. Just 8 percent have a
bachelor's degree or higher.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, 33 percent of white workers have a bachelor's
degree or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is we've provided Latinos with prison
opportunities rather than educational opportunities,'' said Robert
Gnaizda, policy director for the Greenlining Institute, a public
policy and advocacy center based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prison system has eaten up a huge amount of discretionary
money that could have gone to the expansion of higher education,''
said Gnaizda, who was not involved in the study. Since the early
1980s, California has built 23 prisons and no new universities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of education is not limited to recent immigrants, but
persists even for third-generation Hispanics, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors recommend that California:
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to increase the numbers of Hispanic students who graduate
from high school and enroll in a four-year university.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage Hispanics currently in the work force to further
their educations.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Becerril, a member of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, said the study was ``hardly a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues of low wages and dropout rates have been pointed
out over and over again,'' she said. ``There is a growing gap
between Latino families and other groups. It's an issue that should
be of concern, not just for Latinos, but for all Californians. It
will have an impact on the future of the quality of all our
lives.''

`PERFECT BLUE': THIS CARTOON DIDN'T COME FROM DISNEY  
 (PRODUCTION NOTES AT END) 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mima is a wide-eyed, chirpy-voiced young woman with ambition. It
isn't enough that she's one-third of a fabulously successful
Japanese Spice Girls-like pop music group, Cham, whose members
bounce around the concert stage in pink dresses with huge bows in
the back and long white gloves. Mima is leaving Cham to begin an
acting career, and her story is ``Perfect Blue,'' a peculiar
example of Japanese animation _ realistic drawing, childish voice,
flashes of narrative skill.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things moviegoers will notice about Mima is
that she is either not very bright or she has been extremely out of
touch while becoming a music star. Someone actually has to explain
to her what the Internet is (which is why it's only now that she
discovers a worrisome Web site devoted to her). And as she prepares
to do a rape scene in her first acting role, on a television soap
opera, she observes, ``It's not as if they're really going to rape
me or anything.'' But maybe it's not Mima; maybe ``Perfect Blue''
is made for violence-happy 6-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble begins when Mima goes home after her final concert
with Cham. She receives a weird letter that says ``I love looking
at Mima's room,'' a telephone call from a heavy breather and a fax
that calls her a traitor. The next evening, after her first day on
the movie set, she gets home to find that all the fish in her
aquarium are dead and that her reflection _ some manifestation of
an alter ego? _ is talking to her. What the reflection says is
priceless: ``You're no longer a pop idol,'' it accuses. ``You're a
filthy woman now, like a slut. No one likes a pop idol with a
tarnished reputation.'' (They don't?) Then the alter ego emerges
into the room, floats across it and goes out the window. The alter
ego also giggles a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The plot goes on to involve a deranged young man who looks like
Michael Jackson with bad teeth, a truck accident, a murder by a
pizza delivery man and a diagnosis of dissociative personality
disorder. But it may be that none of this is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Blue'' eventually turns into a very interesting play
on levels and perceptions of reality. Before that, it includes
profanity, stabbing, strangling, hitting, lots of animated blood
and some animated nudity. With smarter dialogue, it might have made
a fascinating film.
</P>

HEARING VOICE IN YOUR HEAD NOT SO BAD IF IT'S PLEASANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Could it be true?
</P>
<P>
   Was I really hearing voices? I was dialing my friend Robert's
phone number when I heard it the first time. It was a woman's
voice, slow, low, and barely audible, even though I was alone.
</P>
<P>
   But just as soon as it started, the voice suddenly stopped, and
I kind of forgot about it when Robert picked up. He was the only
person I know who could get me out of my computer mess. He is so
technologically capable that he once built a kitchen clock out of
Nixie tubes. I didn't know what they were, either, but to me, that
just proves how smart he is.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard urban legends in which people buy a computer, take it
out of the box, plug it in and it actually works.
</P>
<P>
   Things like that just do not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not to me.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way things work in my world. I'm never surprised
when I buy something new, I plug it in and it shorts out my
electricity, is missing a part or suddenly bursts into flames and
melts other appliances around it as well.
</P>
<P>
   So, really, how could I have been shocked when I unpacked my new
computer and spent four hours setting it up, only to discover that
as a couple, we were not hitting it off?
</P>
<P>
   It stared at me with a blank screen, hummed a little, and then
gently eased back into its technology coma. That's when I got up
and called Robert.
</P>
<P>
   He heard my cry and was at my door in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes,'' he said, probing and poking where all the wires are
attached to the monitor. ``I can see the problem here. At this
point, you have two alternatives: Send the computer back, or learn
how to push the monitor's ON button.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I settled down and went to work. I tried to print,
only to have my happy new computer inform me that it was going to
be utterly, utterly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the kitchen dialing Robert's number when I heard her _
the Voice _ speak to me again.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped and tried to make out the words, but I could only
understand one: ``serve.''
</P>
<P>
   This is impossible, I thought. There has to be an explanation
for this, a rational one like my dog yawning, or maybe she has some
bad gas.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour, Robert was poking at the wires again when he
mentioned, ``The printer only works when you plug it into the hard
drive. You plugged the printer back into itself. It's not a worm,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later that night, I was getting ready for bed. As I brushed
my teeth, the Voice came to me again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning,'' she said to me in a mumble I could barely
understand. ``Serve the apple!''
</P>
<P>
   This time, I totally freaked out. Oh my God, I thought to
myself. Am I going crazy? Serve the apple? Is this like Son of Sam,
but only with a fruit? Son of Red Delicious? Am I possessed? Am I
going to start killing people on the advice from a member of one of
the four basic food groups?
</P>
<P>
   Then I heard her speak again: ``Serve the apple. Respond.''
</P>
<P>
   I was NOT imagining it. I HEARD it.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't sleep at all that night. I didn't understand what the
Voice wanted me to do. I decided that the Voice wasn't nasty, so it
probably wasn't a demon, and because it was a lady's voice, I
deduced that it probably had to be the Virgin Mary. I also decided
it would be smart not to say anything because I saw what happened
when someone thought they saw Jesus' face on a dirty wall someplace
near Nogales. People flocked from all around and they brought
tents. The last thing I needed was a yard full of people yelling
for me to heal them and asking to use my bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I felt kinda holy. I felt chosen, and I was
excited about what the Mother of God had to say to me next, unless
it was, ``You could be so pretty if you just lost some weight.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as usual, as soon as I sat down to work, my computer
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert,'' I said into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be right there,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Then I looked at the computer, and I got really mad. Nothing
works for me. Nothing, ever. It was really unfair. Stupid thing! I
hate it. I hate it. I HATE IT.
</P>
<P>
   And, before I even knew what I was doing, I had reached out and
smacked the screen with my very own hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not very saintly,'' a nosy-body voice in my head said.
``I'm telling the Virgin Mary!''
</P>
<P>
   When Robert arrived, he looked curiously at the computer and
then at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been hurting this computer?'' he asked me, point
blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' I replied. ``No, I haven't been hurting it! It's been
hurting me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I suspected a while ago that something wasn't right
here,'' he said sharply. ``You had all of these problems with it,
and I'd come over and fix them every time. But now, I see your hand
print on the screen, and you know what I think? I think you like
the attention you get when your computer's broken. In fact, I think
you break it on purpose. And that hand print is the proof I've been
waiting for!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert . . .'' I started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no!'' he said standing up. ``You're sick! It's Munchausen
syndrome by proxy, I've seen your kind before! I'm calling CPS!
Computer Protective Services, you foul abuser!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert, that is ridiculous!'' I said adamantly, stamping my
foot. ``Do you think the Virgin Mary would talk to someone that
abuses her very own computer? I'm holy! I'm going to be serving the
holy apple, or something like that. She told me herself!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving the apple? With the Virgin Mother?'' Robert said,
unbelievingly. ``So what's she look like? Hmmm?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen her,'' I stammered. ``But I hear her all the
time!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah?'' he said, staring at me. ``Does she sound like. .
.this?''
</P>
<P>
   And then he reached over, pushed three keys.
</P>
<P>
   A voice suddenly popped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning! The server is not connected to the Apple remote
access and does not respond,'' my computer said in a lady's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God,'' I said. ``I hit the Virgin Mary!'' &QL;

STUDIES DEBUNK COFFEE AS HEALTH RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It may be the most coveted herb in the world. And the
most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   For millions, coffee is a godsend. It's the slammin',
eye-poppin' slap-in-the-face beverage that launches us on our day.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors claim that coffee's caffeine is a stimulant no one
really needs and may be responsible for everything from infertility
and heart attacks to stomach ulcers and fibrocystic breast disease.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that coffee is a complex liquid, and how it affects
our health is still being looked into. However, based on the most
recent round of studies, it appears that drinking moderate amounts
of coffee _ two to three cups a day _ does little harm and may
actually provide health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the evidence now shows that coffee isn't going
to cause you serious health problems unless you're into excessive
consumption (eight to 10 cups a day),'' said Shirley Strembel,
registered dietitian and public-health nutritionist for Maricopa
County.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hoelscher Day, University of Arizona extension agent in
family consumer sciences, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent research has not found too many problems,'' Hoelscher
Day said. ``At Harvard, for instance, they found that women who
drink six or more cups of coffee a day weren't any more likely to
have heart attacks than women who didn't drink six cups.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for 64-year-old Meg Paige of Phoenix who said
she's been drinking 15 cups of coffee a day since she was
introduced to the stuff as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink even more in the winter,'' Paige said, adding that she
has had absolutely no health problems from coffee, which she drinks
black. She claims that it doesn't even keep her up at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the only thing I drink except for a little water,''
Paige said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anita Murcko of Phoenix is a specialist in internal
medicine. Murcko said she ``really enjoys'' coffee but consumes
only a modest two to three cups a day. Murcko said another Harvard
study published in the ``Journal of the American Medical
Association'' shows that coffee helps prevent gallstones and
symptomatic gallbladder disease in men.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released this year, took place over a 10-year period
and involved 46,000 men ages 40 to 75 with no prior history of
gallstone disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone really knows what it is in the coffee vs.
caffeine in general that makes the difference,'' Murcko said, ``but
this appears to be a very good study.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there's also growing evidence that coffee may reduce
the risk of cirrhosis of the liver among heavy drinkers of alcohol,
improve short-term memory, postpone muscle fatigue and protect
against free-radical damage to tissues.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted at the University of California at Davis found
that coffee has more antioxidant activity than red wine, green or
black tea, or orange juice. Researchers there led by Takayuki
Shibamoto announced in February that just smelling freshly brewed
coffee can make you healthier. They concluded that the aroma of
coffee contains about 300 antioxidants and that the smell of
regular or decaffeinated gives you the same benefit as eating three
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   There's also something to the long-prescribed home remedy that
coffee can sometimes alleviate the symptoms of asthma. That's
because coffee contains caffeine-related compounds, called
theophyllines, that help with asthma relief. But Murcko said, ``You
have to drink a lot of coffee to benefit from this, and it's a very
mild effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Claims that coffee promotes the effectiveness of certain
migraine drugs may or may not be valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows if that is because caffeine withdrawal is
contributing to the migraine,'' Murcko said.
</P>
<P>
   But what's of particular interest to scientists is why coffee
does what we all know it does: increase alertness and prolong
waking hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's a stimulant,'' Murcko said. ``It probably
enhances release of excitatory transmitters in your brain that
allows you to be more alert.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Now the bad news
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Of course, not all the news is good. Coffee does pose health risks.
It most definitely can promote insomnia, anxiety, irritability,
heartburn and indigestion. But one of the risks that concerns
Murcko most is the link between coffee and osteoporosis in
menopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said menopausal women require at least 600 milligrams of
calcium per day. If they don't get that much and are heavy coffee
drinkers, caffeine they ingest can impair the absorption of calcium
and contribute to osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, coffee has also been linked to heart disease,
fibrocystic breast disease, stomach ulcers, and pancreatic and
colorectal cancer. However, more recent studies seem to exonerate
coffee in connection with these issues. Physicians such as Murcko
are still cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practicing, I've had women with fibrocystic breast disease
tell me that when they reduce their caffeine intake, they feel
better,'' Murcko said. ``So even though the current studies don't
show it, I do make the recommendation of less caffeine for these
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said there's only a slight risk that coffee increases
blood pressure and generally only in people who already have
hypertension. In fact, Israeli scientists at Tel Hashomer Hospital
in Tel Aviv have shown that in people over 50 with mild or moderate
hypertension, caffeine raises blood pressure for several hours
after a coffee break, according to a brief in this month's issue of
``Health'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some health authorities remain concerned about the potential
effects of coffee drinking on heart disease and think that coffee
may increase blood levels of homocysteines, an amino acid
associated with heart disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said the idea of caffeine raising homocysteine levels and
increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease ``is a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also some evidence that compounds in coffee increase
cholesterol levels. But, according to a 1997 ``Mayo Clinic Health
Letter,'' these compounds aren't found in filtered or instant
coffee, which most Americans drink. These compounds are found in
espresso or boiled coffee, which isn't filtered.

   Strembel said that if your cholesterol is a concern, drink
filtered coffee and not unfiltered types. &QL;

Murcko said studies have not conclusively shown that caffeine
reduces fertility in women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the studies about reproductive health in women and
coffee have been made more difficult because women who drink a lot
of coffee also seem to smoke,'' Murcko said.
</P>
<P>
   Strembel said that if you're pregnant, you may want to check
with your doctor on the risks of caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen conflicting reports on whether or not there is any
relationship between caffeine and spontaneous abortion,'' Strembel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoelscher Day said a study published in Tufts University's
``Health &AMP; Research Letter'' has lifted a dark cloud from coffee's
long reputation as a dehydrating substance. Like most diuretics, it
was believed that coffee initiated excessive water loss through
increased urination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're exercising a lot, water or sports drinks are the
best way to rehydrate,'' Hoelscher Day said. ``But coffee
rehydrates, too. You don't lose all that much water from drinking
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionally, Strembel said coffee is a lightweight unless milk
is added. Strembel said 6 ounces of brewed coffee contains lots of
water, four calories, 0.1 gram of carbohydrate and 0.1 gram of
protein.
</P>
<P>
   As for caffeine concentration, the ``Washington Post'' reports
that coffee ranks high but is followed closely by other popular
drinks. For example, the amount of caffeine in 8 ounces of brewed
coffee (65-120 mg) and 8 ounces of instant coffee (60-85 mg)
compares with that in: Jolt Cola (12 ounces), 71 mg; Mountain Dew
(12 ounces), 55 mg; Coca-Cola (12 ounces), 45 mg; Pepsi-Cola (12
ounces), 37 mg; and Snapple iced tea (16-ounce bottle), 48 mg.
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said you also have to remember that the smaller the
volume you put the caffeine in, the bigger the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why, with a caffeine pill, you get a jolt pretty
quick,'' she said. ``If you eat a chocolate bar all at once, that
concentrated caffeine is also released fast.''  &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
Dependent on java
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
Technically, coffee is not addictive. However, that's sometimes
hard to believe around hard-core coffee drinkers who refuse to
speak before tossing down that first burst of java in the morning.
Which raises another health question: How good is it for our mental
health to fall into the habit of leaning on caffeine to jump-start
our day?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paula King, a Phoenix psychologist, said there's nothing
wrong with leaning a little on coffee in the morning as a coping
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need ways of managing and feeling like we can function
well in life,'' King said. ``It's when that substance or activity
becomes more important than anything else in life that it becomes a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has had patients tell her that they were obsessed
with caffeine and couldn't function during the day unless they had
a certain amount of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets to that point,'' she said, ``then I would explore
with them new coping mechanisms to move toward well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing everyone seems to agree on is that sensitivity to
coffee's powers varies significantly from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's very important,'' Murcko said. ``Just like
alcohol, there are people who are more sensitive to small amounts.
That same cup or two that brings alertness to some may cause
anxiety and irritability in others.''  &QL;

`NOBODY': OF HERMES, ROLEX AND OH, YES, MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japan's trade balance with the United States is not likely to be
fattened by its export of the literally bloody, figuratively anemic
thriller ``Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody'' adds up to next to nothing, and when its attacks by
arrow, scissors, knife, bullet, broken bottle and fist finally end,
you can almost hear credibility, stretched nearly to the breaking
point, twang as it returns to its reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Nobody'' were a triumph of anything besides barren
imitation, it would be a victory of style over substance, featuring
as it does unsympathetic principal characters whose concerns seem
to run mostly to Hermes ties, Rolex watches and Zippo cigarette
lighters.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, most of the time the film manages to make Tokyo
appear depopulated except during rush hour; gunfights, stabbings
and strangulations in public places never attract the slightest
attention; a character in fear of his life and trailed by a
sinister looking automobile chooses to drive to a deserted
warehouse area; few victims who look dead are entirely dead, and
the hoary, hackneyed ending is likely to leave even the most
tolerant of filmgoers grinding their teeth to stumps in rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' directed by Shundo Okawa, begins as the story of
three well-dressed young men from an advertising agency passing an
evening at a bar. They are the level-headed Taki (Masaya Katoh),
who favors Hermes ties; the big, belligerent Nanbu (Riki Takeuchi),
and the pudgy, bespectacled Konishi (Hideo Nakano). Unfortunately,
when they pass some unflattering remarks about the Rolex watch worn
by one of three other, very similar young men at an adjacent table,
they are overheard.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh words follow and tensions rise, but cooler heads prevail.
The three ad men leave, but when Konishi turns back to retrieve a
forgotten umbrella, he encounters the men from the other table who
beat him and smash his face with a broken bottle.
</P>
<P>
   A few nights later, when the friends encounter one of the
assailants (Rolex) late at night in a deserted passageway, they
subject him to a horrible beating and flee, thinking he may be
dead. From then on, they receive a series of menacing calls.
</P>
<P>
   Who are their enemies? Gangsters? The police? After all, there
has been no report of a death, and no body (has someone made a
pun?) found.
</P>
<P>
   When Konishi is attacked again, stabbed in the stomach with a
pair of scissors in a nightspot, Detective Karaki (Jimpachi Nezu)
of the Shinjuku West police squad enters the case, but Taki and
Nanbu at first reveal nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nanbu is trailed, felled with arrows and shot to death.
Taki, whose romantic life has soured after he betrayed his fiancee
with a woman he picked up one rainy night, is left to try to save
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Fairly late in the going, an effort is made to inject the raging
bloodstream of ``Nobody'' with seriousness when Karaki suggests
that the evildoers represent a new Japan, where punks who years ago
would have become part of its yakuza underworld now become
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   But that thought is soon abandoned. There are guns to be shot,
wounds to be inflicted, villains to be strangled and an effort to
be made to find a way to wrap up this nonsense before the audience
decides to join the bad guys and write finis to a trying day at the
movies.

`TEACHING MRS. TINGLE': EVERYONE GETS AN  ` A ' FOR THE DARK AGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There once was a nasty high school teacher who told Kevin
Williamson he couldn't write, little dreaming that Williamson had
the ``Scream'' movies, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and
``Dawson's Creek'' in his future. As if these weren't hits with
enough of a vengeance, Williamson also dreamed up a story about a
teacher who is tied to her bed by three students and peppered with
taunts like: ``You know, you hide behind your degree. But the
reality is you're jealous of every student you teach!''
</P>
<P>
   In his first screenplay, best described as ``early,'' Williamson
delivered the dramatic equivalent of a mustache scrawled onto this
teacher's portrait. And he created the proudly teen-centric
attitude that would later give him such currency. (Girl, worried
about doing something unethical: ``It's not right.'' Boy,
shrugging: ``What's right any more?'') As for whatever else he
intended, there may someday be enough spare time for a director's
cut of the film that was to be called ``Killing Mrs. Tingle,'' and
has since been bastardized in response to rising high school
violence. Now, as ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' it's the incongruously
toothless version of a sadistic fantasy. Not the easiest mix.
</P>
<P>
   Newly benign, and noticeably clumsier than the hits he has
written, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' Williamson's directorial debut,
relies hard on innocent coincidences. It begins with three high
school heroes in Mrs. Tingle's history class, where the aspiring
actress Jo Lynn (Marisa Coughlan, a strenuously vampy newcomer)
tries to make a point about the Kennedy administration by dressing
up as Marilyn Monroe. Leigh Ann (Katie Holmes) is the good student
working hard to win a scholarship, while Luke (Barry Watson) is the
white-bread rebel; when asked to hand in his history project, he
slaps a stone on Mrs. Tingle's desk and just says ``Plymouth
Rock.'' As for the teacher, she turns her acid tongue on one and
all.
</P>
<P>
   But by the purely accidental happenstance that has been
shoehorned into this story, the three students wind up with an
advance copy of Mrs. T's final exam. Not wanting to be caught
cheating, they make a house call. Meanwhile, one of the history
projects Mrs. Tingle took home with her happens to be a working
crossbow. Presto! It isn't long before one of those unexpected
crossbow accidents causes the teacher to injure herself through no
fault of the students, and they are forced to strap her wrists to
the bedposts.
</P>
<P>
   (What choice do they have? ``She'll press charges. Maybe we
should just finish her.'')
</P>
<P>
   Showing a rare sign of the tongue-in-cheek movie awareness that
worked for ``Scream,'' the film turns this into an occasion for Ms.
Coughlan's full-throttle ``Exorcist'' imitation of Linda Blair
thrashing and shrieking her way through demonic possession. (``You
know, she kind of looks like that movie. The demon chick that
upchucks over everything.'')
</P>
<P>
   Having locked his actors into position, Williamson comes up with
surprisingly little for them to do. His film, however, does prove
that Ms. Mirren can outshine a cute teen-age cast with her hands
tied. She is so prickly and versatile, in fact, that she's far too
good for these circumstances and seems badly miscast in the role of
a one-note classroom martinet.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the Mrs. Tingle seen grading papers in silk
pajamas has nothing to do with her schoolroom incarnation, but
that's no more inconsistent than the rest of the story. And the
students' plot to take pornographic pictures of the teacher with a
goofball gym coach (Jeffrey Tambor) may once have been more
honestly kinky. But here, played as idiotic slapstick, it's beneath
one and all.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' which so
winkingly mocked crassness in popular culture, ``Teaching Mrs.
Tingle'' is content to be part of the problem. Played almost
straight are Jo Lynn's complaint about the lack of a television
chez Tingle (``I mean, it's like not having toilet paper!''), the
film's efforts to turn the teacher's capture into a romantic
occasion for her students, and a sex scene so laughably perfunctory
that the characters barely remember it when it's over. Nor is the
script quite kidding when it has Leigh Ann say, ``I'm gonna burn in
hell for this,'' and Luke answer, ``It'll be a party.''
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   `TEACHING MRS. TINGLE'
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' is rated PG-13 (Parents
strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, brief sexual
situations, violence played for laughs, and the idea that
assaulting a teacher is a smart way to solve problems at school.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Kevin Williamson; director of
photography, Jerzy Zielinski; edited by Debra Neil-Fisher; music by
John Frizzell; production designer, Naomi Shohan; produced by Cathy
Konrad; released by Dimension Films. Running time: 93 minutes. This
film is rated PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   Cast: Helen Mirren (Mrs. Tingle), Katie Holmes (Leigh Ann
Watson), Jeffrey Tambor (Coach Wenchell), Barry Watson (Luke
Churner), Marisa Coughlan (Jo Lynn Jordan), Liz Stauber (Trudie
Tucker), Michael McKean (Principal Potter), Molly Ringwald (Miss
Banks) and Vivica A. Fox (Miss Gold).

pointing to Hawaii's ouster of the U.S. Navy from a bombing range
on the island of Kaho'olawe in 1994 as a precedent for the Puerto
Rican effort to evict the Navy from a 58-year-old bombing range on
the island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and some
members of Congress are demanding a permanent end to the Navy's and
Marine Corps' target practice on 22,000 acres owned by the Navy.
Some 9,300 civilians share the island with the military.
</P>
<P>
   The eviction demand stems from a Marine Corps' bombing mishap in
April that killed a Puerto Rican security guard on contract with
the Navy, David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and injured four others.
Target practice has been suspended since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Vieques is very similar to the island in
Hawaii that the Navy bombed from 1941 to 1990,'' says Puerto Rico
Attorney General Jose A. Fuentes Agostini. The big difference is
that the Navy ``gave that island back to the people of Hawaii,''
says Agostini.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carlos Romero-Barcelo, D-Puerto Rico, the non-voting
representative in Congress for 3.8 million U.S. citizens in Puerto
Rico, says Hawaii prevailed in its dispute with the Navy because of
the political clout of Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, then chairman
of the Senate Appropriations Committee's panel on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his persistence _ coupled with the intense lobbying of
the congressional delegation from Hawaii _ that ensured that the
Navy would stop using an uninhabited island for military maneuvers
and return Kaho'olawe island to the state of Hawaii,'' says
Romero-Barcelo.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Vieques, once a sugar cane-growing center, lies
thousands of miles from Kaho'olawe, a 28,776-acre former Hawaiian
penal colony located about 90 miles southeast of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many parallels.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy began using both islands for target practice at the
outset of World War II. Later, the islands helped combat units
prepare for wars in Korea and Vietnam. For years, the Navy resisted
local demands to cease live-fire operations and return the islands
to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of the island bombing ranges differs _ at least so
far.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush ordered an end to live-fire training on
Kaho'olawe on Oct. 22, 1990. Three years later, Inouye inserted a
provision in the fiscal 1994 defense budget that required the Navy
to turn over the island to local authorities by 2004 after a $400
million cleanup of unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's far-flung Pacific fleet has since shifted live-fire
training operations to San Clemente Island, a 36,000-acre island
about 60 miles off the southern California coast owned by the Navy
since the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy had a fall back at San Clemente,'' says Navy Lt. Cdr.
Herman Phillips, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials say they don't have a comparable fall back
training facility along the Atlantic Coast to match the $720
million Vieques range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pacific fleet had redundancy in the system and the ability
to shift operations to San Clemente,'' says Phillips said. ``We
don't have the ability to fall back to another location for the
Atlantic fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Rico's political leaders attribute Hawaii's success
to the fact that it has the political power of a state compared to
the limited political power of a U.S. territory like Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens. But they do not pay
federal taxes; they do not vote for president; and they do not have
full voting members in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Romero-Barcelo, Puerto Rico's lone non-voting representative in
Congress, says demands for Navy withdrawal from Vieques would
``already have been heeded if we had two senators and a
congressional delegation with the power to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano D-N.Y., whose New York City congressional
district includes a large number of voters born in Puerto Rico,
says the bombing accident on Vieques would trigger an immediate
outcry in Congress if Puerto Rico had full representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would bombing continue if someone had been killed during a
military exercise on Long Island?'' Serrano asks. ``Of course not.
The Navy must stop treating the residents of Puerto Rico as
second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   But Navy Secretary Richard Danzig says Puerto Rico's status as a
U.S. territory without full voting representation in Congress is
irrelevant to the issue at hand. American armed forces conduct
live-fire training at 57 sites across the United States, with 56 of
the locations ``well-represented by congressmen and senators,''
Danzig says.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's contention that live-fire training is essential ``is
really not influenced by the character of their congressional
representation,'' Danzig said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Navy won a powerful ally last week. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
commander of NATO forces that prevailed in a 78-day bombing
campaign against Serbian occupation forces in Kosovo, credited live
fire training on Vieques for helping to ``ensure that the forces
assigned to this theater were ready on arrival and prepared to
fight, win and survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, Clark warned that loss of live fire training such as
provided on Vieques would be ``unconscionable, cause undue
casualties and place our nation's vital interest at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton awaits recommendations from a four-member
Pentagon review panel appointed to craft a compromise between
Puerto Rico and the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said last week the panel expects to submit
its report to Defense Secretary William Cohen by Aug. 31. Cohen
will then review the recommendations before submitting a proposed
compromise to the White House, probably after Labor Day, the
official said.

   HOLLYWOOD _
</P>
<P>
   Sweating Out The Numbers
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant was padding around his sleek and expansive suite at
L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills this week, barefoot in a pair of simple
white pants and a wrinkled blue T-shirt. He had been promoting his
brains out for weeks now _ ``I'm even talking to the British press,
which is astounding'' _ and could hardly wait for the opening on
Friday of his new film, ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' a romantic comedy
about a high-art auctioneer who discovers that his schoolteacher
girlfriend is the daughter of a mobster .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point now where we're getting the tracking
information every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The studio's market-research team was finding out whether people
had heard of the film, whether its name sprang to their minds
unaided or had to be prompted, whether they intended to see it and,
if so, whether it would be this weekend. The tension was palpable,
and rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately we had some good numbers this morning, but it's
still so stressful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant had been absent from movie screens for nearly three years
before appearing earlier this summer with Julia Roberts in
``Notting Hill.'' ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' which was made by Grant's
production company, was finished before ``Notting Hill,'' but wise
heads had concluded that it might be better to release it second,
getting a nice bounce off Ms. Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The story was one of several that Grant had been developing; the
idea was to show ``a Brit meeting the mob, which is something we
haven't seen on the screen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was he gone so long? He hadn't been taking a vacation, he
said, as much as waiting for something he truly loved to come
along. ``I'm not one of those people who must act to live,'' he
said. ``I must truly love something before I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be over until Friday,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Studio people will fan out across America to the first
screenings at important theaters, and by the time heads are counted
at that first 11 a.m. screening, they will know, almost to the
cent, whether their tracking research was correct and how much the
film will make in its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like all the focus groups, market research and
overriding emphasis on the opening weekend. ``It's so destructive
to the filmmaking process,'' he said. ``What was wrong with the way
they used to release films, more slowly, let them build?''
</P>
<P>
   But he is the beast's meal of the week and doesn't much enjoy
the sensation. ``It is really quite true and palpable that you can
walk into a restaurant on the Monday after your film opens and tell
by the way people look at you and the table that you get how your
film did over the previous weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So why go out to a restaurant that Monday? He shrugged. ``If I
didn't,'' he said, ``my life would be nothing but room service
meals and deciding which of the three big-screen TV's in this suite
to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he said, at least one good acting role was
``knocking at my door,'' but he was not sure that he wanted to do
it. ``What I'd really like to do is spend the fall in the South of
France, writing a script,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Take That, Teach!
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriter Kevin Williamson didn't get along with an
English teacher he had for two years in North Carolina. ``She
didn't like me for some reason,'' he said. ``I couldn't figure out
why. When you're 15 or 16 you never know why the teacher is being
mean to you.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said, he worked his heart out on a short story
about an ugly-duckling student involved in a date rape. His teacher
read the story aloud and ``could find not a single good word to say
about it,'' eviscerating him in front of the whole class. ``She
ripped it up and said to me that I had a voice that shouldn't be
heard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, he believed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped writing for many years,'' he said, and was 28 or 29
before be picked it up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a hard place, working as an assistant to someone here
in Hollywood, a desk job, sort of in the wasteland of life,'' he
said. ``I decided: I've got to do something. I'm got to figure out
what I'm going to do with the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, now 34, is one of Hollywood's latest interpreters of
the young-adult mind-set, with his successful screenplays for
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and the
television series ``Dawson's Creek.'' Now he has directed his first
feature film, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' a kind of poison-laced
revenge saga aimed at that English teacher from long ago. The film
opens on Friday .
</P>
<P>
   This script was the first thing he wrote when he returned to
writing five years ago. The title used to be ``Killing Mrs.
Tingle'' but was changed after the student killings in Littleton,
Colo. The movie is a dark comedy about three students who
accidentally injure their hated history teacher, played by an icy
Helen Mirren, and then take her hostage.
</P>
<P>
   He sold the script immediately, Williamson said. But producers
were put off by the way his teen-agers talked. ``They didn't find
it realistic,'' he said. ``They had this adult view of what the
teen-age experience would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after ``Scream'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' did Williamson's
clever and media-savvy teen-agers ring true to the studio
executives; ears, and so ``Tingle'' was finally made.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is at work on ``Wasteland,'' a new television series,
and plans to direct a second film, a romantic comedy, later this
year or early next.
</P>
<P>
   The English teacher who belittled him, he said, died several
years ago, but he really bears no lasting anger. Truly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She turned out to be a very positive experience in my life,''
he said. ``Yes, I learned, there is another way to teach children
so that they can learn the lesson without being infected with the
seeds of hatred. The trick is to believe in yourself and not let
them tear you down. Good will always rise above.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Do-Right Thing
</P>
<P>
   A group of hustling young producers was trying to come up with a
high-concept idea to transform into a studio deal when the
girlfriend of one of them suggested, hey, why not make a movie
based on the ``Dudley Do-Right'' cartoons?
</P>
<P>
   OK, it wasn't an apple falling on Newton's head or Watt
contemplating a steam kettle. But inspiration comes where you can
find it in the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   This was six or seven years ago, when J. Todd Harris was in
partnership with a couple of other guys. He approached the people
who controlled the rights to the work of Dudley's creator, the
animator Jay Ward, who died in 1989. They already had a
relationship with Universal Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to finesse the beginnings of a deal into place,''
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably there were false starts and hiccups. Finally, hot
from the success of ``First Wives Club,'' the director Hugh Wilson
became interested in the project. And Brendan Fraser , who had
already played another Ward character, ``George of the Jungle,''
came aboard. Universal, which has a film based on his Rocky and
Bullwinkle, mixing animation and live actors, in the works for next
summer, became more interested in the Ward canon. And so the film
about Dudley, the bumbling Canadian mountie, was made, with Fraser
starring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing was that I had come to Hollywood after
Stanford Business School with the intention of making studio
movies, but instead I got involved in one small independent film
after another, and this turns out to be the first studio film I
ever was involved with,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been running a theater company in Palo Alto, Calif., for
a few years when he decided it was time to try to crash Hollywood.
He borrowed $20,000 from his grandfather and spent nine months
courting people, raising a pool of production money. ``I really
wanted to be a producer, so I put together this business plan where
I figured I could get 25 or 30 people to give me $2,500 or
$3,000,'' he said. ``In the end a couple even gave me $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the rounds, got studio deals put together but quickly
realized that the studios were buying 10 ideas for every movie that
was made. It was frustrating. And his investors were no closer to
making money on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   So he turned to independent films, had some small successes like
``Digging to China'' and ``Denise Calls Up.'' But only now, with
the release of ``Dudley Do-Right'' on Aug. 27, will he be able to
begin passing some significant money to his investors, most of whom
were Stanford classmates.
</P>
<P>
   If he has one more studio release, he'll be able to pay them out
in full, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making `Dudley' has certainly refired me to do other large
studio movies,'' he said. ``Every time I make an independent film,
it's like starting a new company with $2 million. With Universal
backing a film, you have a lot of that done for you. I remember
going into my first meeting at Universal after the movie was
green-lit and there were something like 30 people around the table.
I almost broke into tears of joy.''

   NEW YORK _ The characters who live in the enchanted Never Never
Land of musical theater have their own special ways of dealing with
adversity. Facing an uncertain life in a foreign land, the newly
widowed Mrs. Anna simply whistled a happy tune in ``The King and
I.''
</P>
<P>
   And the United States government, dangerously depressed by the
Great Depression, learned to accentuate the positive when a plucky
little orphan made the Roosevelt cabinet sing an anthem of optimism
in ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if we're talking about heinous crimes against humanity?
What if the subject is the Holocaust or apartheid in South Africa?
Judging by recent Broadway productions, the proper response would
seem to be close-harmony vocalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Only months after the brief New York run of ``Band in Berlin,''
the musical story of the Comedian Harmonists, a singing sextet
destroyed by anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany, there arrives a peppy,
exhaustingly eager show about a nonwhite doo-wop group, crooning up
a storm in the segregated Cape Town of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   This latest improbable fusion of musical style and historical
substance is called ``Kat and the Kings.'' The show, which opened
Thursday night at the Cort Theater after earlier incarnations in
Cape Town and London, where it won a Laurence Olivier award for
Best Musical, follows the short, stunted career of a young,
American-style singing group whose members are neither black nor
white but, as one of them puts it, children ``of the twilight.''
</P>
<P>
   That such a group is doomed to failure in midcentury South
Africa inevitably leads to thoughts of bright talents sadly
squandered. So, unfortunately, does ``Kat and the Kings'' itself.
The vividness of presence of the show's performers is undeniable;
so is the precision of their skills as singers and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their innate appeal and exuberant energy, there is a
sense that they are as confined as genies in bottles, hemmed in by
the formulaic cartoonishness of the show in which they appear. And
by the evening's end, their exertion in trying to turn period
pastiche songs into showstoppers is so visible that you find
yourself sweating in sympathy. Talent of this caliber should never
have to go begging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kat'' was created by its director, David Kramer, who also
wrote its book and lyrics, and Taliep Petersen, who composed the
score. Its central idea, the impact of American pop music on a
marginal people in search of social identity, has definite promise.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Cape Town a capella groups of 40-some years ago who
created songs in imitation of chart-topping acts like the Coasters
and the Ink Spots, the show hints at the existence of a fascinating
shadow culture.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested process of musical evolution is dizzying; rhythms
and singing styles of ancestral Africa are translated over the
centuries into such American forms as rhythm and blues, doo-wop and
rock and roll, which are in turn slicked up for mainstream
consumption by record producers, while retaining a primal energy
that speaks directly to the rebellious side of a new generation.
The music then makes its way back to Africa, where it is
reinterpreted by artists like those portrayed in ``Kat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show has little interest in exploring how these South
African songwriters made this music their own or what it meant to
them beyond its possibilities as an avenue to success and stardom.
Kramer's and Petersen's tuneful songs are in the blandly mimetic
tradition of nostalgia trips like ``Grease,'' and the numbers are
harnessed to the hoariest of rise-and-fall show business plots.
</P>
<P>
   The setting may be exotic to a New York audience, but much else
will feel bizarrely stale. There's a willful, feel-good naivete
about the whole enterprise that turns apartheid into an
incongruous, random sour note in a blithely sweet-sounding musical
tapestry, with jokes, gags and characterizations that suggest only
slightly spicier variations on the let's-put-on-a-show episodes of
the old ``Our Gang'' comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kat'' is framed by the reminiscences of its title character,
Kat Diamond (Terry Hector), an elderly shoeshiner on the streets of
contemporary Cape Town. A cute, sparky codger who delivers his
business spiels in rhyme, he recalls the days when he was 17,
summoning his younger self (played by Jody J. Abrahams), as he
cruises Cape Town's bustling, ethnically mixed District Six with
his pals.
</P>
<P>
   These friends break down into the expected stereotypes. There's
Bingo (Luqmaan Adams, who exudes matinee-idol charisma), the suave,
lady-killing one; Ballie (Junaid Booysen), the goofy, dim-witted
one, and Magoo (Alistar Izobell), the rich and prissy one, who has
the drawing card of being able to sing like Frankie Lymon.
</P>
<P>
   Magoo's comely sister, Lucy (Kim Louis), has an irritatingly
patrician air, but she knows her pop musicology, and she teaches
the group to harmonize and organizes its club dates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first act is more or less devoted to showing how the quintet
gets its act together; the second to its career high point when it
performs an elaborate, highly polished cabaret act at Claridge's
Hotel in Durban, where the young men must also work as bell hops,
and the group's subsequent dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Kings' breaking up has to do with the social climate
in South Africa at the time, although this fails to make a dent in
the characters' relentless perkiness. It is also worth noting that
apartheid is presented as one of several, equal factors for their
demise; another is the marriage of Ballie to a domineering woman.
</P>
<P>
   The group's hit record is yanked from the airwaves when it is
discovered they are not white. And when Lucy falls in love with
their (unseen) white manager, her days in her native land are
clearly numbered. It is she who in the first act, between moments
of being adorably bossy with those rascally boys, stops to ask,
``Don't you see what's happening in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   She is speaking of what the older Kat refers to as ``a
nightmare, this thing called apartheid,'' before singing a lifeless
ditty about how he doesn't judge people by the color of their skin
but by the state of their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy correspondingly gets two big emotional numbers (one of them
a duet with her brother), unfortunately clunky songs about social
cruelty and finding inner faith: ``All I want is justice, a world
where fair is fair/Where nobody will judge me by my color and the
texture of my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   These numbers bring to mind the syrupy ballads found in current
movies about scorned misfits beating the odds to become sports
champions. There are also some perfunctory and unnecessary
plot-propelling songs, including two in which Ballie is warned
against getting married.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the score sticks closely to the period in which ``Kat''
is set, directly recalling standards like ``La Bamba'' and ``At the
Hop,'' and giving off an oddly distanced, ersatz quality.
</P>
<P>
   The cast performs these with considerable flair and enthusiasm,
with fluid, loose-jointed dancing and tightly woven harmonies. But
ultimately even these numbers become repetitive, and for the
Claridge's Hotel medley, they are undercut by a host of kitschy
gimmicks that do indeed bring to mind this decade's klutzy revival
of ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show's protracted finale, you may find yourself briefly
startled out of the numbness you have probably succumbed to by
then. This happens when the cast members reinterpret a
tribal-inspired number they had performed previously, in Top 40
style, and now execute without the Westernizing gloss.
</P>
<P>
   A rush of fresh air seems to flood the stage, and you're
suddenly aware of how exciting this production could have been if
it had stopped more often to consider what was behind the mimetic
style of performance at its center. As it is, ``Kat and the Kings''
glides along on mere imitations not only of the songs of the period
but also of plot turns, dialogue and shtick that were cliched even
in the 1950s.

 &HT;    CYBERSQUATTERS AND NET PARODIES MAY FACE THE LAW
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Politics categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

   WASHINGTON Last October, an enterprising Californian named Chris
Hayden paid $70 for exclusive two-year rights to the Internet
address www.hillary2000.com. For good measure, Hayden bought
www.clinton2000.com and www.hillaryclinton2000.com , also for the
same low price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it on a lark,'' Hayden, an environmental consultant,
said in a cell phone interview as he drove down a freeway in Costa
Mesa. ``It looked to me as if she had a future in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, as the First Lady prepared to seek a Senate seat
from New York, the Clinton camp offered to buy www.hillary2000.com
. ``Their price was unreasonable and I declined to sell,'' Hayden
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Hayden listed the three Clinton names with an online broker,
asking $15,000 apiece for them. Meantime, the political Web sites
remain dormant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, everybody in politics needs a Web name,'' Hayden
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nascent Clinton Senate campaign chose www.hillary2000.org .
As it happens, typing www.hillary200.org, skipping the last ``0,''
brings up precisely the same graphical layout _ but it is a parody
page with a different message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Rodham Clinton will continue her listening tour in
some god-forsaken upstate cow towns this week, touting a carpetbag
full of magical adventures,'' the fake Clinton site reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton caricatures, and others like them in the growing
realm of cyberspace, pit constitutional guarantees of free speech
against charges of intellectual property theft. These
countervailing issues are being widely tested in the courts, with
no clear outcome in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden's purchase, known as ``cybersquatting,'' would also be
illegal if a bill that enjoys wide bipartisan support in Congress
becomes law. The measure, which cleared the Senate Judiciary
Committee last month, would bar the use of Internet addresses,
known as domains, that are identical to, or confusingly
</P>
<P>
   similar to, distinctive trademarks or service names.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who helped steer the
anti-cybersquatter measure through his committee, voiced an even
greater interest in its passage after a Miami entrepreneur named
Joseph Culligan sought $45,000 to enable the senator's presidential
campaign to deploy www.presidenthatch.com on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just happening to me,'' the senator told the
Associated Press. ``It's happening to most celebrities and people
known in business. Someone tries to tie up their name. It isn't
right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are search engines and hot links available online that
will let you find your way around without typing in an address,''
said Dan Turkette, a Web developer in Fort Wayne, Ind. Thus, simply
typing a candidate's name into a search engine can bring up
literally scores of Web addresses _ some genuine, others decidedly
off-color.
</P>
<P>
   Turkette, who owns www.politicallycorrect.com and is offering to
sell it for $2.5 million, noted: ``Consumers deal on the basis of
brand awareness. That's why domain names can be quite valuable.''
Last week, for instance, an anonymous buyer paid $823,456 in an
auction for www.drugs.com. . The cost of initially registering a
Web site is only $35 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Wild West out there,'' said Benjamin Ginsberg,
general counsel for Texas Gov. George W. Bush's bid for the
Republican presidential nomination, referring to Internet
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Zack Exley, a Boston computer programmer,
registered www.gwbush.com . Ginsberg said Exley sought to sell the
name to the Bush campaign for $380,000, only to later cut his
asking price to $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was just hysterical for me to be negotiating with
the Bush campaign,'' Exley, 29, said. He disputes Ginsberg's
figures as ``way too high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp claimed www.georgewbush.com as its official
campaign Web site. Belatedly, a top Bush honcho, Karl Rove, bought
up another 260 Bush-related domain names and linked them all to the
prime address.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hayden, Exley isn't a ``cybersquatter.'' Having failed to
make a bargain, he operates www.gwbush.com as a parody site. It has
received more than 1.2 million visits, well beyond the circulation
of many political magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Exley also sells satirical Bush T-shirts on the Web. ``It's just
for fun,'' says the online entrepreneur. ``I doubt I'm breaking
even and I won't be giving up my day job.''
</P>
<P>
   At a May press conference in Austin, Bush branded Exley ``a
garbage man'' and said ``there ought to be limits to freedom.''
Exley said he plans to offer Bush's taped comments to visitors,
``pointing up his incredible position on free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Ginsberg has written the Federal Elections Commission
seeking a ruling that would compel Exley to register as a political
action committee and to disclose his Web expenses. The commission
is expected to rule soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a Web site is no different then sending a letter,''
Exley said in rebuttal. ``The FEC shouldn't get involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all observers see it his way.
</P>
<P>
   Said Paul Kedrosky, a professor at Canada's University of
British Columbia who specializes in online business concerns:
</P>
<P>
   ``Something must be done. The issue matters to everyone, from
corporations to political campaigns. It matters to businesses
trying to protect trademarks and expensively gained brands on the
net. It matters to news organizations trying to make sure that when
you say something comes (from them), it actually (does).
</P>
<P>
   ``Because without the kinds of property protections that exist
in the offline world, the online world is just a cheap bazaar, and
a home for intellectual property break-and-enter masquerading as
free speech.''

NATO CHIEF ENTERS DISPUTE OVER BOMBING RANGE IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The commander of NATO underscored the Pentagon's
widening campaign to regain use of an island bombing range in
Puerto Rico, warning in a letter obtained Thursday that American
forces ``may not be fully combat ready'' without resumption of
live-fire training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the commander of American and allied
military forces in Europe, said in the letter that realistic
combat-style training on Vieques enabled Navy aviators and the
Marine Corps to arrive in Kosovo ready for combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The live-fire training that our forces were exposed to at
training ranges such as Vieques helped ensure that the forces
assigned to this theater were `ready on arrival' and prepared to
fight, win and survive,'' Clark said in a letter to Gen. Henry
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that was dated Aug. 16. A
copy of the letter was obtained by the Hearst Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he was ``concerned'' that the four-month moratorium
on training on Vieques means that ``the naval forces that will be
assigned to (the European Command) in the future may not be fully
combat ready to perform their assigned missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said deploying U.S. forces with ``less than this optimum
training in the future would be unconscionable, cause undue
casualties and place our nation's vital interests at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's letter to Shelton is the second time in less than a
month that a senior U.S. military officer has expressed concern
that Atlantic-based forces will suffer diminished combat readiness
without the use of the 11,000-acre maneuver area and 899-acre
live-fire impact range on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. William J. Fallon, the Atlantic fleet commander
responsible for preparing naval forces for deployment to Europe and
the Middle East, warned a Pentagon panel on July 23 that live-fire
training must resume on Vieques by September or the aircraft
carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower will deploy to Europe later this
year with ``serious deficiencies'' in combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of a Marine Corps' bombing accident on April 19
that killed a Puerto Rican security guard and wounded four other
civilians, Puerto Rico's political leaders and allies in Congress
are demanding that the Navy withdraw from the 58-year-old bombing
range on Vieques and relinquish 22,000 acres of property to local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials say they cannot find alternative bombing ranges
along the Atlantic Coast to match the $720 million facility on
Vieques where land, sea and air forces can practice combat
operations with explosive ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton awaits recommendations from a Pentagon review
panel that is scheduled to submit a preliminary report to Defense
Secretary William Cohen by Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Navy and Marine Corps' combat commanders planned to
underscore the value of live-fire training on Vieques in
closed-door testimony to the Pentagon panel scheduled Friday. The
island is located 8 miles off the east coast of Puerto Rico.

`A COOLER CLIMATE': WORTHWHILE, BUT A LITTLE TOO PAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isn't it great when people say, ``What's the worst that could
happen?'' Go on, talk to him (or her), they say. What's the
absolute worst thing that can possibly happen as a result? It won't
go well; you'll get dismissed (or divorced); you'll move on.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the puritanically named Iris Prue (Sally Field), a
fairly upscale, jewelry-wearing 45-year-old wife and mother. Iris
has an affair with a younger man, divorces her husband and refuses
alimony or even community property because ``Oliver and I want to
start fresh.'' Then Oliver leaves her.
</P>
<P>
   With no money, no house, no car, no sympathy from her daughter
the lawyer, and absolutely no job skills, Iris discovers what the
worst is: taking a job as a live-in maid at a rich couple's summer
house in Maine. She works for the haughty sunglasses-wearing,
convertible-driving, tennis-playing Paula Tanner (Judy Davis), who
makes Iris scrub the kitchen floor on her knees and never says
thank you for anything.
</P>
<P>
   That is Iris' fate in ``A Cooler Climate,'' a Showtime movie
with impeccable credentials that has its premiere on Sunday night.
The script, based on a novel by Zena Collier, is by Marsha Norman,
a Pulitzer Prize winner for her play ``'Night, Mother.'' The
director is Susan Seidelman, best known for the film ``Desperately
Seeking Susan.'' The combination of this team with Ms. Field and
Ms. Davis might have added up to award-worthy drama. But ``A Cooler
Climate'' is not particularly complex, its solutions are too pat,
and it ends up simpering rather than affecting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opportunity to watch two fine actresses make these
characters and situations sympathetic and believable while tackling
issues like class, divorce and mother-daughter relationships makes
it more worthwhile than the average television movie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Things do not remain the same in the Tanner household for long.
Paula's husband, Leo (Jerry Wasserman), comes back from Paris long
enough to bring some Broadway friends home for a weekend (they
adore Iris) and to get caught calling his latest girlfriend on the
home phone. Soon Leo decides to end the marriage, and Paula takes
to her bed in an ugly bathrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Iris, in the tradition of all 20th-century feminist
heroines, is transformed. She meets a great guy at a bookstore.
(This little town in Maine seems to be filled with available,
attractive middle-aged residents.) ``We're all dreamers and
runaways,'' explains Jack (Winston Rekert), the executive turned
sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   Iris takes a class to learn computer skills. She gains the quiet
confidence of Gloria Steinem. She develops a better relationship
with Paula's daughter, Beth (Carly Pope) _ a reckless young thing
who brings home a boyfriend who likes to walk around the house
naked _ than she has with her own daughter. All in just a few
fun-filled months. Not to give away the exact ending, let's just
say that only in movies do employers decide that all those years of
giving dinner parties and serving on charity committees make a
woman qualified for an executive job with an assistant of her own
and a desk the size of China.
</P>
<P>
   Jack is so sensitive that his fondest wish is for Iris to stay
with him all night, so he can wake up with her. And their sex scene
features a much-too-artfully draped sheet. But the worst scene of
all is the bookstore reading. As Graham, the store owner, Gerard
Plunkett manages to set back the portrayal of gay characters on
screen about a hundred years. The reading is the balcony scene from
``Romeo and Juliet.'' (Ooh, these small-town people are well read.)
And Graham announces that he's working on a version of
``Moby-Dick'' but without the whale. You don't want to know the
title.

 &HT;    PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE

<P>
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland _ On a sunny mid-August afternoon,
two painters on scaffolds work on a three-story mural portrait of a
girl with a haunting gaze.
</P>
<P>
   A lone figure watches intently from the sidewalk below. William
McGavigan stoops slightly with his hands tucked in his trouser
pockets. He stands motionless in the cool breeze, which whips the
locks of his white hair. The girl is his daughter, Annette, who was
shot to death 28 years ago during the dark days here in the
Bogside, the Catholic neighborhood that has endured the worst of
The Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   McGavigan, a retired truck driver, says he will never forget
Annette, who was 14 when she was struck by one errant police
bullet. ``She was just eating an ice lolly, and then she was
dead,'' he says. ``She was such a lovely girl.''
</P>
<P>
   As he watches and remembers, McGavigan also worries. Northern
Ireland's fragile peace is in clear danger of collapse. A short
walk from the mural, workers on Wednesday were clearing charred
debris from a shop torched during an outbreak of rioting last
Saturday. A block away, the road was scorched by the outline of a
car set afire during the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   These images raise the chilling specter of the sectarian
violence that killed Annette and thousands more over the years. The
peace process was supposed to render such images a thing of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going well, not well at all,'' McGavigan
says as he watches the artists work around his daughter's soft
brown eyes. ``So, many people have suffered, so many people have
been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Northern Ireland was supposed to begin charting its
own future with a government comprising both sides of the bitter
divide, the momentum in the peace process has ground to a halt and
threatens to slip into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The peace deal was heralded by President Clinton during his
triumphant tour of Ireland last September, and it won Nobel Peace
prizes for its main architects, Unionist leader David Trimble and
Republican John Hume.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations now seem premature as the process has been
reduced to a sobering struggle with old realities of mistrust and
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's Unionists, who support Northern Ireland's continuing
as part of Britain, refuse to enter into the government with its
longtime adversary Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish
Republican Army. Both Sinn Fein and the IRA want Northern Ireland
to become part of the Republic of Ireland to the South.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point is the Unionist demand that the IRA surrender
its weapons before Sinn Fein takes its place in the would-be
government.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sinn Fein has argued that such a disarmament _ referred
to here as ``decommissioning'' _ is not required by the 1998 Good
Friday peace accord. Sinn Fein insists that decommissioning will
commence once the Unionists show good faith by allowing the
coalition government to be seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an ideal world and a perfect political process
where people trusted each other then maybe we would be further
along,'' said Mitchell McGlaughlin, the Sinn Fein chairman for
Northern Ireland. ``But why do people have guns in the first place?
It bespeaks a lack of confidence, a lack of trust in rival
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen from the IRA is a cessation of their
military campaign. We don't see operations carried out at the rate
of four or five a day. We don't see mortar bomb attacks. We don't
have car bomb explosions. We don't have sniper attacks on the
security forces. People want more, yes. But at what cost?''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of talks, in which British Prime Minister
Tony Blair has taken a major personal role, there seems little room
for progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clearly the situation _ and the agreement _ is
unraveling and I think there is a failure of politics,'' said Sinn
Fein official Martin McGuinness last week(CQ) during talks in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Things have deteriorated so far that former U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell, the arbiter of the peace accord, has been summoned to
help. Mitchell is scheduled to conduct a review of the situation
next month, with both sides expressing confidence that he will find
the other at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating an already complex issue, the Unionists are
accusing the IRA of violating its two-year-old cease-fire, an
allegation that could lead to Sinn Fein's being expelled from the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has been implicated in five murders since the start of
the peace process in April 1998 as well as a foiled attempt to
smuggle arms from the United States. The IRA has denied having a
role in these incidents, but the denials have been widely
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists last week(CQ) repeatedly expressed their
determination to stick by their guns. ``The Ulster Unionist Party
is steadfast in its resolution that no terrorist-linked party will
participate in executive government in Northern Ireland now or
ever,'' said Ken Maginnis, the party spokesman. ``Government must
deal with terrorist organizations and terrorist-linked parties
according to the promises that were made to us the day the
agreement was signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders argue that the incidents -- even if proven
true -- do not constitute a violation of the IRA's pledge to end
its military campaign. They also seem to argue that the cease-fire
remains in force because the five people killed were Catholics, in
one recent case a police informant.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Unionists are pressuring Marjorie ``Mo''
Mowlam, the British Northern Ireland secretary, to declare that the
cease-fire has been breached. Mowlam met through the week with both
sides as well as police authorities. She is expected to issue a
ruling early next week after consulting with Blair.
</P>
<P>
   She has little choice but to infuriate hardliners on one side or
the other. If she fails to appear tough enough on the IRA, the
Unionists have hinted they will walk away from the peace process.
If she moves to expel Sinn Fein she will provoke the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians worry that if something doesn't happen people
will give up on the political process. ``Unless we are producing
evidence that the political process is working people are going to
conclude that the politicians have let them down yet again,'' said
McGlaughlin, the Sinn Fein leader who is also a city councilman in
Londonderry. ``I can see quite clear evidence that there is an
evaporation of the confidence that was so manifest a year or a year
and half ago,''
</P>
<P>
   The process and its rhetoric have tended to confirm rather than
dismiss the distrust that has plagued any move for compromise for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes our job of selling the idea of political discourse
between the Republicans and the British government and Republicans
and Unionists that much harder,'' McGlaughlin said. ``For all of us
this entails great risks and challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   For Margaret Wair the failure of the political process is a
foregone conclusion. Her apartment in a drab Protestant
neighborhood of Belfast is festooned with Unionist flags
celebrating the Marching Season. Each year, Unionists hold marches,
often through Catholic neighborhoods, to commemorate the 1689
Protestant victory over the Catholics in Ireland that maintained
British rule. This season, which closes at the end of the month,
has been one
</P>
<P>
   of the most confrontational in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I love the marching season,'' she says, admiring the
flags. ``I'll keep them up 'til I replace them with my Christmas
lights.''
</P>
<P>
   She has three sons, but Wair sees little prospect that they will
grow into manhood in an undivided community. ``There can't be no
peace, never,'' Wair says. ``There's just too much hatred, too much
hatred on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Martin Watson shares a Guinness or two with
his friends in a Catholic pub. The entrance is protected by a steel
cage and above the bar where you would expect to find a soccer game
on the television is the pale blue flicker of a security monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has enjoyed the peace and hopes it will last. ``Now I can
walk the street without worrying every time a car stops behind
me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He remains hopeful about the process. ``Nobody wants to go back
to war,'' he says. ``I can't see Mo Mowlam coming out against the
IRA. But if she does, that could be the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are signs of a return to the old ways. Last
weekend, a march by the Apprentice Boys through Londonderry sparked
a riot that led to the unleashing of more than 100 gasoline bombs
and the burning of businesses and cars in the city's center. On
Wednesday, police officers and British soldiers in armored cars set
up a roadblock on the road between Londonderry after a long
absence.
</P>
<P>
   These were familiar and unsettling images.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clear view is that if we don't make the Good Friday work,
then those conditions for conflict which continue to exist will
reassert themselves,'' McGlaughlin said. ``We know what fills a
political vacuum anywhere in any society and we certainly have
experience with that over the last 30 years here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Bogside portrait of Annette McGavigan are two important
symbols: A rifle and a butterfly. Tom Kelly, one of the artists,
says the rifle represents violence and the butterfly represents
metamorphosis _ the prospect of change.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly worries that rifle may yet win out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who are planning to foster the
notion that the peace is dead and create the climate for that to
happen,'' Kelly said. ``But the overwhelming majority are aspiring
for peace and are fed up with the politicians. If you were to round
up all our politicians and give them a long weekend here on their
own or in Bosnia, it might do them a world of good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might just learn that peace is essential, and that the
prospects of change and growth far outweigh one or two issues no
matter how serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might learn that answers have to be found, and that
violence is used only by those who feel powerless.''

   TBILISI, Georgia _ From the sidelines, it may seem like a small
war. But looks are deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's latest military conflict in its southern republic of
Dagestan has far-reaching implications for the stability of the
former superpower and the well-being of the oil-rich Caspian Sea
region.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has launched an extensive air and ground campaign to
vanquish an Islamic rebel uprising begun two weeks ago(CQ) in the
remote Caucasus Mountain republic. With its feeble economy and
dilapidated army, Russia is struggling to prevent its southern
territory from being nibbled away by guerrilla separatists
determined to rid the region of Moscow's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fighting is essentially a war that began in 1994.
Russia's battle with the breakaway republic of Chechnya ended only
because it retreated in 1996, withdrawing its forces which were
unable to end the jihad, or holy war. Chechnya declared
independence; Moscow's prestige and army were in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Russian authorities are facing old foes from
Chechnya, who have crossed into the predominately Muslim republic
of Dagestan to foment a revolution. Once again, Moscow is promising
to crush the guerrillas with a full-scale military operation of the
kind that inflicted heavy civilian casualties but failed to win the
war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan, Russian forces suffered their worst single-day
losses with 18 soldiers killed and at least 20 wounded on
Wednesday, according to the Defense Ministry. But President Boris
Yeltsin and the new prime minister, Vladimir Putin, have vowed to
relentlessly protect ``the links in the chain'' that make up the
Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But the view from Russia's southern neighbors in the Caucasus is
not a promising one. For most of this decade, since the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union, civil wars and economic uncertainty
have plagued the independent Caucasus republics of Georgia, Armenia
and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the fighting in Dagestan, there is concern that the
unrest could spread beyond Dagestan's borders and that a prolonged
fight will sap Russia's already weak economy, ruining the entire
region's promise for security and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia faced a full political and military defeat in Chechnya.
What happens now in Dagestan is extremely dangerous,'' said Peter
Mamradze, chief adviser to President Eduard Shevardnadze of
Georgia. ``If it ends badly it will mean bad consequences for the
entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies have a large stake in what
happens should the conflict in Dagestan spread into neighboring
states or promote further challenges, from Russia's far-flung
republics to the central authority in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia's southern republics
form the western rim of one of the world's largest deposits of oil
and natural gas -- the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies are developing fields in the Caspian and
the United States has bestowed hundreds of millions of dollars in
foreign aid and expertise to help the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the security future of the world will be
decided,'' said Alexander Rondeli, a political scientist and
advisor to Georgia's foreign ministry. ``Whoever wants stability in
the world cannot ignore it. America understands this _ you have to
be here in this region, somewhere, somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia understood the territory's strategic importance in the
16th century, when Peter the Great annexed the region and began a
military campaign to make the northern Caucasus part of the Russian
empire.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-19th century, Russia finally crushed the resistance
led in Dagestan by the legendary Imam(CQ) Shamil, who dreamed of
establishing an Islamic state. But throughout the Soviet period,
the Islamic roots and tightly knit clans of Dagestan and Chechnya
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia has much at stake in Dagestan. It is Russia's
oil-pipeline link to the Caspian Sea and is home to Russia's only
all-weather Caspian Sea port.
</P>
<P>
   If oil weren't critical enough, Russian authorities fear that a
defeat in Dagestan could produce a ``domino effect'' that would
embolden other republics in the Russian Federation to seek
independence, or simply drift further from Moscow's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal power has been weakened to such a degree that for many
regional governors it has already turned into a fictional idea,''
human rights activist Boris Pustintsev wrote last week in the
Russian daily, the St. Petersburg Times.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the forceful military reaction to events in Dagestan,
he said: ``Yeltsin does not want to go down in history as the man
who presided over the destruction of the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Moscow, earlier promises have disappeared that the
fighting in Dagestan would be over in two weeks or less.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rebels still control at least five villages,
including the tiny hamlet of Tando. And on Thursday, Deputy
Interior Minister Lt. Gen. Igor Zubov told the Interfax news agency
that the Russians have lost 40 troops and 160 have been wounded
since the conflict began in early August. He claimed that up to 500
rebels had been killed, though the rebels say the figure is hugely
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, military authorities now suggest that Russia will
have to send at least 10,000 troops _ and perhaps as many as 15,000
_ to force the rebels out of Dagestan and back into neighboring
Chechnya. So far, Russia has sent about 4,000 soldiers and
paramilitary forces. Moscow estimates guerrilla troop strength at
up to 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers mean little. Russia had superior forces in
Chechnya only to see its campaign there fail.
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan, Russia's conventional forces face similar problems
fighting the guerrillas and little time before winter sets in,
according to military analysts. The terrain in Dagestan's Botlikh
region, where the guerrillas have dug in, is extremely isolated and
difficult to negotiate. Furthermore, at the upper altitudes snow
will being falling in six weeks or less, limiting visibility for
Russian aircraft and artillery and obstructing mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   Unless commanders have learned the lessons from Chechnya, ``the
Russian military may be in for another major disaster,'' warned
Pavel Felgenhauer, military affairs correspondent for Russia's
Sevodya newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Russia's favor, so far, is little evidence that the
uprising in Dagestan has garnered widespread public support among
the republic's 2 million inhabitants. The fighting is mainly led by
Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev, a shadowy Jordanian-born
commander known as Khattab and their Chechen and Dagestani
followers.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla movement appears to be relying on the hopes that
local discontent with Moscow will prompt their fellow Muslims to
join the rebellion rather than ally with Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is the most unpredictable country in the world right
now, and extremist movements are unpredictable by their nature,''
said Revaz Adamia, defense committee chairman of the Georgia
parliament. ``It is difficult to predict, because all the players
are unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chechnya's independence is a model few would want to
emulate. The two-year war wrecked the economy and infrastructure
and left rival warlords battling over the ruins the Russians left
behind. While there is a federal government, there is no rule of
law. Organized crime and kidnappings are rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, a predominately Orthodox Christian country with
virtually no armed forces of its own, fears the Islamic militants
could turn an eye to its territory, too. But the more immediate
threat comes at the borders it shares with Chechnya and Dagestan.
Officials are concerned that the current fighting could spread to
their soil or send tides of refugees into Georgia. ``And suddenly,
you're involved in the war without any wish to be involved in the
war'' said Rondeli, the Georgian political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the Russian campaign, a warplane dropped
cluster bombs on a Georgian village near the border with Dagestan.
Russian officials have yet to acknowledge that it was one of their
pilots who dropped the bombs and say their investigation into the
incident continues.
</P>
<P>
   But more potentially serious is the threat that a defeat in
Dagestan poses to the stability of Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's economy took a beating last August when the Russia was
beset by its economic crisis. Russia represents the largest market
for Georgia goods, mainly wine and mineral water. Despite the two
country's deep political differences _ Georgia has accused
``elements'' in Moscow of being directly linked to several attempts
on Shevardnadze's life _ their economies remain closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   Should Russian forces fail in Dagestan, some Georgian officials
wonder if Russia's other fringe republics would declare open season
on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And they say the problems are Moscow's own creation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leaders have retained an imperial view of the former
Soviet Union, officials in Georgia complain. Russia could have more
allies and fewer risks had the Russian government from the outset
of the fall of communism approached the former Soviet republics,
and its own republics that remained in the Russian Federation, as
equals instead of subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it lacks the economic and the military might to impose its
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, we don't wish to see Russia fail. There is nothing in
it for us. Georgia can be unstable; that's not dangerous for
Russia,'' said Rondeli. ``But an unstable Russia is a disaster for
Georgia.''

`MICKEY BLUE EYES': BRITON, TO WED A MAFIA DOLL, GOES TO A
TRATTORIA ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try as he might, Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant), a cultivated,
mild-mannered Englishman engaged to the daughter of a genial Mafia
chieftain, can't seem to deliver the phrase ``forget about it''
with the sinister heft that his future in-laws can. Michael's
inability to give ``fuhgeddaboutit'' and other spicier phrases a
suitably streetwise punch is one of the cute running of jokes of
``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' a lightweight comedy that has more than
enough laughs to justify its silly, scatterbrained premise.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Mickey, an ingenuous English twit who runs a snooty
auction house in midtown Manhattan, fits Grant almost too smoothly.
Bringing his signature bashful-boy mannerisms to the role _ the
half stammer, the tilted eyebrows, the bowed choirboy lips curled
into a beseeching little smile as his blue eyes simultaneously
implore and twinkle _ the actor makes Michael, aka his Mafia
nickname, Mickey Blue Eyes, an appealing, if totally synthetic
creation.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in Grant's screen performances, beneath the surface
wimpiness and ineptitude lies a core of unflappability. Michael
reacts to the most excruciating embarrassments, like an
ill-concealed gun that continually slips down his pants leg onto a
restaurant floor, with a quip, accompanied by a weak, helpless
smile. Hollywood's other Grant (Cary) had the same gift for
maintaining his dignity in the midst of abject humiliation. If Hugh
Grant lacks the dramatic range of his forerunner, his comic timing
is comparably suave.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that Mafia! The movie, directed by Kelly Makin from a
screenplay by Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn, is only the latest
Hollywood product to portray mobsters as a bunch of almost lovable
but deadly buffoons. Here, they're sort of like grizzly bears
noisily rattling around in an urban jungle theme park. Although the
beasts have been put there for show, the signs warn you to pet them
at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a frisson of weirdness is the fact that several of the
actors playing mobsters also have continuing roles in the far more
serious and substantial television series ``The Sopranos,'' and at
certain moments their familiarity makes the movie feel like a spoof
of a spoof of a spoof. Further enriching the referential Mafia mix
is James Caan's appearance as a more mature, much less jumpy
descendant of Sonny Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   Michael stumbles into this clan when he falls in love with Gina
Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn), a surprisingly genteel Mafia princess
(she teaches school), who refuses to marry him because she fears
her father Frank (Caan) and his pals will corrupt him. Michael
forges ahead anyway and visits Frank's restaurant ``La Trattoria''
in Little Italy. Searching for the men's room, he opens the wrong
door, sees a man imprisoned in the restaurant's freezer, and,
mystified, greets him cheerily before proceeding on.
</P>
<P>
   Gina's fears quickly prove well-grounded. In the movie's
funniest moments, Frank and his pals trick poor Michael into using
his business for money laundering by having him auction off a
mobster's hilariously awful religious paintings in which Jesus and
his disciples are gun-toting gangsters. One sale involves a batty
old lady whose misconstruing of the predetermined bidding signals
leads to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' is little more than a series of
stitched-together gags. One of the funniest, set in a Chinese
restaurant, involves the secreting of an intimate message into a
fortune cookie that is delivered to the wrong party. In another,
Michael, after an accidental homicide, is asked if he has any
plastic bags. Returning from the kitchen a moment later he is
clutching a sandwich bag like a good little puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' accelerates into a frenzied
farce whose convoluted plot involves Michael's faking his own death
during his wedding celebration. As the tempo accelerates and it
turns frantic, the movie loses much of its charm and becomes a
comedy machine that confuses humor with desperately pumped-up
adrenaline.
</P>

 &HT;    TERRY EDMONDS: THE MAN WHO PUTS WORDS IN CLINTON'S MOUTH
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Terry Edmonds chuckles when he recalls listening to
the first presidential speech that he crafted and realizing that
the spoken words weren't the ones he had written.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens a lot with President Clinton. He has the tendency
to put the script aside and go off on his own,'' Edmonds said.
``It's disconcerting at first. But now I understand it's not
something that reflects on the writers. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``When you become a speech writer, you pretty much have to leave
your ego at the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the soft-spoken practitioner of an anonymous art admits
to taking some pride in recently becoming the first African
American to lead the White House corps of speech writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I don't stake my claim to fame on my race but on my
abilities and my track record. But this is an historic appointment
and I recognize that,'' he said. ``My feeling is that I want to be
an example to young African Americans, especially African American
males, that you can rise to great heights if you believe in
yourself, if you have a spiritual foundation, if you don't limit
yourself in any way and keep a positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Clinton named the 49-year-old Edmonds to
replace his veteran chief speech writer, Michael Waldman, who
decided to leave the administration. Since 1997, Edmonds has been
associate commissioner for public affairs at the Social Security
Administration, but earlier he worked in the White House Office of
Speech Writing, including a stint as deputy director. At the start
of the administration, he wrote speeches for Donna Shalala, the
Secretary of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Still unpacking at his new office in the Old Executive Office
Building across from the White House, Edmonds reflected this week
on his personal journey from an impoverished childhood to a seat in
Oval Office meetings and on the selfless skills involved in putting
eloquent words in someone else's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Cherry Hills and other public housing projects on
the tough streets of South Baltimore. His biological father left
when he was young. Along with a sister and two brothers, he was
reared by his mother and stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had somewhat of a tumultuous relationship back then,'' he
said. ``They have since calmed down and are a very loving couple
now. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Books were a refuge for me as a child growing up in the inner
city. I sort of escaped into the world of words,'' he said. His
mother brought home ``a series of classics'' _ Robinson Crusoe,
Treasure Island, Robin Hood.
</P>
<P>
   He read the Bible, too, and heard sermons every Sunday. The
Presbyterian Church played a large role in his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always determined to rise above the circumstances that
we were in,'' he said. ``Some of (this ambition) I can't explain
but a lot of it comes from my mother and her dedication to her
family and her encouragement. She always told us we could go as far
as we want to be whatever we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the first in his family to graduate from college _ Morgan
State University, an historically black college in Baltimore. His
sister later earned a master's degree. He worked in public
relations and as an aide to Kweisi Mfume, then a Democratic
congressman from Maryland who is now president of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   His first full time speech writing job was for Shalala, he said.
``For me, the greatest speech giver was Martin Luther King. I would
hear the voice of Martin Luther King as I was writing. I quickly
learned that everyone is not Martin Luther King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't speak in long, flowing, run-on sentences
that are eloquent and poetic. Some people are more direct, short,
to the point, concise. I learned that Secretary Shalala preferred
that type of speech. It took me awhile to turn off the voice of
Martin Luther King in my head and get the voice of Secretary
Shalala right.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the White House, he had to quickly ``understand the
voice'' of the president _ ``get to know the nuances of his speech,
the way he talks, the language that he uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The job entails more than pretty phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just wordsmiths,'' he explained. ``In this
administration, the speech writers have had more of a voice at the
policy-making table. We are included in policy meetings (and are)
asked to bring more than just words to the table. But the finished
product isn't ours. The finished product is the president's.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds manages a staff of five speech writers. He also attends
meetings with the staff and president to ``get the message right''
for the speeches. The pace can be grueling.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Clinton delivers ``three or four speeches a day for
weeks at a time,'' he said. ``This president is undoubtedly the
most loquacious in history.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, in the cable TV era of ever-shortening news cycles,
the number of presidential speeches is increasing in reaction to
more demand for information coming out of White House, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds demurs when asked about memorable words that he has
penned and Clinton delivered. Such disclosures should come only
after an administration leaves office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He does have a list of the ``most gratifying speeches I've
worked on.'' At the top is the commencement speech Clinton gave at
Edmonds' alma mater in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a thrill to go back and to have him mention me in the
speech and to see the pride in the eyes of the president of Morgan
and of the students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his other favorites were the speech Clinton delivered at
the University of Texas in Austin in 1996 on the day of the Million
Man March of African American men on Washington _ ``when he first
laid out his vision for racial reconciliation in the country'' _
and the eulogy Clinton gave for Barbara Jordan, the former Texas
congresswoman. After the Jordan eulogy, he said Clinton called him
and described ``how well it was received.''
</P>
<P>
   From William Safire in the Nixon administration to Peggy Noonan
in the Reagan White House, presidential speech writers often have
moved on to other writing triumphs. Edmonds isn't sure what's ahead
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a lot of time to think about life after the
White House,'' he said. ``We've got 18 months to go.''

 OLDER WORKERS FIND LITTLE OPPORTUNITY IN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gene Nelson, an experienced computer programmer,
has been looking for work for two years. High-tech companies say
they desperately need computer programmers. It would seem like a
perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson has had only a few interviews and no job offers.
</P>
<P>
   A Ph.D. in biophysics who has been programming computers since
the early 1970s, Nelson has sent out hundreds of resumes and
attended dozens of job fairs. He has lowered his salary sights from
$50,000 to $40,000. Now, he says the mid-$30,000 range would be
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the dynamic nature of the high-tech industry, Nelson has
been careful to update his skills and has taught himself several
computer languages, including Java.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the education, the experience and the skills, but I
never seem to be the person they're looking for,'' he says from his
home in Carrollton, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson scoffs at the claim of the Information Technology
Association of America (ITAA), an organization representing
high-tech firms, that there are 400,000 unfilled software
engineering and computer programming jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and other programmers say high-tech companies could find
plenty of engineers if they were willing to hire older workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no shortage of high-tech workers,'' Nelson says.
``There's a shortage of high-tech workers under the age of 35.''
</P>
<P>
   William Payson, who runs SeniorTech Inc., a Campbell,
Calif.-based company that helps high-tech workers over the age of
35 find jobs, agrees. There is ``out-and-out discrimination'' in
the industry against older engineers, according to Payson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies don't want older workers, and the managers make
sure these people are not hired,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He says companies want young, cheap workers fresh out of college
who are willing to work 12-hour days for half the salary expected
by more experienced workers.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics show the trend. Four out of five employed
programmers are 44 years or younger, according to the ITAA.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech industry representatives say part of the reason for
the low number of older programmers is that many of these workers
migrate to sales and management positions after working for a
company for several years. They also say that as programmers get
into their 30s and 40s, many of them are unwilling to work the 12-
and 14-hour days that are common in the computer software industry.
</P>
<P>
   John Palafoutas, spokesman for the American Electronics
Association, a Washington-based group representing electronics
companies, says firms would like to hire older engineers but that
they often lack the ``cutting-edge'' skills needed for current
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the speed of this industry, companies simply don't have
time to train people for six months before they start work on a
project,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Palafoutas and other employer representatives say the lack of
skilled workers threatens the health of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   They point to a 1998 U.S. Commerce Department study predicting
that the information technology industry will need an additional
1.3 million skilled workers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the talent drought continues, the entire national economy
may feel the effect of lost wages and slowed innovation ... and the
competitive advantage that the United States has long held in
technology may be at risk,'' the Commerce Department report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech industry's calls for more workers has been heard
in Washington, where Congress is considering expanding a visa
program that already allows tens of thousands of foreign computer
professionals into the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   The program, established in 1990 to allow high-tech companies to
quickly bring in foreign workers with special skills, currently
allows 115,000 workers into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has proposed raising the cap to
200,000, a move enthusiastically supported by the industry
</P>
<P>
   ``These workers are needed to ensure the growth of America's
most important industries,'' Gramm says. ``High-tech, highly
skilled people create jobs. They don't take jobs away from
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But engineering groups and computer experts say the visa
program, known as H1-B, is a way for high-tech companies to import
cheap labor and to avoid hiring experienced American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about who has the `cutting edge' skills,'' says Norm
Matloff, a computer science professor at University of California
at Davis. ``This is about who costs less _ people with experience
or people without experience,'' Matloff says.
</P>
<P>
   Qualified workers can be quickly trained in new computer
languages _ usually in less than two months, Matloff says. He adds
that most of the foreign workers also need training in the latest
skills.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 breakdown of Census Bureau data showed that 37 percent of
college graduates in the U.S. work force were age 45 or older,
according to the National Software Alliance, a Washington-based
consortium of high-tech industry, government and academic
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But among computer scientists and programmers, only 23 percent
were 45 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The over-55 age group constituted 12 percent of the total
college-educated work force but only 5 percent of the information
technologies field, the analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a
Washington-based group with 330,000 members, has found that for
every year of age, it takes an unemployed engineer an average of
two weeks longer to find a job. In other words, a 45-year-old is
likely to stay unemployed 40 weeks longer than a job seeker who is
25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kostek, president of the institute, says the industry's
push for more foreign workers is simply a way to ensure a constant
supply of young, cheap labor and to avoid retraining older workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, a whole new crop of eager workers lines up at their
door,'' he says. ``It's great for (high-tech companies), but
doesn't really do much for the American engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Popescu, a computer scientist in San Francisco, an
expansion of the H1-B program could mean that his two-year job
search becomes much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu thought his future was secure when he earned a computer
science degree from San Francisco State University in 1992. But
after turning 30 years old, he started to see a change in the
attitude of prospective employers toward his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the sudden, I didn't have the right experience, or the
right skills,'' he said. The job offers slowed to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Now at 35, he has searched for more than two years for work but
has had only a few interviews and no job offers to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could understand not getting some of the jobs, but my
background fits so many of the openings that I don't see how I
could not be right for any of them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu worries that an increase in available foreign workers
will make employers even more reluctant to hire older, American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hire an experienced worker, when you can get another
person who will work for half as much,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Collins, executive vice president of InTECH Staffing, a
national information technologies staffing firm in Dallas, Texas,
says part of the problem is that companies want so-called ``plug
and play'' professionals who can jump into a project immediately
with no training.
</P>
<P>
   To find these people, he says, companies often ``raid'' other
firms for workers with specific skills, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Collins says, companies worry that if they hire and
train a person, that worker will take the knowledge to another firm
after only a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Kostek says that fear of losing workers is an important reason
why employers favor H1-B workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the visa holders, who are allowed to remain
in the country for up to six years, can work only for the firms
that sponsor their H1-B visas. In addition, they must rely on their
sponsor firms to process the paperwork needed to secure a green
card, or work permit for immigrants, which eventually can lead to
permanent citizenship _ the goal of most H1-B workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kostek, this means that firms have little fear that
these workers will leave their employment, which allows the
companies to train them without worrying about whether they will
take a better job offer elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, these people are indentured servants, who serve out
six-year terms,'' Kostek says.
</P>
<P>
   For some engineers, the attitude of high-tech companies toward
older, experienced workers has changed the way they view their
future in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   P. Scott Horne, a 29-year-old computer programmer for a
Minneapolis-based firm, says he has already started making plans to
move into his company's management or sales divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying in programming just isn't realistic,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While he believes the move will allow him to remain a part of
the industry, Horne says he and many other engineers and
programmers who make the switch would prefer to stay in their
chosen field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into management may seem like a step up, but it's really
a step out,'' he says. ``I didn't study computer science because I
wanted to be a manager or salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Matloff believes the often short careers of software engineers
and programmers threatens the future of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   He says students considering electrical engineering or computer
science degrees may decide to go into other professions that offer
better long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to find fewer and fewer people willing to earn a
four-year degree that will get them a job for maybe ten years, if
that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu agrees, saying he would advise college students to think
twice about becoming a software engineer or computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say look at me,'' he says. ``I'm 35 years old with a
degree in computer science, and I can't even support myself.''

the low number of older programmers is that many of these workers
migrate to sales and management positions after working for a
company for several years. They also say that as programmers get
into their 30s and 40s, many of them are unwilling to work the 12-
and 14-hour days that are common in the computer software industry.
</P>
<P>
   John Palafoutas, spokesman for the American Electronics
Association, a Washington-based group representing electronics
companies, says firms would like to hire older engineers but that
they often lack the ``cutting-edge'' skills needed for current
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the speed of this industry, companies simply don't have
time to train people for six months before they start work on a
project,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Palafoutas and other employer representatives say the lack of
skilled workers threatens the health of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   They point to a 1998 U.S. Commerce Department study predicting
that the information technology industry will need an additional
1.3 million skilled workers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the talent drought continues, the entire national economy
may feel the effect of lost wages and slowed innovation ... and the
competitive advantage that the United States has long held in
technology may be at risk,'' the Commerce Department report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech industry's calls for more workers has been heard
in Washington, where Congress is considering expanding a visa
program that already allows tens of thousands of foreign computer
professionals into the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   The program, established in 1990 to allow high-tech companies to
quickly bring in foreign workers with special skills, currently
allows 115,000 workers into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has proposed raising the cap to
200,000, a move enthusiastically supported by the industry
</P>
<P>
   ``These workers are needed to ensure the growth of America's
most important industries,'' Gramm says. ``High-tech, highly
skilled people create jobs. They don't take jobs away from
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But engineering groups and computer experts say the visa
program, known as H1-B, is a way for high-tech companies to import
cheap labor and to avoid hiring experienced American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about who has the `cutting edge' skills,'' says Norm
Matloff, a computer science professor at University of California
at Davis. ``This is about who costs less _ people with experience
or people without experience,'' Matloff says.
</P>
<P>
   Qualified workers can be quickly trained in new computer
languages _ usually in less than two months, Matloff says. He adds
that most of the foreign workers also need training in the latest
skills.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 breakdown of Census Bureau data showed that 37 percent of
college graduates in the U.S. work force were age 45 or older,
according to the National Software Alliance, a Washington-based
consortium of high-tech industry, government and academic
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But among computer scientists and programmers, only 23 percent
were 45 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The over-55 age group constituted 12 percent of the total
college-educated work force but only 5 percent of the information
technologies field, the analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a
Washington-based group with 330,000 members, has found that for
every year of age, it takes an unemployed engineer an average of
two weeks longer to find a job. In other words, a 45-year-old is
likely to stay unemployed 40 weeks longer than a job seeker who is
25.

<P>
   Paul Kostek, president of the institute, says the industry's
push for more foreign workers is simply a way to ensure a constant
supply of young, cheap labor and to avoid retraining older workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, a whole new crop of eager workers lines up at their
door,'' he says. ``It's great for (high-tech companies), but
doesn't really do much for the American engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Popescu, a computer scientist in San Francisco, an
expansion of the H1-B program could mean that his two-year job
search becomes much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu thought his future was secure when he earned a computer
science degree from San Francisco State University in 1992. But
after turning 30 years old, he started to see a change in the
attitude of prospective employers toward his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the sudden, I didn't have the right experience, or the
right skills,'' he said. The job offers slowed to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Now at 35, he has searched for more than two years for work but
has had only a few interviews and no job offers to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could understand not getting some of the jobs, but my
background fits so many of the openings that I don't see how I
could not be right for any of them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu worries that an increase in available foreign workers
will make employers even more reluctant to hire older, American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hire an experienced worker, when you can get another
person who will work for half as much,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Collins, executive vice president of InTECH Staffing, a
national information technologies staffing firm in Dallas, Texas,
says part of the problem is that companies want so-called ``plug
and play'' professionals who can jump into a project immediately
with no training.
</P>
<P>
   To find these people, he says, companies often ``raid'' other
firms for workers with specific skills, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Collins says, companies worry that if they hire and
train a person, that worker will take the knowledge to another firm
after only a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Kostek says that fear of losing workers is an important reason
why employers favor H1-B workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the visa holders, who are allowed to remain
in the country for up to six years, can work only for the firms
that sponsor their H1-B visas. In addition, they must rely on their
sponsor firms to process the paperwork needed to secure a green
card, or work permit for immigrants, which eventually can lead to
permanent citizenship _ the goal of most H1-B workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kostek, this means that firms have little fear that
these workers will leave their employment, which allows the
companies to train them without worrying about whether they will
take a better job offer elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, these people are indentured servants, who serve out
six-year terms,'' Kostek says.
</P>
<P>
   For some engineers, the attitude of high-tech companies toward
older, experienced workers has changed the way they view their
future in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   P. Scott Horne, a 29-year-old computer programmer for a
Minneapolis-based firm, says he has already started making plans to
move into his company's management or sales divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying in programming just isn't realistic,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While he believes the move will allow him to remain a part of
the industry, Horne says he and many other engineers and
programmers who make the switch would prefer to stay in their
chosen field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into management may seem like a step up, but it's really
a step out,'' he says. ``I didn't study computer science because I
wanted to be a manager or salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Matloff believes the often short careers of software engineers
and programmers threatens the future of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   He says students considering electrical engineering or computer
science degrees may decide to go into other professions that offer
better long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to find fewer and fewer people willing to earn a
four-year degree that will get them a job for maybe ten years, if
that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu agrees, saying he would advise college students to think
twice about becoming a software engineer or computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say look at me,'' he says. ``I'm 35 years old with a
degree in computer science, and I can't even support myself.''

NEW ROOTS FOR BLACK CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In villages across Africa, storytelling has long been
an integral part of daily life. At nights, even to this day, people
gather in circles in courtyards illuminated by a full moon and
bright stars to hear gripping tales from wise men and indelible
stories from adventurous young men who have returned to their
hamlets from faraway places.
</P>
<P>
   This and other African traditions are being kept alive in Fort
Greene, Brooklyn, which for years has been a mecca for black life
but which within the last three years has experienced an
extraordinary burst of cultural energy.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry readings have become ubiquitous, performed at spots like
the Brooklyn Moon Cafe and Demu Cafe, both on Fulton Street, and at
the BAM Cafe on Lafayette Avenue, where the famous and
not-so-famous share their works with the crowd. The poems address
themes of love and race, and for many residents they spring from a
cultivated African-American identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Paul Robeson Theater, on Greene Avenue, also offers poetry
readings, as well as plays like a recent production of ``For
Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is
Enuf,'' by the poet Ntozake Shange. And haunts like Brooklyn Mod
and Sol Restaurant and Bar, both on DeKalb Avenue, feature
rhythm-and-blues, Caribbean and African music, some of it live,
increasingly attracting a crowd from across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Live music is most common at the BAM Cafe, but the new bars hope
to capitalize on neighborhood talent to create a more vibrant
scene.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the 135-year-old Brooklyn Academy of Music,
which has made its name as a center for cutting-edge arts programs
like the Next Wave Festival, has reached out to the surrounding
neighborhood with programs on black culture.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the academy, which is just south of Fort Greene,
opened the BAM Rose Cinemas, a 750-seat theater that is the
borough's first art house, as a testament to the area's cultural
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This neighborhood has a lot of creativity and energy,'' said
Gabrielle Kersaint, executive director of the Haitian Women's
Program, a social services agency in nearby Park Slope and a
resident of Fort Greene. Ms. Kersaint, who recently attended a
poetry reading at the Brooklyn Moon Cafe, hoping, she said, to
``get inspired to write creatively,'' added: ``There are a lot of
writers around here. It's nice to see a lot of black folks in the
neighborhood doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Greene, shaped roughly like a triangle bordered by
Washington Avenue in the east, Fulton Street in the southwest and
Myrtle Avenue in the north, was originally home to a predominantly
upper-middle-class white population, but has long maintained a
middle-class black presence.
</P>
<P>
   From 1880 to 1930, Fort Greene contained about a third of
Brooklyn's black residents, giving rise to the term ``Brooklyn's
black belt.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, the area declined as ornate brownstones
were carved into rooming houses. Urban renewal programs later
eroded some of the neighborhood's physical fabric, and crack and
other drug dealers made it a dangerous place. Today, deep pockets
of poverty remain, and the area's housing projects have one of the
highest infant-mortality rates in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in its worst days Fort Greene was somewhat of a
cultural center, home to artists like the jazz singer Betty Carter
and the painter Ernest Crichlow, and more recently the filmmaker
Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee moved a few years ago to the Upper East Side of
Manhattan, the neighborhood's latest rebirth can be tied directly
to him. Lee based his film company, 40 Acres and a Mule, in Fort
Greene in the mid-1980s, when it was better known for its crack
trade than for its creative tradition. The neighborhood was the
setting for some of his films and has since attracted other
directors.
</P>
<P>
   With the revival, Fort Greene stands to challenge Harlem as the
pre-eminent center of black life, at least in New York, if not
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shops and restaurants have sprouted, injecting
commercial vitality. Many of the new businesses have distinctly
African themes, like hair salons that specialize in weaves and
dreadlocks and Moshood Creations on Fulton Street, named for its
Nigerian-born proprietor who designs the fashions. The shop offers
traditional African prints integrated into modern wear.
</P>
<P>
   Moshood also contributes to the buzz of Fort Greene. Every day
in front of the shop live mannequins model the fashions, creating a
bit of street theater that draws crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural neighborhood in that the shop owners really
focus on making them artistically appealing,'' said Selma Jackson,
a co-owner of 4W Circle of Art Enterprise, an art and fashion
boutique. ``It's like an adventure when you come here; there's so
much to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Some new businesses seem imported from SoHo, like the Simbi Art
and Stone, which sells Haitian art and sculpture on Fulton Street,
and the sleek Lucian Blue Restaurant and Bar on Lafayette Street.
And changes in the neighborhood have drawn young, black
professionals from the film, music and art worlds and from Wall
Street. Real estate values have risen, as once-decrepit brownstones
have been restored.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because of the new energy, many local people find the name Fort
Greene, in honor of the Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene,
a bit too bland and outdated. In keeping with their home's newfound
hipness, some residents and merchants refer to their enclave as
Bogolan (pronounced bogo-LAN), an abbreviation of bogolanfini,
which means ``mud cloth'' in the Bambara language that is widely
spoken in Mali. The fabric is worn by dignitaries in the Sahelian
region of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Fred G. Williams, 41, an architect who has lived in Fort Greene
for 20 years, said, ``I've seen a lot of attempts over the years at
improving this neighborhood, but this is the first time we've had
such a large influx of quality stores and restaurants to complement
the brownstones.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It's really important for a neighborhood to have
these things. They tend to foster a greater sense of community
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of the attractions of ``Bogolan.''
</P>
<P>
   Potent Poetry
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Moon Cafe is one of the most popular spots in Fort
Greene on Friday nights. The tiny den attracts people from around
the corner, and from as far as Atlanta, who come to recite or
listen to poetry readings.
</P>
<P>
   With its weather-beaten walls, a few water-damaged spots on the
ceiling, a piano that looks as if Cab Calloway himself had struck a
few notes on it during his heyday and a worn-out floor, the cafe
has a faux-antique air, but it is genuine. The black creative elite
congregate here.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday night, people began milling inside the cafe
at about 9. Some were frantically writing and rewriting their poems
for the readings at 10 or 10:30. Others were more casual, chatting
and catching up on the latest gossip. On most Fridays, the crowd
flows out the front door onto the sidewalk and Fulton Street. The
habitues seemed relaxed, suggesting that they had done this over
and over.
</P>
<P>
   The first act that night was a petite woman, Traci Currie, who
was introduced as ``T C.'' Ms. Currie appeared nervous as she began
her recitation at a hurried pace, but she eased into the
performance and, like every other poet that night, acted out every
word, as if she were appearing in a one-person Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   She stepped up front, grabbed the microphone, took a deep breath
and held the microphone high. She raised her head and began her
poem, ``New Generation,'' which challenges the notion of racial
superiority and other stereotypes:
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Created to raise up in fists the way Hitler professed a
nation of Aryans to conquer a racially or culturally identifiable
group that really ain't no different than by linguistic
semantic-ism, romanticism or utopianism, as in up here _ the
mind(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   When she finished, there was no applause, just finger snapping,
a Blue Moon tradition. Cafe etiquette dissuades the conventional
cheers in deference to people in the apartments upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like most is that this is not just a reading, but
a performance,'' said Charles Witherspoon, 28, a Fort Greene
resident and regular at the readings. ``You feel connected to the
artists. Their motion and facial expressions are captivating.''
</P>
<P>
   Being Neighborly
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Brooklyn Academy set out to answer critics
who argued that in a push to draw audiences from Manhattan, it had
ignored the residents in its home borough and surrounding
neighborhood. One of its efforts was the BAM Cafe, on the second
floor of the academy's main building, which started a series of
performances on Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The program has included a reading by the poet Nikki Giovanni
and appearances by Brooklyn artists like Tracie Morris, a poet;
Brandon Ross, a guitarist, and Graham Haynes, a cornetist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BAM scene was cultivated out of a burgeoning black
cultural scene in Brooklyn,'' said Ms. Morris, who lives in Fort
Greene and has performed her poetry at the BAM Cafe about five
times. ``It's great that BAM is investing in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The events usually draw 100 to 200 people, most from Fort Greene
and nearby Clinton Hill, Park Slope and Prospect Heights, all
within walking distance. In the fall, the academy plans to add a
Thursday night show, said Limor Tomer, program director at the BAM
Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe, which seats about 500 people, has an intimate
ambiance. With red brick walls, the space has an assortment of
couches and love seats, bistro tables and cane chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's other effort was the BAM Rose Cinema, which
features avant-garde and foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, the cinema has been attracting the crowd
envisioned when it opened in November. It recently featured a
retrospective of Spike Lee's films, with Lee leading two
question-and-answer sessions on opening night. Bringing Lee back to
his old neighborhood was a way for the academy to connect with the
community and attract more people.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now a 365-day-a-year operation,'' said Karen Brooks
Hopkins, the president of the academy. ``It's really important that
the community is part of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing a Double Take
</P>
<P>
   Few people would consider a fashion boutique a place for
theatrical performance. But for the last few years, the store
window of Moshood on Fulton Street has been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The show in Moshood's modest window consists of live mannequins,
an oddity that is effective advertising and has become part of the
tour for local residents and tourists. The models have puzzled
schoolchildren, stopped passers-by and prompted drivers to slow
down and wave.
</P>
<P>
   Every day lithe young men and women take turns sitting pretty on
a high-backed wooden chair or leaning majestically against a fence.
They stand still like statues, glowing under a bright light, then
simultaneously twirl and pout to show off Moshood's latest
African-inspired couture.
</P>
<P>
   Since the store opened five years ago, Moshood has been the host
of fashion shows and free jam sessions. The live mannequins began
as a gimmick when the store's owner, Moshood, cajoled a few models
from fashion shows to replace the wooden mannequins, and now
aspiring models stroll in asking for a stint.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have lived through Fort Greene's ups and downs,
the latest rebirth has been made so much sweeter by watching the
reactions of those who moved out during the bad times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them can't believe their eyes,'' said Ms. Jackson of
4W Circle of Art Enterprise. ``All they can say is, `Wow.''' &QL;

   Paul Kostek, president of the institute, says the industry's
push for more foreign workers is simply a way to ensure a constant
supply of young, cheap labor and to avoid retraining older workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, a whole new crop of eager workers lines up at their
door,'' he says. ``It's great for (high-tech companies), but
doesn't really do much for the American engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Popescu, a computer scientist in San Francisco, an
expansion of the H1-B program could mean that his two-year job
search becomes much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu thought his future was secure when he earned a computer
science degree from San Francisco State University in 1992. But
after turning 30 years old, he started to see a change in the
attitude of prospective employers toward his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the sudden, I didn't have the right experience, or the
right skills,'' he said. The job offers slowed to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Now at 35, he has searched for more than two years for work but
has had only a few interviews and no job offers to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could understand not getting some of the jobs, but my
background fits so many of the openings that I don't see how I
could not be right for any of them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu worries that an increase in available foreign workers
will make employers even more reluctant to hire older, American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hire an experienced worker, when you can get another
person who will work for half as much,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Collins, executive vice president of InTECH Staffing, a
national information technologies staffing firm in Dallas, Texas,
says part of the problem is that companies want so-called ``plug
and play'' professionals who can jump into a project immediately
with no training.
</P>
<P>
   To find these people, he says, companies often ``raid'' other
firms for workers with specific skills, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Collins says, companies worry that if they hire and
train a person, that worker will take the knowledge to another firm
after only a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Kostek says that fear of losing workers is an important reason
why employers favor H1-B workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the visa holders, who are allowed to remain
in the country for up to six years, can work only for the firms
that sponsor their H1-B visas. In addition, they must rely on their
sponsor firms to process the paperwork needed to secure a green
card, or work permit for immigrants, which eventually can lead to
permanent citizenship _ the goal of most H1-B workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kostek, this means that firms have little fear that
these workers will leave their employment, which allows the
companies to train them without worrying about whether they will
take a better job offer elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, these people are indentured servants, who serve out
six-year terms,'' Kostek says.
</P>
<P>
   For some engineers, the attitude of high-tech companies toward
older, experienced workers has changed the way they view their
future in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   P. Scott Horne, a 29-year-old computer programmer for a
Minneapolis-based firm, says he has already started making plans to
move into his company's management or sales divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying in programming just isn't realistic,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While he believes the move will allow him to remain a part of
the industry, Horne says he and many other engineers and
programmers who make the switch would prefer to stay in their
chosen field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into management may seem like a step up, but it's really
a step out,'' he says. ``I didn't study computer science because I
wanted to be a manager or salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Matloff believes the often short careers of software engineers
and programmers threatens the future of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   He says students considering electrical engineering or computer
science degrees may decide to go into other professions that offer
better long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to find fewer and fewer people willing to earn a
four-year degree that will get them a job for maybe ten years, if
that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu agrees, saying he would advise college students to think
twice about becoming a software engineer or computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say look at me,'' he says. ``I'm 35 years old with a
degree in computer science, and I can't even support myself.''

`INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE': AFTER CLIMB TO STARDOM, A TUMBLE,
THEN DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seen today, Otto Preminger's film ``Carmen Jones'' engulfs
viewers in the quaint aura of the 1950s, with Bizet's music plopped
down in a modern army barracks, where characters burst into song on
a Cinemascope screen. Even now, however, its entirely black cast
(including a young Harry Belafonte) remains a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   And one other element has not aged. When Dorothy Dandridge
sashays into view as the femme fatale Carmen, swinging her hips in
a tight red skirt and gesturing with a single red rose, she is
unmistakably a movie star. Like most stars, she conveys an
enigmatic quality: Dandridge's delicate beauty and natural elegance
add a hint of mystery to the languorous sexuality of her
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Halle Berry makes a different yet equally telling entrance early
in ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' HBO's engaging, socially
aware look at an accomplished yet tortured life. When Dandridge
arrives at the 1955 Academy Awards ceremony, an announcer
identifies her as ``The first-ever colored nominee for best
actress.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Dandridge story is encapsulated in the scene, from
the racial barriers she confronted to her ladylike presence. (Ms.
Berry's fine features and poise make her an eerie double.) And
along with her accomplishment (other nominees included Audrey
Hepburn and Grace Kelly, who won for ``The Country Girl''), there
is the personal distress.
</P>
<P>
   Preminger, then her lover, showed up with his wife; Dandridge
arrived with her sister. Everything is set up to explain who the
enigmatic Dandridge was.
</P>
<P>
   The film goes a long way toward doing that, though it is never
as dynamic as it should have been. It relies on too many tired
conventions of the docudrama, and its portrait of Dandridge is
simplified (especially when compared with the complex woman who
appears in Donald Bogle's authoritative 1997 biography).
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'' is worth watching for its
affecting performances and for the sheer drama of Dandridge's life.
As executive producer, Ms. Berry had the clout to get the film made
and, true to its title, introduce Dandridge to a generation that
never knew her.
</P>
<P>
   In the hokey narrative frame, Dandridge is making a nightlong
phone call to a friend while putting together a collage of old
photographs, which send her into flashbacks. The earliest scenes
are the liveliest. In the 1940s, as part of an act called the
Dandridge Sisters, she performs at the Cotton Club and meets Harold
Nicholas (Obba Babatunde, so memorable in ``Miss Evers' Boys''),
her future husband and part of the famed dancing team the Nicholas
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The director Martha Coolidge brings great exuberance to the
musical scenes, including Dandridge's movie appearance with the
Nicholas Brothers, singing and dancing to ``Chatanooga Choo-Choo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while her career was taking off, in private Dandridge was
being beaten by her mother's lesbian lover. Ms. Berry, who gives a
shining, controlled performance throughout, is especially strong in
these early scenes as she juggles the excitement of a new career
and love with the fearful, explosive situation at home.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern of professional success and personal sorrow lasted
for much of her life. She and Nicholas had a daughter who,
Dandridge reluctantly acknowledged, had been born brain damaged.
Soon the marriage ended.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding her rise in Hollywood is her manager, Earl Mills. Brent
Spiner (Data from ``Star Trek'') is so effective as the loyal,
lovelorn Mills that he overcomes the liability of a ridiculous red
wig. Mills is with her when, already a star, she plays a Las Vegas
nightclub and is warned not to use the swimming pool because it
would have to be drained if a black person set foot in it. She
splashes her toe in the water and soon sees black workers scrubbing
the bottom of the drained pool.
</P>
<P>
   Though such scenes depict piercing realities, they also suggest
the film's flat-footed narrative. ``You think I've never been to
the South?'' Dandridge says, ostensibly to Mills but actually to
the film's audience, during a club appearance in Miami. ``I can't
use the front entrance and I can't speak to the patrons, right?''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the characters are needlessly burnished. The Bogle
biography reveals that Dandridge could be as self-absorbed as the
next movie star, but here she is saintlier. Even Preminger (Klaus
Maria Brandauer) seems like a pussycat in private.
</P>
<P>
   When he walks out on Dandridge for good, it seems an act done
more in sadness than in racial hypocrisy or cruelty. And as good as
Ms. Berry is overall, she is too restrained to capture Dandridge's
down-and-dirty sexuality when recreating scenes from ``Carmen
Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film is straightforward about Dandridge's decline. She
never equaled her success in ``Carmen Jones'' and died in 1965 when
she was 42 from an overdose of prescription drugs. It has never
been clear whether the overdose was intentional or accidental.
Realistically, the film leaves that haunting question open.

<P>
   SHELBURNE, Vt. _ I had been enumerating the glories of the Inn
at Shelburne Farms, a country estate in Vermont on the banks of
Lake Champlain, practically since the day my friend Nate and I had
met, and now, on a summer evening three years later, we were
finally driving through the Green Mountains, an hour or so from
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   I was worried. Maybe I had oversold the place. Was Shelburne
Farms _ the turn-of-the-century dream house of Dr. William Seward
Webb and his wife, Lila Vanderbilt Webb _ as majestic and welcoming
as I remembered from my last visit four years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Nate, just back from a Maine fishing trip, would find it
pretentious, with its surrounding farmland and forests laid out
with help from Frederick Law Olmstead, and its lake and mountain
views.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the inn had changed. Maybe it had been gussied up with
Laura Ashley, stuffed teddy bears and potpourri, like so many other
New England inns. Maybe Shelburne Farms had gone quaint. We had
left Boston three hours later than planned because of last-minute
work complications. How was I going to impress my friend with his
first glimpse of Shelburne Farms when it would be barely visible in
the darkness?
</P>
<P>
   It was close to 11 p.m. when we turned onto the long, winding
gravel road that marks the beginning of the estate, at the southern
end of Lake Champlain, seven miles outside Burlington. But as we
left behind Route 7, with its dispiriting artificial lights,
fast-food outlets and strip malls, we found that the countryside
was illuminated by a full moon: the lake on one side; pastures,
woodlands and huge barns on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, rising above a grassy hill, just as I
remembered it, was the rambling, Queen Anne-style, stone and
red-brick building, with its turrets, towers and 13 chimneys.
Inside the curved and diamond-shaped windows, the lights glowed.
</P>
<P>
   Nate reacted on cue: ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   The young woman at the check-in desk greeted us warmly and
inquired about our trip. Overtired and disheveled as we were, in
shorts and T-shirts, there was a complete absence of the sort of
cool appraisal that would have greeted similarly attired visitors
at less self-assured places billing themselves as country inns.
</P>
<P>
   She asked if there was anything she could do for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starving,'' I confessed.
</P>
<P>
   She disappeared into the kitchen, and returned with a couple of
smoked turkey and cheese sandwiches on thick whole-wheat bread. The
cheese was Shelburne Farms Cheddar, made from the milk of the brown
Swiss cows grazing in the nearby pastures. The bread was from the
O'Bread Bakery, in one of the barns we had driven past.
</P>
<P>
   Once you check in at Shelburne Farms, you become part of the
household, free to wander. Beginning to feel very much at home in
the 19th century, we decided to have our midnight supper on the
south porch.
</P>
<P>
   We wandered through the main hall and the library, both rooms
with oak-paneled walls and fireplaces, and both decorated, as are
all the rooms, with the Webbs' original furniture.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to pull out one of the family's 6,000 books, perhaps an
Edith Wharton novel _ the Webbs were avid readers _ and curl up on
one of the soft, low-to-the-ground mauve and pale-green velvet
sofas. But I had a more pressing engagement with turkey and cheese.
On the porch we settled into wicker chairs and pulled up a wicker
table. The sandwiches were delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Reviving, we walked across the lawn in the moonlight, past the
clay courts that were so bright under the moon we could have played
tennis, and down to the lake lapping against the shore in the wind.
I felt soothed by the land unfolding around me and sheltered by the
mountains looming in the darkness. We looked up at the stars and
back at the inn silhouetted against the big Vermont sky.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by it all, as I was, Nate assured me that I had
brought him to the right place. Of course Shelburne Farms wasn't
pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the real thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago Vermont was hardly the country mecca for escaping
urbanites that it is today. Mrs. Webb's Vanderbilt siblings built
opulent mansions on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, in Newport, R.I.,
and in Asheville, N.C. But the Webbs, who were married in 1881 at a
high-society wedding in New York, had been captivated by Vermont on
their travels and decided to move to Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Webb's $10 million inheritance provided the cash for the
couple to buy about 3,800 acres in the Champlain Valley. Through
the late 1880s and early 1890s Webb oversaw the construction of the
family house and what became the biggest, fanciest barns in
America, transforming the land into a model experimental farm where
all the latest agriculture and horse breeding techniques could be
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Webb died in 1926, his widow 10 years later. Their youngest son,
Vanderbilt, inherited the farm, and in 1939 his son, Derick Webb,
took over as farm manager. But Derick and his family occupied
another house on the property, and the Big House, as they called
it, fell into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   With skyrocketing taxes and expenses, it became increasingly
difficult to keep up the farm, and in 1970 Derick called his six
children together on the south porch. Marshall Webb, who was 21 at
the time, remembers his father telling them that he was considering
selling 500 acres to a developer who wanted to build ``a golf
course and fancy houses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically told him that was absolutely what we did not want
to happen,'' Marshall Webb recalled when I telephoned him, after
our weekend, to ask about the meeting, which I had read about in
``The House at Shelburne Farms,'' by Joe Sherman, a book sold at
the inn. The children offered their father a deal: If the land
remained open and agricultural, they would stick around and help
out. If not, they would all leave.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of Marshall and his siblings was to preserve the land
as a working farm and turn the estate into the nonprofit
environmental center that it is today. The inn supplies the income
for the center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We were young idealists,'' Marshall Webb said. ``All we were
thinking about was that this land was too valuable to split up and
develop. We wanted it to work its magic on other people and
hopefully influence them to make sound decisions back in their
hometowns about what to do with their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   My environment at the inn _ the Webb Room, once occupied by Webb
_ certainly worked its magic on me. The day after we arrived, I
opened my eyes to an absolutely perfect morning in the country and
my ears to a bird symphony.
</P>
<P>
   I had spent the night on the carved rosewood bed of William
Henry Vanderbilt, Webb's father-in-law, one of the richest men in
the world in the Gilded Age. The room was enormous, four times the
size of a standard hotel room, large enough to take a walk in,
which I did.
</P>
<P>
   The pale green carpet matched the pale-green velvet chaise
longue and the 19th-century reproduction flowered wallpaper. There
was no minibar and no television, although the inn keeps two
televisions in a closet for emergency requests. A bank of windows
opened onto the lawn sweeping down to the lake. The outdoors
beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Nate and I had breakfast on the terrace on the lawn. He raved
over his oatmeal and dried-cherry pancakes and gobbled up a basket
of homemade croissants. I had my idea of the perfect breakfast: a
bowl of fresh fruit, plain yogurt and granola, and plenty of Nate's
syrup-drenched pancakes. We wondered aloud about the tree directly
before us on the lawn, and suddenly three waiters were hurrying
over to make the identification. It was a linden.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a morning newspaper? We sat there for two hours,
drinking the good, strong coffee and watching the peaks of the
Adirondacks emerge from the mist across the lake. Our waitress
smilingly kept refilling our cups. She would have been content, it
seemed, to have us sit there all day.
</P>
<P>
   The natural beauty notwithstanding, what makes Shelburne Farms
the successful enterprise it is today took a lot of work. After the
family meeting on the south porch, Derick Webb told his children he
was willing to become further indebted while they tried to realize
the family's dream. And so they all pitched in, fixing up
buildings, restoring barns, raising money and managing the crops
and cows. They started a summer camp for children that would
eventually become a year-round teaching program.
</P>
<P>
   When Derick died in 1984, he bequeathed all the land to the
nonprofit center, as his children, who relinquished all claim to
ownership, had hoped he would. In 1985 they began restoring the Big
House as an inn with 24 guest rooms and a dining room open to the
public. As faithfully authentic as the restoration was, and with
the inn to be closed during the winter, no thought was given to
heating. As for air-conditioning, who needed air-conditioning in
Vermont?
</P>
<P>
   As we got up from breakfast, we began planning our day. Should
we explore the cafes and markets of Burlington, Vermont's Queen
City, and ride bicycles along the path around Lake Champlain? Or
hike the extensive walking trails of Shelburne Farms? Perhaps we
could fit in a ferry ride across the lake, to the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   But nature intervened. Despite all the genuine comforts of
Shelburne Farms, we could not deny the obvious: It was hot. Really
hot, heading toward the high 90s. On the south porch, where Mrs.
Webb had once spent entire summer afternoons reading and writing
letters, we overheard another guest, a man, complaining, ``I've
never paid so much to sweat in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Our visions of hyperactivity vanished. But still I was
determined to visit the studio of Sarah Wesson, an artist whose
paintings of the Vermont landscape I was introduced to first by her
note cards and then by one of her prints, ``First Red Barn on the
Left,'' which hangs in my dining room, a gift from a friend. I'd
seen plenty of paintings of bucolic Vermont in galleries, but for
me no one captured the essence of the natural landscape _ the
motion of the clouds, the shapes of the fields, the colors _ as Ms.
Wesson did.
</P>
<P>
   We drove south to tiny Panton, passing fields of corn that swept
down to the lake shore. It was a Sarah Wesson landscape of greens,
blues and purples, earth and sky playing with the New England
summer light. We arrived at the small house at the end of a country
road and climbed the wooden stairs to her second-floor studio.
</P>
<P>
   There again were the colors, but this time they were in her
paintings: oils and watercolors that seemed to have taken their
light from the landscape outside her big windows. ``The wide open
fields here in Panton remind me of the sea,'' Ms. Wesson has
written about her work. ``Slight undulations are waves on a calm
day; the facing mountains are waves not quite broken.''
</P>
<P>
   I longed to buy them all, to bring her shimmering Vermont home
to my apartment in Cambridge. Fortunately, you don't have to be a
Vanderbilt to acquire a Sarah Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Next we headed back to Shelburne for the obligatory visit to the
Shelburne Museum, three miles from the inn, a staggering collection
of Americana, from a Shaker door-latch collection to quilts and
weather vanes, housed in 87 exhibit buildings. I was sure that the
barn, the woodworking tools and the 892-ton steamer Ticonderoga
would appeal to Nate's masculine soul.
</P>
<P>
   We had just finished touring the un-air-conditioned room packed
with dozens of fancy carriages with fur spreads, and were looking
at what appeared to be a blur of hammers in an equally sweltering
room when I said to Nate, ``I've got to get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   He, far from being seduced by the hardware, gratefully escaped
with me to the air-conditioned gift shop. Cooling off amid the
displays of scarves, cards, books and Vermont chocolates, we looked
at each other. We were both thinking the same thing: Why are we
here, why are we anywhere other than Shelburne Farms, especially
when we only have 24 hours left?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Relieved to be away from the hustle and bustle of Shelburne and
the traffic of Route 7, we collapsed into the beauty and poetry of
the place. We enjoyed a tasty picnic lunch on the south porch,
sharing a grilled eggplant sandwich with goat cheese, tomatoes and
basil, and pasta salad with arugula, feta cheese, black olives and
artichokes. We carried a Tolstoy novella, ``Happy Ever After,'' out
to the tall locust tree on the lawn _ the aforementioned linden
tree was nearby _ and read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   The heat that had been unbearable beyond the gates of Shelburne
Farms was here just a part of the atmosphere. We took a lazy walk
down to the Coach Barn, where Webb once kept his carriages, and
onto the Farm Barn, where we peeked at the goats and lambs that
delight visiting children and, on the other side, the O'Bread
Bakery, and the Cheddar cheese making operation.
</P>
<P>
   We made it back to the inn by teatime for cucumber and caviar
sandwiches, scones and lemonade. We debated whether to take a nap
or swim in the lake. We did both. As hot summer days sometimes do,
this one drifted by.
</P>
<P>
   Even modest dreams can be fulfilled at the Webbs' Gilded Era
home, and I found myself fulfilling one of my own that evening:
walking barefoot across the beautiful lawn, sipping a glass of
wine. We strolled through the formal gardens beside the lake that
Mrs. Webb had nurtured over the years, inhaling the scent of roses,
and watched as the sun melted into the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that we had been grazing since 9 a.m., we
eventually took our seats in the dining room among the other
guests. The candlelight and the Webbs' original red silk damask
wallpaper made the room feel grand and cozy at the same time. The
French doors were flung open to the night, bringing in the
fragrance of the garden and the lake breeze.
</P>
<P>
   We feasted together on a wonderful beet salad made from beets
grown on the farm. Nate devoured his roasted rack of lamb with
asparagus and mushrooms, and I polished off a filet of Atlantic
salmon with wild rice pilaf and asparagus. We shared a rich
chocolate dacquoise with raspberries for dessert. Our sense of
well-being was complete.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we did more lounging, on the south porch, the north
porch and the lawn, reading aloud and wandering around the inn. As
other guests checked out, the doors of their rooms were
deliberately left open, and we explored the Overlook, Lila Webb's
bedroom; the Rose Room, which had belonged to the Webb's only
daughter, Frederica, and the White Room, where Webb's valet had
slept.
</P>

   In the Game Room, where Webb and his friends gathered after
dinner for port and billiards, we stared at the big-game heads on
the wall. We did make one brief foray off the grounds, to the
Artisans Guild in nearby Ferrisburg, filled with paintings by local
artists, including Ms. Wesson. All too soon it was time to leave.
We took a last look at the lake, the lawn, the gardens and the
mountains beyond, said goodbye to the friendly young woman at the
check-in desk and got into the car.
</P>
<P>
   We were silent, even a bit melancholy as we headed down the
gravel road, back to traffic and tension and the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' I said to Nate, cheering up a bit at the prospect
of the fires in the 30 fireplaces, the landscape ablaze with color,
the cups of hot chocolate on the south porch, ``it's even better in
the fall.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Significant rain will fall Friday in the central Appalachians
from Pennsylvania into western North Carolina as a developing
low-pressure system crosses the mountains. The flow of moisture
from the Atlantic will enhance the showers along the east slopes
with some sections receiving more than two inches of rain by later
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will spread east to southern New England, but a dome of
dry, mild air over northern Maine should keep brighter skies and
pleasant weather over the northern half of New England. A
freshening onshore breeze will keep readings below seasonal levels
near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of strong thunderstorms should develop over the
Carolinas in a wedge of sultry air ahead of an approaching cold
front. Hail and damaging winds are possible in some communities,
especially in east-central North Carolina. More thundershowers will
erupt in the steamy air over the South. Thunderstorms will be more
numerous in southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will persist over lower Michigan and the Ohio Valley as a
large disturbance in the jet stream settles into the region. Very
pleasant late summer weather is expected in the Middle West, but
hotter air will return to the western Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The monsoon will be very active with afternoon thundershowers
from Arizona and New Mexico into Wyoming and Idaho. A few potent
storms will drift into Kansas and northern Texas. The West Coast
will notice more clouds and it will be seasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tricky Winds
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday a hurricane-hunter aircraft measured
tropical-storm-force winds at Veracruz, Mexico, about 90 nautical
miles south of the center of a tropical depression over the Bay of
Campeche. Yet the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm. The
reasoning was sound. Veracruz is located at the top of the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec, where the Bay of Campeche narrows markedly. Thus,
when winds blow from the north, they must funnel into the area,
causing them to accelerate. So Thursday's strong winds were more a
function of the lay of the land than the strength of the tropical
system.

   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In Gulfport, Miss., this week, school officials at Harrison
Central High ordered Ryan Green, a Jewish student, to wear his Star
of David tucked inside his shirt. They feared the six-pointed star
resembled a gang symbol and refused him permission to display it.
</P>
<P>
   His father explained that the Star of David represented the
boy's faith,akin to a Christian wearing a cross. The school still
refused.
</P>
<P>
   This act of ignorant discrimination should shock all
Americans,especially as it followed the shooting at the Jewish day
care center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, like all Americans, is protected by the Constitution to
freely express his religious beliefs. A Star of David hardly
symbolizes violence. In the post-Holocaust world, it embodies faith
and suffering in the face of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi officials appear to have confused the six-pointed
Star of David with the five-pointed pentagram often favored by
violent gangs and Satanists.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups also use upside-down or twisted crosses. Will
Mississippi school authorities forbid Christian students their
crosses because they resemble satanic symbols?
</P>
<P>
   In a religiously diverse society, we all need to understand such
symbols and their meanings. For a faithful Jew to wear a Star of
David is one thing; for a member of a white supremacy group to wear
it, another. The Jew intends it as a witness to faith. The white
supremacist intends insult to that faith. One display is welcomed
by civilized people; the other (although protected in some
instances by the Constitution) is not.
</P>
<P>
   If Judaism confuses school officials in Mississippi, what if an
American Indian student had appeared on the first day of class
wearing a swastika? Would anyone have understood that in his
religion this ancient symbol conveys blessing and not
anti-Semitism? Would they have assumed him a Nazi? If Buford Furrow
had worn the same swastika while shooting at the Jewish community
center, it would carry an entirely different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a culture full of conflicting religious symbols. When
they collide, we tend to respond as the Mississippi authorities.
Hide them. Tuck them away. Do not display your beliefs in public.
We strip the public square of crosses, crescents, and stars and
threaten legal action if another faith offends us.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy seems, however, to have failed. Radically
privatizing faith has contributed to greater misunderstanding and
prejudice. Tucking faith away has relavitized all religions to
``personal belief systems.'' If recent events in Littleton and Los
Angeles prove anything, they prove that all faiths are not equal.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, especially conservative members of Congress,
believe that putting faith back in school will solve our problems.
But whose faith? Christianity? Judaism? Buddhism? Nazism?
</P>
<P>
   Religion should be expressed in public institutionsbut neither
as some nostalgic return to dogmatism nor an all-out conflict
between ``equal'' religions. We need to learn to live together with
difference while finding common morality in our diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Good teachers are key in this national task. Although not
allowed to share their personal faith in public-funded
institutions, we endow all teachers with the responsibility to
teach critical thinking, to discern between truth and falsehood
(yes, even in a pluralistic culture).
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who teach ``irrelevant'' subjects like philosophy,
religion, literature, poetry, history, and fine arts, find
ourselves daily immersed helping students sort through issues of
meaningboth the beliefs of others and their own spiritual quests.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally or not, teachers mentor students and help them
choose good over evil. We are a kind of secular clergy, diverse and
pluralistic among ourselves, still idealistically hoping for a
better world.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Green's act of faith can teach us all what kind of nation
we need to become. And a world religions course for Mississippi
school officials probably would not hurt, either.

   FILM-MICKEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ In interviews promoting the gangster romantic comedy
``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' Hugh Grant has often been quoted as saying
that he rewrote his character and his lines to make both funnier.
He might as well say that he rescued the film, because without him,
it would have sunk like a pair of cement boots. Even with him, it
just barely keeps its humorous head above water. By ROBERT PHILPOT.
Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL;

<P>
   FILM-HUGH GRANT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Despite a plethora of interviews accompanying his new
film ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' Hugh Grant has plenty to say, much of it
humorous, often at his own expense. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story will
move in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ILLUMINATA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ For movie fans who want something a little more
sophisticated than ``American Pie,'' John Turturro's theater-world
satire ``Illuminata'' is a textbook example of ``Be careful what
you ask for _ you might get it.'' Here's a film that's smart, often
funny, unconventional and unpredictable. It's also pretentious,
often boring or crude, bizarre and meandering. By ROBERT PHILPOT.
Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-TRICK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Trick'' is tricky. On the one hand, this gay
romantic comedy about two guys falling in love as they attempt to
have a one-night stand is sweet and amusing. On the other hand,
it's kinda ordinary. The odd thing is, the ordinariness works for
it as well as against it. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-XIU XIU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Not every movie set in the '70s has a cast lifted from
Entertainment Weekly's list of hot young actors, peeking through
bad shag wigs and coping with the angst of being different, man!
``Xiu Xiu, the Sent Down Girl'' _ the directing debut of actress
Joan Chen (''The Last Emperor'') _ reflects another kind of exile.
It's the story of a teen-aged girl in China, the smart, curious and
free-thinking Xiu Xiu (Lu Lu), who's shipped off to the countryside
_ sent down _ for Communist indoctrination. And, in a low-key way,
it has an almost painful directness. The dialogue tends to point
things out, as if it were actually written by the Communists. By
ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-TINGLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ With his writing for ``Scream,'' ``Dawson's Creek,''
``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and ``The Faculty,'' Kevin
Williamson has made a career out of irony. Not content with
employing it, he is now defining irony for us. In his directorial
debut, the teen-age dark comedy ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' he tells
us (over and over) that irony is ... an outcome different from what
was expected. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL;

Instanbul, the city in which I crossed the threshold from
adolescence to adulthood and acquired a veneer of cosmopolitan
sophistication, flooded me when I read the news of the devastating

only way to explain the widely divergent views of Microsoft Corp.
that are emerging from the ever-expanding crop of books being
written on what has become the world's most valuable company. It's
only natural that a company worth $500 billion _ as Microsoft was

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is difficult to respect presidential candidates
who lack the courage to say whether they believe in evolution or in
creationism.
</P>
<P>
   The former is the underlying principle of biology and other
sciences and the latter is a literal interpretation of the biblical
account of the rib, the snake and Adam and Eve.
</P>
<P>
   If our putative leaders don't believe in evolution, their
know-nothing attitude in the White House could endanger our very
national survival. If they do, their failure to defend it reflects
a scary indifference toward education and our ability to compete in
the high-tech, super-informed world of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Yet three leading Republican presidential hopefuls expect us to
honor and maybe elect them despite their professed indifference
toward the fundamental factual evidence tracing the development of
human life.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes
ducked this week when confronted with questions about the Kansas
Board of Education's decision to eliminate evolution from the state
school curriculum and to encourage teachers to lecture on the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Their answer, phrased in practically identical words, was
``leave it to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a great governing philosophy when applied to practical
problems best addressed at the local level, such as police
deployment and the distribution of welfare funds. But that is not
what we are dealing with here. This is about whether to teach our
young the central organizing principle of all biological science.
</P>
<P>
   In poll after poll, education ranks as the highest priority of
American voters. A secular nation about to enter the 21st century
requires the practical knowledge about the complexities of the
universe that comes from scientific study. There is an important
role for spiritual guidance in our church-going nation, but it must
be complementary rather than supplementary.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, Dole and Forbes didn't get it. They allowed as how
they would let local officials determine what to tell our young
people about the origins of life rather than endorse the extensive
paleontological, biochemical, geographical and other factual
evidence upon which the scientific community relies.
</P>
<P>
   The three candidates are so intimated by the religious
conservatives that they are not willing to contest the Kansas
school board's suggestion that Charles Darwin was a jerk who held
nutty, unverifiable theories no better than anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Will our political heroes tell us they can't decide
whether the Earth is flat or round? What if some school board
somewhere declares Lucy, the famous 3.2 million-year-old Ethiopian
mummy once admired by President Clinton, to be a fraud made of
plastic?
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas School Board justified its retreat from scientific
reality by noting that since ``no one was present when life first
appeared on Earth,'' any theory about it is just a guess, including
the process of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   This nonsense did not offend our GOP trio, although it outraged
the National Academy of Sciences, the state's university presidents
and educators everywhere. The trio's bland acceptance of eyewitness
accounts as the only possible evidence of evolution is frightening.
Haven't they ever heard of fossils? Carbon dating? Discoveries of
cachesof 2.6-million-year-old humanoid tools?
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that Forbes, who panders to religious
conservatives, would cower behind states' rights on a hot subject
in the Bible Belt. He said ``in terms of evolution, there's a huge
debate now ... so I'll trust the parents on that one ... leave it
to local parents and local school boards.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a ``huge'' debate on evolution, most of us have
missed it. Religion and evolution can comfortably co-exist. Some
religions interpret the Bible literally but many more teach it as
an allegorical tale with a timeless spiritual message. The ``day''
in which God created Earth, for instance, may not have been 24
hours but several billion years. His divine supervision remains the
same.
</P>
<P>
   It is the cowardice of Bush and Dole, however, that is horribly
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them know better. Both have been making a big deal of
appealing to centrist voters who are uncomfortable with narrow,
intolerant religious dogma. Both were well educated at Ivy League
colleges where the process of evolution is unquestioned and new,
challenging evidence welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet asked if he is a creationist, Bush did not deny it. He told
USA Today that ``I believe children ought to be exposed to
different theories about how the world started.'' In effect, he
dismissed evolution as just another ``theory,'' of no more weight
than Uncle Henry's notion that the moon is made of green cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also weaseled when asked if she personally believes the
literal biblical explanation of how the world was created. ``This
is a state issue,'' she said. ``I'm a person of strong faith and
each person just has to ... parents can teach their children the
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman who has been promising us straight talk. She
says she wants to look people in the eye. How can she do that and
pretend that it's OK to produce a generation of dumb kids by
failing to teach them evolution in science classes?

   Here are Anne Stevenson's reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO OTHER BOOK &QL; 
 &UR; By Randall Jarrell &QL; 
 &UR; (HarperCollins, $27.50) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer remembered much about writing ``The Woman at the
Washington'' ``Zoo'' _ a poem is, so to speak, a way of making you
forget how you wrote it _ but I had almost all the sheets of paper
on which it was written, starting with a paper napkin from the
Methodist Cafeteria. If you had asked me where I had begun the
poem, I'd have said: `Why, sir, at the beginning'; it was a
surprise to me to see that I hadn't.'' This charming passage
introduces Jarrell's essay about the work for which he won a
National Book Award in 1961, and little gems such as it are
everywhere in this collection of criticism and prose. Part of the
pleasure is that you seem to stumble on them unawares, but, of
course, that's an illusion _ such things are never so accidental.
Perhaps it's because Jarrell died in 1965, and his essay
collections have been out of print. More likely, it's because, as
volume editor Brad Leithauser points out, Jarrell was deeply
passionate about the rewards and challenges of literature and
deeply generous in his attention to them. Jarrell notes, for
example, that Marianne Moore's poems ``judge what is said about
them almost as much as poems can so that even one's praise is
hesitant, uncertain of its welcome.'' When you've read William
Carlos Williams' ``Patterson,'' he says, ``You know for the rest of
your life what it is like to be a waterfall.'' And Malraux ``writes
a passage of ordinary exposition so that we breathe irregularly and
jerk our heads from side to side like spectators at a tennis
match.'' Other subjects include Robert Frost, W.H. Auden and
reading itself. ``Mediocrity,'' he writes, ``may often give us
unqualified pleasure; it does not disturb our self-satisfaction but
rather encourages us with the thought that we are as good as
another. . . . Properly speaking, we learn only from those books we
cannot judge.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GONE BOY &QL; 
 &UR; By Gregory Gibson (Kodansha, $24) &QL; 
On Dec. 14, 1992, Gibson's 18-year-old son, Galen, was killed by a
fellow student at a small college in Massachusetts (the murderer,
Wayne Lo, went on a random shooting spree that left four people
wounded and two dead). With the dreadful phone call that woke them
that night, Gibson, his wife and their younger children embarked on
a process that all parents dread, one that took them through
disbelief, anger, confusion, frustration and obsession. Gibson
filed a lawsuit against the college (its staff had intercepted
ammunition that Lo had ordered through the mail, then passed it on
to Lo unopened), but the case dragged on until Gibson was so filled
with rage that he felt capable of murder himself. He set out to
free himself, in a sense, by looking at the facts of his son's
death and writing this book. In it, he interviews witnesses, Lo's
friends, attorneys, the gun dealer who sold Lo his weapon _ and
finds himself reacting to them in surprising ways. But the climax
of his book comes when he meets the parents of Wayne Lo _ sweet,
wounded people whose son, like Gibson's, is lost to them. Sad,
sometimes funny, beautifully written (Gibson is an antiquarian book
dealer) and ultimately triumphant, this is the story of a father's
journey through grief and his refusal to be destroyed by it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ONE YEAR OFF &QL; 
 &UR; By David Elliot Cohen  &QL; 
 &UR; (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We read the parts about Italy first and were dismayed to learn
that Cohen was so cowed by Italian drivers that in Florence he
actually paid one of them to park his car for him. This did not
bode well for our enjoyment of his book, and sure enough, we found
it to be a bit of a trial. Here's the hook: Cohen turned 40 and,
sensing a midlife crisis on the horizon, decided he should sell his
small publishing business and his house, take his kids out of
school (the oldest was 8) and spend a year traveling around the
world. His wife agreed to this, which seems shockingly adventurous
for people who can't park a car in Florence. But we digress: This
book is a collection of ``adventures, anecdotes and minor
epiphanies'' from their year off, served up as e-mail letters they
sent to their friends. Some of it is great fun. Some of it is . . .
well, ``kid'' anecdotes, which as we all know are entertaining in
direct proportion to your degree of affiliation with the kids in
question. Kara and Willie were bored at a volcano in Costa Rica but
fascinated by the ubiquitous dog poop in Paris, and Cohen has
quotes to prove it. More interesting is the fact that the family
traveled more than 50,000 miles in 13 months for less money than it
would have cost to live in California for that time. And they'd do
it again in a heartbeat despite the ennui and the dog poop. This is
not a true travel book, but if you have kids and are looking for
inspiration, it might be for you. &QL; 
 &UR; ANNE FRANK &QL; 
 &UR; By Melissa Muller (Owl, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muller's biography of Frank, new in paperback, includes
references to five previously unpublished pages of Anne's diary in
which she criticizes her parents' marriage and expresses her wish
that the diary be kept out of her family's hands. Anne's father
kept these pages separate from the rest of her diary and gave them
to a friend just before his death in 1980. News of their existence
caused a stir last year, and holders of the Anne Frank copyright
denied Muller permission to quote them directly. That seems shoddy
in light of the final pages of this book, which contain a note from
Miep Gies, the woman who helped the Frank family during the two
years when they were in hiding. How did she find the courage to do
it? ``Of course, it takes courage to do one's duty as a human
being, of course, one has to be prepared to make certain
sacrifices,'' she writes. ``But that's true in many of life's
situations.'' &QL;

ONCE MORE, BUGS BUNNY ONE HOP AHEAD OF TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Bugs Bunny may be politically incorrect, but he won't
be bounced from the Canadian airwaves after all.
</P>
<P>
   The wascally wabbit got off with a paw-slapping this week after
being hauled before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council for
insinuating that women are ``witches.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bugs first uttered the offending remark 45 years ago.
But his misogyny is only now catching up with him.
</P>
<P>
   A formal complaint against Bugs was lodged with the
quasi-judicial tribunal by an Ontario woman angered by the closing
line of the cartoon ``Bewitched Bunny,'' which has aired hundreds
of times in Canada and the United States since its release by
Warner Brothers in 1954, apparently without previous complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The animated yarn is a Looney Tunes twist on the fairytale
classic ``Hansel and Gretel.'' In it, Bugs saves a pair of kids
from being gobbled by the wicked witch, then, just on the verge of
getting cooked himself, douses the hag with magic powder _
transforming her into a very nubile female bunny.
</P>
<P>
   After cavorting a bit, the cartoon pair amble off arm-in-arm
into the sunset. Instead of just thanking his lucky rabbit's foot,
though, Bugs looks back over his shoulder with what might be fairly
described as a leer, saying, ``Ah sure, I know! But aren't they all
witches inside?''
</P>
<P>
   That was just too much for a female viewer in Toronto,
identified in news reports as Judith Hansel, who fired off a
missive to the Global Television broadcast company in July 1998
after being ``horrified'' by the hijinks on The Bugs Bunny and
Tweety Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Televising this anti-woman cartoon demands that you personally
offer a televised apology to woman viewers,'' she wrote, insisting
the apology be read at the start of the evening national newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Bell, Global's director for regulatory affairs,
responded with a letter saying the company was sorry the viewer was
offended, but denying the cartoon was demeaning to women.
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied, the angry watcher filed a formal complaint with the
Broadcast Standards Council, Canada's TV watchdog body, charging
that Bugs was not just a carrot-chomping wiseguy but a violator of
the industry's Sex Role Portrayal Code.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cartoon gives a wrong idea that all females are evil and
destructive... and that women are evil inside,'' her complaint
stated.
</P>
<P>
   It looked liked curtains. But wily old Bugs, as he has so many
times since making his cartoon debut in 1938, once again managed to
hippity-hop his way out of trouble _ barely.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal allowed that he's a hare-brained troublemaker, all
right, and way out of step with the times. But he hadn't broken
Canadian television content rules. Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is undeniable innuendo in the closing line... which some
may find offensive,'' the six-member panel wrote in a
densely-worded report officially closing the case. ``That being
said, the Council is not of the view that a breach of the broadcast
Code it administers is entailed.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that again, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, bottom line: Bugs walks.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that the world's most recognizable
rabbit has roused ire. Several Bugs Bunny cartoons are no longer
aired because they rubbed people the wrong way with racial or
ethnic stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian case apparently marks the first time Bugs has
faced formal charges of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been complaints about insensitive characterizations
in old cartoons such as this one, but I don't know of any other
serious attempt to silence Bugs Bunny,'' said Stephen Charla,
curator of the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Created by animator Chuck Jones, the smartmouthed rabbit
features the voice of Mel Blanc and, in addition to cartoons, has
appeared in comic books, motion pictures and newspaper strips.
</P>
<P>
   The panel that ruled on Bugs's fate consisted of two former TV
station managers, a lawyer, a self-styled ``feminist media
activist,'' a filmmaker and a television producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a fence-sitting decision,'' said Ron Cohen,
national chairman of the Broadcast Standards Council, telling the
Ottawa Citizen that Bug's remark ``wasn't a positive thing to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Global TV, meanwhile, is happy to see the long-eared star escape
the regulatory briar patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the tape, it's done so tongue-in-cheek, the way
it's presented could never be offensive to women,'' Bell told
Canadian reporters. ``We're happy with the decision. That's all,
folks.''

   We live in a culture full of conflicting religious symbols. When

to Ryan Green and his Star of David. Hide them. Tuck them away. Do
not display your beliefs in public. We strip the public square of
crosses, crescents, and stars and threaten legal action if another
faith offends us. That strategy seems, however, to have failed.

A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME SHOWING OF SARGENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston is in a tizzy over Sargent this summer. A
traveling retrospective, ``John Singer Sargent,'' already seen in
Washington and London, is making its final stop at the Museum of
Fine Arts, and three smaller shows are on view elsewhere. Even
enthusiastic natives are finding it all a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent was born in Italy in 1856; his parents were expatriate
Philadelphians. But Boston has always embraced him as an adoptive
son, and not without reason. He put in quality work time here. He
whipped up portraits of the local swells, notably Isabella Gardner,
whom he depicted as a wasp-waisted bodhisattva with a smeary face
and milky skin. He produced his only mural cycles _ three of them _
for the city. He considered them his highest monument.
</P>
<P>
   The murals, all still in place, are getting a lot of attention
these days, not because they are things of undying beauty (they
aren't), but because they complicate the usual image of Sargent as
a souped-up van Dyck, a Gilded Age yuppie with a magic touch and
not much else. Highly socialized, in love with surfaces of every
kind, he was never the mystery-wrapped-in-an-enigma type. But the
murals suggest that he had his depths, intellectual and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   One cycle is permanently installed in the Museum of Fine Arts
itself. In 1916, Sargent created paintings and sculptural reliefs
for the building's main rotunda. Partly to complement the
neo-classical architecture, he concocted allegorical scenes related
to art: ``Architecture, Painting and Sculpture, Protected by Athena
From the Ravages of Time.'' That sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   The results were an instant hit. Sargent was asked to do more
and eventually came through with 20 paintings _ executed on canvas
in the studio, then glued into place _ and 18 reliefs. He was about
to sail from London to Boston to install the last paintings when he
died in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has cleaned the ensemble, and it looks great, really
seeable for the first time in years. What does one see? A curious
melange of Classical muscle, Baroque attitude and contemporary wit.
(Sargent is rumored to have used touring ``Ziegfeld Follies'' girls
as models for some of his peplos-clad maidens.)
</P>
<P>
   All of Sargent's murals have a straitjacketed feel. He developed
a new, clean-lined style for them, which was brave of an artist at
mid-career. But the painterly brio that had made his name and
remained his strong suit was left out.
</P>
<P>
   That's why these projects look most dynamic in their planning
stages, as a wealth of preparatory studies in the retrospective
suggests. A nude oil sketch of Thomas McKeller, the black Boston
hotel worker who posed for many figures in the rotunda paintings,
including that of Apollo, carries a thrill of sensuality that the
finished murals lack.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Public Library
</P>
<P>
   Of the three mural cycles, the most ambitious and interesting is
also the hardest to see. Titled ``Triumph of Religion'' (1890-1919)
and covering the walls of the so-called Sargent Gallery on the
third floor of the Boston Public Library, it is in desperate need
of cleaning, repair and relighting, all of which the library plans
to undertake at some unspecified future date.
</P>
<P>
   The task will be a ticklish one: the murals are an intricate mix
of paintings and reliefs in varying states of decay. No less
complex is the now-obscured thematic program, which dramatizes a
fanciful historical transition from Judaism to Christianity, with
figures of pagan gods, Hebrew prophets and Spanish Madonnas folded
in.
</P>
<P>
   The whole cycle was meant to conclude with a painting of the
Sermon on the Mount, though this was never executed. Sargent, who
had a horror of controversy, was accused of using anti-Semitic
stereotypes in the mural and dropped the project. But even
incomplete and with serious conceptual flaws, ``Triumph of
Religion'' is an impressive thing, the work of an erudite if
somewhat conventional thinker who was also a virtuoso technician.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest view of the murals is to be found not on the walls
but in vitrines. As part of the exhibition ``Sargent in Context,''
there is a modest display of documentary material in the Sargent
Gallery itself. A dozen or so Michelangelesque figure drawings are
in cases downstairs. An exquisite oil and graphite study, tucked
away in a vestibule not far from the murals, shows how the Sermon
on the Mount might have appeared in situ. The design is lucid; the
colors are bright.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University
</P>
<P>
   The third ``Boston'' mural cycle, and the smallest, is in
Harvard's Widener Library. A memorial tribute to lives lost in
World War I, it consists of two tall vertical panels, ``Death and
Victory'' and ``Coming of the Americans'' (1921-22), set on either
side of a central staircase.
</P>
<P>
   The war hit Sargent hard; a beloved niece was killed in a
bombing raid in France. He caught a sense of its waste in the
monumental 1919 painting ``Gassed,'' commissioned by the British
War Memorials Committee and on view in the retrospective at the
Museum of Fine Arts. The Harvard murals aren't in this league. With
their strapping soldiers and stagey allegorical figures, they are
scaled-up propaganda posters. Even critics at the time seem to have
thought so.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rough draft that retains the sap of life, as one sees
in ``Sargent in the Studio: Drawings, Sketchbooks and Oil
Sketches,'' organized at the Fogg Art Museum by Miriam Stewart and
Kerry Schauber. The bulk of these treasures were given to Harvard
by the artist's two sisters, and mural studies, some of them
knockouts, are the focus of the selection here.
</P>
<P>
   But another Sargent is present, too, the artist whom everyone
knows, some people are mad for and history will probably remember.
This is the Sargent of the portraits: formal, in the case of an
evanescent watercolor of the ultrachic Virginie Gautreau, better
known as Madame X, and informal in seductive studio drawings of the
young working-class men who served as his favored models.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the artist who, in watercolors as fleet as snapshots,
captured family and friends snoozing on country picnics. There is
the somewhat less familiar painter of landscapes: a view of an
Alpine glacier in the Fogg show, executed when Sargent was 14, has
the sparkle of a cut diamond.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gardner Museum
</P>
<P>
   Mature work in this genre has been gathered in ``Sargent: The
Late Landscapes'' at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (where,
incidentally, the immense ``El Jaleo'' (1882) is permanently
installed). These paintings, like the murals, seem to have been the
artist's attempt to distance himself from portraiture and to fully
explore progressive terrain already mapped out by figures like
Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the landscapes, executed on trips to Europe, the Near
East and the Canadian Rockies, play the Impressionist game, as in
the oil-on-canvas ``Yoho Falls'' (1916), a half-abstract jumble of
rocks and mists conjured up in stabs and spatters and relieflike
ridges of paint.
</P>
<P>
   But Impressionism was old, old news by this time; in Paris,
Cubism had already reached its golden age. Whether Sargent's late
landscapes represent a new direction for him, or simply confirm
that his gracile hand and eye for light could adapt willy-nilly to
any subject, remains a matter for debate. There is little debate,
however, that the concentration of Sargent's art in the Boston area
this summer is a rare and possibly once-in-a-lifetime event.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Anyone bent on one last Sargent fix can find it in a diminutive
but very pretty show of his paintings and drawings, ``John Singer
Sargent,'' at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine, an hour or so
north of Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artist's trademark subjects are in place: Venice and
the Alps, well-heeled clients (Mrs. Henry St. John Smith and her
boyish but sad-looking husband), and a few old friends. One of them
is Elise Meyer, who is seen in a pencil sketch here but who appears
with her mother and brother in a traffic-stopping family portrait _
Sargent made them all resemble some fabulous species of orchid _ at
the Museum of Fine Arts.

   DIVERSE SOCIETY MUST UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT ITS RELIGIOUS
SYMBOLS, by Diana Butler Bass
</P>
<P>
   We live in a culture full of conflicting religious symbols. When
they collide, we tend to respond as the Mississippi authorities did
to Ryan Green and his Star of David. Hide them. Tuck them away. Do
not display your beliefs in public. We strip the public square of
crosses, crescents, and stars and threaten legal action if another
faith offends us. That strategy seems, however, to have failed.
Radically privatizing faith has contributed to greater
misunderstanding and prejudice.

 &HT;    Grant's affable-guy shtick takes a hit in `Blue Eyes'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer experiences culture clash when he
finds himself married to the mob, literally, in ``Mickey Blue
Eyes.'' Call it a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant plays Michael Felgate, a courteous chap who's
surprised when his girlfriend, Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn), calls off
their relationship after he pops the question. The reason: Her
family are all members of the mob, and she's afraid Michael will
get drawn into their web.
</P>
<P>
   Gina's father, Frank (James Caan), warmly welcomes his
prospective son-in-law. But, sure enough, Michael soon finds
himself doing little ``favors'' for colleagues of the family. It's
around this point that the movie slips its moorings, accumulating a
body count and also a tone that wobbles between farce and thriller.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Analyze This'' took mafia cliches and gave them a '90s
update, the makers of ``Mickey'' don't seem to realize that their
jokes are treadworn. So is Grant's one-trick performance as an
elegant bumbler. He's terrific at it, yes; but it's time to show
more range. Tripplehorn doesn't help him any; her fretting
performance squelches the comedy. But Caan is enthusiastic, and the
great gallery of mafioso faces includes gravelly Burt Young as
Vito, head of the Graziosi family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' (which is the name Michael goes by when he
has to pretend to be a mob member) is the second movie produced by
Grant's girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley. The first was ``Extreme
Measures,'' a medical thriller that let Grant switch gears into
drama. It tanked at the box office. That's a shame, because the new
movie seems designed to present the prepackaged Grant persona, the
professional, shrinking male virgin of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey
</P>
<P>
   Blue Eyes''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan and Jeanne Tripplehorn. Rated
PG-13 for brief strong language, some violence and sensuality. At
metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An awkwardly manufactured mob comedy.

`RUN CATCH KISS': GENERATIONAL PROFILE? NO, IT'S THE SEX, STUPID 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little-known event that took place around the time that
Richard M. Nixon was resigning as president was the birth of Amy
Sohn, the ingenuish author of ``Run Catch Kiss,'' a clever,
awkwardly hip, flimsy novel of Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   The sociological astrology of Ms. Sohn's birth deserves some
attention here, especially in light of the consciously vapid
concupiscence of her book, which evokes the life and fantasies of a
young sex columnist for a downtown alternative weekly in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The birth date question seems relevant for several reasons. One
is that Ms. Sohn has emerged as a representative of her generation,
those comfortably nihilistic, politically disengaged, economically
anxious urbanites about whom so much has been written.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Ms. Sohn actually is a sex columnist, for The New York
Press, a conservative alternative weekly published in Manhattan,
and the fact that there are sex columnists these days is perhaps a
not extremely subtle clue to the spirit of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is the theory of the end of history, which also
means the end of world-historical causes and meanings. A
concomitant to the end of history is a kind of spiritual inversion
in which sex, for example, along with a cynical, solipsistic
self-satisfaction, replaces the outward-looking idealism that was
once characteristic of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I don't believe in generational determinism; not all
people in their 20s inhabit Ms. Sohn's world of detached,
hedonistic bohemianism. Still, there is something about her career
so far that suggests a mini-Zeitgeist, and ``Run Catch Kiss'' is a
good emblem of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clever and witty book, but it is also more a collection
of fragments, held together by a slender strand of plot, than a
fully formed novel.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is sex and longing. More specifically, the subject
is a young woman's desperate efforts to: 1) make it in the downtown
world of New York, 2) find true love, and 3) while she's waiting,
have lots of sex: sex about as mysterious and spiritually
fulfilling as brushing your teeth. The Spenglerian gloom-and-doom
forces among us would lament that after 3,000 years of civilization
it has come to this.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bright and funny side to ``Run Catch Kiss,'' mostly
in the fact that Ms. Sohn is a talented woman who writes with an
energetic self-mockery. There are many clever moments in her
picaresque tale of an updated Holly Golightly whose unhinged sexual
experiences are material for her newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   The woman in question is a recent Brown graduate named Ariel
Steiner who falls into writing her sex column for a politically
conservative downtown newspaper called City Week. The sex is mostly
unfulfilling, but Ariel needs material, so she keeps on trying to
get it, even as she worries about what her parents _ liberal and
permissive, but there's a limit! _ will think.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the sex is not very good is that the young men
involved in Ariel's life are far too self-absorbed and egotistical
to be of much use. This gives Ms. Sohn some pretty good satirical
targets. Her story about the boyfriend who snorts heroin so
casually he has no idea how transgressive it is serves as a
commentary on the bland unawareness of Ariel's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown Rag Cans Fibbing Squibber'' is the tabloid headline
when Ariel is fired from her job as sex columnist after her editors
discover she has been making up some of her sexual adventures.
That's not only an on-the-mark tabloid headline but also a
well-aimed dart at a kind of introverted journalistic idealism,
like a thief getting morally outraged when his pocket is picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think how baseball is kind of like sex, because it's not a
consistently high-energy sport,'' Ariel muses as she watches the
1996 World Series in a bar. ``There are these intermittent surges
of excitement every once in a while, followed by a steady lull for
a few minutes, until the next surge comes again.'' Ms. Sohn's Brown
University composition instructor would have given a high mark for
that.
</P>
<P>
   There is some fun here, in other words. Ariel, who is Ms. Sohn's
narrator, likens herself to Dorothy Parker and Fran Lebowitz, and
one senses more than a little autobiographical projection in this.
Who knows? Maybe that thinly disguised prophecy will hold true. But
so far, despite the fun to be had in ``Run Catch Kiss,'' Ms. Sohn
hasn't arrived yet.
</P>
<P>
   This novel is also bit like Ariel's baseball: It has a few
surges, but mostly it is tedious in its adorable, hapless,
nervously brash one-note-ness.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from her few acidulous comments on her cohort's collective
consciousness, Ms. Sohn doesn't have much to say even as she
recycles herself as material, no longer for a sex column but for a
sex novel. At the end of the century, after Henry Miller, Philip
Roth, Erica Jong and others who have exploited the sexual
confessional mode, she seems not only imitative but palely
imitative as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here again Ms. Sohn provides material that she aims at others
but that could just as well be aimed at herself. At one point Ariel
is talking about her drug-addict boyfriend, complaining that all he
talks about is ``what geniuses Hunter S. Thompson, Carlos Castaneda
and Jim Carroll were.'' But, she says, ``a girl can hear only so
much about Thompson, Castaneda and Carroll before she starts to get
a little bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a reader can also have enough of unmodulated erotic
bravado. What ``Run Catch Kiss'' needs is some psychological or
moral depth to go with its slick, commercially oriented wit and
bawdy energy. One sees in this book the beginnings of a
generation-specific satire, but only the beginnings. And in a
novel, unlike a newspaper column, the beginnings are not enough.

 &HT;    Shedding light on theater's magic
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the purpose of this review, let's agree that the world can
be divided into two sorts of people: those who are stage-struck and
those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-filmmaker John Turturro firmly belongs in the former
group. So does anyone interested in checking out his new movie,
``Illuminata.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in turn-of-the-century New York, Turturro's film chronicles
the shenanigans _ more offstage than on _ of a diverse theater
company. Center stage is their leading lady (Katherine Borowitz,
Turturro's real-life wife), a woman of radiant talent, glowing
cheekbones and infinite patience when it comes to her beloved, the
company's egotistical, temperamental in-house playwright
(Turturro). Much to the chagrin of the company's directors (Beverly
D'Angelo and Donal McCann), she insists that her next vehicle be
his not-yet-finished new play _ a play that may never be finished
at the rate he's going.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other members of the troupe (Ben Gazzara, Rufus
Sewell and Bill Irwin, among others) have their own agendas. As do
visiting Big Names: Susan Sarandon, as a purringly self-assured
diva, and Christopher Walken as a snottily acrimonious critic. Not
surprisingly, most of the action unfolds on a single night, when
numerous seductions are either consummated or fail.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie _ probably too much for the non-stage-struck _
is fussy and self-consciously ``theatrical.'' Further, director
Turturro has a weakness for whiteface tableaux _ the sort of thing
that worked in ``Children of Paradise'' but not here.
</P>
<P>
   But again, anyone who's ever yielded to the roar of the
greasepaint will savor the film's flamboyant and heartfelt
theater-is-life/life-is-theater contrivances. There are plenty of
juicy lines (``In `Hamlet,' everyone dies: Now that's a play!'')
and juicier performances. Aside from Borowitz _ who owes her
husband just about anything he wants for showcasing her so well _
there's Sarandon, who has a fine time overacting and making
overripe proclamations along the lines of ``I have always acted. I
am my own double.'' Every bit as effective is the occasional quiet,
uncluttered moment of theatrical magic, as when the late, great
Irish actor McCann softly delivers a monologue from ``The
Tempest.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCann speaks, we're all a bit stage-struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illuminata''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Turturro, Katherine Borowitz, Susan Sarandon and
Christopher Walken. Rated R for langauge, nudity and sex.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: For the stage-struck only.

Journal-Constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM)40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest moneymaker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM)1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger''PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace'' PG-13 (violent content, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes,
</P>
<P>
   Kate Beckinsale and Bill Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers prison drama. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale
sweat it out in a Thai maximum-security pit after being duped into
dope smuggling. Unbearably high-minded, the movie doesn't even have
the B-movie juice of an old babes-behind-bars melodrama. (SM)1
hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' R (brief nudity, sexuality, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Furlong
</P>
<P>
   and Sam Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss it off. This lame rip-off of Robert Zemeckis' ``I Wanna
Hold Your Hand'' chronicles the misadventures of four die-hard Kiss
fans as they try to crash their idols' concert. Set in 1978, the
film has a few amusing nostalgic touches, but mostly it's a sorry
collection of adolescent fantasies that look almost quaint compared
to what else is going on in teen movies this summer. (ERG)1 hour,
30 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick'' PG-13 (profanity, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst,
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Williams
</P>
<P>
   and Dan Hedaya.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams play teen girls who
unwittingly bring down Richard Nixon's White House in this mix of
``Clueless'' and ``Forrest Gump.'' Too bad the movie's target
audience won't get most of the Watergate jokes, and that the
movie's first half has a dangerously uncertain tone. (SM)1 hour, 30
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM)2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,

<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. Somebody's got to
turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and disguised as an
A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is an over-directed,
overwritten and ultimately underwhelming whodunit B-grade thriller.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Illuminata'' R (profanity, sex and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Turturro,
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Borowitz ,
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Christopher Walken.
</P>
<P>
   For the seriously stage-struck. John Turturro's film chronicles
the shenanigans of a turn-of-the-century New York theatrical group.
The company's leading lady (Katherine Borowitz) has both radiant
talent and infinite patience when it comes to her beloved's
(Turturro) unfinished play. Susan Sarandon has fun as a purringly
self-assured diva. A bit fussy and overdone, but there are moments
of magic. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' R (profanity, violent creature attacks,
</P>
<P>
   gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Pullman,
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes watchable, underpopulated ``Jaws'' retread
about a giant crocodile, the croc attacks are predictable and
rudimentary. This is the sort of movie in which no one but bit
players get their heads bitten off. Pity. The scares aren't scary,
the laughs aren't funny, and poor Bridget Fonda has to keep falling
off moving vehicles directly into the path of the monster croc,
like some 1940s hapless heroine. (SM)1 hour, 22 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant,
</P>
<P>
   James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' PG-13 (comic action violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess! Ben
Stiller and Janeane Garofalo headline a ragmuffin team of superhero
wannabes. But the movie is mostly like its hapless heroes _ kind of
clumsy and good intentioned but with none of the knack it takes to
save the day, or itself. (SM) 2 hours, 1 minute. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains
</P>
<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG) 2 hours, 10 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax ... It's Just Sex'' (Unrated, but contains profanity,
nudity,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mitchell Anderson
</P>
<P>
   and Jennifer Tilly.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Anderson, Jennifer Tilly and Lori Petty star in this
big ensemble comedy-drama about a group of gay and straight friends
in Los Angeles, falling in and out of love. The repartee and
observations are often sharp and witty, but midway through the
movie loses its center and its focus. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Franka Potente
</P>
<P>
   and Moritz Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this
adrenalin-fueled German flick is the big-screen love child of every
video game and MTV quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
Franka Potente plays the flame-haired woman who has 20 minutes to
run through Berlin in search of 100,000 marks, or lose her lover.
In German with English subtitles. (SM)1 hour, 21 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger,
</P>
<P>
   Longer &AMP; Uncut'' R (profanity, gross-out humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   It offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and also funniest) bit of celluloid to
ever make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty
cultural artifact that captures the here and now of American media
obsessions, circa 1999. It should be put inside a time capsule.
(SM)1 hour, 21 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM)2 hours, 11 minutes.
C+

   ``Tarzan''G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 28 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   teen drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Helen Mirren,
</P>
<P>
   Katie Holmes, Barry Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Marisa Coughlan.
</P>
<P>
   It barely makes a passing grade. Three high school kids take
their evil history teacher hostage in her home and then try to
figure out how to get out of the mess they've created. It ends up
being a wishy-washy remake of 1980's silly ``Nine to Five.'' As the
tied-up teach, Helen Mirren is pretty good. Her young co-stars,
however, fail to match her talent. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The Imax film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``trick'' R (sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and mature themes)Starring Christian Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and John Paul Pitoc.
</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' PG-13 (action violence,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith,
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer, this tale of 1800s agent
James West, based on the old TV show, is a bizarre mix of
overproduced camp, sloppy pacing and tepid scripting. Will Smith
and Kevin Kline have zero sparks of buddy chemistry. ``Wild Wild
West'' is anything but wild. It's a washout. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska)41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps,
</P>
<P>
   Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship is what sets this movie apart from the usual genre
pigeonholing of African-American cliches and becomes something much
more universal. It's a male-bonding flick that transcends issues of
race. (SM)1 hour, 46 minutes. B

 &HT;    `Teaching' needs better lesson plan has flawed lesson plans
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As high school movies go, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' barely makes
a passing grade. It never gets a firm grip on what it is. High
school horror flick? Smart-aleck teen hostage tale? Nasty-nice
Disney movie with devilish undertones?
</P>
<P>
   Gifted actress Helen Mirren stars as high school history teacher
Mrs. Tingle. She's a born-to-be-bad one _ the kind of testy,
high-minded, hard-grading instructor who openly puts down her
students. Her greatest joy is making them feel worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Across the classroom sits Leigh Ann (Katie Holmes), the
hard-working student needing one more A to make class valedictorian
and land a much-needed college scholarship. And the charmer Luke
(Barry Watson), whom she secretly loves. And her gal pal Jo Lynn
(Marisa Coughlan), who has her sights set on being a mega movie
star.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of misunderstandings and mishaps, these kids
ultimately take Mrs. Tingle hostage in her own home _ a fairly posh
one for a teacher _ tying her to her bed and then spending several
days figuring out how they're going to get out of the mess they've
just created. Otherwise, how is poor Leigh Ann going to get to
college?
</P>
<P>
   As if anybody will care.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Kevin Williamson (aka Mr. ``Scream'') has made,
in effect, an end-of-the-century remake of that silly, fluffy 1980
Lily Tomlin-Jane Fonda-Dolly Parton comedy ``Nine to Five.'' Only
not nearly as witty and never as funny.
</P>
<P>
   Mirren gallantly makes a go of it. She's testy, manipulative,
conniving and, by midway into the movie, quite convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and Watson seem to be here because they're young WB stars
_ she of ``Dawson's Creek'' and he of ``7th Heaven.'' Their main
contribution is a fairly lusty roll in Mrs. Tingle's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it's the moment at which most kids in the audience will
sit up and take notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tingle''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson and Marisa
Coughlan. Written and directed by Kevin Williamson. Rated PG-13 for
thematic content, violence, sexuality, language and teenage
drinking. 1 hour, 35 minutes.

<P>
   The verdict: Go to the back of the class.

 &HT;    For new friends, `trick' is finding spot to be together
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Jim Fall's new film ``trick'' may not be a huge treat,
but it's a sturdy and often well-acted example of post-AIDS,
post-``queer''-bashing cinema.
</P>
<P>
   In this romantic comedy, the characters' sexuality isn't the
only thing that's a given; so is a prominent aspect of gay single
life. That is, while lots of guys are looking for true love, on any
given night they'll certainly settle for a quickie with a real
cutie (actually, a good many straight singles feel the same way).
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel (Christian Campbell), an aspiring musical-comedy writer,
is a real cutie in a sort of fresh-faced, dimpled Mousketeer way
(we're talking the Annette era). Mark (John Paul Pitoc), however,
is more than a cutie. He's a well-muscled hunk of boy-toy who
dances at a local bar wearing little more than a smile and a skinny
pink thong.
</P>
<P>
   The two pick each other up, both clearly intending nothing more
than a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But that's the rub.
Mark lives in one of the outer boroughs of New York, so Gabriel's
Greenwich Village place is the obvious choice. Unfortunately, it's
occupied _ first by his ditsy best friend (Tori Spelling), who's
busily photocopying her resume, then by his boorish straight
roommate, whose girlfriend has just returned from Europe. For the
rest of the movie, Gabriel and Mark roam the streets. Every time a
possible solution arises, so does an obstacle (that's why some
reviews have compared this to ``After Hours,'' a shaky comparison
at best).
</P>
<P>
   ``trick'' becomes more endearing as its simple lust story turns
into a simple love story. Forced to get to know each other before
sex, they learn some surprising things. Further, director Fall uses
their nighttime odyssey as an amusing insider's tour of gay Chelsea
and Greenwich Village. Stops along the way include a piano bar
where everyone knows every show tune ever written and a crowded
disco where shirtless men dance to Helen Reddy's ``I Am Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What weakens the picture is that, as it goes along, the
obstacles become more and more contrived. After a point you begin
thinking, hey, fellas, why not just spring for a hotel room? Still,
Campbell (Neve's brother) and Pitoc are pleasant company, and their
self-revelations are appealing.
</P>
<P>
   One final problem: Spelling seems to think that going the indie
film route will do for her career what it's done for Christina
Ricci and Lisa Kudrow. One small difference: They can act.
</P>
<P>
   ``trick''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc. Directed by Jim
Fall. Rated R for sexuality, language and mature themes.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Appealing romantic comedy about two gay guys
looking to make love in all the wrong places.

A TALK WITH THE DISARMINGLY CHARMING HUGH GRANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most newspaper and magazine stories about movie stars like to
pretend that they're the only ones covering the subject. We are not
going to do that to you with Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   At one point this month, photos of Grant graced the covers of
Esquire, Detour and Entertainment Weekly. During the past couple of
weeks, he has appeared on ``The Late Show With David Letterman,''
``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' CNN's ``TalkBack Live'' and
``Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee.'' He has also spoken with dozens of TV and
newspaper reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And this is just for his latest movie, ``Mickey Blue Eyes,''
which opens Friday. Grant previously made the publicity rounds just
last May for ``Notting Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   What could he possibly have left to say? The Divine Brown
incident is old news. The rumors that he and Julia Roberts clashed
on the set of ``Notting Hill'' apparently are false.
</P>
<P>
   He and James Caan also got along on the set of ``Mickey Blue
Eyes,'' in which Grant plays an art-house auctioneer who gets mixed
up with Caan's mob figure. He helped longtime love Elizabeth Hurley
produce the movie, although he gives her most of the credit (she
charmed real-life goodfellas during research).
</P>
<P>
   And journalists are obsessed with his hair.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, though, that Grant has plenty to say, much of it
humorous, often at his own expense. So we'll let him do the
talking. Here are some observations he made during a Dallas stop.
They are best read with a British accent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Esquire cover: ``That's by far the worst cover, not only
ever taken of me, but of any human being in the history of
magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Entertainment Weekly cover: ``I look like Ellen
DeGeneres.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Detour cover: ``I look like Princess Margaret after she
had the very bad scalding in her bath.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note: We happen to think all the covers are just fine. Well,
maybe not on Detour, where Grant looks more like Christopher
Walken).
</P>
<P>
   On magazine photos, in general: ``Have you seen the picture
inside (Esquire) with me as a Fort Worth cowboy? Did you find that
particularly hilarious? They always do this thing of saying
(imitates a pretentious American photographer), `Do you want to do
something really different? 'Cause you're always in a suit, it
would be so great if you're like, crazy and wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I want to say, `Oh, p--- off. Just make me look nice.' But
then you're so tired, you give in and they bring out the spurs and
the cowboy hat.''
</P>
<P>
   On being photogenic: Even the people I hire, the PR people, are
unable to lie about some of these pictures. Particularly the girl
who works permanent for us in London. She just sits there, looking
at the contact sheets, crying with laughter at how bad my pictures
are.''
</P>
<P>
   On unfortunate show-biz slang: (Reads from a Variety review of
``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' which has just arrived by fax): ```Grant's
new vehicle should hit a commercial bull's-eye. ... bolstering the
actor's popular resurgence and solidifying his b.o. (box office)
bankability.' `B.o.'s' an unfortunate term, especially today, when
I've run out of my Estee Lauder.''
</P>
<P>
   On music: ``Music is a terrible black hole for me. I don't know
why, but I've never been good on music. I think I've got two
records to this day. One of which is `Godspell.' So I'm not exactly
a rocker. I guess I'm slightly more into it now than I used to be,
because I got quite heavily involved with the director of `Mickey
Blue Eyes.' I got quite heavily into all that Sinatra, Dean Martin
type of stuff. I listen to all that in my car.''
</P>
<P>
   On books: ``I've got to that stage now where I can't bear to
read any book by anybody younger than me. I find that too
upsetting, particularly if it's good. I don't mind if it's (junk).
If it's good, it's just too annoying.'' (For the record, Grant's
favorite writers are Martin and Kingsley Amis, Evelyn Waugh, Nancy
Mitford and Bill Bryson.)

   On rumors that he'll retire from acting and take up writing: ``I
don't know, I will have to decide then whether to put my money
where my mouth is and go and do it or not. I could say to ... my
agents and everyone, `It's over, I've stopped acting. Goodbye, I'm
off to write my bad novel.' Or I could do a halfway house, keep my
(production) company going and go and write my own script, which is
also quite tempting. Or I could just chicken out and accept this
job I've been offered with this very funny script, and shoot that
instead.''

   On his earliest fans: ``(After this tour) I go to Japan to
promote `Notting Hill' for a couple of days. ... Japan might be
fascinating. I've always wanted to go there. You know, they were
the first people to ever like me. Way, way back, way before `Four
Weddings and a Funeral,' when I did (1987's) `Maurice' with
Merchant-Ivory. I got unbelievable numbers of letters from Japanese
girls. I don't know why, they have this sort of thing about English
gentlemen. Anything English _ golf, whiskey, that sort of stuff.
And they went nuts. I used to get sackfuls of mail with origami and
stuff inside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny enough, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' _ the only country
it failed in was Japan. They apparently didn't get the jokes. They
thought it was rather a sad film.''

 &HT;    STUDENT ENROLLMENTS TO RISE AGAIN THIS FALL
 &HT;    EDS: Data for textbox or graphic at end of story
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The nation's schools and colleges will set new
enrollment records this fall, President Clinton said Thursday as he
released the government's annual back-to-school report.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic president and Republicans in Congress quickly
moved to claim that the report supported their rival visions for
the size of tax cuts and the rules for federal aid to education.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, 53.2 million public and private school students are
expected in kindergarten through 12th grade, according to the
report. That is about 446,000 more than last year's enrollment, an
increase of just under one percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another 14.9 million students up 273,000, or 1.9 percent over
last year's record are expected at two-year and four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Federal researchers expect the number of students in schools and
colleges to rise until 2006, dip slightly for three or four years,
and then begin to rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the increase is due to immigration, the lure of higher
earnings for educated workers, and the state and local funding
increases that were made possible by continued prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest single factor cited in the report is that more
members of the ``baby boom echo'' generation are old enough to go
to high school or college. They are the grandchildren of people who
had lots of children during the ``baby boom'' that followed World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no end in sight to the increasing number of young
people attending our schools, `` said Education Secretary Richard
Riley, who is expecting his 11th grandchild soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the announcement of the administration's program to
save the future for Secretary Riley's grandchildren,'' Clinton
joked to sympathetic educators gathered next to the White House in
the Old Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   He said the report reinforced his decision to veto the tax-cut
bill Republicans plan to send him next month. It would deprive the
government of revenue that could be used to finance education and
other domestic programs, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately the congressional majority wants to back off the
commitment we made to hire new teachers and build new schools,''
said Clinton, painting a nightmare vision of children who are
taught year after year in trailers parked outside overcrowded
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larger classes, fewer teachers, more trailers,'' he said. When
he repeated the phrase, it came out, ``Larger taxes, fewer
teachers, more trailers.'' Beaming, he added, ``Sounds like a
country song. I like country music, but we can do better than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans later counter-attacked vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   They said their plan to give small tax incentives for
construction bonds in all school districts was better than
Clinton's plan to give big tax incentives for construction bonds in
100 poor school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is permanent and applicable to all school districts
... not just the ones the president picks,'' said Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to let school districts mingle federal
teacher-training funds with the federal subsidies earmarked for the
hiring of 100,000 more teachers, said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa.,
chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some school districts will choose to use the funds to hire
additional qualified teachers,'' Goodling said. ``Others may decide
they would prefer to enhance the professional skills of their
existing teacher corps.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said he looked forward confidently to reaching a
compromise with Republicans ``after the August break.'' Congress
returns Wednesday Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get this worked out,'' Clinton told reporters. He said
the compromise could require Republicans to accept smaller tax
cuts, stronger protections for Social Security and more spending
than they intend for education, agriculture, medical research and
incentives for business investments in poor nations and
neighborhoods.

 &HT;    Tourists' food and trash is bad news for Smoky bears
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Holly Morris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're planning a fall trip to the Great Smoky Mountains,
beware of the black bears that populate the national park. Wild
bears in the Smoky Mountains and other national parks are naturally
afraid of people, but may turn dangerous when they learn to eat
food we humans eat. And they can smell food _ or garbage containing
food _ from far away.
</P>
<P>
   Black bears were once hunted close to extinction in the Smoky
Mountains. Protected since the park was founded in 1930, their
population has grown to more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not any place you can go in the park that there
are not black bears. We have one of the highest densities of black
bears in North America,'' says Kim DeLozier, wildlife biologist for
the park.
</P>
<P>
   One way we can help keep bears alive is by not feeding them.
Instead, DeLozier says, keep them at a distance _ from yourself,
children, pets, cabins and campsites. And never leave anything that
smells of food where bears might find it.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in bear country, put all food, food wrappers,
cooking foil and strong-smelling items such as toothpaste, soap and
shaving cream out of the reach of bears. Bear-tempting garbage
should be left in the bear-proof containers _ cans or Dumpsters _
the National Park Service provides within the park or locked up
inside a bear-proof vehicle or structure.
</P>
<P>
   Bears live a lot longer if they eat grasses, seeds, berries,
ants, acorns and other natural foods, rather than hot dogs,
Twinkies and potato chips. It's not so much a question of a
healthful diet as of preserving a healthy distance between bears
and humans. Bears that become accustomed to human food become
threats to people and to themselves: They may seek food along
roadsides until they're accidentally killed by a car, or they may
injure park visitors and have to be euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   If you find yourself face to face with a bear, the National Park
Service advises you to back away slowly (don't run) and seek
shelter in a car or a house. If the bear looks as if it's going to
attack you, get aggressive. Try to fight back with any object
available; wave your arms, and make as much noise as you can. Do
not play dead.

 &HT;    High-tech Cherokee museum mixes history, entertainment
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEROKEE, N.C. _ Computer-animated forest creatures. An
electric-light ``campfire'' that billows smoke. A ``talking rock''
that sounds out the Cherokee language in stereo. This is not your
father's Native American museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of the Cherokee Indian, a static exhibition of
baskets and arrowheads encased in glass from its opening in 1976,
got a high-tech face-lift in the summer of 1998. The $3.5 million
renovation, designed ``to mix education and entertainment,'' says
museum director Ken Blankenship, incorporates traditional artifacts
with computer animation, holograms, dioramas and audio voice-overs
to tell the history of the Cherokee people from the Paleo-Indian
period through the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   To make the museum more fun for children, Blankenship consulted
designers and artists from around the country. Among them was
Disney Imagineering, the company that designs Disney's theme park
attractions and created the set for the Alliance Theatre production
of ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen lots of kids come through here and not really learn
anything,'' explains Blankenship, who became the museum's director
in 1986. Attendance has plateaued in the past few years at about
140,000 per year; Blankenship hopes the more child-friendly
displays will draw 200,000 people annually within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The experience begins in a small theater, where visitors gather
around a smoldering ``campfire'' (computers control the flickering
lights and smoke emissions) to watch an animated video that depicts
the creation of the world from the Cherokee point of view. A
medicine man introduces the tiny water spider that brought fire to
the Cherokee people, the buzzard that beat the Earth with its wings
to make the Great Smoky Mountains and other natural legends.
</P>
<P>
   Exiting the theater, visitors stroll through time, past
pre-Columbian pottery and spears to multimedia displays such as a
``talking rock.'' Inscribed on this rough-hewn block of stone are
the characters of the Cherokee alphabet, created by Chief Sequoyah
in the early 1800s. A honey-toned voice recites the alphabet and
each character lights up in turn.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's centerpiece is the multipart display on the
Cherokee Removal of 1838. In the Chamber of Dissenting Voices,
visitors hear taped re-creations of speeches from key political
figures of the time, including President Andrew Jackson, who
favored transplanting the Cherokee tribe from western North
Carolina to Oklahoma, and Cherokee Chief John Ross, who opposed the
move. A massive mural of the Trail of Tears looms in an adjoining
room, accompanied by a taped voice that reads the names of the
thousands of Cherokees who died during the infamous march westward.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit can be an emotional experience, particularly for
people with blood ties to the Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come over here several times a year,'' says Monette Knaps,
38, of Sevierville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Stuart, 36, have Native Americans in their
family trees. Stuart's great-grandmother and Monette's grandmother
are full-blooded Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something about the area that we find
interesting,'' Monette explains. ``I guess we're trying to relive a
little bit of our past.''

 &HT;    Laid-back adventure awaits at Earthshine
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE TOXAWAY, N.C. _ The celestial-sounding name is alluring:
Earthshine Mountain Lodge. Definitely has that organically grown,
Birkenstock sandal-wearing, granola-eating ring to it. A place so
pastoral and picture-perfect rustic that L.L. Bean has photographed
two catalogs of country couture here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, first-timers never know exactly what to expect from this
back-to-nature getaway in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Take Cheryl Dunson. The Peachtree City mom was more or less
flying by the seat of her pants when she booked a weekend at the
rough-hewn retreat for herself and her 9-year-old son, Kent.
</P>
<P>
   And as it turned out, the seat of her pants took a beating:
whooshing down sliding rock on the North Fork of Flat Creek;
careening down the hill behind the lodge on baby shampoo-and-water
slicked sheets of plastic; and bouncing in the saddle atop a white
horse named Casper.
</P>
<P>
   Fanny fatigue notwithstanding, Dunson was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it an adventure,'' she says gamely, dripping and
slightly sudsy as Kent made his umpteenth turn on the slippery
slope. ``I wanted to do something different. I didn't want to do
Disney World or the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, she was a little taken aback at first that there was no
air-conditioning or locks on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   But 24 hours into the adventure, she was settling into Earth-
</P>
<P>
   shine's unhurried, carefree rhythm and, like the rest of us,
enjoying the simple pleasures _ nature hikes, catching up on
reading, striking up conversations with the other guests, telling
ghost stories, feeding barn animals and plowing into meals that
would fill a farmhand.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what happens on a Saturday night when TV is not an
option.
</P>
<P>
   After an afternoon storm left the landscape rather sodden, the
evening's plans were changed from a barnyard trek and ``fairy
hunt'' to a ``broom dance'' and circle games upstairs at the lodge.
Watching our kids prance about, trying to avoid being the one stuck
with the broom as a partner when the music stopped, was gratifying
to us parents. (Most Saturday nights, you'd have to surgically
remove the remote control from my 11-year-old daughter's right hand
and wrest the phone from the other.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so nostalgic,'' says Sally Simpson of Jacksonville,
who was visiting with her daughter and grandchildren. ``This is how
we grew up _ families interacting, playing cards and games, doing
magic tricks. A rainy day didn't bother us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain or shine, after just a few hours at Earthshine, the outside
world seems very far away. Nobody is held captive, but there's
simply nothing appealing about getting back in your car and leaving
this haven of peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The small but comfortable rooms with unpainted plank walls and
exposed wood beams are decorated in early log cabin with rag rugs
on board floors, quilts on the log beds. Don't worry, there are
electric lights, indoor plumbing and private bathrooms. Window fans
move breezes through the room. Rustic elegance, they call it.
</P>
<P>
   Three bounteous meals a day plus fruits and beverages are
included in the overnight price. Mealtime at communal tables under
the vaulted ceiling of the lodge's great room is a much-anticipated
event; like Pavlov's dog, when the triangle rings, we salivate.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived on Saturday just in time for a hamburger and barbecue
chicken cookout. Suppertime brought a feast of salmon with
hollandaise sauce, Moroccan stew, couscous, green salad, wild rice
salad and chocolate walnut cake with ice cream for dessert. Sunday
night dinner was an ample offering of cider-baked ham, yams, green
beans and blackberry cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast includes pancakes, sausage, homemade applesauce,
oatmeal, granola and fresh fruit. Hearty grub to fortify us for a
busy day.
</P>
<P>
   The activities list _ posted daily in the lodge _ is a
smorgasbord of fun: creek hikes, treks to King's Falls, water
games, fishing in the catfish pond, mornings at the re-created 1840
pioneer homestead or Cherokee village and, for kids only, cookouts
and barn loft camp-outs.
</P>
<P>
   But guilt-free indolence is also encouraged: rocking on the
deck, reading by the fireplace or napping in a hammock or curled up
on your oh-so-comfy bed. (I indulged in the latter during a summer
afternoon thunderstorm that dropped the temperature about 20
degrees, and it was one of the best snoozes I've had in a long
time.)
</P>
<P>
   We were glad we weren't too lazy to join the kids for the
Cherokee experience led by Benny Upton, whose tribal name is
``Amasissido.'' Everyone calls him Water Rabbit, because he's also
the guy who mans the hose during the afternoon water play.
</P>
<P>
   The band of tenderfeet who followed Water Rabbit into the secret
Cherokee hideaway in the forest Sunday morning included a
13-year-old named Austin Massey from Durham, N.C., who was trying
hard not to look overly interested in the proceedings. ``He's from
the Cynical Tribe,'' quipped Water Rabbit. ``He's a teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon we all were learning to build a fire, grind corn, weave
fishing nets, throw tomahawks, use twigs to draw designs on clay
beads, hunt salamanders in the spring and tell a tulip popular from
a red maple.
</P>
<P>
   And as we headed back to the lodge, Kent Dunson _ flush with
success from nailing his tomahawk into a tree-stump target _ begged
his mom: ``Can we stay a week next year?''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-85 north, then just across the South
Carolina line, take Exit 1 (S.C. 11, the Cherokee Foothills
Parkway). Follow S.C. 11 to U.S. 178, then north to U.S. 64 in
Rosman. Travel west about 3 miles until you see a BP station on the
right. Turn right and travel .7 miles, then turn left onto a gravel
road. Go 1.6 miles to the Earthshine driveway, turn right and go up
the hill.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What it costs: The all-inclusive rates are $130 per night
adult double occupancy ($170 single), plus $70 per night for ages
6-15 and $40 per night for 5 and under. Pay-extra options include
horseback riding ($40 per person for a two-hour guided trail ride),
High Ropes Challenge ($40 per person), zip-line course ($50 per
person) and climbing wall ($25 per person).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What to bring: Clothing that can get wet and dirty, blue jeans
for horseback riding, a sleeping bag for the kids' campout, boots
or sturdy shoes for hiking, fishing poles for the catfish pond and
alcoholic beverages if desired.

 &HT;    A pastoral mountain place, Earthshine positively glows
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE TOXAWAY, N.C. _ Dusk creeps in slowly this lazy Sunday
evening as a round butterscotch candy moon rises above the pines.
We are gathered around a campfire beneath a tin-covered open-air
shelter next to the barn, listening to Appalachian folk tales and
hungrily assembling s'mores _ despite having eaten a big country
dinner only a couple of hours before.
</P>
<P>
   Goats and sheep watch curiously from the grassy hillside,
chickens scratch around the barnyard, and Liza Jane, the roly-poly
Mediterranean burro, mooches marshmallows. She is too plump for her
own good, and we have been instructed not to feed her _ no matter
how pitifully she begs.
</P>
<P>
   When darkness finally enfolds the barnyard, laughing children
with cupped hands outstretched dart about in pursuit of lightning
bugs. And as the fire dies down and the embers glow orange, the
grown-ups sit back, smiling contentedly, perhaps remembering
similar summer nights long ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the weekend ends at Earthshine Mountain Lodge _ not
with a bang but a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Marion Boatright and Kim Maurer-Heinitsh,
Earthshine welcomed its first visitors in 1990. The centerpiece of
the 70-acre retreat bordering the Pisgah National Forest in the
Blue Ridge Mountains is a hand-built cedar log lodge with 10 cozy
rooms, most with lofts that are perfect for children.
</P>
<P>
   Earthshine _ defined as what you see when you look at a crescent
moon and see the rest of its sphere lightly lit _ was envisioned as
a place where guests might see things in a different light and
learn fresh perspectives on how we all relate to ourselves, the
natural world and to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Hunley of Aiken, S.C., made the mystic connection
immediately when she first encountered Earthshine about six years
ago. Back on the lodge's expansive deck after our barnyard trek,
she recalls, ``I was trail hiking in the area, and all of a sudden
we saw it. This place just glowed on the horizon.'' Soon, she
returned as an overnight guest, and has been coming back ever since
to bask in the warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she says, gazing out on the purple peaks that ring the
farm and sighing with contentment, ``we're just hugged by
mountains.''

 &HT;    Sonny Rollins on his place in jazz, yoga and what he likes to
listen to
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have no doubt in your hearts. Sonny Rollins is the last man
standing.
</P>
<P>
   Not to get agonizingly pre-millennial about it, but when it
comes to jazz that pretty much everyone can agree is jazz, the
lineage of legendary figures is nearly shot. Masterful musicians
abound, as well as individuals who most certainly will map out the
next evolution of this extravagantly American music, but we are
perilously short these days on indisputable giants.
</P>
<P>
   Robust and engaged as he approaches his 69th birthday, Rollins
is not only critically acclaimed as the greatest living jazz
improviser, he's a vital link to the tumultuous days when jazz as
an art form with its roots in popular song and social dance steamed
ahead rather than glanced back at a long plateau, its engine room
almost recklessly stoked by an inspired, possessed assortment of
Promethean innovators: John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk,
Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Charlie Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his pathbreaking contemporaries, significant influences
like drummer Max Roach and alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman, are
still at it. But Rollins, who performs Saturday at Spivey Hall in a
rare Southeastern date, has cut the widest swath for the longest
time to the loudest applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a really good night, he's the finest tenor saxophone player
alive,'' says John Armwood, a Marietta jazz educator and radio host
for WCLK-FM (91.9). ``His improvisations have a logic to them
that's fascinating to watch. He'll take a theme and deconstruct it
in a very logical and thematic way. He just works it and takes it
apart. His placement of notes and juxtapositions of rhythms can be
so profound. You can see the sparks shoot out of his horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Giddins, longtime jazz critic for the Village Voice and
author of the National Book Award-winning collection ``Vision of
Jazz,'' hails the saxophonist as an artist of Olympian stature.
Rollins, he writes, ``invokes tempests of sustained exhilaration
that have not often been heard in jazz since the glory days of
Louis Armstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   This, obviously, isn't the case every night Rollins plays, and,
as Giddins observes, hasn't extended to his latter-day studio work,
a steady stream of yearly albums that rarely fail to spark critical
debate. ``Enigmatic'' is the phrase that most often recurs in the
hefty summations of Rollins' career, which has been marked by
several extended sabbaticals _ most notoriously in the late 1950s,
when the saxophonist could be seen practicing from the exalted
vantage point of the Williamsburg Bridge. As with Bob Dylan (a
vastly more inconsistent performer equally committed to ripping up
his songbook), the decades of output make him dangerously easy to
underrate as a recording artist. Each new disc usually boasts
something inspired. But Rollins' epic endeavors of the 1950s _ the
decade when he made his reputation, following through on the
lessons of Charlie Parker and his early inspiration, Coleman
Hawkins _ really did earn him the title he gave to his breakthrough
album: ``Saxophone Colossus.'' He's had to compete with his own
shadow, one cast by a face whose strong nose, authoritative
whiskers and shaded gaze is, even now, impressively forceful enough
to occupy a spot on Easter Island.
</P>
<P>
   The saxophonist seems keenly aware of the struggle. He still
practices for three hours a day and limits his concert dates to
about 40 a year, the better to conserve his strength. He's an
unsparing critic of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the records I make fall into the category of not being up
to snuff,'' Rollins says, talking recently from his home in upstate
New York. ``All of them. I forget about the end result. I'm a very
sort of hard guy on myself, shooting for the stars all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview, Rollins shared his thoughts on several
subjects, from the rich cultural legacy of his Harlem, N.Y.,
childhood to his abundant affection for calypso rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On his use of calypsos, a staple of his concert repertoire
and, in tunes such as ``St. Thomas'' and ``Don't Stop the
Carnival,'' akin to personal signatures:
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are from the Virgin Islands, and as a small boy I
heard some of that music. My mother used to take me to the dances.
I relate to it. The reason I like it is it's sort of liberating.
People like it. They really enjoy it. I don't see anything wrong
with that. I still really enjoy playing music in 4/4 time. I like
playing with the backbeat. Jazz is fighting to survive out here.
You've got rap and hip-hop and this and that. Everybody's trying to
keep jazz in the basement. Anything you can do to play jazz and
make people like it, you're accomplishing something. It's a
both/and situation. To me, there's nothing declasse about going
into a jazz setting and playing music that makes people dance. Some
purists feel any kind of funk rhythm is not what people should be
playing, but they can't do that to me because my credentials are
too secure.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the importance of yoga in his life, a discipline he pursued
after reading ``The Autobiography of a Yogi'' in the late 1960s,
and its connections to his music:
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to draw a straight line between something
that I play and yoga. The two are separate in many ways. If I go to
a studio and try to do hatha yoga before a recording date, it takes
away from the energy I need to put into the music. After reading
that book, I decided to go to India. I was interested in finding
another way of living, something besides the materialistic way of
life. I was in an ashram for four months and it centered my life so
when I came back, I was ready to get back into my music.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the art of improvising:
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn the melody. I learn the words. I learn different
versions of it. But on the bandstand I forget. I don't think
anymore. Then I let the song play me. It's a Zen approach. I'm not
consciously thinking of the melody or the words or the chord
changes. I try to make my mind empty so the song can come out from
where I want it to come from.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On his musical roots:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it, playing as a little boy with my friends, but
I grew up at the right time and in the right place. When I was
born, we lived on 137th Street in Harlem ... and I came into
contact with a lot of the great stuff that was happening then. The
Cotton Club, the Apollo, there was so much music around Harlem.
Even as a little boy, I realize I gleaned a lot of it just being
around. It was a great upbringing. Music came naturally. I'm
fortunate. In my immediate crowd of people, everyone wanted to be a
jazz musician, but not everyone had the talent. My eyes were set on
that prize. I would practice prodigiously. It was fun to me. Nobody
had to say, `Sonny, practice that saxophone!'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On why he decided to become a saxophone player, picking up the
alto at age 11:
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Jordan was playing in a club across the street from my
school. There was a picture showing him with a saxophone and
cutaway tails and tuxedo. I thought, `Wow, that's it! I'm going to
be a saxophone player.' It all came together with Louis Jordan. I
begged my mother to get me a saxophone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the last thing he hears before going to sleep at night:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a music listener. I have so much music that I'm
thinking about, I really try not to listen to music. That might
sound like heresy. I read a lot of books and, at night, I listen to
old-time radio shows on cassette. Radio detective shows, from the
'30s, '40s and '50s. It keeps me from watching television. It's a
security blanket of sorts. It's what I heard when I was a kid.''

 &HT;    Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos double up on tour, packing powerful
message
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos pose little threat to the sales
dominance of sexpots such as Britney Spears and Ricky Martin. The
music dominating the charts these days doesn't approach the
challenging social and psychosexual realms that Amos and Morissette
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette, crown princess of angst, and Amos, free-spirited
musical adventurer, have joined forces against the teeny-bopper
tide. The pair's ``5 1/2 Weeks Tour'' rolls into Lakewood
Amphitheatre on Saturday. The joint endeavor is part of a trend
that has seen artists that may not be able to sell out a large
venue alone mustering their combined drawing power.
</P>
<P>
   Amos, in a recent online chat, explained the origin of the tour.
``This was truly Alanis' idea, the concept of us doing a double
show together,'' she said. ``She let me get a little frisky by
letting me call it `5 1/2 Weeks.' I made tea for her a few years
ago when she popped back after a show ... and we got on really
well. So when she put this idea out there, it was quite good
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing seems especially auspicious for Morissette, whose
latest release has had lackluster sales. ``Supposed Former
Infatuation Junkie,'' Morissette's follow-up to her
16-million-plus-selling 1995 breakthrough, ``Jagged Little Pill,''
sold only a fraction of the numbers of its predecessor, while Amos
consistently sells between 500,000 and 1 million copies. Amos' fan
base, built throughout the '90s, is loyal. But Morissette's
meteoric rise didn't allow time to develop a fan base. Many of the
fans that bought ``Jagged Little Pill'' have moved on without her.
With this tour, it seems that Morissette is trying to make a new
start, snagging some of Amos' fiercely loyal fans along the way.
</P>
<P>
   When Morissette bounded to the upper reaches of the singles
charts with the stinging ``You Oughta Know'' in 1995, things were
looking rosy for women in rock. The cookie crumbles quickly in the
world of pop music, though.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent New York Times article, critic Ann Powers summed
things up nicely, writing that the ``moment when women confronted
male rockers on their own terms, displaying a sexual forcefulness
and self-respect that threw the genre's historic chauvinism into
question, has faded. In its place is the culture's new custom of
either placing female artists and fans within a female ghetto, or
ignoring them.''
</P>
<P>
   Have women made strides in pop music? Sure. A glance at the
charts makes that clear; you'll find lots of women there. But let's
take a closer look: Britney Spears, Shania Twain, Christina
Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez _ these women are selling sex and
disposable pop. Still, as Powers writes, even ``the Lolita-like
Britney Spears sends a message mixed enough to be considered
empowering by some of her teenage admirers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Amos, Morissette and their ilk are sexless. Instead,
they use their insight into the female psyche to explore sexuality
in a more serious vein. Amos' thumping ``Raspberry Swirl'' or her
harrowing first-person tale of rape in ``Me and a Gun'' and
Morissette's bile-filled kiss-off in ``You Oughta Know'' were a bit
more thought provoking than Spears' ``Baby One More Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The successful women-of-rock tour Lilith Fair is touted for
raising the profile of female musicians, a task it accomplished.
But, who, exactly, benefited most? It was the sweet, nonthreatening
Jewel, the gently spiritual tour founder Sarah McLachlan and the
ham-handed and thankfully forgotten Meredith Brooks, to name a few.
There were cutting-edge performers on the tour and stalwarts like
Chrissie Hynde. Hynde didn't need Lilith Fair; it needed her.
</P>
<P>
   The chart-topping women of R&AMP;B are setting their own agenda. In
their heels and high splits, R&AMP;B quartet Destiny's Child may look
like they're out to catch any man's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But it's another ``m'' they're after: money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to just beat brothers down or anything,''
says Rozonda ``Chilli'' Thomas, whose Atlanta pop group TLC had a
hit with its own hard line on broke men, ``No Scrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a scrub can be a guy or girl who's not trying to do
anything for himself,'' the singer continues. ``It just so happens
that we are women, so we're going to talk about men, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Morissette and Amos are going to talk about men, too, but we
just have to dig a little deeper and listen a little harder to hear
it.

   COCAINE _ As Gov. George W. Bush continues his tour of smaller
cities to raise money for his presidential bid, the cocaine
question continues to dog him. In Roanoke, Va., on Thursday, the
question arose again, and Bush's campaign said he would be saying
more than he had before. The substance of this more detailed
response? That he had done some things 20 years ago that were
irresponsible. A look at Bush's strategy on the question and
whether it's hurting him. At the least, the question is interfering
with his message on other issues. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman). 20-25

<P>
   w/BUSH-DRUGS _ COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is in
Columbus as the latest report of ancient drug use swirls around
him. The Dallas Morning News wrote a story this week about Bush's
FBI background report that said he hadn't used drugs in seven
years, which is as far back, apparently, as the FBI goes. Here he
visits a training center, has a press conf and gets money from Lee
Wexler. (Hershey, Dayton Daily News).

<P>
   BUSHCLINTON _ Some are fed up with the president's womanizing.
Others had problems with the GOP's embrace of social conservatives
in 1996 and perceive more moderate views from Texas Gov. George W.
Bush. Whatever their reasons, a few hundred large campaign
contributors who supported the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996 have
opened their checkbooks this year for Bush. (Sherman/Foskett,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   NORWOOD _ Charlie Norwood came to Congress with one thing on his

the former dentist to a politically precarious spot. Norwood has

   STEM - WASHINGTON - Research on human stem cells is potentially
as important to human health as the development of antibiotics and
vaccines and should continue with federal support, according to a
committee of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science. However, because of ``public anxiety,'' federal money
should not be used to actually derive the cells from human fetuses
or embryos, the committee said. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-SCHOOLS _ WASHINGTON - Schools and colleges will set new
enrollment records this fall, said President Clinton, as he
released the administration's ``Baby Boom Echo'' report Thursday.
He predicted that after he vetoes a GOP tax-cut bill next month, he
and Republicans will reach a compromise with higher education
spending and lower tax cuts than the GOP wants. (Mollison, Cox News

   CYBERSQUATTERS _ WASHINGTON _ Internet pioneers once made a tidy
profit by registering domain names with brand identification, only
to ``flip'' them back to Fortune 500 companies. Congress is now
bent on passing a law to ban such ``cybersquatting.'' The practice
struck home with pols when the most natural names presidential
candidate web states of such pols as Hatch, Gore, and Alexander got
taken over this year. Sometimes, the idea is not to resell the name
but to mock the candidate by attracting innocent eyeballs to
negative sites. (Glass, Cox News Service). 25.

 &HT;    My new friend is a llama
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISGAH NATIONAL FOREST, N.C. _ My llama is famished.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems. The 13-year-old, 400-pound pack animal that
trails me through this deliriously lush stretch of mountain
wilderness is snarfing every chlorophyll-producing thing in sight _
pine needles, hemlock leaves, clumps of pungent sassafras, you name
it. B.B. is his name, short for Baby Boy, but it also could stand
for Big Belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like anything that's green,'' says guide Bob McIntyre.
``Just don't let him get near the mountain laurel or the
rhododendron. They'll make him real sick.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre patiently points out the forbidden flora, though I have
to strain to hear him over the breathy chewing noises B.B. makes as
he chows down about 3 inches from my right ear.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that's part of the charm of English Mountain Llama
Treks, the unusual guided excursions begun four years ago by
McIntyre, 50, and his wife Cathy, 46. Drawing from a stable of 30
llamas, the McIntyres add an element of animal magnetism to day
hikes through the Pisgah National Forest and overnight hikes
through the nearby Nantahala National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Each hiker on our 4.5-mile trek _ myself, Helen and Norman Moore
of Columbia, S.C., and Andy and Nicole Boatright of Baxley _ is
paired with a woolly companion, who follows us on a lead rope over
fallen logs, up steep embankments and down weedy trails, eating and
defecating all the way.
</P>
<P>
   The llamas carry the gear _ lunch, along with a portable table
and chairs, is provided on the day hikes; tents, sleeping bags and
food rations on the overnight hikes.
</P>
<P>
   An early-morning shower douses the path into the Pisgah, and our
hiking boots go thwock-thwock in the mud as we head up to a
250-acre natural bald called Max Patch. (The llamas, with their
padded, two-toed feet, glide gracefully through the slosh.)
</P>
<P>
   To get there, we have to traverse a portion of the Appalachian
Trail _ and separate temporarily from the llamas, because pack
animals and horses aren't allowed on the trail. Cathy takes B.B.
and company to meet us on the lee side of the bald. At the summit,
we smile as we watch her slowly progress down an alternate trail
far below, scolding and cajoling her frisky charges as she goes.
</P>
<P>
   The sun breaks briefly over the bald, and as we survey the
panorama of gorgeous rolling meadows, a few of us break into the
Julie Andrews twirl from ``The Sound of Music.'' Feeling heady and
not at all embarrassed by our movie-musical outburst, we descend to
reclaim our animal sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that I'm surprised by how much fun I'm having.
Before I went on a llama trek, I'd failed to see the full value of
this burgeoning mini-industry. (There's a smattering of trekking
outfits across the country, mostly out West.) After all, you don't
get to ride the llamas _ they can carry up to a third of their body
weight, but their spines aren't built to handle the direct pressure
of a human posterior _ and I can carry my own lunch without too
much exertion. Why not just hike the trail without the four-legged
tagalong?
</P>
<P>
   But as B.B. and I march on _ me huffing and puffing on my first
nature walk in ages, him acting like he's at the world's biggest
salad bar _ I find myself growing more fond of this odd creature.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever seen a llama's mug up close? They wear this
endearingly enigmatic smirk that is equal parts impish and aloof,
as if they were secretly amused by the pink-skinned creatures
before them. They're extremely head-shy _ try scratching them
behind the ears and they'll bolt. They're competitive, jockeying
constantly for position as leader of the pack. (That spitting you
hear so much about? It's basically a llama-to-llama power thing.)
Even their poop is interesting _ it looks like polished ebony
aquarium stones.
</P>
<P>
   Each llama on our trek has a distinct personality quirk. B.B.
chomps endlessly. E.T. hams it up for the snapping cameras. Thor
whines. Topcat is ... extra woolly.
</P>
<P>
   No children accompany us _ the Boatrights left their five kids
at home so they could enjoy some rare time alone _ but Bruce
Freeman of Hillsborough, N.C., can vouch for the trek's kid appeal.
The 39-year-old Procter &AMP; Gamble account executive and his family
signed up for a day trip with the McIntyres last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman says his daughter Kane, 7, usually starts complaining
about 100 yards into any hike. ``But she took to the llamas
immediately. It was so funny, she's not even as tall as a llama's
leg, but at one point she was leading three of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane's parents were so happy with their complaint-free day that
they came back for an overnight hike this July. ``This will be a
yearly tradition for us,'' Freeman says. ``From now on, no llama,
no hike.''
</P>
<P>
   And kids will get a thrill out of the other wildlife here, too.
The Pisgah offers up gaggles of grouse _ which scare the bejesus
out of the llamas when they beat a winged retreat from the high
grass _ as well as turtles, wild turkeys, deer, snakes and, on rare
occasions, the elusive black bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen four bears up here in four years,'' Bob McIntyre
says as he surveys the dense underbrush. But toward the end of our
hike, we see a rough-hewn divot in a dirt embankment, where he
suspects a bear recently dug for grubs.
</P>
<P>
   As if the natural attractions weren't enough, the McIntyres toss
in some homespun extras: Our picnic lunch of cold-cut sandwiches,
Sun Chips and pasta salad is capped by Cathy's scrumptious homemade
Hershey Bar pie. (During warm weather, you may get brownies and ice
cream.) Along the trail, Cathy snaps photos of our group, which
will be mailed to each member later. And at the end of the hike,
everybody gets a souvenir mug.
</P>
<P>
   The McIntyres began raising llamas in 1993, after moving to
Newport, Tenn., from Sarasota, Fla. ``We had read a few articles
about packing (the insider's term for hiking with pack animals),
which piqued our interest,'' explains Bob, a former postal worker.
``Then we visited a few llama farms and saw some of the babies. It
was all over after that.''
</P>
<P>
   They started buying up llamas _ $500 to $800 for the males,
$1,200 and up for the females _ and opened the trekking business in
1995. (It's named after their English Mountain home in Tennessee.)
They guided about 50 hikes last year, the lion's share during the
high season of April through November. And business is picking up _
this year, they estimate they'll guide 75 trips, with lots of
repeat hikers.
</P>
<P>
   The McIntyres think that many people return because they, too,
fall for the beasts. Count Helen Moore among them. This is the
second llama trek for the 47-year-old physician's assistant _ last
year, she hiked the Nantahala National Forest with a different
North Carolina company. ``I love animals, and llamas are so
interesting,'' she explains as she cozies up to Topcat. ``Mine
hummed the last time I went. It's just really neat to hike with a
buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even one who treks with his mouth full.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO

PAST IN THE `BULL' EVOKES EMPATHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We just called it the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   That was short for Istanbul, the venerable, magnificent city
that sits at the choke point connecting the Mediterranean Sea and
the Black Sea, straddling Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   I once called it ``San Francisco with minarets'' because of its
hills and the way it commands the view of its own bay (the 20-mile
channel known as the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara).
</P>
<P>
   We _ meaning some members of my small detachment of airmen
stationed near the town of Yalova _ headed for the ferry for the
two-hour cruise over the Sea of Marmara for two days of fun and
adventure the instant that our three-day shifts were completed.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell you what we were doing there, but then, like they
say in the spy movies, I might have to shoot you.
</P>
<P>
   Every trip to the Bull during my two years was a stimulating
experience. Sometimes too stimulating _ in fact, downright
dangerous. There was always something different to do and learn, if
one were willing to expand his horizons.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry ride itself was often breathtaking, with dolphins
racing the boat, gulls hovering and plummeting down on their
scavenging runs, and the people on deck _ the din of the heated
conversation, backgammon games, waiters scurrying and boys hawking
snacks and periodicals.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding in toward the city, one was overwhelmed by the sight of
the ancient fortifications, and the rolling vaults of the mosques
with their sleek minarets _ rocket-like structures seemingly poised
for launch into space.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the sights, sounds, smells and feel of the city in
which I crossed the threshold from adolescence to adulthood and
acquired a veneer of cosmopolitan sophistication flooded me when I
read the news of the devastating earthquake that shook western
Turkey this week.
</P>
<P>
   I had felt the earth move a few times when I was there, but not
seriously. Even then it was an extremely disorienting feeling to
totally lose your moorings during what seemed to be a suspension of
the law of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   I'm ashamed to admit it, but my first thoughts about the
earthquake were concerns about the Blue Mosque, the Suleymaniye
Mosque and Ayasofia, the sixth-century Byzantine cathedral that was
converted into a mosque by the Ottomans in the 15th century and
later into a museum.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after I knew that the earthquake spared all of
Istanbul's most impressive architecture and that the city itself
did not bear the brunt of the earthquake's impact that my concern
shifted to the people who have suffered this great calamity.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered some of my Turkish friends from the old days and
wondered if they or their children or relatives had been among the
victims. And I prayed a Christian prayer for them all, although
most of them were Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   That's another thing that happened to me in Istanbul, which may
seem blasphemous or heretical to some. My Christian faith was
strengthened through exposure to Islamic influences.
</P>
<P>
   There was something about the hundreds of muezzins summoning the
faithful to their prayers in the misty early mornings that called
me to prayer as well. I did not, of course, pray in the same way.
But I knew in the depths of my being that we were importuning the
same God.
</P>
<P>
   That realization has led me over the years to be utterly baffled
by the amount of blood that has been and is still being shed over
the different ways people chose to express their devotion to the
same supreme being. The Balkans wars in that sense seem utterly
senseless.
</P>
<P>
   So too does the continuing tension between the Greeks and the
Turks and untenable political situation on Cyprus that is the
product of that historical antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, it is encouraging to note that Greece was among
the first nations to respond to Turkey's need for massive emergency
assistance. Greece already has sent three C-130 transport planes
with medicines and two 11-doctor emergency medical teams.
</P>
<P>
   Natural disasters of the scale that has hit Turkey often have
the effect of making historic antagonisms irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, Turkey is just another faraway place whose
name evokes exotic imagery. The deaths of thousands of Turks in an
earthquake there amount in their minds to no more than statistics
for a headline.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a different thing for one who has spent a lot of time
in the Bull, tasting its food, wandering its narrow side streets
and drinking its coffee, its tea and the wine called Binbirgeje,
``A Thousand and One Nights.''

 &HT;    Coonts takes international intrigue to `Cuba'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Cold War ended and the Berlin Wall came tumbling down,
a lot of spy novelists and techno-thriller writers began scrambling
for new villains. They weren't hard to find, says Stephen Coonts,
author of seven New York Times best sellers, including ``The Flight
of the Intruder'' and ``Under Siege.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clarksville, Md., writer insists that the collapse of
communism did not lower the level of tension in the world; rather,
it raised it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism collapsed because it couldn't take care of the
people who lived in its shadow. Those people are still hungry,
naked and cold. We plump, comfortable, warm people should
contemplate that hard fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In Coonts' latest thriller, ``Cuba'' (St. Martin's, $24.95), the
bad guys are Cuban officials jockeying for power as Fidel Castro is
dying. Meanwhile, Coonts' recurring character, Rear Admiral Jake
Grafton, is dispatched to Guantanamo Bay to keep secretly stored
chemical weapons from falling into the hands of the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain amount of military jargon in the book, but
Coonts doesn't consider himself a techno-thriller writer like Tom
Clancy. ``I don't like those types of books,'' says Coonts, a
former naval aviator who flew combat missions in Vietnam. ``I
prefer more character development.''
</P>
<P>
   Coonts relied on books and Internet sites for most of his
research on Cuba. He wanted to visit the island, but his wife
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I absolutely could not go,'' Coonts says. ``She
said some of the people there might have read `Under Siege,' where
I had Fidel executed by a firing squad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the news: Georgia writer Terry Kay (``The Kidnapping of
Aaron Greene'') has signed a deal with William Morrow for a novel
due in January and a nonfiction book at a later date. The novel,
``The Package,'' will deal with a man who commits suicide after
being forced into early retirement, and what happens to the people
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep hearing the same story from people who are downsized,''
Kay said. ``They are so shocked they don't know what to do. When
they calm down, they all want some measure of revenge. The
companies haven't taken just their jobs away _ that's part of it _
they've taken away their dignity. Most people don't act on that,
and sooner or later they'll get a job doing something, but they
still hold that bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wolfe galore: Not only will Tom Wolfe's Atlanta novel, ``A Man
in Full,'' be released in paperback in October, but all of his
previous works will be published in new paperback editions as well.
Available soon are ``The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline
Baby''; ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test''; ``The Pump House
Gang''; ``Radical Chic &AMP; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers''; ``The
Painted Word''; ``Mauve Gloves &AMP; Madmen, Clutter &AMP; Vine''; ``In Our
Time''; and ``From Bauhaus to Our House.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Small towns, big deals: Dolly Parton has bought the film
option to Stella Suberman's ``The Jew Store.'' Published by
Algonquin Books, the memoir tells the story of a Jewish store owner
and his family in a small Tennessee town in the 1920s. ... Durham,
N.C., writer and NPR's ``All Things Considered'' contributor Haven
Kimmel has sold her memoir of growing up in Mooreland, Ind., to
Doubleday for six figures. Senior editor Amy Schiebe told
Publishers Weekly she was impressed by Kimmel's writing style and
the way ``she captures that caught-in-amber quality of little
towns.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Hughes hoax: More than 27 years ago, Clifford Irving
convinced the publishing world that he had written ``The
Autobiography of Howard Hughes.'' This was quite a coup, since the
reclusive billionaire was never seen outside of his hotel suite and
never gave interviews. Just before the book was published, however,
Hughes conducted a conference call to several journalists and
announced that he had never met Irving and the book was a fake.
Irving went to jail for 17 months and most of the manuscripts were
destroyed. Now living in Santa Fe, N.M., Irving has revived the
bogus autobiography and is marketing it through the Internet at
www.terrificbooks
</P>
<P>
   .com. Irving still claims this is the autobiography Hughes would
have written _ ``if he dared'' _ but even ignoring the fact that
the anecdotes and interviews are fake, the story is more
entertaining than many novels.

 &HT;    SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY SAYS NO CHANGES NEEDED IN STEM CELL RESEARCH
RULES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyle
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The federal government should fund research on
human embryonic stem cells but, because of ``public anxiety''
surrounding the subject, should avoid financing the actual
collection of the cells, a committee of scientists, lawyers and
ethicists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Human stem cell research, which some biologists say could lead
to cures for some of humanity's most fearsome diseases, is
nonetheless controversial because it begins with cells
``harvested'' from aborted fetuses or discarded human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science leading to the understanding of human stem cell
biology is about to enter a phase of research and development that
could lead to unprecedented cures'' for diseases like cancer,
diabetes, heart disease and diseases of the nervous system, the
committee said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
   Embryonic stem cells are the primitive cells that have not yet
become specialized. They are the precursors of many different kinds
of tissue, such as skin, muscle, nerve, bone.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the Institute for Civil Society,
was virtually identical to previous recommendations that federal
funds be used for stem cells research _ but not to finance the
collection of the cells on which the research is done.
</P>
<P>
   The two organizations will sponsor a public meeting to discuss
the implications of stem cell research next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By manipulating the cells, scientists are learning how to clone
``designer'' cells and tissues, an ability that many experts
believe will lead to the discovery of entirely new classes of drugs
and other cures.
</P>
<P>
   However, since all stem cells are grown from cells taken from
electively-aborted fetuses or embryos discarded by reproduction
clinics, critics fear the emerging science will lead to cloning,
abuse of human research subjects, commerce in human life and a host
of other problems.
</P>
<P>
   A National Bioethics Advisory Commission created by President
Clinton has earlier called for federal funding of research using
human stem cells, so long as no government money is used in the
actual collection of the cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this approach will allow publicly-funded
researchers to move more quickly toward discoveries that will lead
to alleviating the suffering caused by human disease,'' stated the
report issued Thursday. ``We understand that there are many
individuals who believe that any use of human embryos other than
for achieving a pregnancy (is) unethical, believing that the human
embryo is a full human being from the earliest moments of the
conception process.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee said research could go ahead while such issues are
being discussed.

   FBC-ALABAMA _ The Road to College Football travels to Alabama,
where the sex scandal surrouding coach Mike DuBose - and not the

DuBose. Others have publicly harassed the woman with whom he had an
affair and who later filed a lawsuit against him. The school
considered firing him before it shortened his contract and reduced
his compensation. Athletic Director Bob Bockrath says information
not available to the public kept him from firing DuBose. The school
trustees asked the university president to tell them what's going

   COXNET NASCAR 0820: BIG LEAD _ How outrageous is Dale Jarrett's
lead in the Winston Cup points standings? The 300-point advantage
is so enormous that the Ford No. 88 driver could finish last and
next-to-last in the next two races, including Sunday's Pepsi 400,

   BOX-TONY-AYALA _ The opportunity to see if Tony Ayala had indeed
become a changed man during 16 years in prison came even before the
first fight in his improbable comeback. At a pre-fight interview
his opponent, Manuel Esparza, took the mike. Esparza, 21, was only
4 years old when Ayala fought his last fight in San Antonio, one in
which he unleashed all the savage fury he had in and outside of the
ring and when he continued to batter a helpless Robbie Epps even
after the referee had declared Ayala a winner in a first-round
technical knockout. Esparza was still shy of his third birthday
when Ayala pounded Jose Baltazar into submission in two rounds and
then spit on him to avenge a pre-fight insult to a boxer known as
Torito. Like a wine-sodden tourist in Pamplona Esparza couldn't
resist running in front of a bull. ``I just want to ask you one
question,'' he said, turning to Ayala. ``Do you like mayonnaise or
mustard, because I'm going to be feeding you some fist sandwiches
all night, brother. Hopefully a lot of people will come out to see
the fight to see what happens to the ex-champ and the new champ.''
Ayala and Esparza fight Friday night in San Antonio. (Maher, Austin
Anmerican-Statesman).

HUGH GRANT COMES OFF SURPRISINGLY WELL IN `MICKEY BLUE EYES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the summer of Hugh Grant. He entered it with a rather
shaky career as a B-level star bent on self-parody, and he's
leaving it as Hollywood's premier light-comedian leading man _ the
David Niven (Grant's hero) of his time.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the triumph of ``Notting Hill,'' which he stole
right out from under Julia Roberts. Now he's followed it up with
``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' a Mafia comedy that is not as good a movie
but is every bit as strong a personal star vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a British manager of a posh New York auction house who
has found the girl of his dreams in Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn), a
beautiful and self-sacrificing teacher in a public high school who
is reluctant to introduce him to her family.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly turns out that she's the daughter of a top-level
gangster (James Caan) in one of New York's biggest crime families.
And when he finds out about it, she tries to break the engagement
because she knows _ the Mafia being the Mafia _ that he will
inevitably be corrupted by the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, of course, exactly what happens. The lovers go ahead
with their marriage plans and the mild-mannered Englishman is
sucked into and exploited by the family, targeted by the FBI,
forced into gun fights with competing gangsters, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you're right. It's the same formula as ``Analyze This.''
And, like that movie, ``Mickey'' becomes progressively less
sophisticated and more slapsticky (after a terrific first act)
until it finally threatens to self-destruct _ here with Grant's
mugging through several scenes as a pathetic imitation-gangster.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, he comes off amazingly well. He's
enormously endearing (especially when he's under the tightest
control), and the audience seems to just love him. He's also
surprisingly good in some of the more physical comedy, displaying
for the first time a surprising Harold Lloyd quality.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one way, ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' is also vastly
superior to ``Analyze This'' _ it really never romanticizes,
glamorizes or trivializes the Mafia. Thanks largely to an
absolutely icy performance by Burt Young as the Godfather, the
hero's predicament seems genuinely frightening. The film has a
slight bite.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Blues Eyes. Directed by Kelly Makin. Written by Adam
Scheinman and Robert Kuhn. Cast: Hugh Grant, James Caan, Jeanne
Tripplehorn, Burt Young, James Fox. Castle Rock. 110 minutes. Rated
PG-13 for gangster violence.

`KILLING MRS. TINGLE' HAS A BRAVURA PERFORMANCE BY HELEN MIRREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the fact it deals with a trio of oppressed students who
resort to violence against an unfair teacher, the release of the
high-school black comedy, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' in
post-Columbine 1999 makes for some lousy timing.
</P>
<P>
   Up until a few months ago, it was called ``Killing Mrs.
Tingle,'' and even the week before its release, the producers were
still dickering with the ending, and touching up the ad campaign to
make the actors look more wholesome. Clearly, the studio is scared
to death of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to fear. It's forgettable but somehow totally
innocuous, with a few mild chuckles, a bravura performance from
Helen Mirren, and able support from a trio of young stars who are
more attractive and engaging than the teen movie norm.
</P>
<P>
   The title character (Mirren) is a domineering, small-town high
school teacher who holds some unknown resentment against young
people everywhere, and likes nothing more than publicly humiliating
her students _ stripping them of every vestige of their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And when the sweet young heroine, Leigh Ann (Katie Holmes) _ who
is dirt poor and desperate for a college scholarship _ invests six
months making a senior project so spectacular it could win the
Nobel Prize, Mrs. Tingle positively delights in trashing it with a
C grade.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but this teacher-from-hell conspires to have
Leigh Ann kicked out of school for cheating on a final exam, even
though she knows full well the kid is perfectly innocent. This is
not just a mean teacher, but a pathological nut case.
</P>
<P>
   So, through a series of fumbling incidents, Leigh Ann and two
friends (Marisa Coughlin and Barry Watson) take Mrs. Tingle
prisoner, tie her to her bed, take pornographic pictures of her,
threaten her with blackmail and otherwise try to to talk her into a
deal _ which, of course, she rejects.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the movie. As written and directed by Kevin
Williamson (the writer of ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer''), it's played mostly for laughs _ with a heavy infusion of
teenage romance _ and it's never quite as mean-spirited as my
synopsis makes it sound.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the best thing on the screen is Mirren. She's
an authentic star, and one who has become ever more charismatic and
appealing as she's aged in the movies of the past 25 years. This is
the meatiest role she's had in ages, and she makes the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   But she's almost too much actress for the part. As played here,
Mrs. Tingle is so confident, so cunningly resourceful and so
physically attractive that its impossible to believe her as a
small-minded shrew in a dead-end job. This woman should be running
General Motors, or, at the very least, a movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching Mrs. Tingle. Directed and written by Kevin Williamson.
Produced by Cathy Konrad. Cast: Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Marisa
Coughlan, Barry Watson. Dimension Films. 93 minutes. Rated PG-13
for sex scenes and some violence.

JOHN TURTURRO'S `ILLUMINATA' IS AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Turturro is a reliable and often inspired supporting actor
(``Quiz Show,'' ``The Color of Money''), and he made a credible
debut as a director in 1992 with his autobiographical first film,
``Mac,'' which won the Camera d'Or at Cannes that year.
</P>
<P>
   But with his second directorial effort, `Illuminata,'' he's been
hit by the sophomore curse, big time. The movie is an
incomprehensible mess _ so boring and numbingly unworkable that
it's hard to imagine what he could have been thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a freewheeling ensemble piece, set in the backstage
world of a New York repertory company around the turn of the
century _ but I had to learn this from the press notes, because it
seems to take place in Italy in some time warp (i.e., the company
ingenue has a tattoo on her chest).
</P>
<P>
   Turturro, who co-wrote the script and co-produced, plays Tuccio,
the resident playwright, who is eager for the company to stage his
unfinished play, ``Illuminata,'' but is having resistance from the
theater owners (Beverly D'Angelo and Donal McCann), who consider it
chaptrap (they're right).
</P>
<P>
   There's also Rachel (Katherine Borowitz), the company's lead
actress, for whom Tuccio has written the play; Old Flavio (Ben
Gazarra), the company's chest-pounding senior actor; and Celimene
(Susan Sarandon), the aging star of another company who sees
``Illuminata'' as a potential vehicle for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix are the juvenile leads (Rufus Sewell and
Georgina Cates); the flamboyantly swishy and hugely powerful drama
critic Umberto Bevalaqua (Christopher Walken); and Marco (Bill
Irwin), a handsome actor who this corrupt critic wants to seduce.
</P>
<P>
   When an actor collapses during a performance of ``Cavalleria
Rusticana,'' Tuccio contrives to instantly substitute
``Illuminata,'' and the movie chronicles the various clumsy
seductions, farcical backstage scheming and other intrigues that
ensue.
</P>
<P>
   If this synopsis makes the movie sound like it has a clear
focus, then I shamelessly flatter it. Mostly, it just rambles about
aimlessly, with no real storytelling momentum, and scene after
scene that fail to be in any way engaging or even slightly amusing.
</P>
<P>
   The roles are broadly written by Turturro, and hammily acted by
the cast _ even such sure-fire performers as Sarandon and Walken
can't make anything of the script. Turturro himself doesn't have
the stature of a lead, and his overemphasis on his own character
seems narcissistic and self-indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, his film contains long, long scenes on-stage in which
we're forced to watch actors perform monologues and slices of
``Illuminata'' that have no context or meaning to us, but which
Turturro seems to think are profoundly moving. But then he's read
the play; we haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminata. Directed by John Turturro. Screenplay by Brandon
Cole and John Turturro. Cast: John Turturro, Susan Sarandon,
Christopher Walken, Beverly D'Angelo, Katherine Borowitz. Artisan.
95 minutes. Rated R for sexual references.

HUGH GRANT: FROM GOOD FELLOW TO GOODFELLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Stories about Hugh Grant typically include
certain inescapable adjectives _ ``floppy-haired,'' ``bumbling''
and the like _ that have come to define the 38-year-old actor's on-
and off-screen persona in a way that irritates him to no end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuttering is another one,'' Grant grumbles. ``Completely
unfair. `Effete,' used, of course, wrongly. `Boyish.' I've also
been referred to several times as pocket-sized, which is quite
weird for someone who is 5-feet-11. I can show you some
pocket-sized stars, but I'm not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what words would Grant use to describe himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``Moody. Dangerous. Brooding. Super sexy. Those will do fine,''
Grant says. ``One other _ slightly cruel. Yes. I rather like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   None of those words, of course, remotely resemble the public's
image of the charming Grant, who's back in theaters this summer
(after a three-year absence) in two romantic comedies. ``Notting
Hill'' you probably know about. ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' comes from
Simian Films, the production company Grant formed with longtime
girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley. Grant plays an art auctioneer caught
up in the New York mob through his fiancee's family.
</P>
<P>
   One magazine called ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' Grant's ``moment of
truth,'' another description the English actor finds laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my life's burning ambition was to be a movie star, then it
would be a very big moment,'' Grant says. ``I want the film to do
well, but I like to think there are other aspects to life as well.
I'm always boring on about how I should give up this business and
do something more grown-up. So, if I'm forced into that, it really
wouldn't be the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Grant to retire any time soon. Here, he drolly
explains the subtleties of underworld fashion, how Julia Roberts
could have made Benito Mussolini a star and why hugs from James
Caan should be approached with some caution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' co-star, James Caan, says that the
trick to the movie was to keep you nervous all day long. His quote:
``I scared him out of his skin some days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant: Lovely man, Jimmy. I believe he took the role just
to torment me for a few months, and he did so with some relish. I
thought it was nice that we gave him a job in the first place, sort
of plucking him from the old people's home as it were.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And he calls you a ``little wimpy guy.'' That's the thanks
you get.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: I think he was in love with me. That's why he can't leave
the subject alone now. His whole thing about me being an English
wimp is his cover-up for the fact that he has a crush on me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you suspect this because ...
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Well, you know, there's a lot of hugging and kissing in
these mob movies, and I got the impression halfway through the
shoot that the hugs were lasting just a little bit longer than they
needed to.
</P>
<P>
   Q: He wouldn't be the first person to fall in love with a
co-star.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: No. Making a movie brings you together. And I'd catch
looks across the set from him, and the thing got worse and worse,
and I'd go back to my apartment in New York and find him curled up
in a little ball outside.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was this hard for Elizabeth?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Well, it was obviously embarrassing for her. And then the
poems came.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were going to have an on-set crush develop, I'd
imagine you'd pick Julia Roberts over Jimmy Caan.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: One would think so. But she tormented me as well. I just
realized that all these American actors torment me. When I got in
bed with her for our big love scene, she said, ``Hey, someone
around here has been to the gym and it's not HUGH.'' That was very
depressing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The success of the movie must have cheered you up.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: It was a relief, of course, after having been away for so
long. Everyone from the beginning said ``Notting Hill'' was going
to be huge. But what I hadn't calculated on, and what I now
realize, is that Julia could make a romantic comedy with Mussolini
and the film would make $150 million. And that's rather annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Being cast as Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Yes. Because my part in the movie was actually bigger
than hers, and I naively thought, ``This is my movie with Julia in
it.'' And when the film was being marketed, I suddenly realized,
``No. I'm just Mussolini.'' I'm the little guy walking by her giant
poster.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' came from your production company,
you must have insisted on poster approval.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Yes. It's nice to have power, to feel like you're one of
the grown-ups on the film set. Although, producing is torture, too,
with literally 700 things to worry about in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And Elizabeth is a details-oriented person?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Not at all. She's very good at being a producer in that
she inspires fear in nearly everyone she meets. There's always the
latent threat of physical violence. But she's much less organized
than I am. And that's hard on me because I'm not accustomed to hard
work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You consulted with actual mobsters to give ``Mickey Blue
Eyes'' a realistic feel. Did they have any problems with the humor
in the script?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Mobsters are very funny people. That's why just about
everybody who plays a mobster in the film is, frankly, a mobster or
closely connected to their world. No one could be funnier. And a
lot of them, particularly the low-grade ones, knew Jimmy Caan. In
fact, he was raised by mobsters, not unlike Mowgli being raised by
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did these wise guys offer any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: You'd have dinner with them and, after a few drinks, one
would say, ``There's a moment in the movie where the guy gets
whacked. It don't happen like that. If I was going to whack you,
I'd come up behind you, boom, you're gone. You wouldn't know what
hit you.'' You say, ``All right then, we'll change that.'' It is
quite a weird piece of dinner conversation, not something you'd
come across very often in Hammersmith.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about fashion tips?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Well, I don't think I could pull off the banana yellow
suits. But I quite want to do the jewelry route. I dropped into
Harry Winston and inquired about some diamond cuff links, but then
Elizabeth found out and said it was a waste of money that would be
better spent on her.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who had better accessories _ the mobsters or Elizabeth?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: I don't know about better, but the men certainly had
more. They used to compare jewelry _ and manicures. There would be
this ongoing debate. Elizabeth took a couple of them to the Estee
Lauder spa at Bloomingdale's and gave them the new Estee Lauder
manicure. After that, she could do no wrong in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And in your eyes?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Well, she does come in quite handy at events like
premieres. That's a talent she has that I don't. She tells me what
face I should make when facing banks of paparazzi. I'm useless in
that regard. I always look like a constipated lesbian for some
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what ``look'' have you decided works best for you?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: I go through phases. Sometimes I think smiling is the
best answer because then you look happy and successful. But
unfortunately, I also look enormously fat-faced like that, and I
have very bad teeth. So, Elizabeth begged me not to smile, and I
put on a mean and moody look. But then underneath the photo, the
caption always says, ``Gloomy Hugh. What's up?'' So I'm back to
square one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything Elizabeth refuses to do with you?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Whenever I'm in Los Angeles, I'll go watch the big
football (soccer) games at the Cat and Fiddle. Being broadcast live
from England, the matches begin here at 5 or 6 in the morning. Once
I dragged Elizabeth along and she never forgave me. So, now I
usually go by myself because it's difficult to convince anyone to
wake up that early.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the expatriates surprised to see you?
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Well, it's an interesting crowd. I'll be at the bar, it's
6 a.m. and there are people ordering three pints of Snakebite,
which is a half-beer, half-cider mix that most English pubs refuse
to serve because it's so lethal. That's their breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd hate to hang around for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: Things get a bit rowdy, but only if England is winning.
Complete strangers will be hugging each other, buying the room
pints of Snakebite.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds like a place your friend James Caan would like.
</P>
<P>
   Grant: He'd love it. He enjoys a good hug. God knows. &UR;  &QL;

BRITISH BAND POUNDED OUT MEMORABLE ROCK TUNES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The first time ex-Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan
heard the term ``garage rock,'' his reaction was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I instantly thought, `We invented it!''' he says. ``See, the
thing about the Faces was, it was very earthy but very musical at
the same time. It was all about having a good time. And the secret
was, the girls liked us and the fellas did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Faces formed in 1969 after the demise of Britain's beloved
'60s mod group Small Faces. The band _ Rod Stewart (vocals), Ron
Wood (guitar), Ronnie Lane (bass), Kenney Jones (drums) and McLagan
_ is the subject of a terrific new 19-track anthology, ``The Best
of Faces: Good Boys ... When They're Asleep'' (Warner
Archives/Rhino).
</P>
<P>
   A rough, sloppy, hard-drinking rock 'n' roll band, the Faces
were able to pound out a rocker like ``Had Me a Real Good Time,'' a
folky tune such as ``Sweet Lady Mary'' or the ambitious,
blues-tinged ``Debris.''
</P>
<P>
   The quintet called it quits in 1974 after Stewart's solo career
turned the Faces into a mere backing band. Still, their music has
influenced guitar-rock bands from the Replacements to the Black
Crowes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were made in the States,'' recalls McLagan, who lives in
Austin, Texas. ``Rod's heart was in the Faces at the beginning, but
he began to keep his best stuff for his solo albums. Then, people
started buying more of Rod's albums than ours.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ODDS 'N' ENDS

<P>
   The moody Blue Hawaiians say aloha to their longtime home,
Hollywood's Lava Lounge, on Sunday before launching a world tour in
support of their new album, ``Savage Night.'' ... Worst band name
of the week _ the Gas Giants _ formed by ex-members of Arizona's
Gin Blossoms. ... The reunited Cult continues its seven-night stand
tonight at the House of Blues. ... David Bowie is putting the
finishing touches on ``hours ...'' _ a new album set for release

BASEMENT JAXX/``REMEDY'' (Astralwerks/XL)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Savvy Brit duo Basement Jaxx (knob twirlers Simon Ratcliffe and
Felix Buxton) currently rule the dance floor as the new kings of
house music. But don't let that scare you. Whether you're a rock
fan or monkish techno-head, this innovative debut sustains interest
and will have you returning for more.
</P>
<P>
   Standouts such as the flamenco-fueled club anthem ``Rendez-Vu''
and the smoldering funk workout ``Red Alert'' prove cutting-edge
dance sounds needn't be as rock-based as Fatboy Slim, head-banging
as the Chemical Brothers or ascetic as Moby and Aphex Twin. With
``Remedy,'' Basement Jaxx offer infectious modern dance-pop with
personality, wit and hooks to spare. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHARLIE HADEN QUARTET WEST/``THE ART OF THE SONG'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Supported by a string quartet, bassist Haden and his acclaimed
small combo return for another beautiful album of jazz and pop
standards. Vocalists Shirley Horn and Bill Henderson each sing on
four songs, and Haden himself handles the vocal duties (rather
touchingly) on the album's closer, the traditional ``Wayfaring
Stranger.'' The pace is unhurried, sometimes to the point of
monotony, with one leisurely ballad leading to another (and
another). The cumulative result, though, is a graceful program of
meaningful standards that feels like musical poetry, which happens
to be Haden's stock in trade. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NUSRAT FATEH ALI KHAN/``SWANSONG'' (Narada) &UR; !off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years after his death, the great singer of Sufi
devotional music is presented in his last live concert recorded in
his native Pakistan. Qawwali music is, at its heart, an intensely
ecstatic, improvisational music best shown off on stage. The
two-disc ``SwanSong'' finds the master in peak form (although the
same can't always be said of the recording quality, which is
sometimes marred by feedback and other aural defects), months
before he was scheduled to sing with Luciano Pavarotti, Bjork and
Madonna. Those sessions never had a chance to blossom, but this one
did. Be glad. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bloom &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JULIE MILLER/``BROKEN THINGS'' (HighTone)
</P>
<P>
   Like Lucinda Williams and Gillian Welch, roots-rocker Miller
makes highly personal country- and folk-based music that has the
rare ability to transport. On her second solo effort, produced with
help from husband and guitar dazzler Buddy Miller (plus an all-star
cast of Patty Griffin, Steve Earle, Victoria Williams and Emmylou
Harris), Miller ranges from folky to all-out rock, always mindful
that the tune's the thing.
</P>
<P>
   On an album of fine work, clear standouts include ``I Know Why
the River Runs,'' ``Orphan Train'' and ``All My Tears,'' a
memorable Miller song previously covered by both Little Jimmy Scott
and Harris. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JIMMY RUSHING &AMP; FRIENDS/``OH LOVE'' (Vanguard)
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Basie frontman Rushing gets his due on this reissue, to
be followed by three other volumes drawing from the excellent
jazz/blues platters he cut for the label. Called ``Mr.
Five-by-Five'' because of his round stature, Rushing stands tall as
one of the great blues belters of all time, a man who exuded a
joyous enthusiasm with every note he sang.
</P>
<P>
   This album, which features the glorious Basie rhythm section of
Jo Jones (drums) and Walter Page (bass), also spotlights legendary
boogie-woogie pianist Sammy Price on half of its dozen cuts.
Wonderful stuff and one of the best reissues of the year. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RIZMAN-MUAZZAM QAWWALI/``SACRIFICE TO LOVE'' (Real World)
</P>
<P>
   Two teen-age nephews of the great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan take up
the family biz (the Khan clan has been singing Sufi devotional
music for five centuries) to good effect. The boys (as well as
another singing nephew, Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the heir
apparent who has toured widely in the United States) aren't yet at
the Olympian level of their late uncle, but the rhythmic pulse of
this music, the soaring and trance-inducing vocals and the fire of
religious faith carry this one quite far nonetheless. It will
surely be interesting to see where the boys take this music in the
future. 2 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bloom &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HARRY ``SWEETS'' EDISON/``THE SWINGER AND MR. SWING'' (Verve)!off!
</P>
<P>
   The late great trumpeter Edison passed away last month at the
age of 83, leaving behind a distinctive body of work that can be
touched by few. The albums on this double-disc reissue were
completed in 1958, just as Sweets was shining as a session man on
Frank Sinatra's classic Capitol records.
</P>
<P>
   Working with saxman Jimmy Forrest, well-schooled in swing and
r&AMP;b grooves, and underrated pianist Jimmy Jones, Edison shows his
patented blend of timing, phrasing and economy (not to mention
humor) in these long-out-of-print sessions of originals and
standards, which include two previously unreleased tracks. Since
Edison led few dates, particularly during this period, this is an
excellent chance to hear a legend in his natural habitat. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARLING &AMP; CAMERON/``ALL-IN'' (emperor norton records) &UR; !off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wacky Dutch dancemeisters, plainly sparked by labelmates
Stereolab, here dip into a pop soup of '60s and '90s influences
ranging from Lalo Schifrin spy themes to chirpy synthesizers to
rock guitar to goofy Japanese bubblegum. The ultra-slinky ``Voulez
Vous?'' has earned airplay and is a fun, empty-headed invitation to
the dance floor and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea how perfectly Arling and Cameron marry silly and
sublime, ``How About the Boys?'' is being used in TV ads for the
Gap. In their recent Los Angeles appearance, the Dutch boys'
concert featured an ersatz bird-call lecture, complete with slides,
and a Mozart solo by their Theremin-playing sidewoman! Totally
whacked, but great fun. 2 1/2 stars

WAR WILL BE LONG, RUSSIA NOW ADMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia Thursday acknowledged that its campaign to
suppress an Islamic rebellion in Dagestan was not working, a stark
reversal of almost daily assurances that it would crush the rebels
within a week.
</P>
<P>
   As federal troops reported their heaviest losses yet in the
13-day conflict, a senior Russian commander said Moscow was
rethinking the tactics it was using to dislodge armed militants who
have declared an independent Islamic state in the rugged Caucasus
region.
</P>
<P>
   It was the clearest sign that the military has begun to accept
what independent observers have been saying all along: that Russia
faces a long, drawn-out struggle against the 2,000 followers of
renegade Chechen commander Shamil Basayev.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of artillery and air strikes and other types of
weapons which are in place is not effective enough,'' said Colonel
General Igor Zubov, the Russian deputy interior minister who
returned from the fighting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters in Moscow that Basayev's men had fortified
positions on the hills around the several villages they control
inside Dagestan's border with separatist Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov spoke after Russian troops were repulsed in an effort to
take one of the villages, Tando, which is strategically located on
the rebels' supply line to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian army said 17 of its troops were killed and 18
wounded during the failed assault _ losses that had made the
commanders think again. A major offensive planned for this week had
been put off until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The villages) could be taken by a direct assault but it would
bring big losses,'' Zubov said. ``Therefore . . . I must say we
have decided to make sure our losses come to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubov said the mountainous terrain in Dagestan gives the rebels
many places to hide from Russian warplanes and gunships during the
day. At night, he said, they emerge to launch deadly raids against
the Russians. Even troops who fought in the 10-year Soviet campaign
in Afghanistan and Russia's 1994-1996 conflict with rebels in
Chechnya say mountain warfare in Dagestan is much harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veterans say, `We have not seen anything like this,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov's somber assessment contrasted with the almost daily
assurances of senior commanders and recently appointed Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, who promised that the rebels would be
destroyed by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   As Moscow's optimism waned, Dagestani leaders, who have chided
the federal commanders for moving too slowly, expressed their
irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generals were in an excessively good mood when they made
their declarations about how Dagestani territory would be cleared
of militants in a week,'' observed Mukhu Aliyev, the speaker of the
regional parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov's remarks came as the military released casualty totals
for the first time. The figures of 40 dead and 160 wounded were
shockingly high for the kind of mop-up operation the Kremlin has
been describing. Even observers who remember how badly Russian
leaders underestimated their opponents in their disastrous
1994-1996 campaign in Chechnya expressed surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a real war in the Caucasus,'' commented an
anchorwoman on Russia's NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov said the military had ``achieved its strategic goals'' by
breaking the rebels into small, disjointed groups. But he did not
explain why the Russians were unable to overwhelm them.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested Russia was repeating the mistakes of Chechnya.
The Moscow daily newspaper Kommersant described Thursday's failed
assault as a mirror of so many botched attacks in that conflict,
noting that the Russians believed air strikes had sufficiently
weakened the rebels to permit a ground assault, only to have the
militants emerge from basements and caves to beat back the
government troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians say that more than 500 rebels have died in the
fighting, but there has been no independent confirmation. Moscow
also says it has surrounded the rebels, in part by mining the roads
that connect Dagestan and Chechnya. But NTV Thursday reported that
Basayev easily moves between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev helped orchestrate the Russian defeat in Chechnya but
now operates outside the control of the breakaway region's
self-proclaimed independent government. He told reporters this week
that he would not leave Dagestan until Russian troops leave.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev wants to unite Dagestan and Chechnya. He uses code names
for his operations based on names of 19th century religious leaders
who led the resistance by Chechen and Dagestani warriors against
Czarist armies.
</P>
<P>
   But Dagestani leaders say that despite their historic ties to
the Chechens, their people have no interest in seceding from Russia
now. Pro-Moscow Dagestani leaders Thursday warned civilians of
possible attacks by the rebels in other parts of the region. That
warning was made after Basayev, speaking to Russian reporters,
threatened to begin a new operation, code-named ``Imam Gamzat
Bek,'' which Russian intelligence believes will involve attacks on
large cities on the plains in northern Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's press ministry responded by warning television stations
to stop broadcasting interviews with rebel leaders.

   In a report to Congress this week, the US Department of
Transportation said that all of the 10 major airlines in the United
States _ those with revenues of $1 billion or more _ met the goal
of having 75 percent of their fleet be comprised of quieter,
so-called Stage 3 aircraft, at the beginning of this year. By Jan.
1, 2000, the fleet must be all Stage 3 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, and the Air Transport
Association, the trade association for major carriers, expects all
the airlines to meet the Jan. 1, 2000 goal of having all Stage 3
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation sources, however, said that as many as 16 smaller
carriers have approached the FAA about obtaining a waiver
permitting them to fly in 2000 with some Stage 2 aircraft, but
officials are not inclined to grant any exemptions. As a result, it
is possible some planes will be grounded to meet the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this year, the FAA was more charitable,
allowing an airline that was one conversion away from meeting the
75 percent threshhold still fly, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of 1999, Alaska Airlines was the only major airline
to have completely converted its fleet from Stage 2 airplanes to
Stage 3 airplanes. Trans World Airlines brought up the rear, with
25 percent of its fleet still the noiser Stage 2 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Of national airlines, with revenues between $100 million and $1
billion, Midwest Express, which flies into Logan Airport, had 77.8
percent of its fleet Stage 3 aircraft. Of the cargo carriers,
United Parcel Service's entire fleet was quieter airplanes,
Airborne Express was at 83 percent, and Federal Express was at 89.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stage 2 airplanes are restricted from operating at Logan from
10:30 p.m. and 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Residents near the airport said they can't tell any difference
between the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone in close proximity is going to suffer from considerable
noise pollution and it doesn't matter whether it is Stage 2 or
Stage 3,'' said Preston Galarneau, a councilman in Cheslea, who
lives on the water near Logan International Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is admirable what they are trying to do, but it does not
have much of an impact. They are pretty low and very loud when they
come by my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Older planes that do not meet the new noise requirements must
either be retired, refitted with new engines, or have something
called a hushkit installed that acts like a muffler to reduce
noise. There is some controversy over airplanes fitted with
hushkits, and the European Community is considering banning them
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   During 1998, 479 noisier Stage 2 aircraft were removed from
service and 745 Stage 3 aircraft entered service. At the start of
the year, there were some 511 Stage 2 aircraft used by major
airlines that were still in service, and US cargo arilines had
another 131 in service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA and the entire aviation community are committed to a
cleaner, less noisy airspace system,'' FAA administrator Jane F.
Garvey said Thursday in a prepared statement. ``This report show
that we are living up to that commitment.''

TEXAS MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY VOWS NOT TO CUT SERVICES _ FOR NOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state's mental health agency, which is
facing a $30 million annual budget shortfall, promised Thursday not
to cut any services for the next three months and to restore full
funding to a ``new generation'' drug program.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation
said it had found an additional $9 million to fund programs for the
mentally impaired in the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $7.2 million will restore all of the $27 million
allotted by the Legislature for a new generation of greatly
improved anti-psychotic drugs during the fiscal year 2000. Another
$1.8 million will prevent a cut in community mental health services
through November.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is undergoing an independent state audit to find out
why and how it miscalculated its budget by $30 million this coming
year and potentially the same amount for the next year. Although it
is too soon to tell whether cuts in services will be avoided
altogether, some officials expressed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think at the end of the day, unless things change, we
will be dealing with a reduction in services from what the
Legislature intended,'' said Don Gilbert, commissioner of Health
and Human Services, which oversees MHMR along with 12 other social
service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, who headed the mental health agency before assuming
oversight of all the social service agencies, said he believes the
audit will show the shortfall resulted from overestimating
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the new drugs for treating psychosis induced by
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depressions should cut
costs. Revenues, meanwhile, should rise under a new government
health plan for previously uninsured children with mental health
problems. The board of the mental health agency already has
announced cuts in central administration and information
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know is these new generation medications have a
profound impact on people with serious mental illness,'' he said.
``Their demand for in-patient psychiatric services is definitely
going to decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Gilbert said, the lower expected cost in the
second year of psychiatric treatment should begin to ``chip away''
at the budget problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right, I think. There should be significant savings, but
we don't know what that will be,'' said Rep. Garnet Coleman,
D-Houston, who specializes in mental health issues as a member of
the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to work with the state auditor's staff and
state leadership to address the remaining budget issues and to seek
additional long-term solutions,'' said MHMR Commissioner Karen
Hale.
</P>
<P>
   About $4.4 million of the new funding for drugs and continued
service will be transferred from the umbrella Health and Human
Services Commission, although Gilbert said he didn't know yet from
which programs or agencies the money will be shifted.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money is savings resulting from the agency
prepaying its leases for next year with money left over in this
year's budget, said Laurie Lentz, spokeswoman at the mental health
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve for mental health services brought relief for
advocates of the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the department has responded to the community's
concerns and the legislators' concerns about the budget cuts and
they reinstated those funds for community services, even if it is
only for three months,'' said Lynn Lasky, public policy director at
the National Association of the Mentally Ill of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, said it
is important that the agency reassure those who need mental health
services, but said the problems are fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that nobody has a handle on the big picture. If
you don't fix what's wrong with the fiscal accountability, that's
systemic and you're just going to have those problems over again.''

TWO SIDES OF MICROSOFT: AUTHORS LOVE, HATE SOFTWARE GIANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only way to explain the widely divergent views
of Microsoft Corp. that are emerging from the ever-expanding crop
of books being written on what has become the world's most valuable
company.
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural that a company worth $500 billion _ as
Microsoft was for a fleeting period this summer _ would have its
share of admirers and detractors.
</P>
<P>
   In one camp, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is portrayed as a
savvy visionary capable of shifting the focus of an established
software company to capitalize on the seemingly sudden rise of the
Internet. In another camp, the world's richest man is derided as
the embodiment of an evil emperor digging for new ways to crush
insurgent rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The truth probably lies somewhere in between. But you probably
wouldn't guess that from a pair of the latest pieces focusing on
the development of the Microsoft empire. For these authors,
recently studying the Microsoft phenomenon, the truth lies at one
end of the spectrum or the other.
</P>
<P>
   If you love Microsoft or have developed a good old-fashioned
distaste for the software giant, the local bookstore is likely to
have a new title that suits your taste.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned, though. If you're looking for objective
storytelling that helps explain the lessons that can be learned
from the evolution of the computer industry, you may just have to
keep on looking.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, for the lazy reader at least, the new Microsoft
titles pretty much lay their views on the line from the front
cover. The first is called ``How the Web Was Won. Microsoft From
Windows to the Web: The Inside Story of How Bill Gates and His Band
of Internet Idealists Transformed a Software Empire'' (Broadway
Books, New York, 352 pages, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds to you a little like the title of a book that
would be written by a hometown reporter, you're getting the idea.
It was penned by Paul Andrews of the ``Seattle Times,'' one of the
newspapers that closely tracks the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It's familiar territory for Andrews, who earlier co-authored a
book with Stephen Manes titled ``Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul
Reinvented an Industry and Made Himself the Richest Man in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that Andrews appeared to have extensive
cooperation from Microsoft executives, who gave him interviews and
access to key e-mail messages chronicling Microsoft's early
internal debates on how to address the rise of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews' book is enlightening in that it provides insight in how
Microsoft wrestled with the emerging threat of the Internet in 1993
and 1994 _ long before most consumers were aware of the World Wide
Web as a communications medium.
</P>
<P>
   But the text provides a narrative that only a techie could love.
The book plumbs the depths of the internal debate over the Internet
at Microsoft while giving a blow-by-blow account of incremental
steps, such as how a piece of networking software known as
``WinSock'' came to be integrated into the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   From the other end of the Microsoft love-hate spectrum comes a
more readable offering from author Gary Rivlin called ``The Plot to
Get Bill Gates: An Irreverent Investigation of the World's Richest
Man and the People Who Hate Him'' (Random House, 360 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   With chapters that carry titles like ``Bill Gates for Dummies''
and ``Bill Gates is Satan,'' Rivlin's work does not carry the
methodical precision that Andrews brought to his work.
</P>
<P>
   But a reader is likely to make it through more chapters and
maybe learn a little bit more about the broader landscape of the
computer industry in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And those readers who make it through Rivlin's entire book are
rewarded with three pages of Microsoft jokes in a stand-alone
appendix. In a book market flooded with Microsoft-related titles,
those three pages just may represent the most engaging material
available on the software giant today.

   MORE ON THE BOY AND HIS BEAGLE: Once again a boy and his dog and
their nice little movie, ``Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season,'' have
infiltrated the nation's theaters, hung around for too short a time
to be noticed by many people but just long enough to gather an
accolade or two before beating a precipitous but well-planned
retreat to more hospitable territory in video stores.
</P>
<P>
   The first time was in April 1997, when ``Shiloh,'' based on
Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's Newbery Medal-winning book about a beagle
and the boy who rescued him from an abusive master, opened on the
big screen. This year ``Shiloh 2'' entered theaters on July 2,
right when one big film after another was vying for screen time at
the height of the summer crush. In many places it lasted little
more than a week. ``We couldn't hold theaters in New York,'' said
Carl Borack, one of the producers. But then the plan was only to
till the ground for video.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the cassette was released by Warner. In the film, a
seventh-grader named Marty (Zachary Brown) does his level best to
befriend a misanthropic, gun-brandishing alcoholic named Judd
(Scott Wilson), who once owned Shiloh and resents Marty and his
family for taking him in for the dog's own good. Judd gives the
impression that he'd do a lot of damage with his gun if that was
his notion, but the boy and his father (Michael Moriarty) practice
restraint and patience. ``This is a smart, sensitive movie,'' Anita
Gates wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The first film was a smart one, too, and a success in theaters
and on video, but that didn't help the sequel when it was shopped
around Hollywood by Dale Rosenbloom, who directed ``Shiloh'' and
wrote ``Shiloh 2.'' So-called family films, of course, run all the
way from ``Tarzan'' to the most modest productions never intended
for the big screen. Before the ``Shiloh 2'' script was written, the
studios envisioned it as a cable and video property, not a film
suitable for a theater release. ``Too soft, not hip enough, not
edgy,'' Borack said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was made with independent financing and won some
prizes at festivals. Still it was rejected at the studios. ``They
said it would take $15 million to promote,'' Borack said. Finally,
it was suggested that if Rosenbloom wanted to hold out for the
movie screen, he should go through the back door, so to speak, and
approach studio video divisions, which might sponsor a scaled-down
theater appearance to help announce the cassette. Warner, which had
released ``Shilo'' on tape, accepted.
</P>
<P>
   At Warner the film's story, which is more substantial than those
in many movies of this kind, performances by an accomplished cast
and finished appearance marked it as a rare case. ``We do quite a
few direct-to-video movies, but for only a very few of them do we
try to get a theatrical release,'' said Dan Capone, a Warner vice
president in charge of family entertainment. ``For this movie, it
was important to get it into theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents probably were pleased. ``It's one of those movies they
can watch without saying, `Oh, my God, that was a painful two
hours,''' Borack said.
</P>

<P>
   THE CELEBRATION
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the adventurous standards of Dogma 95, the
Danish filmmakers' collective, the young director Thomas Vinterberg
turns a birthday reunion dinner into a wildly active battle royal
between Helge (Henning Moritzen), a prosperous, self-satisfied
patriarch and his rebellious children, including Christian (Ulrich
Thomsen, left). ``It's quite a job being toastmaster tonight,''
says one guest, and so it is when Dad stands accused of incest and
responsibility for a child's death. Reflecting Dogma 95's
adventurous approach to editing, Vinterberg, Janet Maslin wrote in
The New York Times, ``hurtles the film forward in a manner that
seems seamless but calls for immense skill.''

<P>
   Two scrappy young Frenchwomen, Isa (Elodie Bouchez) and Marie

moment and grab at betterment. Soon the confused Marie gets into a
bad match with a club owner (Gregoire Colin) while the
rough-featured Isa takes on a radiance as her confidant. Later,
though, Marie's sexual desperation drives a wedge between the pair
and they battle over their differences. ``As that bond frays, this
impassioned first feature by Erick Zonca reveals a soulful, moving
vision of our shared responsibility for one another's lives''
(Maslin).

   Doug Liman's film takes a circular route to nowhere and back in
the company of quick-witted young people who arrive at the starting
point somewhat wiser for their experiences. After a botched drug
deal, Ronna (Sarah Polley) has an altercation with Todd (Timothy
Olyphant) and lands in a police sting operation. Meanwhile, Simon
(Desmond Askew) has gone to Las Vegas, where he and friends
misbehave with lap dancers and get into trouble that follows them
back to Los Angeles. Along the way, Liman ``creates a film that
lives up to the momentum of its title and doesn't really need much
more.''(Maslin).

   When a programming executive (Ellen DeGeneres) has the idea to
follow every move of an ordinary person on television, she may not
have meant someone quite as ordinary as Ed Pekurny (Matthew
McConaughey), the 31-year-old video clerk who is selected for the
project. With cameras recording his every move, Ed does little more
than scratch himself in unsightly places until he gets involved
with his brother's ex-girlfriend (Jenna Elfman). Suddenly the
country is hooked on Ed in Ron Howard's film, which ``brings the
effects of such cultural topsy-turviness right home'' (Maslin).

   THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALLEN GINSBERG. Toward the end of Jerry
Aronson's film, shown on PBS in 1997, the poet, who died in 1996,
says, ``I had my chance and I lost it.'' That's a harsh
self-assessment from a man who had such a strong influence on
intellectual thought since publication of his first poem, ``Howl,''
in 1956. Here the life and times move from the Ginsberg's early
poems to his placement among Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs
as a prototypical Beat, his homosexuality, the protests against the
Vietnam War, his experiments with LSD and his devotion to Buddhism.

`ANALYZE THIS': SIMPLE PLOT, GREAT CASTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wise guys are funny _ and they have feelings, too,
at least according to ``The Sopranos'' on HBO, or a 1997
made-for-cable-comedy called ``The Don Analyst,'' or the recent hit
film ``Analyze This,'' which hits video and DVD shelves this week.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine James Cagney in the 1931 classic
film ``The Public Enemy'' having a crying jag like mob boss Robert
De Niro does in ``Analyze This,'' but, hey, we're all more
sensitive now. ``Public Enemy,'' by the way, is the film in which
the brutal Tom Powers (Cagney) smashes a grapefruit into the face
of his mistress (Mae Clarke). Try to get away with that now.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the mob has become something to laugh about in
Hollywood today, or not laugh about if you count last year's
alleged comedy ``Mafia.'' The laughs in ``Analyze This,'' though,
are mostly right on target. The most brilliant casting coup was De
Niro _ who is known for his wise-guy characters in ``The
Godfather'' and ``GoodFellas'' _ as the conflicted mob boss. It's a
wonderful self-referential joke that resonates throughout the film.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is simple. De Niro plays Paul Vitti, a New York City
mobster facing a midlife crisis after his best friend is whacked by
a rival gang leader (Chazz Palminteri). Billy Crystal is
psychiatrist Ben Sobol, who unwittingly becomes Vitti's shrink
while in the midst of trying to tie the knot with his fiancee (Lisa
Kudrow). Director Harold Ramis (``Groundhog Day,''
``Multiplicity'') keeps the gags coming, but the best part is the
Cyrstal-De Niro relationship, which grounds the comedy. In lesser
hands, some of the material would fall flat, but with De Niro
playing off his tough-guy image and Crystal at his nebbish-y best,
the film's fanciful premise flies. In particular, a clever parody
of one of the most famous scenes in ``The Godfather'' is all the
more funny because of the pair's screen personas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' also boasts a solid supporting cast. Kudrow, in
a relatively minor role, is the perfect combination of unflappable
and hysterical, and Joe Viterelli _ as De Niro's right-hand man,
Jelly _ segues from mayhem to slapstick with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, ``Analyze This,'' don't forgetaboutit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Everybody's watching: Ron Howard's ``EDtv,'' which also arrives in
video stores this week, unfortunately hit screens less than a year
after ``The Truman Show,'' and audiences apparently weren't
interested in another hit on the television industry. ``EDtv'' is
hardly in the class of the Peter Weir film _ ``Truman'' is an
interesting parable that has something to say about our media
culture, while ``EDtv'' never does much more than throw a few barbs
at the boob tube and our obsession with fame. Nevertheless, ``EDtv
_ the story of a man, Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) who agrees
to have his life filmed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a
desperate cable channel _ is both funny and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey shines as the charming Ed, a 31-year-old
going-nowhere video-store clerk who is spotted for the show by a TV
producer (Ellen DeGeneres). After passing the audition, Ed is
signed to the channel, which also gets releases to film him and his
relatives and friends, including his brother Ray (Woody Harrelson),
Ray's girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman), his mother (Sally Kirkland)
and his stepfather (Martin Landau).
</P>
<P>
   At first the show is slow going, with the opening shot being Ed
waking up and scratching his private parts before realizing the
cameras are on him. Predictably, a baffled audience can't take
their eyes off him, and _ also predictably _ things get crazy.
Early on, he walks in on Ray cheating on his girlfriend, who
happens to be watching. Ed then has to hightail it over to Shari's
apartment to try to calm her, but she instead announces to the
world that Ray was lousy in bed. After that, the TV audience is
hooked, just waiting for the next shocking revelation while
debating aspects of Ed's life in man-on-the-street interviews or
polls in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv's'' looniness and terrific acting allow you to forget
that the film has little to say. But Howard's strong suit has
always been his ability to turn out consistently entertaining
films, and with ``EDtv'' he has a full house. &QL;

   CHRISTINA AGUILERA: ``Christina Aguilera'' (RCA/BMG). Build a
better nymphet: it's a lucrative proposition, with female
teen-age-oriented artists still relatively rare, and the appeal of
such imaginary girlfriends proved by the success of Britney Spears.
The challenge also has a moral dimension, since it means
acknowledging that girls are expressing their sexuality younger
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   One of the summer's catchiest singles captures the moment's
anxieties about teen-age sex. ``Genie in a Bottle,'' sung by the
blue-eyed former Mouseketeer Christina Aguilera, is a skittish
dance hit propelled by indecision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body's sayin' let's go,'' the 18-year-old singer whispers,
``but my heart is saying no.'' The chorus then spirals upward,
riding bubbly dance beats, as Ms. Aguilera declares herself the
kind of genie who appears only when rubbed ``the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   This double-entendre, shocking to some, nonetheless expresses a
distinctly female sexual need and imagines a self-aware Ms.
Aguilera in charge of it. It has topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This singer's full-length debut, out this Tuesday, is engineered
to keep her there. The pop empress Diane Warren wrote two ballads:
a Whitney Houston-style rave-up, ``I Turn to You,'' and the bouncy
``Somebody's Somebody,'' in which Ms. Aguilera seems to replicate
herself as an En Vogue-like girl group. ``Love Will Find a Way''
gains spice from a reliable Jackson Five-style bass line. The
flamboyant Star Search-style ballad ``Reflection'' was on the
``Mulan'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its sleek design, this album hints at a real singer's
emergence. She has striking vocal power and range, if not a clue
about expressing individuality. Once she has fulfilled the
requirements of a teen-age pinup, she may enlist her bold talent to
make music as personally nuanced as ``Genie in a Bottle'' is
serendipitous.

 &HT;    Sleepers: 10 often-overlooked collector cars
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Automakers are more than willing to help baby boomers
relive their youth.
</P>
<P>
   From the burst of high-performance roadsters to the new
Volkswagen Beetle, manufacturers are bringing out a variety of new
``toys'' to appeal to a market niche with more disposable income as
their children grow up and out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, prefer the originals.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings Motor News, which publishes a catalog of collector cars
and parts, has listed 10 ``sleepers'' it describes as overlooked
collector cars. The 10 were chosen for potential appreciation in
value.
</P>
<P>
   The editors advise buyers to choose the very best example of a
car that you can find within your budget. If you have to farm out a
great deal of the work, the cost could exceed what the car is worth
today or in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a collector car is a matter of the heart, not the head,
for anyone other than the pros, they say. ``These cars should be
picked primarily because they appeal to you, so if you never make a
cent on the car, you'll still have a car you enjoy owning and
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings had two criteria: The car must be available for less
than $10,000, and the would-be collector should have a good chance
of finding an example of the car. The cars are listed in
alphabetical order:
</P>
<P>
   _ Austin-Healey Sprite/Mark I MG Midget, 1962-64
</P>
<P>
   The second-generation Austin-Healey Sprite built from 1962 to
1964 evolved from a bug-eyed, rounded roadster to a squarer, more
conventional appearance. Sharing the body shell and running gear
was the MG Midget, which differed in badging and trim levels. These
cars offer top-down fun, crisp handling, a choppy ride and
excellent fuel mileage as well as a vast availability of spare
parts. They're simple to restore and maintain and are in demand as
economical entry-level collector sports cars. Check carefully for
rust and rot as they can render these cars unrestorable if
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   _ BMW 2002, 1968-76
</P>
<P>
   The car that put BMW on the map in the United States quickly
proved itself a sensation on roads and racetracks throughout the
country. The slick two-door offered a combination of performance
and roadability that appealed to commuter and weekend racer alike.
Today, these cars are sought after by collectors but are not yet
out of reach for the enthusiast of modest means. These cars enjoy
an excellent parts supply and support from a large nationwide club.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buick Regal T-Type coupes, 1983-85
</P>
<P>
   The 1983-85 Buick Regal T-Type coupes were built to give Buick a
more youthful, sporty image. These street fighters had a
turbocharged V-6. Visuals included a blacked-out grille and
headlamps, hood bulge and bright rocker panel trim. These hot
Buicks have yet to catch fire with collectors.
</P>
<P>
   _ DeSoto V-8s, 1951-54

RACING CARS TAKE OFF AT AUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While no personal trainers are expected, an auction
next weekend at Pebble Beach, Calif., may give new definition to
the term ``body beautiful.'' There will be lots of tycoons, and the
testosterone will be flowing. But the bodies they will be ogling
will be auto bodies, many costing $1 million and up.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 29, Christie's will conduct its annual ``Exceptional
Motor Cars'' sale at the Pebble Beach Equestrian Center. The
auction will be held after four days of events, including a 50-mile
drive for entrants in this year's Concours d'Elegance, a beauty
contest for cars, and the Monterey Historic Car Races at Laguna
Seca, a nearby track. At last year's auction, Christie's sold $15
million in cars in two and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pebble Beach attracts car enthusiasts from all over the
world,'' said David Gooding, Christie's top car specialist. ``Tens
of thousands come.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's will offer 73 cars, among them a 1935 Bugatti Type 57
Atalante, a two-seater with its original black paint and cognac
leather seats; a 1937 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Cabriolet, a 1921
Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost tourer, and Marilyn Monroe's favorite car,
a golden yellow 1953 Cadillac Eldorado custom convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the world of dot.com billionaire collectors, a
car's mere beauty is not enough. Bruce and John McCaw of McCaw
Communications, who sold part of their company to AT&AMP;T; Anthony
Wang of Computer Associates, and Jon Shirley, a board member of
Microsoft, all collect vintage racing Ferraris, which have become
the ultimate status symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a postwar car, Ferraris tend to lead the way,'' said Miles
Morris, a Christie's car specialist. ``They have a special mystique
and allure. Ferrari was always particularly successful as a racing
car from the 1940s to the late 1970s. Ferraris go for higher prices
because people remember the races in their youth. They grew up with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bluntschli, a former Ferrari owner and racer who now works
at Cavallino, a magazine for serious Ferrari aficionados, said:
``There's nothing better than a throaty, open-air Ferrari. The
handling in the car is just incredible. You can't beat its
responsiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cote, the manager of Ferrari of Los Gatos, Calif., said,
``These cars are a total passion.'' He explained: ``When you drive
one, the hair goes up on the back of your neck. You get a tingly
feeling. There's the sensation of speed. It sounds like you are
going through a tunnel. It strikes almost a sexual kind of emotion.
In 15 minutes you get a visceral rush like you've never felt
before. Drugs have nothing on this; you have no idea how addictive
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sheehan, a Ferrari specialist in Newport Beach, Calif., put
it another way. ``Men are insane,'' he said, ``which is why they go
racing and spend $1 million on a car. Ferraris are in a world of
their own. It's like a religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing Ferraris have been built since 1947; to be considered
vintage, a Ferrari must be at least 25 years old. There are eight
vintage Ferraris in Christie's sale.
</P>
<P>
   People discuss Ferraris as they would champion thoroughbreds; in
fact, the car's symbol is a prancing horse. ``For me, a car must
have a great racing history,'' said Sheehan, who maintains a Web
site on the cars, www.ferraris-online.com. He said he liked Lot 38,
a 1966 Ferrari 275 GTB/C Competition Berlinetta, Chassis No. 9007,
which won the ``first in class'' title 15 times in 22 races between
1966 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 9007 has a spectacular history,'' he said. ``It has a good
engine with a lot of power, unusual sound, enough brakes to stop it
and really balanced handling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lot 54 is a 1952 Ferrari 340 Mexico Berlinetta Carrera Pan
Americana, Chassis No. 0226 AT, one of four of that model made. It
is estimated to sell for $1 million to $1.5 million. ``It's a great
car,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The car was designed to compete in the 1952 Carrera Pan
Americana, a 2,000-mile race on the new Pan American Highway. The
route was from the southern border of Mexico to Texas. The driver,
Albert Ascari, a Grand Prix world champion, crashed after 92 miles
but was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some wicked hairpin turns; the tires blew out at
160 miles an hour,'' said John Starkey, the author of ``Ferrari: 50
Years on the Track (Renwick &AMP; Starkey Ltd., 1998). ``It was a heck
of a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans also study the lineage of the Ferrari jockeys who handled
the cars. The 9007 was raced by a famous Italian driver, Sergio
Tullio Marchesi, who won the 1967 and 1968 Italian National Grand
Touring Championship titles.
</P>
<P>
   Provenance is another consideration. Was the car ever owned by a
celebrity like Ralph Lauren, Paul Newman, David Letterman or
Nicolas Cage, who all have vintage Ferraris? Is it part of the
stable of a major collector like David Scaife, a member of the
Mellon family and a Gulf Oil heir?
</P>
<P>
   Scaife is selling Lot 64, a sleek red hardtop convertible 1962
Ferrari 250 GT Nembo Spyder, Chassis No. 3771 GT.
</P>
<P>
   Other East Coast collectors include Scott Rosen, the co-owner of
National Wholesale Liquidators in New Jersey, and Oscar Davis, the
chairman of Hayward Industries of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market for Ferraris is worldwide,'' Morris of Christie's
said. ``It may be strongest in the U.S. but it's also good in
Japan, Australia, Europe and Great Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   International collectors include the Sultan of Brunei and his
brother Prince Jeffrey; Yoshiho Matsuda, a Japanese construction
tycoon; Brandon Wang, the diaper king of Hong Kong, and Lorenzo
Zimbrano, the head of Cimex of Mexico, one of the world's largest
cement companies.
</P>
<P>
   Does condition count?
</P>
<P>
   ``Few Ferraris are 100 percent original,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bluntschli pointed out, ``Over the past 40 years, a lot of
Ferraris crashed and burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ferraris are often rebuilt, she said she preferred cars
with matching chassis and engine numbers, that is, cars that have
retained their original engines.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said, ``It's like a Louis XIV antique chair,'' adding,
``If they are asking a million dollars for a chair from Versailles,
you want to make sure the top and bottom match.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the beauty issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beautiful body on a car counts tremendously,'' Sheehan said.
``Some collectors buy cars only for show. Others race them. Before
I sell a car, I ask the person what he wants to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris summed it up: ``At the end of the day, we're not owners
of these cars. We're really only custodians.''
</P>
<P>
   Show Time
</P>
<P>
   Saturday and Sunday 200 exhibitors will participate in Antiques
Weekend in Somerset, N.J., at the Garden State Exhibit Center
between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. The show's Web site is
www.stellashows.com.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at 3 p.m. John R. Clark of Kitty Kat Kollectibles will
lecture there on his specialty, Roseville art pottery made in Ohio
between 1890 and 1954. A piece of Roseville can range from $50 to
$2,000, depending on its rarity, period, color and decor.
</P>
<P>
   Lynde McCormick of Boston is selling Chinese vernacular antiques
at the show, including an 18th-century Ching elm painting table
priced at $3,400, and a 19th-century eight-foot-long elm altar
table, $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of demand in our area,'' McCormick said. ``Our
things are really different.'' His Web site:

INS WARNS MEXICAN CITIZENS ABOUT USING PHONY U.S. BIRTH
CERTIFICATES

   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Immigration officials are giving 2,000
Mexican citizens who bought fraudulent Texas birth certificates
from crooked midwives a choice _ surrender the phony document or
face arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A list of the midwives' clients has been distributed to
Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors at the
international bridges in Brownsville, part of the legal fallout
from perhaps the largest birth certificate fraud ever uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, federal prosecutors in Brownsville obtained
guilty pleas from 13 lay midwives in Cameron County _ including a
San Benito woman on a state health department midwifery advisory
board _ after charging them with selling hundreds of phony birth
records to Mexican parents at prices ranging from $400 to $1,500.
In exchange for probated sentences, the midwives agreed to hand
over lists of clients they falsely claimed had children born on the
U.S. side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican parents who attempt to bring their children into the
country using birth certificates they purchased from local midwives
now will be subject to arrest, INS officials warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to . . . have these people surrender the
document, that is the Texas birth certificate, which they had
obtained through fraudulent means and no questions will be asked,''
said Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Art Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, any attempt to use these illegally obtained
documents to get their offspring into the United States would
result in a prosecutable offense,'' Moreno warned, adding the
parent's local crossing card could also be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, INS officials contacted the primary media outlets in
Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, to publicize
their intention to stop those using the fraudulent birth documents
to bring their children into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we started this little media blitz, it's my
understanding that slightly more than 50 individuals have come
forward to surrender their Texas birth certificates at the
bridge,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraudulent birth documents gave the children born in Mexico
an automatic claim to U.S. citizenship, one that could eventually
extend to the child's parents and close relatives. And it also made
them eligible for an array of benefits and entitlements afforded
U.S. citizens, including welfare, food stamps, Medicaid and other
taxpayer-funded programs.
</P>
<P>
   Using the names provided by the INS, state welfare officials
found 100 families who used the false credentials to apply for
benefits, said Michael Uhrbrock, public information director for
the Texas Department of Human Services in Edinburg. Depending on
the amount of benefits paid, the families were either referred for
prosecution or asked to repay the benefits and removed from the
program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scam was simple for midwives to work, since they are allowed
to file delayed birth certificates attesting they assisted in a
birth outside a hospital. In one case, midwives recruited clients
at a Matamoros hospital by contacting new parents whose children
were born there, INS investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Trevino, the INS investigator who headed up the midwife
inquiry, told the Brownsville Herald that as many as 30,000 births
were recorded by a group of 20 midwives in Cameron County during
the past 10 years, and that most of them proved to be fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Houston Chronicle in 1996, Trevino
cited the prodigious pace of Brownsville midwife Margarita
Garcia-Rojas, then 61, who filed 3,400 birth certificates between
1985 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost like delivering a baby a day for 10 years,''
Trevino said. adding the midwives' activities failed to raise any
red flags with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to some people at City Hall in Brownsville and said
`How can a person file 3,400 records in a 10-year period and nobody
take notice, or suspect something is up?' They told me, `Well,
we're not investigators, and we don't have the authority to do
investigations.' But they do have a responsibility to the
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville Independent School District officials said they
don't know if the INS effort to identify children with fraudulent
documents has affected enrollment in the Rio Grande Valley's
largest district. Currently 38,732 students have enrolled, slightly
fewer than the 38,898 enrolled at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 166 students less now, the fourth day of school, than
at this time last year,'' said Drue Brown, public information
officer for the district. ``But we are starting school a full week
earlier (this year) and our totals are rising daily.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officials say the delay in placing the lists at the border
crossing was due to the lengthy investigation of the midwife's
records, which included births they did attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have the task of insuring the information provided by
midwives does not cause any undue hardships on those children who
were delivered by those midwives and born in the United States,''
Moreno said.

`DATELINE NBC': A LOOK AT SCHIZOPHRENIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(EDS: The spelling of Luca, in the 1st graf, is correct.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting into the mind of someone afflicted with schizophrenia is
no easy assignment, but Friday night's ``Dateline'' gives it a
dutiful try. The mind is that of the 26-year-old Luca Moylan, who
at the age of 14, after a seemingly happy childhood, began to
experience terrifying voices and hallucinations. At 17, he was
diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   When John Hockenberry, Friday night's reporter, met him two
years ago, he had already been wandering New York City's streets
for a decade, sometimes on drugs. He remembers his life then as
befogged and disconnected; he felt trapped in what he calls an
``ultimate loneliness.'' Then with the help of a new medication and
a psychiatrist associated with Fountain House, a mental-health
center on New York City's West Side, Moylan experienced a
remarkable turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   His allies were his mother, Donna, who had no unrealistic
expectations of success but, from the pictures of their spaghetti
dinners together, provided a sustaining, if often disappointed,
hope of some sort of improvement, and Dr. Ralph Aquila, who
provided medication, exhortation and a faith that Moylan was
capable of taking control of at least some basics of his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The medication helped him to the first steps to recovery, but as
Aquila kept emphasizing, recovery from the symptoms of
schizophrenia is slow and hard work. In a few weeks Moylan's mind
seemed to be clearing, and he felt ready to leave his halfway house
and go off on his own. But then despite the psychiatrist's
warnings, he began to be late or miss days at his mail room job and
to sample some marijuana, a dangerous recreation given his
condition. He resisted therapy; delusions returned.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy sessions, vividly recorded, become a battle of sorts
between the patient, who feels he is being manipulated, and the
doctor, who recognizes that the young man's try for freedom is
premature and dangerous. When Moylan demands a new life, Aquila
insists that he concentrate on more manageable goals, like holding
a job and getting to appointments on time: ``Let's do the concrete
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The desperation of that low point seems to have marked a new
resolve on Moylan's part. Why he escapes a breakdown is not
entirely explained in this report, but presumably the medication
and the therapy have been doing their job. Now he can work for a
few hours a week and talk to Hockenberry in a coherent way.
</P>
<P>
   He says he feels as if he had been in a coma for years. The
reporter describes him as having a ``newfound confidence in his own
mind.'' He hugs his mother, who, still realistic, speaks of his
seeming recovery as ``a quiet joy'' but ``fragile.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFTER LIFE,' starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika Oda.
Written, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118
minutes). Much of this transcendentally compassionate, gently
humorous Japanese film is set in a drab office building where
courteous caseworkers welcome the week's new clients. The place
turns out not to be a social service agency but a metaphysical way
station where the newcomers are people of all ages and types who
have just died and have three days to select one memory to take
with them into eternity. Before they depart, those memories will be
filmed. As they tell their stories and make their choices (those
who can't choose remain at the processing center as caseworkers),
the movie becomes a profound meditation on life's meaning and value
and the relationship of movies, memories and dreams (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PIE,' starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Natasha
Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Eugene
Levy. Directed by Paul Weitz (R, 100 minutes). The snickering
teen-age comedy about four boys, all seniors in the same Michigan
high school, who make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of
the school year serves up a new gross-out joke every five minutes.
The movie obviously wants to outdo ``There's Something About Mary''
in raunchy guffaws, but it lacks the antic spirit of its
forerunner. More like an upper-middle-class ``Porky's,'' it parades
its dirty jokes as crassly as an old-time burlesque show (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ARLINGTON ROAD,' starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope
Davis, Robert Gossett and Joan Cusack. Directed by Mark Pellington
(R, 117 minutes). In a smart, stylish thriller that recalls the
paranoid classics of the  &UR; ' &LR; 70s, Bridges plays a history professor
who begins to suspect that his smiling suburban neighbors are not
what they seem. Tracking down clues to an anti-government terrorist
network, he also engages in a battle of wits with Robbins' cryptic
character, and these fine actors square off to gripping effect.
Swift and pulse-quickening, this thriller has more than its share
of surprising twists, including a whopper at the finale. All in
all, a welcome change of pace from the season's dopey blockbusters
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN TALE,' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere, Didier
Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric Rohmer
(PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The final
chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand). The movie follows the adventures of
this wiry and vital but lonely widowed mother of two after she
allows two friends to play matchmaker. The film's plot, like that
of other Rohmer movies, is mathematically schematic as the
characters indulge in exquisitely verbalized soul-searching. As
sensuously gratifying as it is civilized, with a wonderful central
performance by Ms. Romand, it reaches a happy ending that feels
entirely earned (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BIG DADDY,' starring Adam Sandler, Cole and Dylan Sprouse and
Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Leslie Mann. Directed by Dennis
Dugan (PG-13, 95 minutes). It's awfully early in the career of Adam
Sandler to find him sharing the screen with a scene-stealing
6-year-old (actually the Sprouse twins). Besides, the cute kid in
Sandler's movies is usually the star himself. But he's in a
position to do whatever he likes, even if it's a flimsy sentimental
comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have
been hoped for. Having greatly expanded his following with the
romantic comedy and  &UR; ' &LR; 80s kitsch of ``The Wedding Singer,'' not to
mention the inspired rustic lunacy of ``The Waterboy,'' he falls
back on much less inventive material this time. And the barrage of
brand-name junk food is enough to make skin break out in the
audience (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pinup status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and much more, this clever little indie is at the center of
a new form of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BROKEDOWN PALACE,' starring Claire Danes, Kate Beckinsale and
Bill Pullman. Directed by Jonathan Kaplan (PG-13, 100 minutes). In
a movie reminiscent of last year's ``Return to Paradise'' (a much
stronger film), two American girls (Ms. Danes and Ms. Beckinsale)
vacationing in Bangkok are thrown in a Thai prison after being
arrested at the airport with several kilos of heroin that were
planted in their luggage. Although Ms. Danes is convincing as the
headstrong brat responsible for their predicament, the storytelling
is weak and confused. Pullman is the cynical expatriate American
lawyer enlisted to deal with the corrupt Thai justice system
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `BOWFINGER,' starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather
Graham. Written by Martin. Directed by Frank Oz (PG-13, 97
minutes). This hilarious, good-hearted spiritual descendant of
``The Producers'' is a comic coup for Martin. And it's directed by
Oz every bit as winningly as his ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and
``In and Out.'' Murphy is razor-sharp in a dual role, as both a
grinning fall guy and the kind of hotshot action star whose very
presence is enough to get a movie made. Martin, sublimely funny,
runs circles around him as an unscrupulous filmmaker trying to
trick the star into appearing in his movie. ``Did you know that Tom
Cruise had no idea he was in that vampire movie until two years
later?'' this filmmaker inquires. Made fondly and knowingly, with
nonstop good humor (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB,' with Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay
Segundo and Ry Cooder. Directed by Wim Wenders (not rated, 106
minutes). When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder
assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an
album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon,
selling more than a million copies worldwide and revitalizing the
Cuban music scene. Wenders' ebullient documentary follows the group
on tour from Amsterdam to New York and includes interviews with the
group's main members. The music pulsates, and the pictures of
Havana compare the city's grand but faded architecture with the
musicians' weather-beaten faces (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP BLUE SEA,' starring Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool
J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard and
Samuel L. Jackson, Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 100 minutes).
Better not mess with Mother Nature. That's the familiar message of
this man-against-shark horror film in which the research team of a
floating ocean laboratory is stalked by three 8,000-pound
genetically ``improved'' mako sharks. Ms. Burrows is the chilly,
anything-for-science marine biologist behind the research, and Jane
the hunky shark-wrangler who tends these razor-toothed killing
machines. ``Titanic'' meets ``Jaws,'' without romance, history,
myth or credible characters, only nonstop action and half an ocean
full of crimson, blood-thickened water (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DICK,' starring Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams. Directed
by Andrew Fleming (PG-13, 90 minutes). Now we know the identity of
Deep Throat, the confidential source who gave the journalists Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein the inside dish about Richard Nixon's
role in the Watergate scandal and helped bring down his presidency.
``Dick'' reveals the snitches to have been two giggly 15-year-old
girls, Betsy (Ms. Dunst) and Arlene (Ms. Williams), whom Nixon had
appointed his official dog walkers. In remembering the good old
days of plumbers and White House tape recordings, this extended,
wildly funny ``Saturday Night Live''-style sketch spares no one.
Dan Hedaya's shifty-eyed, hunch-shouldered Nixon caricature is the
hilarious embodiment of paranoid guilt (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `EYES WIDE SHUT,' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last cryptic,
spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a stunning
epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a dead-serious film
about eros and mortality, one that flirts with the ridiculous but
sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. Cruise,
as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of strange,
dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks his
jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film) is a joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GRAND ILLUSION,' starring Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay and Erich
von Stroheim. Directed by Jean Renoir (not rated, 117 minutes, in
French with English subtitles). An oasis of subtlety, moral
intelligence and deep emotion on the cinematic landscape this
summer. And the third inspired reissue in three years from Rialto
Pictures, which previously resurrected Godard's ``Contempt'' and
Fellini's ``Nights of Cabiria.'' As this 1937 masterpiece refracts
wartime through the peculiar civility of life in German-run prison
camps, it creates a rich and stirring vision of all that war
destroys. And the sole casualty in one of the most devastating
films about battle is a man who dies in bed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HAUNTING,' starring Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jan De Bont (PG-13, 117
minutes). In a wildly overdone haunted house with a Gothic nouveau
riche look, walls warp, statues morph and things go bump in the
night. The special effects are piled on so relentlessly that after
a while the sight of the flying cow from De Bont's ``Twister''
would not be amiss. Firmly committed to the idea that more is more,
this is a remake of a 1963 black-and-white film that left much more
to the imagination. But the cast is good; Neeson plays the doctor
who leads the other three principals to Hill House for a psychology
experiment that goes really, really wrong (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, John Wood and Jeremy Northam.
Written and directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best
thing about Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar
Wilde's 1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego, Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they are almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ILLUMINATA,' starring John Turturro, Katherine Borowitz, Susan
Sarandon, Rufus Sewell, Christopher Walken and Donal McCann.
Directed by Turturro (R, 111 minutes). An enormously fond homage to
the world of acting, beguilingly presented and full of knowing
backstage humor. The usual suspects _ the aging diva (Ms.
Sarandon), the self-involved leading man ( Sewell), the idealistic
aspiring playwright (Turturro) _ are played invigoratingly, as is
Walken's snide, Transylvanian-sounding critic. Turturro and Ms.
Borowitz, his somberly beautiful wife, play out a delicate balance
of love and ambition against this nicely tumultuous backdrop
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `INSPECTOR GADGET,' starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert
Everett. Directed by David Kellogg (PG, 85 minutes). The midmorning
midden of children's cartoons that yielded a vein of cinematic gold
with ``George of the Jungle'' has now been mined for this clinker.
Too bad, because this Disney comedy wastes good talent. Broderick
brings an endearing combination of intelligence, wit and naivete to
his portrayal of a security guard who is transformed into the human
gizmo, Inspector Gadget, after being blown up in an effort to
capture a megalomaniacal magnate ( Everett). But even Broderick can
go only so far with the film's noisy, childish material. Watching
this movie is like watching a human Swiss army knife for nearly an
hour and a half. It's a remarkable device, but do you really want
to spend a lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store
Frankenstein creation that can light cigars with his thumb, shoot a
grappling hook to the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter
from his head? (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE IRON GIANT,' with the voices of Elie Marienthal and Harry
Connick Jr. Directed by Brad Bird (PG, 90 minutes). Based loosely
on a children's fable written in 1968 by Ted Hughes, this film
looks at the fearful years of the Cold War through the politically
correct lens of the 1990s. All this re-examination of the
atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a
bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a
50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the
sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell,
Maine &UR; . &LR;  The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes
entangled in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret
playmate. Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid government agent is closing
in on the giant, leading to a showdown with the military. ``The
Iron Giant'' is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.
Many parents will doubtless approve of the film's messages while
they ponder how the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of
history (Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `MY LIFE SO FAR,' starring Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene
Jacob, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell and Robert
Norman. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 93 minutes). A steady
``Masterpiece Theater''-like glow warms ``My Life So Far,'' a boy's
reverie of growing up in the misty Scottish highlands of Argyll in
the late 1920s. Frisky little Fraser (Norman), who narrates the
story, recalls a year in the life of the mildly troubled Macintosh
clan. What strife there is mostly involves his father, Edward
(Firth), an eccentric fiery-eyed inventor, and his Uncle Morris
(McDowell), who brings home a beautiful French wife (Ms. Jacob),
with whom Edward falls in love. If the story is slight, it is
smoothly told and well acted (especially by Firth), and the
nostalgic atmosphere is beguiling (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MYSTERY MEN,' starring William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Hank
Azaria, Janeane Garofalo and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Kinka Usher
(PG-13, 100 minutes). Based on a comic book, this satire on the
superhero genre has a fine deadpan cast and a funny premise, even
if its skit-worthy material is allowed to run out of steam. Its
characters are lovable losers, convinced that superhero status is
mostly a state of mind and can be achieved even if one's secret
power is throwing forks or hoisting a shovel. Macy sets the
entertainingly tongue-in-cheek tone as the intrepid Shoveler, but
Usher does some shoveling, too. His film loads up on so many jokey
characters that it begins to be as overblown as a ``Batman'' _ and
not so far removed from the genre it mocks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later,
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
(Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK,' starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TWIN FALLS IDAHO,' starring Michael and Mark Polish and Michele
Hicks. Directed by Michael Polish (R, 100 minutes). This eerily
effective film carries the real-life closeness of twin brothers
into the realm of haunting fantasy. The look-alike Polish siblings
play conjoined twins whose delicately balanced interdependence
yields a rare brand of tension. With a bleak, lonely look and a
strain of black humor (in their three-legged suit, the film's Falls
brothers impress everyone on Halloween), the film introduces a
wild, gorgeous young woman into their lives and watches what
happens when one twin starts to court her. The story is intensely
rendered, without gimmicks (Maslin).

EVERNHAM STAYING PUT, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest rumor in Winston Cup racing burned itself out last
week when Tommy Baldwin, Ward Burton's crew chief, announced he was
staying with Burton in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That ended speculation that Baldwin was leaving Burton to
replace Ray Evernham as Jeff Gordon's crew chief, with Evernham
moving into management.
</P>
<P>
   The published report seemed to gain credibility when Evernham,
while implying nothing was going on, refused to deny that there had
been contact between Hendrick Motorsports, which owns Gordon's car,
and Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Further, both Bill Davis, Burton's car owner, and Burton were
clearly concerned about Baldwin's status. And Davis had been burned
by Hendrick before.
</P>
<P>
   It was Davis who gave Gordon and Evernham their start in NASCAR
when he teamed them in the Busch Series in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gordon was on Ford's fast track, but it wasn't fast
enough. Hendrick and Chevy snatched him away from Davis and Ford at
the end of 1992 and reunited him with Evernham, who had moved to
Alan Kulwicki earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis jumped from Busch to Winston Cup in 1993, and while he and
Burton won a race in 1995, until this season, Davis and Burton have
essentially struggled with mediocrity _ at best _ until Baldwin,
32, came on board late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Baldwin's direction, Burton has made a solid move up,
which has increased Baldwin's stature in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   That fact, plus repeated statements by Evernham indicating his
desire to move into management, seemed to leave the door open for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   But Baldwin's decision to stay with Davis and Burton, at least
for now, almost certainly means that Evernham will continue in his
present role with Gordon through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Evernham is no dummy. He understands that Gordon
factors into his success just as he plays a major part in helping
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Dale Jarrett and crew chief Todd Parrott
have been the most-consistent team in NASCAR this year, Gordon
remains the most competitive.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Evernham may be getting tired of the daily grind, he
will not move up until he is certain there is somebody ready to
move in.
</P>
<P>
   And there aren't a lot of guys capable of doing that.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, if he stays with Hendrick, it would probably be
beneficial to Hendrick's overall operation if Evernham were in more
of a supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Hendrick has Gordon and two other very sick cars.
There's a doctor in the house, but he doesn't have time to treat
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   If Evernham was able to pay more attention to the other two
teams, it could give them a boost. But a boost like that is
unlikely unless it can be done in a way that won't jeopardize
Gordon's chances of staying on top.

BALLPLAYER MANAGES TO BE THERE WHEN HISTORY IS MADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS ANDERSON   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Bobby Witt may hold the major-league record for
spine-tingling chills in a career. Baseball's version of Forest
Gump, Witt has witnessed some of the game's greatest moments.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Tampa Bay pitcher has been in the majors since
1986, so the chances of seeing something historic have been
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   But what Witt has watched is, well ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just weird,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While pitching for the Texas Rangers, Witt was in the dugout for
Nolan Ryan's 5,000th career strikeout, his 300th career win and his
sixth and seventh no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie in 1986, he saw Don Sutton pick up his 300th win.
</P>
<P>
   While pitching for Oakland in 1993, Witt saw Minnesota's Dave
Winfield record his 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, Witt was Tampa Bay's starting pitcher when Wade Boggs
hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, becoming the only player in
history to reach it on a homer.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in perspective, only 23 players have reached 3,000
hits this century, and Witt saw two of the players do it.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, 1998, Witt was traded from Texas to St. Louis, just
in time to see Mark McGwire go on a home run binge that landed him
in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the longevity factor,'' Witt said. ``Being able
to stick around you have a tendency to see more things, to see
certain historical moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just happen to be in the right place at the
right time. There's probably some guys who have been playing as
long as I have who haven't seen anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt keeps memorabilia in a game room inside his Texas home. He
could open a small museum with what he has.
</P>
<P>
   When Witt pitched in Texas, the Rangers always put a player's
picture on each game ticket. On the night Ryan fanned Rickey
Henderson for his 5,000th strikeout, Witt's picture happened to be
on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   To remember Ryan's 300th win, Witt has an untorn ticket from the
game and a signed commemorative bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Nolan for four years, and watching the no-hitters
and the 5,000th strikeout, was awesome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Witt said it was hard to single out a highlight of all the
events he has seen, but McGwire's 70th home run at the end of last
year ranks high.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire hit his 50th homer, he signed a ball for Witt that
read: To Bobby, home run No. 50, first player in history to do it
three straight years, Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire hit his 61st and 62nd home runs, he took all of the
balls that were not used in the game, signed them, and gave them to
his St. Louis teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after McGwire hit his 70th home run on the last day of
the 1998 season, Witt received a signed ball from the game in the
mail. He also received a dozen other baseballs signed by McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest surprises came one afternoon when Witt had
just finished working out. He returned to his locker to find the
spikes McGwire had worn for home runs 58-60. ``He just threw them
in there,'' Witt said. ``He was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt was the starting pitcher for Tampa Bay on the night Boggs
homered for 3,000. Witt lasted only two innings and left the game
after getting pounded for six runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have still been in the game,'' said
Witt, who has a 7-9 record. ``Just the way he did it, to hit a home
run for 3,000, just the electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already out of the game, and I came back down to get
dressed, and then I went back to the dugout. When he came to the
plate, it was the same feeling I had when McGwire came to the plate
for 61.''

IRWIN PART OF THE CHANGING FACE OF THE SENIOR TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ ``The good part about last week,'' said Hale
Irwin of his experience at last week's 81st PGA Championship, ``was
there was little expected of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of nice to walk in, be able to play, and not have
great expectations hanging over you. For myself, I expected to play
better. I hoped I'd play better. The first two rounds were shocking
to some people in that 1) I was able to walk 36 holes and 2) I had
a score where I could actually see the leaders. When you turn 50,
some people feel you become a non-entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was refreshing. I wasn't tired. It's just my game wasn't
quite where I needed it to be. Medinah finally exposed me. Had I
been in the hunt going into Sunday, it might have been different. I
lost it early on Saturday, and then it became a time of trying to
catch up. The great part of it was the reception I received on
every hole all week. Particularly on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was a touch of deja vu out there in the northwestern
suburbs of Chicago, Irwin turning back the clock and even earning a
glance from Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw. But it wasn't to be.
Irwin opened 70-69_139 to fan the fires of his youth, but closed
78-75 to finish tied for 41st at 4-over-par 292. This brought him
back to earth and sent him on his way to Thursday's Pro-Am before
teeing it up Friday in pursuit of a third straight BankBoston
Senior title at Nashawtuc CC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did make a comment early in the week to the press that I
wasn't playing my best golf,'' said Irwin of his performance at
Medinah. ``What I was doing was keeping it under control and
managing what I had quite nicely. I didn't putt particularly well
and I was keeping it in play. I led the field in driving accuracy
the first two rounds. I knew when the weekend started I couldn't
just fall back on that. I needed to step up my game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I three-putted a couple of holes right out of the box on
Saturday and never got the momentum going. I lost that good,
positive feeling I had created on Thursday and Friday. I did the
same thing on Sunday, and that's a tough course on which to get
anything back. I had pressures coming to bear, with talk about
Ryder Cup. They were just a few extra curves, and I was never a
good curveball hitter. That's why I left baseball. I just didn't
handle it all that well on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   So the venue shifts from the par-72, 7,401-yard layout at
Medinah, the longest at sea level for any major championship, to
Nashawtuc's par-72, 6,773-yard tract for this 54-hole event. The
young turks Irwin will face the next three days aren't named Tiger
Woods or Sergio Garcia. They're named Bruce Fleisher, Allen Doyle,
and Christy O'Connor. You're a rookie on this circuit when you're
50.
</P>
<P>
   This is a formidable field. Fleisher, who has won five times, is
No. 1 on the money list with earnings of more than $1.7 million.
Irwin has also won five times and is No. 2 $1.5 million in
earnings. Doyle, with three wins, including the PGA Seniors
Championship, has three wins and more than $1.3 million. Larry
Nelson is No. 4 and Dana Quigley of Barrington, R.I., is fifth.
Twelve of the top 15 money winners on the Senior Tour are in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are not big so you have to play good iron shots,''
said Irwin, who can join Chi Chi Rodriguez (1986-88) as the only
players to win this stop three straight years. ``You have to make a
careful analysis as to how you're going to attack this golf course.
The fact is you can't be so conservative that you don't play
aggressively, but at the same time you have to be careful. That's
been my approach to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The field represents, to a great degree, the changing face of
the Senior Tour and with Tom Watson, Tom Kite, and Lanny Wadkins
ready to come on board in the coming months, the landscape will
again be altered. ``I never felt I belonged out here,'' said
Quigley, who is now in his third year on the tour and has won six
times. ``After I won for the first time, it didn't maked me
officially feel I belonged. But I felt I might be headed in the
right direction. I wasn't intimidated anymore.''

DISORDER LEAVES A TRAIL OF SUFFERING, SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sickened by pesticides, weakened by headaches and
panic attacks, Don Paladin has made his bedroom, with its stainless
steel walls and spotless tiled floor, his sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, he is safe from the chemicals that have turned his life
upside down and left him weak, sick, wary and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated because his friends, co-workers and neighbors don't
understand that he suffers from an enigmatic and controversial
disorder called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder is sometimes dismissed as being imagined by a
patient. But sufferers disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't fit into one of the three camps _ cancer,
infection or allergies, what do you have left _ psychological,''
said Paladin, a former Whatcom County elementary school special
education teacher who took a disability retirement in 1996 because
of his poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, or MCS, strikes without warning
and sufferers say it can cause chronic fatigue, aching head and
joints, memory loss, chest pain, upset stomach and burning eyes and
skin. It is said to be an incurable affliction that some doctors
question the very existence of while others have tried to treat,
without much success. There is no definitive cause of the disorder
other than sufferers who complain of poisoning from the surrounding
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely on the fringe for being accepted,'' said Dr.
William Robertson, director of the Washington Poison Center in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   MCS patients claim that everyday household chemicals such as
paint, perfume and cleaning products, as well as road tar, copy
machines and industrial air pollutants, make them sick.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson doesn't deny that chemical odors can induce a
sensation in people, but he questions if they can cause the
symptoms reported with MCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanism (for the symptoms) can be psychology or
physical,'' he said. But there is no evidence of molecular,
physical changes caused by chemical exposure, he added.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation is discouraging for MCS patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that people are treated this way without anyone
taking them seriously,'' Paladin said. ``You wouldn't believe the
devastation of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Buscher works with Paladin and other MCS patients at
the Northwest Center for Environmental Medicine in Bellevue. He
said the medical community has been slow to accept the disorder
because it has only recently been identified and is absent from the
curriculum of most medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a hard time changing,'' he said. But doctors are
``seeing so much of it (MCS), it's hard to deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the federal government finished drafting a report to
define MCS, but widespread criticism has made reaching agreement
over the disorder difficult. The group, with representatives from
eight federal agencies, plans to reconvene this month to review
comments on the draft and decide how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   A separate group of 34 researchers and doctors reached a
consensus defining MCS, published earlier this summer in the
international journal, ``Archives of Environmental Health.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions differ on when descriptions of MCS-like symptoms began
emerging _ some say 40 years ago, others 100. But in the past
decade it has received added attention with the prominence of Gulf
War Syndrome suffered by Persian Gulf War veterans and because of
increased reports of people made ill by so-called sick buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Sufferers of both ailments can exhibit MCS-like symptoms, but
symptoms from the latter appear short lived. The illness caused by
sick buildings is only experienced while inside the building. Poor
air quality, workplace stress and toxic chemicals have been
suggested as causes.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys conducted in the mid-1990s by New Mexico and California
state health departments have found that between 2 percent and 6
percent, respectively, of the general population said they had MCS
and that 16 percent of those surveyed claimed they are unusually
sensitive to everyday chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Studies also find that women are more often afflicted,
comprising 80 percent of sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has not been surveyed for MCS, but Karen McDonell, an
MCS patient living in Gig Harbor, maintains a state list of
sufferers and has collected more than 900 names during the past six
years. She said there are even more people in the state who are not
on her registry, which only contains names of people who've
contacted MCS support groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pesticides seem to be one of the more reactive chemical
cocktails that can drop MCS sufferers in their tracks. In
Washington state, the Department of Agriculture keeps a list of
people who have doctor verification of pesticide sensitivities.
There are 42 residents of King, Pierce and Snohomish counties on
the list and more than 100 residents statewide.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists, doctors and non-profit groups continue to
explore and debate the issue, MCS patients try to find ways of
existing in a world suffused with approximately 40,000 chemicals
blended into more than 2 million mixtures, many of unknown
toxicity, according to the 1998 book ``Neuropsychological
Toxicology.''
</P>
<P>
   Individuals with MCS generally trace the start of their illness
to a massive chemical exposure or repeat exposures.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Morris attributes her severe asthma, and ultimately MCS,
to contact with the pesticide 2,4-D as an infant. Her father used
the herbicide as a weed control for local wheat farmers. When he
came home from the fields the toxic pesticide came with him.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her late 40s, Morris said she is still plagued by
pesticides. Her neighbors on a quiet street in Richmond Beach have
their yards regularly sprayed for bugs and weeds and have ignored
her pleas to stop. She's even offered to pay the difference for
less toxic pest control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't register with them the concerns I have to deal
with,'' Morris said. She blames their continued pesticide use on
their lack of understanding of the chemicals' dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like because it's legal, it's OK,'' she said. ``But
there is so much new information that this is not OK ... and I
don't think anyone should be put at risk in this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, why care so much if you have dandelions or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Morris has traveled out of the Seattle area only three times in
the past six years because of her affliction.
</P>
<P>
   While Morris and Paladin say they are made ill by pesticides,
others argue that the chemicals are perfectly safe when used
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson recommends responsible, discretionary use of
pesticides, suggesting people ``choose their enemies carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   He dispels concerns about pesticide use at low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wrong doses, any chemical can be dangerous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the rates of asthma and some cancers grow,
researchers look at the proliferation of toxic chemicals as
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has
slowly been re-evaluating some pesticides for health risk. On Aug.
2, the EPA banned or restricted use of two pesticides used by apple
growers, in part because of fears that they could cause
neurological damage, particularly in children.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Washington Toxics Coalition sought to
identify pesticide exposure to children in a survey of 33 urban and
rural school districts. They found that 88 percent of the districts
used pesticides on school grounds and only three districts warned
parents before their application.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Loudon, pesticide policy analyst at the Coalition,
said parents and school districts were concerned about the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that children are at a much greater risk for suffering
harmful effects of pesticides,'' she said. They are more likely to
digest or come in contact with the chemicals when they play.
</P>
<P>
   But the causality between the dangers of pesticides and human
health are still unresolved, said Robertson, the director of the
Washington Poison Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of a pesticide doesn't mean it's going to make
anybody sick,'' Robertson countered.
</P>
<P>
   However, Paladin traces his fragile state of health to a
pesticide spray used to kill wasps discovered in his Ferndale
classroom. When he returned the next day, he experienced panic
attacks, blurred vision and a burning in his chest. Paladin changed
schools and recovered from this exposure, but routine pesticide
treatment for ants at his new school eventually made him
debilitatingly ill.
</P>
<P>
   There was another individual with MCS in the Ferndale district _
a 7-year-old boy who also had to leave, opting for home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole slew of us in society who can't function''
because pesticides continue to be used, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Kropack has been luckier than many MCS sufferers. In
1997 she became sick from chemicals used in the remodeling of her
work site, but was able to continue working from home as a water
quality specialist.
</P>
<P>
   At first, her co-workers, including scientists and engineers at
the state Department of Health, were dubious of her claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't even look me in the eye, they couldn't even talk
to me,'' Kropack said. But acceptance of her illness has increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a learning process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This learning process has required people around Kropack to
realize they must use certain deodorants and laundry detergent and
forgo perfumes if they want to be around her. She carries a change
of clothes washed with unscented soap that friends or family can
put on if she reacts to them.
</P>
<P>
   But MCS skeptics caution people against changing their lives and
abandoning pesticides and other chemicals at the behest of MCS
sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lynn Richard, an industrial hygienist and consultant with
the Maryland-based, industry-supported research group Environmental
Sensitivities Research Institute (ESRI), said that without
scientific evidence showing that certain chemicals cause specific
illness, pesticide and chemical use should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a cause-and-effect relationship,'' she said.
``There comes a point at which you need to weigh what is reasonable
for a community and what is reasonable for an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard said a community can start down a slippery slope,
complying with MCS sufferers' demands, from elimination of
pesticides to bans on certain paints and even restrictions on auto
exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point would enough be enough?'' she asked. With the
limited scientific information available for MCS, how could you
even document what was helping people, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ESRI, a non-profit group whose supporters include the Cosmetic,
Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Proctor &AMP; Gamble and
Colgate-Palmolive, provides modest research grants for studies of
chemical sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Sorg, a scientist in Washington State University's
Program in Neuroscience, received a $10,000 grant from ESRI to
support experiments in rats that try to simulate aspects of MCS,
particularly heightened chemical sensitivity, a controversial trait
of the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Sorg repeatedly exposes rats to formaldehyde to try to duplicate
the sensitivity that might be occurring in humans. Once sensitized
to one chemical, the rats, like MCS patients, demonstrate an
increased sensitivity when exposed to other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The research addresses one of the primary arguments against MCS
_ the claim that there is no solid evidence that very low-level
chemical exposures can make people sick.
</P>
<P>
   Sorg has also found that the sensitivity appears to be
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   She is submitting her findings for publication in a scientific
journal and has plans to test rats with other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really in the middle'' she said. If the disorder has not
been thoroughly studied, it can't just be dismissed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until there is an explanation for the diverse symptoms suffered
by the chemically sensitive, whether MCS is one disorder or many,
psychological or physiological in origin, the battle will continue
over the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research is still not definitive enough to prove the
existence of MCS,'' Paladin concedes. People with the disorder are
``caught between the fact that no one really knows what is going
on, but they're sick and people say it's psychological.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not part of your existence, you can't understand.''

 &HT;    CDC warns of dangers of stoves inside tents
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is
using the deaths of six Georgians in camping accidents in March to
highlight the dangers of stoves and grills inside tents.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper released Thursday, the agency discusses, without
using names, the deaths of Robert and Adrian Green, Clarence
Williams and Nicolette Hawkins of Baxley on March 14 and Kenneth
Lang Sr. and Kenneth Lang Jr. of Marietta on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   All six, as well as a dog, were killed by carbon monoxide
poisoning after they pulled cooking devices _ a propane stove in
the first case and a charcoal grill in the second _ inside their
tents to keep warm as they slept. Carbon monoxide, a byproduct of
burning, forms a compound in the body that prevents blood from
carrying oxygen to tissues. All six victims had high levels of the
compound in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   From 878 to 1,513 deaths per year are because of carbon monoxide
poisoning, the CDC said, and about 30 each year happen in tents or
recreational vehicles. The most common scenario is that campers
unprepared for falling temperatures after dark pull the devices
inside and seal doors and zippers, not realizing that they are
trapping poisonous gases in their sleeping space.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational-goods retailers are aware of the danger and
routinely warn customers. ``We never recommend any kind of flame in
a tent at all, not even a stove or lantern,'' said Terrell Boyd, a
salesman at REI in northeast Atlanta. ``A lot of customers like to
use the vestibule of their tents for stoves, but we recommend they
use it only for storage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Langs died during a Cub Scout campout, and the Boy Scouts of
America have been developing additional warnings for their Guide to
Safe Scouting handbook as a result.

<TEXT>
<P>
   IZMIT, Turkey _ Nuri Tekin shuffled to the back entrance of the
city's prized indoor skating rink, looking for his nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, people in green surgical masks walked gingerly, using
flashlights to cut the misty darkness, up and down rows of
horizontal, covered shapes on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Numbly handing over Recet Tekin's identity card to a woman at a
desk by the entranceway, he was told he now could take with him
Number 415 _ just a blanketed bundle on watery, puddly ice _ the
body of his 15-year-old nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified almost all of them,'' said Suna, the city
employee behind the desk, a surgical mask around her neck and a
look of exhaustion in her eyes as she tried to put yellow slips of
paper on all the bodies being brought to this just-completed rink.
</P>
<P>
   Over the clacking of a generator laboring to keep the ice solid
in sweltering heat, Tekin tried to connect the inert figure _ one
of more than 500 bodies inside the rink, one of more than 7,000
people who perished in Turkey's deadliest quake in six decades _
with the boy he had loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died when our building collapsed,'' Tekin managed to say,
``now we have come to bury him.''
</P>
<P>
   Words seem insufficient to describe the changed state of this
seaside city, near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake. Behind Tekin,
dozens of still-dazed people stood at the edge of the rink's
parking lot, many crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't want to go in!'' shouted an elderly man, being
dragged inside by his wife and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandson, we are looking for him,'' sobbed his wife as she
tugged at her husband's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 72 hours after an earthquake leveled thousands of
buildings in an arc stretching from the outskirts of Istanbul
through the industrial heartland of Izmit, the search for survivors
is turning into a collection of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   With official morgues long filled, any place that offers
temperatures cold enough to stop bodies from decaying are being
pressed into service. But with the fear of disease rising, not even
the makeshift morgues or the cemeteries working overtime can cover
the number of bodies being dug out of the rubble. In scores of
devastated areas, the odor of rotting flesh is wafting through the
wreckage. And in one town east of Izmit, Sakarya, authorities have
buried 1,000 bodies in a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Izmit and many communities in northwestern Turkey,
neighborhoods were leveled, electric wires are down, water lines
have been cut, roads cracked and bridges collapsed. The country's
stock market has been shut since the quake, parliament was recessed
and phone lines in areas hit hard are only partly being restored.
</P>
<P>
   To protect against explosions, natural gas lines running through
heavily damaged areas have been turned off. Towns around Izmit's
state-owned oil refinery Tupras were evacuated because of the fires
that broke out in the oil storage tanks after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying planes Thursday dropped special chemicals on the
tanks, which spewed out flames into a sky so black with smoke that
at midday the sun was blocked in this area just outside Izmit city.
But officials said the fires were coming under control, with a
diminishing risk of flames igniting tanks holding liquefied
petroleum gas, which would send poisonous chemicals into the air.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away from blazing refinery, rescue workers and
volunteers continued their frantic search for the living and their
resigned digging for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 36 hours the chances of someone surviving in the rubble
drops by 50 percent and after five days it's more a miracle than
anything else if someone can be brought out alive,'' said Ellinor
Von Kauffungen, from the Swiss Disaster Relief organization.
</P>
<P>
   She was part of a team of some 10 orange-suited Swiss rescue
workers desperately trying to reach two young men buried, but still
alive, under about 20 feet of rubble of what once was a five-story
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   A long hose was dropped into a hole to try and bring water to
the young men, whose weak cries were monitored by rescue workers
pressing their ears against the heavy sheets of concrete that
blocked their access to the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nephew's son Recep was going to go the next day back to the
army and there was a party for him that night when the earthquake
hit,'' said Bayram Bayraktar, standing anxiously at the edge of the
collapsed building.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two days we dug with our own hands to try and reach
people, and we managed to get some 15 people out, but we could not
get to Recep and his friend _ all I could tell them was to stay
calm and maybe help would come,'' said Bayraktar, who lost eight
relatives in the quake.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the hope of life for Bayraktar's nephew and his
friend, many people in Izmit city and the province, where some 1.4
million people live, were looking for the dead. The sign was often
a bulldozer pushing through the rubble, which meant it no longer
mattered if concrete blocks shifted wildly because nobody was left
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Turkish officials, worried about the chance of
dangerous aftershocks, ordered millions of people still in their
buildings to sleep outside. In Istanbul, where some 1,000 people
died in the quake, tens of thousands of terrified residents
streamed into parks to spend the night.

STUDY TIES RISE IN ABORTIONS TO DROP IN CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Aug. 26.)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now comes a scholarly study suggesting that abortion prevents
crime, a report stamped with a big ``Slippery Slope,'' causing both
sides in the abortion debate to run and hide in the same bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Chicago and Stanford
University, trying to understand the reason for a dramatic decline
in crime numbers during the 1990s, found an equally dramatic
increase in abortions in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, they suggested, all those people who might have been
born but weren't could have turned into criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the study could be stood on its head tomorrow by
another study, because that's what studies do to one another. But
for now, the numbers are worth looking at. There was a big drop in
crime 20 years after there were lots of abortions. Those
pregnancies that were terminated in the 1970s would otherwise have
resulted in people who were 18 to 24 years old in the 1990s. Ages
18 to 24 are considered the peak crime years.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested that had these children been born they
would have grown up unloved and unwanted, making them antisocial,
which is probably not fair because there are many well-adjusted
young adults today who were initially a real setback to their
parents. But their research does support the popularly held theory
that children who grow up unloved and resented tend to take out
their hurts on society.
</P>
<P>
   The worse assumption is that the would-be mothers of these
unwanted pregnancies in the 1970s were mostly poor or very young or
women of color. The research surmised that these would-be criminals
would have been the unwanted offspring of teen-agers, minorities
and the poor because they get the majority of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   When you add that assumption, the slippery slope becomes a luge
track.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers knew they were holding a firecracker. They made
their presentation, said they doubted anyone would like it and
explained that they were only giving us the facts. It didn't mean
that they personally believed in abortion or that certain groups
should be encouraged to have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But someone is sure to grab this study, like a sea gull on a
potato chip. And what will they do with it?
</P>
<P>
   It's fine to make a point that a woman's ability to choose is
good for society, but claiming that poor women tend to give birth
to baby criminals is unfair and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the other side, what does this do to the
rights-of-the-unborn debate? Those who oppose abortion contend that
the unborn fetus might have gone on to greatness, but never to
breaking and entering.
</P>
<P>
   This is a creepy study that whispers things like superior race
and selective breeding. There's a ``those people'' hidden in the
interpretation. Hitler types would love it.
</P>
<P>
   Right off, it seems like another way to demonize the poor, the
young and women of color. You don't want them having babies. Their
kids just naturally go bad.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what. The kids of middle-income, wealthy, older white
parents also go bad. Read the news.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to argue than that. In the 1970s, after the
Supreme Court made abortion legal in Roe vs. Wade, lots of women
got abortions. In addition to poor, young women of color were a
large number of white, not-so-poor and not-so-young women getting
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   We know them. They had abortions for the same reasons women had
them before abortion was legal. They had them because their birth
control didn't work, their house was bursting or maybe their
marriage was in trouble. They were not ready because they were
still in school or just starting a job or because they were ill or
because they were raped by their mother's boyfriend or their date.
They were not prepared _ emotionally, financially or
psychologically _ and for the first time in the history of women
who pray to a special saint once a month, they could do something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   They had a safe, compassionate and legal choice. They had
clinics to go to. They had government funding to pay for the
procedure. Some of the rich still went quietly to their own doctors
or into a hospital and got a special diagnosis. But the
legalization of abortion assured all women the choice.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers went up because there was a way to count the numbers
and because more women lived to report their abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s there were many things that more women started
doing, and one of them was thinking for themselves. So a lot of
women had abortions because they could make up their own minds,
even if it meant going against what their parents, boyfriends and
churches wanted them to do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the numbers zoomed. Some of them had husbands, some
did not and some had had sex only once. Some of them were Catholic
and some belonged to churches that would today be considered
stalwarts on the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   All incomes, ages and races filled the clinics, grateful for
places that were warm and caring, and which still are, even though
the staff now wear bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   We may buy the notion that unwanted and unloved children can
grow up to be sad and desperate individuals. But not that one kind
of potential mother is likely to produce bad kids.

KOREA APPEARS TO BE EMERGING FROM YEARS OF SEVERE FAMINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ North Korea appears to be emerging from a
prolonged severe famine with the help of international food aid,
but four terrible years of hunger from 1995 through 1998 may have
cost the country 2 million to 3 million lives, according to
accumulating evidence gathered by a range of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead were old people and children, or urban dwellers
of any age with no way to forage off the land.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, North Korea got nearly 3.5 million metric tons
of donated food from abroad, mostly from China, Japan, South Korea
and the United States. It still needs more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food assistance is essential,'' said Catherine Bertini,
executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, who has just
returned from North Korea. ``It is the only reason why there might
be some stability now in the nutritional lives of many North
Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we saw no food in the country at all,'' she said
in an interview Thursday. ``There wasn't much food growing. There
weren't small animals around. I remember distinctly not ever
hearing a bird sing _ or seeing a bird. I can count on one hand how
many oxen we saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, there were quite a lot of oxen working in the
fields or pulling carts,'' she said. ``There were small herds of
goats. We saw a lot of pigs, dogs and many small animals of all
kinds. There seemed to be a stable food situation now. That does
not mean that it's good. That doesn't mean that there is enough
food in the country. And it doesn't mean that there aren't still
children who are malnourished, because clearly there are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country does not grow enough to feed itself,'' she said.
``The aid is absolutely critical.'' North Korea could use even more
food, she added, since current assistance is based on subsistence
nutritional levels.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bertini said that North Korean officials now acknowledge
that people were dying of starvation in significant numbers,
although the figures they give are much lower than estimates by
international aid experts. North Korea says that 220,000 people
died in the four-year period. Outside the country, estimates range
from 1.5 million to 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Natsios, a former vice president of the relief agency
World Vision and the author of a new study of North Korea for the
U.S. Institute of Peace, a congressionally supported research
organization in Washington, said Wednesday that the North Korean
famine had become ``one of the great famines of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that more than 10 percent of the population
starved to death,'' said Natsios, who served as President George
Bush's emergency aid coordinator in the Horn of Africa during food
crises in Somalia and Ethiopia. He said the North Korean famine was
comparable to the Chinese famine of 1958 and the famine in the
1930s in the Soviet Union. ``I hope and pray,'' he said, ``that
this is the last of the great totalitarian famines whose roots lay
in systemic dysfunction.''
</P>
<P>
   In his report, ``The Politics of Famine in North Korea,''
Natsios said that confidence in the government has been shaken. In
an interview, he added that the country's belligerence could be an
attempt to mask or deflect attention from its weakness and discord.
Other experts see the North Korean missile threat as blackmail
designed to get desperately needed hard currency from industrial
nations in return for concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of isolationist North Korea, based on a bizarre
self-reliant socialism known as juche, lost what shaky props it
still had when the Soviet bloc disintegrated a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Its industries collapsed and its collective agricultural system
was devastated when tools, fertilizer and seeds could no longer be
bought and farmers started hoarding crops for their own use,
sometimes in league with soldiers sent to guard the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Then a series of natural disasters struck. In 1995, North Korea
was driven to ask for international help for the first time. By
then it was to late for many of its 24 million citizens.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another recent study, by the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and
Public Health, found that between 1995 and 1997 infant mortality
rates rose, family size fell and death rates across the board were
at least seven times higher than those recorded by North Korea's
1993 census. The survey, published in the British medical journal
The Lancet in July, was based on interviews with people who had
fled North Korea for China.
</P>
<P>
   Similar surveys based on varying samples have been made by the
Korean Buddhist Sharing Movement, an independent South Korean
organization, and by officials representing aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A former North Korean government ideologue, Hwang Jong Yop, who
defected to the south in 1997, wrote last year in a book, ``North
Korea: Truth Or Lies,'' that a high-ranking agriculture official
told him that 500,000 people had starved to death in 1995, about
50,000 of them party cadres. The government expected another 3
million deaths in the next two years if foreign aid was not sought,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Bertini saw encouraging signs of recovery this
year, North Korea will not be out of danger for a long time, she
and other experts say. Typhoons are threatening crops again, and
China has had a poor harvest in corn, which is traded across the
border unofficially by ethnic Koreans living on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, those who survived, weakened and
malnourished, will find it hard to resist infections. Medicines are
scarce to nonexistent and water supplies contaminated. Without a
functioning economy, North Korea cannot engage in international
trade or find the money to repair public utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The famine, which reached its peak in late 1996 and 1997, led to
acute malnutrition and loss of body mass, known as wasting, in more
than 15 percent of children under age 5 and stunted growth in 66
percent of that age group, according to a survey by the United
Nations, the European Union and Save the Children/U.K. That study
was done almost a year after the peak had passed, and many children
were already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger also forced between 100,000 and 400,000 people to flee
North Korea for China, although it is not known how many may have
returned or been sent back. Official North Korean figures
acknowledged about 200,000 refugees. Whatever the number, the
Chinese were sufficiently concerned to begin detaining North
Koreans and deporting them.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering evidence of a major catastrophe has diminished
disagreements about what actually happened in North Korea, Natsios
said. Some relief officials were at first convinced that the famine
alarm was exaggerated; others argued that it was a government ploy
to get food that would go to troops.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said that much of what was known before experts began
analyzing data from refugees and others leaving the country was
based on what aid workers were able to see on occasional visits to
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these visits do provide some information,'' he said,
``neither field visits nor the data provided by the North Korean
government about the food situation are conclusive evidence of
anything, because they present conditions as the central
authorities wish them to appear to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bertini said last week that North Korea was still barring
foreigners from 49 of its 112 provinces and did not allow aid
agencies to employ Korean-speaking staff members.

MAKE MOVING EASIER FOR KIDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, Aug. 26)  
(mk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three of my friends' families, as well as my own, have moved in
the past year _ taking with them some of the 10 million American
kids who move each year.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the move was across town or out of state, the children
involved had anxieties about leaving their familiar homes and
settling into a new room, street and school.
</P>
<P>
   A strange shared belief among the kids is that their old houses
were bigger, even when in every case the new homes were larger than
the ones left behind. And each has clung to one special friend from
the old neighborhood who is his or her best friend, never to be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   These glorified links to the past are a way of staying loyal. To
relegate a beloved room, yard or playmate to photo albums and
distant memories is a form of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   So a bit of nostalgia is healthy and to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   But if it goes beyond that, to outright depression and not
accepting the new surroundings, the child may need extra help or
counseling to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a move means a loss of control in almost every area
of children's lives. They don't get to vote on leaving, let alone
on their new home and school.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare a child for a move, several books are available.
``The Moving Book: A Kids' Survival Guide,'' by Gabriel Davis
(Little, Brown and Co., 1997, $17) is a good one for a relocating
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Moving Book'' is interactive, and aimed at kids 6 to 12,
though it has activities in which all children can participate.
There are journal pages for kids to fill out, such as ``Why my
family is moving ...'' and ``Where I was when I heard the news
...'' and a pro and con list about the move.
</P>
<P>
   Other writing exercises include filling out comic-strip bubbles
about the move, and a memory book with a page about the old house,
favorite memories, friends, favorite restaurants, good neighbors
and school.
</P>
<P>
   The authors suggest that older students write to their new
schools and request a pen pal in the same grade they're entering.
</P>
<P>
   The guide takes kids through everything from packing their rooms
to having a garage sale, from travel games to play on the drive to
the new house to ways to explore their new surroundings after the
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrate your arrival!'' says Davis. ``Raise a glass of
lemonade in a toast, take turns carrying one another over the
threshold, have a big family hug. Do something _ anything! _ to
mark the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide suggests that children draw a map of the new
neighborhood and make a plan to arrange their new room just the way
they want it. (A tip from my own experience: Paint the room in a
favorite color even before the moving trucks arrive, if possible.
It will be dry and ready for posters, bookshelves and bunk beds.)
</P>
<P>
   The final pages are address sheets and tear-out,
change-of-address postcards to make staying in touch easy.
</P>
<P>
   The days just before the move are extremely hectic, so
before-moving activities should start about a month ahead of time.
It's easy to pretend that the move is still a long way off, but
preparing can make for a smooth transition instead of a bumpy ride.

RESCUE LEADERS STRUGGLE TO BRING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN GORVETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ As search and rescue teams flooded into Istanbul on
their way Friday to quake-devastated zones south and west of the
city, UN crisis coordinators complained of a chaotic start to the
relief operation as emergency teams were snapped up by local
authorities desperate for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 2 1/2 days here, our main problem is we still don't know
what is really going on,'' said Richard Van Hazeprouk of the UN
crisis management team.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,700 foreign experts in search and rescue are now
deployed throughout the disaster area, with more arriving hourly.
However, in Van Hazeprouk's crowded and busy office, the first
battle has been to establish contact and coordinate the many
different groups and nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first teams that arrived here Tuesday went to whichever
Turkish authorities who met them at the airport were shouting the
loudest,'' he said. ``No one took contact numbers, a record of the
equipment the teams had or even a note of where they were going. We
lost them.''
</P>
<P>
   The disorganized start to the rescue operation left residents of
Golcuk, a naval town some 70 miles south of Istanbul, venting their
frustration. An Israeli team was sent straight for the collapsed
naval barracks in the town, under which some 200 people were
buried, including an admiral.
</P>
<P>
   Yet next door, in the town itself, some 50 percent of the
buildings were collapsed or damaged, the respected newspaper
Radikal claiming as many as 15,000 people were still trapped
beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no water, no electricity, no food!'' shouted Golcuk
resident Altin Akbayrak in a makeshift tent hed set up in the town
square.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents in Golcuk, still waiting for assistance Thursday
afternoon, attacked passing cars and buses, jammed with citizens
trying to get back into the city to discover what had happened to
their relatives. Angry locals accused drivers of blocking the roads
to relief vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In several situations where teams had been sent by the
authorities, we decided there was no big problem and then had to
move them,'' said Van Hazeprouk.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the teams out in the field have even had time to
report, Hazeprouk said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the scale of the disaster, both in terms
of casualties and the geographical area covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of places for the teams to go,'' said UN
Ankara office spokesperson Tugrul Kursanlu, and the area is so vast
_ the radius is several hundred miles.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding where to send teams uses straightforward criteria
though: Highest impact, highest casualties, highest destruction,
explains Van Hazeprouk.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have also been angered by the contrast between the
struggle to save lives and the seemingly blase statements of the
country's authorities. Nesut Pektas, the senior Turkish disaster
relief coordinator, said Thursday that in Istanbul the situation is
almost completely normal, and in the next two days the situation
will be under control in the other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the respected columnist for Radikal, Ismet Berkan, said:
``The organization of the authorities is very poor. ... They can't
just give us words in a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in Izmit, the industrial city at the quake's epicenter, as a
rescue team picked more bodies from the ruins, Swiss rescue worker
Ellinor Von Kauffungen was more understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never have enough people in a place like this,'' she said.

 &HT;    Cox lands new headquarters site
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Enterprises Inc. ended months of searching for a
new headquarters site Thursday, purchasing the former Central Park
development site in Sandy Springs. Cox will also retain its
existing headquarters complex on Lake Hearn Drive and is still
considering expansion there as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the new site, on Peachtree-Dunwoody Road, north of Interstate
285, Cox plans a 380,000-square-foot office building and another
50,000-square-feet facility for a fitness center and other
services. The new building will be headquarters for Cox Enterprises
and other Cox-owned businesses, including Manheim Auctions, Cox
Newspapers and Cox Broadcasting. Cox Communications will remain at
the Lake Hearn site. Cox's downtown operations, the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, WSB-TV (Channel 2), WSB Radio Group and Cox
Interactive Group, will not be affected by the company's new
development.
</P>
<P>
   Work will start on the new building in June and is scheduled for
completion in late 2001. The company did not disclose the price of
the land or its development.
</P>
<P>
   The property was acquired from New York insurance giant
Equitable Cos., after the sale to a developer planning a
high-density residential, office and retail project fell through.
That project was opposed by nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   Cox needs additional facilities because of its ongoing growth,
said Tim Hughes, senior vice president of administration. Of the
825 employees based at Cox headquarters, 100 are working in nearby
buildings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the company has been considering two options for
additional facilities. One was an expansion at Lake Hearn, where it
has a 300,000-square-foot building and room for more on its 27
acres. The second was to build a 600,000-square-foot complex on one
of a half dozen proposed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new 29-acre site offers more land for future development
than does Lake Hearn, which faces the uncertainty of potential road
widening and interchange expansion along I-285, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Hearn site ``is in a state of flux,'' Hughes said.
``While not an optimal site for future expansion, it is valuable,''
he said, and could be expanded once road plans for the area are
settled.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Cox obtained a development permit from DeKalb County to
work on site preparation for a 17-story, 300,000-square-foot office
building and parking deck on its Lake Hearn property. That permit
was obtained ``to preserve the value at this facility,'' Hughes
said. That building is still under consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins Properties Inc., was hired as developer for the Cox
facilities. The project will be designed by Duda/Paine Architects
LLP of Durham, N.C., with HKS Inc. of Dallas, Texas, as associate
architect, and Hendrick Associates of Atlanta as interior designer.
</P>
<P>
   An important factor in the site selection was convenience for
employees, Hughes said, noting that most Cox headquarters employees
live north of Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   While both the existing and new locations are near the Perimeter
MARTA station and have shuttle service to it, proximity to the rail
system was not a critical factor in site selection, Hughes said,
because many company employees don't live near transit stations.

BUSH STILL DECLINES TO PUT DRUG-USE ISSUE TO REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
and MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. _ |After weeks of refusing to answer questions
about whether he had ever tried cocaine, George W. Bush invited
continued speculation on Wednesday by declaring he has not used
illegal drugs in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In setting these parameters, Bush seemed to imply he could not
make the same claim for earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush told reporters he could answer ``no'' to a
standard question on federal background forms asking prospective
workers if they have used illegal drugs in the last seven years. He
was asked on Wednesday if he could have given the same answer when
his father was president and federal forms asked about drug use for
the prior 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, let's see here. ... Yes, I could have,'' Bush said after a
pause. ``Over 20 years ago, I did some things that _ when I was
young, I made mistakes. I have learned from the mistakes, and
that's all I intend to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In retreating, however slightly, from his previous refusal to
talk about illegal drugs, the Texas governor clearly hoped to put
to rest the question that has dogged him since his first news
conference as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But despite polls that show the public doesn't want the news
media prying into personal behavior, Bush's equivocal answers are
helping to keep the subject alive. The strategy is reminiscent of
Bill Clinton's word-parsing answers in 1992 to questions about the
military draft and his marital fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's response might be setting a new standard for
delving into the private lives of public figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have done is interesting,'' Earl Black, a professor
of political science at Rice University in Houston, said of Bush's
campaign. ``They have now created the Bush rule, a statute of
limitations on youthful indiscretions that kicks in at the 25-year
mark. That's a standard most Americans would find pretty
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the latest question-and-answer session with
reporters in Roanoke, a heckler confronted Bush on the issue during
his tour of the city's historic farmer's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just answer the question!'' the man shouted as he held up a
sign with the word ``SNORT.'' Bush greeted the critic as if he were
a supporter and calmly told him he had nothing more to say on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   The heckler declined to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 53, backed away from his no-comment stance for the first
time Wednesday when asked whether he would continue the current
practice of asking government officials about drug use in the past
seven years during background checks. The Clinton administration
goes beyond the standard form for White House jobs by asking about
drug use after age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Bush elaborated on Wednesday by saying he could have passed the
background check when his father was president, when the standard
was 15 years. The elder Bush served from 1989 to 1993, meaning his
son would have to have been drug-free from 1974 on to meet the
15-year standard. Under the Bush administration, drug use meant
disqualification. Under Clinton, candidates may still get jobs in
the administration depending on the circumstances of their drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   Informed later that the current White House background check
covers behavior dating to age 18 for White House jobs, Bush
returned to his original response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told the American people all I'm going to tell them,'' he
said. ``I've made mistakes and I've learned from those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Bush is determined to avoid additional comment on the
issue, even though some of his prominent supporters, including
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, have urged him to be more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people really care about what he did 20 years
ago,'' Bush spokesman Mark McKinnon said. ``We have answered the
question we think people care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, one of the early leaders in the effort
to get Christian conservatives involved in politics, defended Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a preacher of the Gospel. The central message we have is
God forgives. And when God forgives, he forgets and so should we,''
Falwell said at a later Bush fund-raiser in Roanoke. ``I know him
very well. There is nothing in his past that I have ever heard
about that would embarrass me.''

DETAINED AMERICAN STUDYING POVERTY IN REMOTE PROVINCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The words that Daja Meston's friends and family use
to describe him _ mild-mannered, private, soft-spoken, and gentle _
hardly paint the picture of a radical intent on fomenting unrest in
China.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese authorities did not view Daja Meston's visit to
rural Qinghai province in remote northwestern China as an innocent
research trip. Early this week, the 29-year-old from Newton, Mass.,
and Gabriel Lafitte, an Australian associated with the University
of Melbourne, were detained near the site of a controversial World
Bank project to alleviate the desperate poverty of the region,
closed to outsiders until recently.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish American by birth whose parents raised him in a Tibetan
Buddhist monastery in Nepal, Meston married a Tibetan exile he met
in Boston nearly a decade ago. The highly unusual background of the
Brandeis University graduate and former monk got him an invitation
to appear on the ``Oprah'' show last year.
</P>
<P>
   His wife calls him an aspiring scholar profoundly connected to
Tibetan culture and spirituality. With his aversion to speeches and
demonstrations _ even photographs _ her husband was anything but a
hot-headed activist, Phuntsok Meston said Thursday from her home in
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shock,'' said Phuntsok Meston, 30, who works in
an art gallery. ``It was publicly stated by the World Bank and
Chinese officials that this was an open area, that anybody is
welcome, so we didn't think anything would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel by foreign journalists and officials outside big cities
in China is generally prohibited without permission and official
escorts, but Chinese officials had pledged two months ago that
diplomats, politicians, journalists, and other ``legitimate''
individuals could freely visit the site of the disputed project.
Nevertheless, the two men were accused of conducting an ``illegal
investigation,'' according to information provided by Chinese
authorities to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Western Poverty Reduction project plans to commit
$160 million of World Bank money to resettle and improve living
conditions for peasants in three Chinese provinces. The Qinghai
portion has come under fire from Tibetan and environmental groups,
who accuse China of flooding Tibetan areas with Han Chinese
migrants and ignoring ecological impacts.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the June 24 vote, China's representative to the
World Bank, Zhu Xian, promised that ``authorities will sincerely
welcome and facilitate site visits by legitimate parties
concerned,'' including non-governmental organizations ``if they are
not politically hostile and not challenging China's sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan rights groups said the two men and others had been
encouraged by China's World Bank representative to enter Qinghai on
tourist visas. The incident also called into question pledges
Beijing made while lobbying for the loan, critics said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are reneging on the spirit of that statement . . .
that's open hypocrisy,'' said Alison Reynolds, director of the Free
Tibet Campaign in London. It also raises concerns about China's
promises to safeguard the rights of Tibetans and Mongols affected
by the resettlement and of local opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test of the entire project,'' said John Ackerly,
president of the International Campaign for Tibet in Washington,
D.C. The loan was approved, he noted, on condition that the Qinghai
component be delayed until ``outsiders were allowed to see
conditions and needs of the local people.''
</P>
<P>
   Meston and Lafitte met last May at a Brandeis University
conference and became close friends. Lafitte visited World Bank
officials and was encouraged to visit the project, Ackerly said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Qinghai earlier this month (8/7), Lafitte
said he doubted China had exhausted options for improving living
conditions without resettling people, and asked: ``Could we just
slow down the project?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics of the project insisted that Lafitte and Meston
were not rabble-rousers, only reseachers fascinated by Tibetan
culture and development.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Clark, senior attorney at the Washington-based Center for
International and Environmental Law, said she was told Tuesday by
China's office at the World Bank that an American and an Australian
had gone to Qinghai alone and ``had made mistakes,'' and now were
facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerly said Qinghai ``was a very, very high profile project,
and everyone has been scrambling to learn more about it. ``Daja . .
. was going to research, not to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Meston was highly sought as a translator for Tibetans visiting
America, Acklerly said. In 1997, US Rep. Frank Wolf, a Virginia
Republican, hired Meston to translate during Wolf's trip to Tibet.
After returning, Wolf condemned China for ``repressing'' Tibetans,
outraging Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Daja Meston worried the Wolf trip might be held
against him, though he worked only as a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Daja Meston completed his degree at Brandeis and was considering
graduate study. He worked part-time at WorldTeach, an nonpolitical
educational program associated with the Harvard Institute for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the Chinese have granted diplomatic access to Meston, and a
consular officer from Beijing would fly to Qinghai Friday to meet
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have urged the Chinese to release the American. We
understand they were preparing an independent study of the impact
of a proposed World Bank project,'' Rubin said.

 &HT;    Berry lovingly gives Dandridge her due
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy Dandridge was the Joe Louis of post-war glamour girls, a
sepia-skinned knockout who proved black was beautiful at a time
when American society insisted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Then after her death in 1965 at age 41, she was all but
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge doppelganger and one-time Atlantan Halle Berry may
change that with her dramatized biography, ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge,'' a lovingly indulgent portrait of the
singer-dancer-actress who helped break Hollywood's color barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Berry delivers what could be her most intoxicating performance.
Granted, she's no Meryl Streep, but Berry's sexy and subtle
portrayal of Dandridge makes it clear that she's more than just the
sum of her finely chiseled cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   Berry gets solid backup from Cynda Williams (``Mo' Better
Blues'') as her envious sister Vivian, Loretta Devine (``Waiting to
Exhale''), pitch perfect as their actress-mother stuck playing
``mammy'' roles, and Klaus Maria Brandauer (``Out of Africa'') is
convincing as legendary director Otto Preminger.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd casting choice that works in spite of itself,
Dandridge's longtime manager Earl Mills is played by Brent Spiner,
best known as the emotionless android Data on TV's ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other celebrities, Dandridge's life followed a familiar arc
of bad luck, bad husbands and bad drugs. Credit Berry and her
capable co-stars for keeping the movie from overdosing on tempting
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the movie relies on trite and ineffective
flashbacks _ from the last night of her life _ to tell her story,
starting with the 1954 Academy Awards. After starring in ``Carmen
Jones,'' an all-black version of the classic Bizet opera, Dandridge
scored one of her many ``first Negro'' accolades when she was
nominated for a best actress award. She lost to Grace Kelly, but
firmly established herself as a leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   While her career seemed to be taking flight, her personal life
was in turmoil: She had divorced Harold Nicholas (Obba Babatunde)
of the dancing Nicholas Brothers, she gave birth to a severely
retarded daughter, and became Preminger's mistress, unaware he was
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you stand on the edge of a cliff and jump off
because you're tired of being scared,'' Berry as Dandridge says in
a one scene. ``Sometimes you jump just to see what it feels like to
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie suggests that part of her descent was the racism that
all ``colored'' entertainers faced, but those injustices seemed to
torment Dandridge more acutely.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie never reaches full boil, it's a well-told
story about a wounded beauty haunted by the knowledge that while
she could perform at the glitziest Las Vegas casinos, she still
couldn't swim in the pool.
</P>

 &HT;    Some Democrats under Bush's campaign spell
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not even Democrats, it seems, are immune to Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's charms and his aggressive drive for campaign
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 75,000 people who have helped Bush ring up more than
$37 million in his presidential campaign are 277 contributors who
gave money to the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996. Some of those
donors also have contributed to Democratic candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though relatively small in number, these donors offer some clues
to Bush's early fund-raising success and the potential he has to
mine support from conservative Democrats and independents. Some of
the contributions also reflect disapproval of Clinton, particularly
over his sexual improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, the contributions show that while it's
still early, Bush's strategy of reaching out to moderate
Republicans without offending the party's conservative base also is
catching the attention of some Democrats and previously disaffected
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yerrid, a third-generation Democrat from Tampa, Fla., is a
trial lawyer, a favorite target of Republican attack and,
seemingly, a sure bet to support a Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But, prodded by Republican friends, Yerrid paid $1,000 to meet
Bush at a June 25 luncheon in Florida. When Bush learned of
Yerrid's profession, the governor said, ``Now when I get up and
mention tort reform, I'm going to see if you turn red and walk
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yerrid recalled, ``Well, sure enough, when he got to that point
in his speech, he stopped and looked right down at me. I didn't get
red, get up or walk out because he gave a great speech and I was
interested in some of the things he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Courting both camps
</P>
<P>
   Like Yerrid, many of these donors haven't made up their minds
about which candidate they will ultimately support for president,
and many are contributing to more than one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Troy LaGrone, a beer distributor in Denton, Texas, called Bush
and Gore ``the best candidates in their fields. I'm not sure where
I'll be if I have to pick between them.''
</P>
<P>
   August Busch III, the chairman of Anheuser-Busch, also has given
to candidates in both parties _ Bush and former Democratic Sen.
Bill Bradley _ a common practice among large contributors who wish
to keep open their lines of communication with both sides. In 1996,
Busch and other top company executives contributed to Clinton and
the campaign of GOP nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Jere Drummond and Ronald M. Dykes, the chief executive officer
and chief financial officer of BellSouth Communications Group, gave
not only to Bush, but also to Gore and Arizona Republican Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Florida businessman H. Wayne Huizenga, who counts among his
holdings the Miami Dolphins, is another prominent Clinton-Gore '96
supporter who is backing Bush this year.
</P>
<P>
   Personal preference
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's Democratic donors said they gave $1,000 simply to
hear what the candidate had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not committed to anything at this stage,'' said Ronald
Norby, a construction executive in Greeley, Colo. ``You've got to
find out what the platforms are, who the running mates are going to
be. There is a lot left to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Wyatt, a rancher from Hollister, Okla., who supported
Clinton in 1992 and 1996, said he thinks Bush will be a stronger
candidate than Gore on maintaining commodity price supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is a little bit more of a friend of agriculture
than the vice president,'' said Wyatt, whose 5,000-acre farm
straddles the Texas border. Gore is ``going to have to swing pretty
hard on the agriculture line to get my support.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gwen Cupp of Hot Springs, Ark., Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky meant the end of her support for the president and his
fellow Democrats. ``The bottom line is we are just disappointed,''
said Cupp, whose husband also has abandoned the Democrats for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, Bush has lured back to the Republican fold
those who left the party in 1996 and voted for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Snyder, a corporate attorney from Atlanta, was an avid
backer of former President George Bush when he lost against Clinton
in 1992. But Snyder said he thought Clinton did well in his first
term, and he became disenchanted when he perceived that Dole, the
former senator from Kansas, cozied up to the religious right in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush represents traditional Republican fiscal
conservatism without the Republican social agenda,'' Snyder said.
``I voted for George Bush in 1992, and I'm one of those that thinks
he's getting another George Bush like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another category of contributors talked about the perils
of having politically active friends, particularly in a period of
intense pressure to raise more and more money.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McInerney, president of Star Lincoln-Mercury in
Southfield, Mich., said he got a call from a Republican friend who
said, ``I've got a table (at a fund-raiser) to sell, do me a
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   McInerney obliged. ``It was just, `I'll buy myself out of this
mess,''' said McInerney, a longtime Democrat who is still eyeing
Bradley and Gore.

CORRECTS TITLE OF MOVIE  
 `TEACHING MRS. TINGLE' HAS A BRAVURA PERFORMANCE BY HELEN MIRREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the fact it deals with a trio of oppressed students who
resort to violence against an unfair teacher, the release of the
high-school black comedy, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' in
post-Columbine 1999 makes for some lousy timing.
</P>
<P>
   Up until a few months ago, it was called ``Killing Mrs.
Tingle,'' and even the week before its release, the producers were
still dickering with the ending, and touching up the ad campaign to
make the actors look more wholesome. Clearly, the studio is scared
to death of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to fear. It's forgettable but somehow totally
innocuous, with a few mild chuckles, a bravura performance from
Helen Mirren, and able support from a trio of young stars who are
more attractive and engaging than the teen movie norm.
</P>
<P>
   The title character (Mirren) is a domineering, small-town high
school teacher who holds some unknown resentment against young
people everywhere, and likes nothing more than publicly humiliating
her students _ stripping them of every vestige of their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And when the sweet young heroine, Leigh Ann (Katie Holmes) _ who
is dirt poor and desperate for a college scholarship _ invests six
months making a senior project so spectacular it could win the
Nobel Prize, Mrs. Tingle positively delights in trashing it with a
C grade.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but this teacher-from-hell conspires to have
Leigh Ann kicked out of school for cheating on a final exam, even
though she knows full well the kid is perfectly innocent. This is
not just a mean teacher, but a pathological nut case.
</P>
<P>
   So, through a series of fumbling incidents, Leigh Ann and two
friends (Marisa Coughlin and Barry Watson) take Mrs. Tingle
prisoner, tie her to her bed, take pornographic pictures of her,
threaten her with blackmail and otherwise try to to talk her into a
deal _ which, of course, she rejects.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the movie. As written and directed by Kevin
Williamson (the writer of ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer''), it's played mostly for laughs _ with a heavy infusion of
teenage romance _ and it's never quite as mean-spirited as my
synopsis makes it sound.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the best thing on the screen is Mirren. She's
an authentic star, and one who has become ever more charismatic and
appealing as she's aged in the movies of the past 25 years. This is
the meatiest role she's had in ages, and she makes the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   But she's almost too much actress for the part. As played here,
Mrs. Tingle is so confident, so cunningly resourceful and so
physically attractive that its impossible to believe her as a
small-minded shrew in a dead-end job. This woman should be running
General Motors, or, at the very least, a movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching Mrs. Tingle. Directed and written by Kevin Williamson.
Produced by Cathy Konrad. Cast: Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Marisa
Coughlan, Barry Watson. Dimension Films. 93 minutes. Rated PG-13
for sex scenes and some violence.

 &HT;    Seven accused of smuggling Chinese
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Authorities charged seven people Thursday in the
smuggling of 132 Chinese nationals found hidden on a ship in
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the ship's crew, including the captain, and
three passengers face three charges each that carry a maximum
penalty of 30 years in prison and a $750,000 fine. They appeared
briefly before a federal magistrate Thursday afternooon in
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from the discovery Aug. 12 of 132 illegal
immigrants aboard the Prince Nicolas, a ship registered in Cyprus
that was hauling pig iron. Agents found the passengers in cramped
rooms that shot off different sides of a ladder descending into the
bowels of the ship. They said the entrance was bolted closed and
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Donnie Dixon of the Southern District of Georgia,
which covers 43 counties, declined to say whether investigators
will make more arrests. He said they have not finished their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime the laws are being violated in such an organized and
calculated way, I think we are obligated to take it seriously,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Drake, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said the
seven defendants were charged with transporting, smuggling and
concealing illegal aliens. He identified the crew members as Zhang
Zhi Zhong, 33, the captain; Huang Shi Jian, 27, the second officer;
Shi Ya Dong, 57, the chief engineer; and Sun Cheng, 35, a cabin
boy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the passengers charged are Zheng Xiao, 33; Li Guo Guan,
whose age was unavailable; and Zheng Huan Jian, 24, who is not
related to the second officer. Drake would not say why the three
passengers were charged.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said he might ask a grand jury for indictments next month.
Most of the 132 Chinese remain in jails in DeKalb and Fulton
counties. Many have asked for asylum. It may take years for the
government to resolve those requests.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to smuggle Chinese nationals have been uncovered in the
last two years in California, Guam, New Jersey, Washington state
and along the western coast of Canada. Investigators said the
Prince Nicolas case is the most sophisticated immigrant smuggling
operation in recent Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese immigrants pay $30,000 to $50,000 to weather poor
conditions on trips here because they believe they will make lots
of money, said Lani Wong of Atlanta, the former national chairwoman
of the National Association of Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Many end up with low-paying jobs in garment factories or
restaurants in New York and other cities with established Chinese
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to the village and tell them what opportunities they
have in the U.S.'' she said. ``They don't know that they'll
probably end up working in a sweatshop.

BELGRADE DEMONSTRATORS REPRESENT MANY BACKGROUNDS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also YUGOSLAVIA-POLITICS) 
(rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ They were mostly the educated urban elite
who turned out to demonstrate in central Belgrade: students, young
professionals and their parents, who looked as if they were walking
in the park after work.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also ordinary workers and activists who had driven
in from different parts of the country. They brought with them
flags and banners, even fireworks. They had rough hands and were
sunburnt, and brought a more down-to-earth attitude and blunter
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   And under the festive mood, the message from all was the same:
The demonstrators were opposed not only to the government; many
were irritated with the opposition leaders. Virtually everyone
interviewed said that they wanted to see a united opposition, and
that leaders should bury their differences and their egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not interested in any party and we are angry with the
leaders of the opposition parties,'' said Dejan Zhivkovic, a
retired lawyer who came with his wife. His two sons were also
somewhere in the crowd, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not understand the main wish of the people is that
they unite their forces to bring about big changes,'' he said of
the opposition politicians. ``We are convinced the leaders should
change and new young and uncompromised people should come. We are
not here because someone called us, we are here because we are
unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   People were infuriated by the on-and-off performance of some of
the participants. Two brothers in their sixties, Radojica and
Dobrosav Dmitric, a construction worker and a truck driver, had
driven 60 miles from their town, Gornji Milanovac, which is also
the home town of the former Army chief of staff, Gen. Momcilo
Perisic.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic, who has recently entered politics in opposition to
President Slobodan Milosevic, announced a few days ago that he
would not attend the rally. The Dmitric brothers gave a hurt smile
at the mention of his name, and expressed their unhappiness that he
was not here.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd showed less tolerance for Vuk Draskovic, the leader of
the Serbian Renewal Party, booing and whistling during his speech
and as he left through the crowd. They said he had betrayed them by
joining the Milosevic camp, even for only a short time, when he
voted for war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rebeka Srbinovic of the New Democratic Party, which took part in
previous governments, was also drowned out by booing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sign that people are growing mature politically,''
said Petar Milosavljevic, 57, as Draskovic swept past, flanked by
bodyguards and hectoring bystanders. ``They are recognizing who is
working in their interest. It is some kind of political sobering
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people mentioned the war in Kosovo, although one group
carried a banner showing they were from Kosovo. The reasons most
people gave for being there were economic.
</P>
<P>
   Mirna Obrenovic, 38, a travel agent, said her business had
shrunk to 20 percent of its level 10 years ago. A retired
architect, Karin Milutinovic, said she had only just received her
April pension on Wednesday, and last year only got six months'
worth of payments. ``It is not so important though, but that we
feel so helpless,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Srboljub Puresevic, a construction engineer from a town south of
Belgrade, came in his car with three men from work. Other
co-workers feel the same, he said, but did not dare to come. ``I
used to have a salary that was worth 1,000 Deutsche marks, now it
is worth 100,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Branka Apic-Krcedinac, a member of an organization for diabetes
sufferers, came with colleagues and friends in a convoy of 48 buses
from Novi Sad, in northern Yugoslavia. Holding up a home-made
banner, she said diabetes patients lacked insulin and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to think elections could change anything because
the ruling parties would control the results. Most people said
Milosevic would have to go first, whether forced or of his own
will. It would take vast demonstrations, one student said, ``that's
the only way.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloomy statements, the crowd laughed and cheered,
whistled and cracked jokes. As the demonstration broke up after two
hours, people said they thought it was a success. ``It was
successful for the early stages because our politicians are just
getting started again after a long pause,'' said Nikola Markovic,
who attended with his wife. ``It would be an illusion to expect
something really big to happen. But it is like an announcement of
future developments to make people think.''

STAY HEALTHIER, LIVE LONGER, STUDY CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Living proof of a new study's conclusion that centenarians live
longer than most people because they've been healthier,
104-year-old Dirk J. Struik said he continues to live independently
and is rarely in the hospital, except on a doctor's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, however, he said he holds no special secret to
a long life.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Struik, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology mathematics professor emeritus, has been a part of the
New England Centenarian Study, a project of Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest report from the project, in the current journal
Lancet, the researchers say they found that of the 37 centenarians
from eight towns in the Boston area who have participated in the
long-term study, 89 percent were living independently when they
were about 92 years old, and 35 percent were still doing so at
about 102.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study speaks against this adage that the older you get,
the sicker you get,'' said Dr. Thomas Perls, director of the
centenarian study and a geriatrician at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. Perls is coauthor of a book entitled ``Living to
100,'' published this year by Basic Books.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel Hitt, coauthor with Perls on the study agreed: ``They
are living the vast majority of their lives in excellent health.
These people aren't very, very sick for 10 or 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that most of the study participants
had avoided such illnesses as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. ``Had
they not done so,'' the researchers wrote in the Lancet, ``it is
unlikely they could survive to the practical limits of the human
life span.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier findings from the long-term study have identified a
sense of humor, a resilient personality and a history of family
members living a long life as being crucial components of living
for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Struik might as well be living proof of another new study's
conclusion in the current British Medical Journal, that elderly
people who stay active are likely to live longer than those who do
not.
</P>
<P>
   Although Struik was not part of the study led by Thomas A.
Glass, Harvard School of Public Health assistant professor, he
exhibits many of the qualities identified there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep up with my profession,'' Struik said in an interview.
He reads mathematical journals, although he said he leaves the
solving of today's mathematical problems to younger people, and he
added that he also reads the newspapers every day.
</P>
<P>
   In this second study, Glass and his colleagues followed more
than 5,500 people in New Haven, Conn., and found that those who
engaged in such social and productive activities as playing cards,
preparing meals or doing community work were likely to live longer
than those who didn't. Surprisingly, such social and productive
activities were found to be just as important as physical
activities in prolonging life.
</P>
<P>
   ``More active elderly people were less likely to die than those
who were less active,'' write the researchers in the British
Medical Journal. ``Social and productive activities were observed
to confer equivalent survival advantages compared with fitness
activities. This observation is important because it suggests that
activities that entail little or no physical exertion may also be
beneficial.''

COALITION OF TOWNS SEEKS TO BLOCK SCHOOL TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Taking aim at a controversial school funding
plan cobbled together by lawmakers earlier this year, a coalition
of five poor towns Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to
declare the plan unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, the so-called Claremont Coalition of
property-poor towns sued New Hampshire, saying that its new school
funding system has been implemented too slowly, and is
fundamentally flawed. At issue is whether the state provides an
adequate education to students in less-affluent districts and
whether the system taxes all property owners equally to pay for
public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of our districts provide a constitutional
inadequate education,'' said Andru Volinsky, lead lawyer for the
coalition. ``We don't think it is constitutional to force those
children to participate in that kind of a limited education program
and we don't think it's constitutional to make them wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Motions filed by lawyers for the coalition ask the court to
among other things, force the state to begin immediate payments for
``compensatory services'' in 11 schools where fewer than 40 percent
of all students scored at a level of ``Basic'' or above on
standardized assessment tests.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also asks the court to begin imposing sanctions on the
state in the form of legal fees and costs as a result of its
continuing failure to meet an April 1, 1999 court-imposed deadline
to craft an equitable system of funding the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The state has struggled with the school funding issue since
1971. In 1997 the court declared unconstitutional the system of
funding public schools almost entirely through local property taxes
that varied wildly between rich and poor cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   In response, during the most acrimonious legislative session in
the memory of veteran lawmakers, the 424-member House and 24-member
Senate passed separate versions of what would have been the state's
first general income tax. Faced with repeated threats of a veto by
Governor Jeanne Shaheen, however, the income tax effort died. So
did proposals to pay for schools by permitting gambling via video
slot machines, a capital gains tax bill and a proposed tax on
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the governor and legislature settled on an education
funding bill that required the state to begin paying some $825
million in school costs on July 1. The bill enacted a statewide
property tax that caused an uproar in property-rich communities and
raised the tax on cigarettes and the transfer of real estate yet
still left an estimated $100 million hole in the school funding
plan which has yet to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement seemed to please no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We predicted this would be in litigation and today that
prediction came true,'' House Speaker Donna Sytek said. ``The
question is how long they are going to be in litigation _
potentially forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen said the state's plan is working and constitutional.
``We have fundamentally changed the way we support education in New
Hampshire. . .and I am confident the Supreme Court will recognize
that,'' Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   If the court were to require the state to spend even more than
$825 million on education it would resurrect both the campaign to
pass an income tax and the drive to pass a constitutional amendment
to override the court's ruling. As is, no consensus exists on how
to fill the existing $100 million gap.
</P>
<P>
   No schedule has been set for when lawmakers will reconvene. When
they do, the next battle is likely to be over the imposition of a
capital gains tax, a move that has Shaheen's backing, but one that
will face strong opposition in the Republican-controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just isn't the willingness in the Legislature to raise
more money, at least there wasn't when we left in June,'' said Fred
King, a state senator who Thursday announced a $775 million interim
plan he hopes will earn the Legislature two more years to find a
solution if the impasse isn't resolved.
</P>
<P>
   King predicted that the historically frugal state would find
itself between $1 billion and $2.3 billion in debt by 2005 as a
result of the school funding decision unless legislators either cut
spending or raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects serious financial problems to arise until
sometime next year. A quick court ruling could change that,
however, forcing legislators back into a session that promises to
be even more fractious that the last one.

 &HT;    Ratajczak: Housing boom over
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite a sharp drop in mortgage rates in metro
Atlanta this week, Georgia State University economist Donald
Ratajczak says the trend is upward.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the 30-year, fixed-rate loan averaged 7.55 percent,
down from 7.84 percent last week, according to a weekly survey by
BankRate.com.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage closed at 7.16 percent, against
7.44 percent last week. The one-year, adjustable-rate loan was
relatively flat, ending the week at 5.97 percent, down from 6.01
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All the rates include discount points, or fees charged by
lenders at closing.
</P>
<P>
   Rising mortgage rates, perhaps to the 8.5 percent level, will
bring a housing market slowdown and an end to double-digit home
price appreciation within two years, Ratajczak said in his
summer-quarter forecast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``An 8 percent mortgage rate is recessionary, and rates will
exceed 8.5 percent next year. When they hit 9 percent, that is the
real barrier. People will ... stop buying,'' said Ratajczak.
Double-digit interest rates, should they appear, ``would be a real
problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1998, when rates in metro Atlanta hit a 6.21
percent low, they have been steadily rising. ``What has happened is
that the market has moved up aggressively in the last 60 days. But
economic data suggest that inflation is not moving up now, so rates
have come back down,'' said Patrick Flood, president of HomeBanc.
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak agreed but downplayed the weekly variations: ``Next
week, they will probably be higher again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a 7 percent interest rate makes it harder for entry-level
buyers to afford home mortgages. But, Ratajczak declared, 8 percent
would affect adversely many move-up buyers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Single-family housing starts would fall 15 percent by 2001,
Ratajczak said, if rates hit the middle-8-percent range.

GROWCOST (Phoenix) - We hear about the economic benefits of growth
_ a bigger tax base, new jobs, new businesses _ but what are the
costs of growth to a city or county or school district? Let's look
at the cost based on a single family home in a new neighborhood.
What demands do they make of the city and local schools? A new
family in a new subdivison means more people on the road, which
means more roads are needed, as are more police, firefighters,
garbage trucks, water, sewer lines, schools, stores _ it's a domino
effect. On the flip side, most planners say single family housing
does not pay for itself, which means money for all the needed
services has to come from somewhere else. How does it all fit
together? By SHAUN MCKINNON. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COFFEE (Phoenix) - It may be the most coveted herb in the world.
And the most controversial. The truth is that coffee is a complex
liquid, and how it affects our health is still being looked into.
However, based on the most recent round of studies, it appears that
drinking moderate amounts of coffee _ two to three cups a day _
does little harm and may actually provide health benefits. By
THOMAS ROPP. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - I've heard urban legends in which people
buy a computer, take it out of the box, plug it in and it actually
works. Things like that just do not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not to me. That's not the way things work in my
world. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL;

GOODY-TV (Undated) _ Introducing Dorothy Dandridge is a
worthy-but-flawed HBO original movie that does just that _
introduces us to the first black woman ever nominated for a Best
Actress Oscar. It would have been far more satisfying to get to
know her better. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL;

MARTINEZ ARRIVES ON TIME, SOUNDS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- At 4:05 p.m., all seemed well inside the Red Sox
clubhouse. Pedro Martinez leisurely strolled by a group of
reporters, went straight to his locker, and began to prepare for
his start against the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   One minute later, all hell broke loose, triggered by the arrival
of Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who took the brunt of a
Martinez tirade that centered around manager Jimy Williams and his
decision to scratch Martinez from last Saturday's start against
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was angry not only at Williams, but also the media
horde that was waiting to see if he arrived within two hours of
game time, a team rule. Martinez took particular offense to the
newspaper and television cameras that awaited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to come over?'' said Martinez in a voice loud
enough to be heard by the reporters. ``Is (Williams) going to
apologize? Is he going to shake my hand? Or is he going to blow me
(off).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people following me around. I don't like the
cameras. I'm tired of these clowns following me around.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had more to say but because of the nature of the
conversation reporters were asked to leave the clubhouse by Kevin
Shea, the team's director of communications and baseball
information, who declared, ``This is a private conversation and the
locker room is now closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had arrived Saturday less than 35 minutes prior to game
time. Thursday, his car pulled into the players' lot at 3:50 and he
chose to sit in his White Mercedes, talking on a cell phone, rather
than enter the park immediately. Whether the 4:05 entrance, exactly
two hours prior to game time, was deliberate, has yet to be
determined. You didn't learn from much his remarks to Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned,'' said Duquette, ``Pedro is ready
to go out and pitch. He was still venting from the attention that
he's gotten from his last start. But he'll be ready to pitch
tonight. From Jimy's perspective, the situation is resolved. As for
the rest, it's really a position that Pedro should talk to the
manager about.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he did not go to the clubhouse to act as a
peacemaker between Martinez and the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even go there,'' said Duquette. ``If you're trying to
position me between the player and the manager, you're wrong. I'm
not between the two. Did I resolve anything? I don't have any
issues to resolve with (Martinez). As far as we're concerned, the
item last week is resolved. That's gone by. The rest of it is
difficult for me to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams took the same stance before and after batting practice.
Asked if he'd spoken with Martinez, Williams said any conversation
they have is private.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's said in the clubhouse should stay in the clubhouse,''
he said. ``You might not agree, but that's the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would handle what seems to be a growing problem,
Williams said, ``I have no problems, just challenges.''

BONN, THE EX-WORLD CAPITAL, HAS ITS EYE ON A VIRTUAL FUTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ ``We are going to start by demolishing the
British Embassy,'' said Ulrich Lissek, pointing to a squat building
opposite his office. ``Then we're going to take over the
headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party over there. And that
will be just the start of our radical project.''
</P>
<P>
   Lissek may sound like a holdover from some 1960s revolutionary
movement, but he is in fact the chief spokesman for Deutsche
Telekom, the now privatized German telecommunications company that
is in the vanguard of an unlikely plan to transform Bonn's culture
from bureaucratic stodginess to Silicon-Valley sprightliness.
</P>
<P>
   As the German government departs for Berlin this month after a
50-year sojourn on the Rhine, ``Boomtown Bonn'' sounds like an
unlikely slogan. But it is the one making the rounds here as
Telekom and its various subsidiaries buy up great swaths of real
estate, computer company start-ups multiply, and an Internet
banking group thrives.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to all predictions on ``Black Thursday'' _ the day in
June 1991 when Parliament voted to move the German capital back to
Berlin _ Bonn is prospering. Unemployment in the region is 7
percent, far lower than the 16 percent in Berlin, real estate
prices are rising, and only 1.5 percent of office space is vacant,
compared with more than 10 percent in the new capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period of angst is over,'' said Barbel Dieckmann, the
mayor. ``We were a successful capital and we would have liked to
remain the capital, but now we feel Berlin has many reasons to envy
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonn, a city of 330,000 people, is still a genteel place where
the whiff of capitalist enterprise is scarcely overwhelming. But
the city's attempted makeover appears genuine and has wide
implications for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The country is trying to make a painful shift from a highly
regulated society where the state accounts for close to 50 percent
of economic activity to a nimbler, more entrepreneurial system
better able to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bonn's ability to shift from ponderous, state-heavy
predictability to a place on Germany's telecommunications and
information-technology frontier may provide a measure of how far a
culture that is still generally risk-averse may be altered.
</P>
<P>
   With over four million Germans jobless, over 10 percent of the
workforce, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder believes it's time for a
Germany burdened by a graying population and soaring youth
unemployment to rethink itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough of the nanny state,'' Economics Minister Werner Mueller
said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lissek of Telekom agrees. ``We want to engineer a vast shift
from the functionary's culture, which does not prize the client, to
being the most customer-friendly company in the world,'' he said.
``There is a culture of envy here that makes wealth somehow
shameful. We want to make wealth respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   These aims are evident in the vast modern atrium of Telekom's
new Bonn headquarters, where the price of the company's stock in
Frankfurt, New York and Tokyo flashes on one side and an ``Online
Screen'' offers travel and shopping services on the other. For what
was until 1993 a staid state-owned corporation, this is a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road, on land where the British Embassy now stands,
Telekom is planning a $550 million building for about 5,000
employees. Its mobile-phone unit has bought up an old cement
factory on the banks of the Rhine and is planning another huge
development there.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the giant, hundreds of small Bonn computer
companies are springing up, full of Germans talking a remarkably
glib line in ``interfacing,'' ``stock options,'' ``the TeleBonn
concept'' and ``Silicon Valley type models.'' A new Bonn-based
online banking service, Bank 24, hired over 1,000 people last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a three-piece suit, Stefan Huthmacher, the chief
executive of a software and consultant company called Comma Soft,
scarcely looks like a denizen of Palo Alto. But as he shows a
visitor the ``Japanese meditation room,'' complete with screens and
prints, where employees are encouraged to seek inspiration, he
explains that the West Coast has been a model to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to develop the garage start-up mentality among
students in Germany,'' he said. ``One of our problems is that we
persisted too long with classical heavy industries, and did not
adapt our education system fast enough to new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, Huthmacher, a 44-year-old former
university physicist, said that his company had possible openings
for 100 people, but cannot find qualified people to fill the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem to find people,'' he said, ``because
German universities still fail to teach the right disciplines. We
sell knowledge. In an industrial area like the Ruhr, that is still
a hard concept to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The company, which develops networking systems for large
companies or public entities based on Microsoft software, has 125
employees and is planning to go public soon. It recently applied
for permission to put up a building _ a process that can take years
in Germany _ and saw in the city administration's acceptance within
weeks a sign that Bonn is really changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to re-educate our population to look forward,''
said Michael Swoboda, the president of the Bonn Chamber of
Commerce. ``We believe at least 250,000 jobs will be created in
telecommunications and information technology in Germany in the
next five years, and we plan to get a big chunk of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Riek, 25, has created 16 jobs in two years at his
start-up company ID-PRO, a software consultant firm. A former
student of Bonn University, he illustrates the crossover from
university to technology and business that the city now hopes to
nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Of about $1.5 billion that Bonn received as compensation for the
move of the capital to Berlin, the largest part has been spent on a
new science and telecommunications research center called Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany's problems are simple,'' Riek said. ``We suffer from
what I call a `digital gap,' and we don't understand service.
Teachers in general know little about computing, and
business-client relationships are about confrontation rather than
cooperation. My hope is that Bonn can offer some new models.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dieckmann, the mayor, said she was confident of the city's
success. But in good German fashion Bonn is also hedging its bets.
Various U.N. agencies have been lured to the town. Six ministries
are remaining. One or two federal authorities _ including the
Anti-Trust Commission _ are moving from Berlin to Bonn to provide a
counterweight to the departure of over 15,000 civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even hope some spies will remain,'' she said. ``After all,
we are going to be a telecommunications capital, and I've been told
that industrial espionage is very much the wave of the future.''

   POLICE (Seattle) _ An independent panel found the Seattle Police
Department kept shoddy records when investigating itself, were
restrained from having face-to-face interviews and failed to even
take complaints, leading the panel to suggest major reforms to the
way the department police itself. But the report emphasized no
widespread corruption in the department. The four-member panel,
appointed by Mayor Paul Schell, recommended the creation of a new
Office of Public Accountability that would be headed by a civilian

   FILM-ILLUMINATA (Undated) _ John Turturro is a reliable and

his autobiographical first film, ``Mac,'' which won the Camera d'Or
at Cannes that year. But with his second directorial effort,
`Illuminata,'' he's been hit by the sophomore curse, big time. The

FBI ELEVATES FUGITIVE MOBSTER TO `TOP TEN' LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Legendary South Boston crime boss James J. ``Whitey''
Bulger became Thursday the 458th fugitive to make the FBI's Ten
Most Wanted list, but he may well be the first former FBI informant
to rate such a billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you we are out to catch him,'' said Barry
Mawn, special-agent-in-charge of the FBI's Boston office, hoping to
dispel public perception that the FBI isn't eager to nab Bulger, a
longtime informant who corrupted at least one agent with payoffs
and skipped town on the eve of his Jan. 1995 federal racketeering
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn said he didn't know whether Bulger, whose 70th birthday is
Sept. 3, is the first FBI informant to be placed on the agency's
top 10 list since its inception in 1950, but that he ``probably
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The last confirmed sighting of Bulger was in Oct. 1998 at a
convenience store in Sloan, Iowa, according to authorities. Earlier
he was spotted in New York, Louisiana, Wyoming, Mississippi,
Florida, and even in his hometown of South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn speculated that Bulger is hiding in the Southeastern United
States with his girlfriend, Catherine Greig, 48, who may well have
dyed her blonde hair to change her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the kinds of looks that make it easy for him to blend
in,'' Mawn said of Bulger, a balding, blue-eyed, silver-haired man
who often wears a cap and glasses. ``There's nothing distinctive
that makes him stand out. It enhances his ability to be a fugitive.
If they're in the Southeast, every other person could look like
Whitey Bulger and Cathy Greig.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed numerous false Bulger sightings have been reported to the
FBI's Violent Fugitive Task Force, comprised of investigators from
the FBI, Boston Police, the Department of Correction and the state
Parole Board. Three investigators are currently assigned full-time
to the Bulger case.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn said authorities are convinced that it will take national
publicity -- the kind that being on the Top Ten brings -- to nab
Bulger. His photograph will appear in post offices and federal
buildings throughout the country and on the FBI's Internet web
site, www.FBI.gov. It will be circulated to law enforcement
agencies throughout the country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger will remain on the Top Ten list until he's caught. Of the
458 fugitives who have appeared on the list, 429 have been
captured, including 134 with the help of tips from the public,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting him on the Top Ten list certainly doesn't guarantee he
will be caught, but we believe it will help a lot,'' said US
Attorney Donald K. Stern, whose office indicted Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   In Bulger's absence, his longtime partner and co-defendant,
Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi revealed that he and Bulger were
longtime informants and claimed that the FBI allowed them to commit
crimes as long as they provided information about the criminal
activities of Mafia members.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Mark L. Wolf, who presided over lengthy
hearings exposing a corrupt and cozy relationship between Bulger
and Flemmi and the FBI, is expected to rule soon on a request to
dismiss the racketeering indictment against Bulger, Flemmi, and
three other men.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed Thursday by reporters about why the FBI has taken
so long to give Bulger top 10 status, Mawn said the fugitive
investigation has evolved from a covert search to a very public
one.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, the FBI announced that it was offering a $250,000
reward for Bulger's capture. Nine months ago, the Boston FBI office
began petitioning to elevate Bulger -- who has sporadically
appeared among 27 fugitives on the FBI's Web site -- to the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month when FBI Director Louis Freeh held a press
conference in Boston, he was grilled about why Bulger wasn't in the
top 10. He said Bulger was being considered.
</P>
<P>
   In his top 10 status, Bulger joins the likes of Saudi terrorism
suspect Osama bin Laden and Eric Robert Rudolph, who is a suspect
in abortion clinic bombings.

SIZING UP PLASTICIZERS: SOME BLAME BIRTH DEFECTS ON COMPOUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: N.C., Pa. and Tenn.) 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Scientists are trying to reach a consensus on
whether compounds used to make numerous plastic products are
somehow causing birth defects or lowering sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in reproductive health met this week to evaluate the
health risks of seven chemicals widely used to make plastic more
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear these chemicals, leaching from intravenous bags or
squeeze toys, could be contributing to fertility problems, which
plague an estimated 5 to 10 percent of couples, as well as major
birth defects, which affect 3 percent to 5 percent of newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials argue vinyl products have been used safely
for more than four decades. And, they warn about the dangers of
substituting these materials with substances that have been studied
far less closely.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member panel, convened by the National Toxicology
Program, however, failed to reach agreement on the risks.
</P>
<P>
   The experts were not so much divided in their opinions. Instead,
they said, they just did not have enough time during their 2
1/2-day conference to fully evaluate the volumes of research on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not contentious discussions,'' said Dr. Lynn
Goldman, a pediatrician and senior science adviser to the National
Toxicology Program.
</P>
<P>
   The panel members refused to say how they are leaning in their
evaluations. The experts hope to reconvene before the end of the
year to finish their work, although no further meetings have been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Though the panel has no authority to change government
regulations affecting plastic products, its recommendations likely
would have great influence with federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product
Safety Commission are conducting their own investigations into
these compounds, known as phthalate esters.
</P>
<P>
   Similar in appearance to vegetable oil, these phthalates, or
``plasticizers'' as they're known in the industry, are added to
polyvinyl chloride to make the hard plastic more elastic.
</P>
<P>
   Untreated vinyl is used to make household water pipes and home
siding. By adding these phthalate esters, manufacturers can produce
a myriad of more flexible products, from shower curtains to medical
tubing, rain coats to tile flooring.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's petrochemical companies produced about 1.5 billion
pounds of phthalates last year, according to SRI International, an
industry consulting company based in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's major producers include Houston-based Exxon
Chemical Co., Kingsport, Tenn.'s Eastman Chemical Co., and
Pittsburgh-based Aristech Chemical Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort to restrict the use of these plasticizers would
affect not just the phthalate industry but other products further
up the chain in the plastics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Propylene is one of the two major building blocks of plastics.
And about 8 percent of U.S. propylene production is used to make
the feed stocks needed to produce plasticizers.
</P>
<P>
   Aristech, for instance, doesn't manufacture phthalates in the
Houston area. But the company's plant in nearby Pasadena, which
employs 120 Aristech workers and another 45 contract employees,
produces two chemicals used to make plasticizers.
</P>
<P>
   Plastics makers could use other compounds to soften polyvinyl
chloride, but forcing the industry to switch to those chemicals
would drive up costs. And, industry officials point out that these
phthalates have been studied far more extensively than the
alternative products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an extraordinarily bad move to seek substitutes
because we have almost 40 years of research to see that something
is safe,'' said Jack Maurer, Aristech's director of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Washington-based Vinyl Institute, in a written
statement, said they were confident ``the conclusions of this
review will reflect the same findings as hundreds of studies have
in the past _ that the benefits of these products, especially vinyl
medical devices, far outweigh any alleged health risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical device makers point out that phthalates leaching out of
the plastic bags used to store blood actually help extend the
blood's shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's position was bolstered two months ago by the
findings of a blue ribbon panel chaired by former U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop.
</P>
<P>
   That group, convened by the American Council on Science and
Health, concluded that two of the plasticizers most widely used to
make vinyl toys and medical equipment were not harmful. In fact,
the group urged the continued use of these materials, citing their
benefits in the medical industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the plastics makers are being challenged by groups such as
Health Care Without Harm, a coalition of 180 health, religious,
labor and environmental groups that is trying to prod the Food and
Drug Administration to restrict the use of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Health Care Without Harm point to a study that
indicated one commonly used phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,
leached from intravenous bags into the solutions contained and then
into patients.
</P>
<P>
   They fear leaching phthalates, besides causing reproductive and
developmental problems, could cause damage to hearts, livers, lungs
and kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Both the American Council on Science and Health and Health Care
Without Harm made presentations to the National Toxicology
Program's expert panel.
</P>
<P>
   Activists hoping to force a ban on use of the seven phthalates
expressed frustration Thursday with the speed of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Finaldi, the toxics coordinator for Greenpeace USA in
Raleigh, N.C., said 15 other countries in the last year have moved
to restrict use of plasticizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of discussions in other countries where
governments believe that precautions are more important than
protecting a product for industry,'' Finaldi said. ``We feel like
it's the other way around here.''

COMMENTARY: AN AMERICAN IN PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Surely one of the oddest features of international
affairs today is the fact that half the world thinks America wants
to dominate everything and half the U.S. Congress doesn't even own
a passport.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between how foreigners see America and how America sees
itself in the world could not be larger, particularly after Kosovo.
China and Russia openly complain about America throwing its weight
around. But there is plenty of resentment of U.S. ``domination''
among America's European allies as well. You can read it in the
European press, or hear it in little digs like the one making the
rounds over here that ``the Chinese lost more people in the Kosovo
war than the Americans did.''
</P>
<P>
   The gulf war showed the Euros how far ahead the U.S. military
was in technological terms, and the Kosovo war showed how much
wider that gap had become. This has left the Euros feeling
victorious in Kosovo, yet diminished. As one British defense
official remarked to me, ``We have to avoid a situation where you
(Americans) turn out the high-tech stuff and we provide the jolly
good infantry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder the French have coined a new term to describe
America today _ ``the hyperpower.'' The term ``superpower'' was too
small. It's also no wonder that right after NATO's Kosovo victory
the European Union declared its intention to form its own military
force capable of acting independently of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This would be laughable if it were not so pathetic. The Euros
will not catch America so easily. Consider just one reason:
Devotees of Ronald Reagan like to credit him with the military
buildup that enabled the United States to run so far ahead of all
its allies and enemies. They are right about Reagan, but they are
wrong about what he deserves credit for. The most important thing
Reagan did was break the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike,
which helped break the hold of organized labor over the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   That was critically important for spurring the information
revolution in America. How so? Ask yourself this: Why is it that
the Europeans have lots of money and the same access to technology
as Americans do, yet most of them have been slow to absorb
computers and info-technologies. Answer: U.S. firms are quick to
absorb new, more productive technologies because they can easily
absorb the cost of the new investment by laying off the workers who
used to perform that task. And as the overall economy becomes more
productive, those workers get rehired elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans have moved slower because their rigid labor laws
make it very hard, or very costly, to lay off workers. And if you
have to pay for a new computer and the wages of an old worker, you
are much less likely to buy the new computer. The world's eight
largest high-tech companies are all U.S.-based.
</P>
<P>
   The deregulation of the U.S. economy has fostered the quick
adoption of the new information technologies, and these new
technologies have given the U.S. military its great technological
leap forward _ from laser-guided weapons to stealth technology to
electronic warfare. These systems are now essential for fighting
wars that modern democracies will tolerate, which is to say
high-tech, remote-control, low-casualty wars. Without the economic
and technological underpinnings that make such weapons possible,
the Euros will have a hard time catching Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Euros need to understand their weakness, and how
to manage it, America needs to understand its strength and how to
manage it. The idea that the U.S. Congress, looking at a $1
trillion surplus, wants to cut its paltry foreign aid budget,
refuses to pay its U.N. arrears, talks about free trade but then
won't even expand Nafta to Chile, and treats foreign policy as a
sport in which you pass sanctions against your favorite enemy, like
a game of darts, should embarrass every American.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is split between those who believe the United States
should act everywhere alone and those who believe it should act
nowhere. The idea of a generous America, leading where it must,
sharing where it can and financing the development banks to give a
hand up to those most in need, has a shrinking constituency.
</P>
<P>
   It's crazy that at this moment the president has to spend his
time abroad persuading foreigners that America is not a cheap
imperialist, and his time at home convincing Congress that America
still has a global role.

 &HT;    Berry feeling good about life, `Dandridge' project
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Everyone knows Halle Berry is beautiful.
But you don't know how beautiful until you're sitting two feet from
the curvy siren in a plush California hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   Her smooth, honey-colored complexion is without blemish. You
search for an imperfection on her oval face. A mole. A scratch. A
pimple. Anything!
</P>
<P>
   There are none.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's delicate frame is tiny, yet deceptively voluptuous in a
light blue, two-piece Armani pant suit. When asked if she still
hates her breasts, which Berry has been known to say are too big,
she stands up, saunters thisclose to her wide-eyed visitor, bends
over and breathlessly coos, ``What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Berry tilts her head back and laughs _ hard.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's clear that Halle Berry is feeling _ and looking _
good.
</P>
<P>
   But Berry wasn't always smiling. In fact, the 31-year-old
actress has battled diabetes, severe depression, insecurity and
narrow-minded movie producers. She even thought about taking her
own life after divorcing baseball star David Justice in 1996. Berry
actually sat in her car with the engine running in her garage and
thought about dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the lowest, lowest low after my divorce,'' Berry says
quietly. ``Although that was one of the hardest experiences of my
life, it's been one of the best because ... it made me make some
real changes and inspired me to really stand up for me and figure
out who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Berry is Dorothy Dandridge, the sultry, yet
widely forgotten black actress, dancer and singer in HBO's
sympathetic, yet revealing film, ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge''
(Saturday, 9 p.m.). For a time, the stunning sex goddess was the
black Marilyn Monroe. Dandridge oozed sexuality, confidence and
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Called a ``sepia siren'' and the most ``beautiful Negro singer
since Lena Horne'' by Life magazine (she was the first black female
star to grace Life's cover), the tall willowy beauty reached the
pinnacle of stardom as the sultry seductress lead in two
exceptional Hollywood musicals, ``Carmen Jones,'' for which she was
the first black woman to receive an Oscar nomination for Best
Actress, and ``Porgy and Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like Berry, Dandridge was a tortured soul who battled many
personal and professional demons. There were two failed marriages,
an abortion after a protracted affair with ``Carmen Jones''
director Otto Preminger, a mentally retarded daughter and racist
Hollywood's inability to find roles to match Dandridge's celebrity.
The stress took a toll.

<P>
   On Sept. 8, 1965, Dandridge was found dead on the bathroom floor
of her Hollywood apartment. The cause of death was an overdose of
Tofranil, an anti-depressant. Dorothy Dandridge was only 42.
</P>
<P>
   Was it suicide or accidental? No one knows for sure. But Berry,
who also executive produced the HBO film and gave up her salary to
get it made, has no doubt that Dandridge killed herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I believe that the night she died she took the
pills and said, `OK, I'm going to lie down on the floor and die
right now,''' Berry says. ``But I think it was a slow process.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie six years in planning
</P>
<P>
   It was a slow process getting ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge''
made. It took a hard-charging Berry six years to get Dandridge's
tragic story on HBO. The film is based on a biography by Earl
Mills, Dandridge's long-time manager (tenderly played by ``Star
Trek: Next Generation'''s Brent Spiner).
</P>
<P>
   Martha Coolidge, the film's director, also found the subject
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself, `Why isn't Dorothy Dandridge the
household word that Marilyn Monroe is?''' Coolidge asks. ``And I'm
not saying they're the same. I think Dorothy Dandridge has, in so
many ways, more social significance, though she may not be as known
culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry wasn't the only entertainer fascinated with Dandridge's
life. Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson are also looking to produce
and star in a Dandridge movie. Berry, however, wants to dispel the
notion that she beat out Houston and Jackson out for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have rights to our respective books,'' she points out.
``I just got my project done first. It wasn't like there was one
role and we were all vying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry says that Dandridge has been a role model of hers ever
since she was 18 and saw ``Carmen Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her contribution was so great and so meaningful, not only to
me, but to an entire community of people,'' Berry says. ``And
(Dorothy) gave me an opportunity to finally, after 10 years of
struggling in this industry, to be a leading lady.''
</P>
<P>
   While Berry has appeared in a string of films, including roles
as a crack addict in ``Jungle Fever,'' a crack mom in ``Losing
Isiah,'' a femme fatale in ``The Flintstones'' and a mouthy
militant in ``Bulworth,'' she has had a tough time finding meaty
dramatic parts.
</P>
<P>
   As Dandridge, Berry gives a wonderfully detailed and rich
performance. She sings, dances and shows a wide variety of
emotions. One of Berry's finest moments is when Dandridge is told
that although she's a guest at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas,
she's not allowed to use the swimming pool. A defiant Dandridge,
however, sticks her toe in it anyway, only to find out later that
the pool was drained and cleaned. It's a sobering moment. And the
quiet anger is etched all over Berry's face.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, Dandridge are alike
</P>
<P>
   Berry's obsession with Dandridge goes beyond the obvious
comparisons of two gorgeous black actress struggling to be taken
seriously in Hollywood. Like Dandridge, Berry has suffered her
share of personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even Geri Branton, Dandridge's best friend, sees the
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Halle's personal life is shocking in that it's the
same as (Dorothy's),'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most red-blooded women, (Dorothy and I) shared the issues
of trying to find love in all the wrong places,'' Berry explains.
``We're both products of an idealistic way relationships are
supposed to be _ little girls growing up and finding Mr. Right and
being happy. And what you find out first is that you have to be
happy with yourself. She didn't know that. She was saying, `Love
me, love me, please somebody love me' and she didn't love herself.
I've been through that phase in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempestuous love life
</P>
<P>
   Berry has been involved in a string of rocky relationships,
including romances with Wesley Snipes and ex-husband Justice. In
1991, she was hit by a former boyfriend and lost 80 percent of the
hearing in her left ear. In 1993, Berry's dentist/boyfriend sued
her for $80,000 he said he loaned her during their relationship.
The suit was dismissed, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to not dig deep enough with people,'' she says. ``I
need someone who can deal with the woman that I really am, not this
image of Halle Berry that's put up on a pedestal. I need someone
with strong faith. That's what keeps people together, it's not
looks, how much money you have, it's what's in your heart. Now when
I meet a guy, I don't only listen to what he's saying to me, I look
at how he treats other people. How does he treat the sales clerk,
someone who means nothing to him. Is he respectful? Or is he
self-absorbed? I never really looked at those things before.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be hard to fathom, Berry never believed she
measured up as an actress or a mate. She may have been smiling for
the cameras, but she was dying a slow death inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people look at me and say, `She should be happy,' but
what they don't realize is that I'm still a person inside just like
everybody else and people expect you to always be happy just
because you have what they think is physical beauty or you have
money and you're an actress,'' she says. ``But when people start to
make you feel like there's something wrong with you and you're not
as happy as they think you should be, then you start to get
insecure.''
</P>
<P>
   And lonely. Despite her stunning good looks, Berry says she's
often home alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men think I must have somebody, so they say, `I'm not even
going to step there,''' she says. ``And it's the opposite. I've
been dateless more than anybody I know. That's a hard, cold fact.
Many times my girlfriends are going out and I'm like, `Can I
come?'''
</P>
<P>
   After years of personal and professional stress, is Berry now at
peace? She says she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent the last three years of my life really just getting
to know myself and really appreciate who I am,'' she says. ``When I
stopped looking for love from everybody else and when I loved
myself enough, I stopped caring about what people thought about me.
If you like me, great, if you don't, so sad, so sorry, but my train
is still going on.''

BUSH SAYS HE'S BEEN DRUG FREE IN PAST 15 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush's smooth-running
campaign for the GOP presidential nomination is facing its first
crisis over the candidate's refusal to directly answer one
question: ``Have you ever used illegal drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Bush tried to put out the media fire over the
persistent, unsubstantiated rumors of past cocaine use, telling
reporters that he ``could have passed'' the FBI background checks
his father, President George Bush, imposed on employees in his
administration. Those checks required them be drug-free since 1974,
Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   A day before, Bush told the Dallas Morning News that he could
pass the current White House standard, which he said required no
drug use for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says unnamed rivals in the GOP field are spreading the
gossip about cocaine, and he asserts he will not play ``the
politics of personal destruction'' by making his private life a
public issue. But what he won't say is that he never experimented
with illegal drugs, fueling speculation that Bush has something to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to tell people I made mistakes and that I have
learned from my mistakes,'' Bush said during a campaign stop
Thursday in Roanoke, Va. ``And if they like it, I hope they give me
a chance. And if they don't like it, they can go find somebody else
to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no evidence that Bush ever used cocaine, the
rumors have gained altitude in part because Bush acknowledges he
once sowed some wild oats _ ``when I was young and irresponsible, I
was young and irresponsible,'' he often says _ and also because he
has been frank about other personal issues, like his marital
fidelity and heavy drinking before the age of 40. Bush is now 53.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also hard for Bush to dodge because each of the
other eight GOP presidential candidates has denied using illegal
drugs, and at least two of them, Gary Bauer and Utah Senator Orrin
Hatch, say Bush should be honest and forthcoming if he used
cocaine, which is a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he gave time-specific answers over the last two days
because they address the ``relevant'' questions of whether he could
pass the same background checks that he would require in his own
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I was asked . . . whether or not, if I became
president, I will have background checks for the people that work
for me at the White House,'' Bush said in Roanoke. ``And if I did,
could I pass the challenge of a background check. My answer is
absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only could I pass the background check and the standards
applied to today's White House, but I could have passed the
background check and the standards applied on the most stringent
conditions when my dad was the president of the United States _ a
15-year period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have more to explain, however, since the Clinton
administration actually requires the FBI to ask White House
applicants about drug usage since their 18th birthdays. Ralph Reed,
a GOP consultant who is working closely with the Bush campaign,
said the candidate has said enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Reed said in a telephone interview. ``Whatever
the cost, somebody ultimately has to take a stand and say, `Enough
is enough, I am not going to play the politics of gotcha.' Bush
wants to maintain the moral high ground, which is the right thing
to do. I think the public is hungering for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlyn Bowman, who analyzes polls at the American Enterprise
Institute, said the public is ``all over the map'' on the issue of
peeking into a public person's privaXS+fehavior. According to a
Newsweek poll in January, 61 percent of Americans said politicians
should refuse to answer questions about their personal lives, but
the same respondents were split, 47 percent for and 47 percent
against, over whether the media should probe the extramarital
affairs, drug use, and business dealings of public officials.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted last week for Fox News found that 69 percent of
those surveyed wanted to know about a presidential candidate's past
cocaine use, 41 percent said they cared if the candidate had used
marijuana, and 28 percent thought a politician's past extramarital
affair was relevant.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidate Steve Forbes said on CNN's ``Crossfire'' Thursday
night that it was ``absolutely false'' that any of his campaign
aides were spreading rumors about Bush and cocaine, but he would
fire them if they were. ``I vehemently deny it,'' Forbes said. ``We
don't engage in rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kalb, executive director of the Joan Shorenstein Center
on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard University,
said Bush's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy is admirable but
untenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sympathetic to any politician who has to face a
rambunctious press, but at this stage it is unrealistic to imagine
you can avoid it,'' Kalb said. ``The longer the siege continues,
the worse it is likely to get for the governor. He has to face up
to the need to answer these questions, because the press won't go
away.''

   &UR; GETTING READY FOR THE BIG ONES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Every dog has its day, and all things Cuban being  &LR; mas buenas &LR; 
than ever _ the music, the cigars and testimonials from supermodels
and movie stars _ it's time to say hello to a Cuban breed, the
Havanese.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bonnie Levinson &LR; , who lives in San Francisco and is about to
become a Havanese owner, says there are fewer than five in San
Francisco, and only 4,000 in the United States. The American Kennel
Club describes the dog as part of the Bichon family, small, sturdy
and short-legged, ``with a soft, profuse, untrimmed coat. His
plumed tail is carried curled over his back. He is an affectionate,
happy dog with a lively, springy gait.'' This makes him likely to
be a much more popular pet than  &UR; Fidel Castro &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The first Bichons, ancestors to the Havanese, were brought from
Spain by sea captains as gifts for rich Cuban women in families
with whom the Spaniards wished to establish trade. Three families
that who  &LR; left Cuba during the '50s and '60s brought the dogs to
the United States.
</P>

   - You're sick of Y2K predictions? W cites experts at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter who say, ``The Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and

<P>
   - Yes, it's almost Miss America time again, and say hello to
Miss California 1999,  &UR; Mary Anne Sapio &LR;  of Rohnert Park. Her
platform issue is breast cancer education and awareness, her
scholastic ambition is to get an undergraduate degree and a
master's in education and then a law degree, and her talent is tap
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Imelda Marcos &LR;  has confirmed reports that her shoe collection
is growing quickly and said the tally could some day exceed 3,000.
``I seem to get more and more shoes,'' she said in Manila on
Wednesday, ``and I'm afraid that I will have more shoes than
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos left behind 1,220 pairs of shoes when she and her
husband, the late  &UR; Ferdinand &LR; , fled the presidential palace in
Manila. She said people gave her shoes when they imagined her
forced out and shoe-impaired. ``They thought I was shoeless. They
did not want a former first lady to be without shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   - In celebration of the 2,000th birthday of  &UR; Jesus &LR; , the
National Catholic Reporter is sponsoring a contest for an artwork
depicting him. The work will appear on the millennium issue cover
of the magazine, and the artist will win $2,000.

   &UR; THE AMERICAN WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In response to complaints from animal rights advocates, Procter
&AMP; Gamble recently announced that it would stop testing products on
animals, reports Advertising Age. Now comes word that the company
is buying the pet product manufacturer Iams; P&AMP;G executives told Ad
Age that would give Iams the chance to apply tricks of the human
care trade _ hair products and the like _ to pet care products.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' concludes Ad Age, ``in just a little over a month, P&AMP;G
has gone from using animals to test human products to using humans
to test animal products.''

   P.S. ``Every Breath Is a Prayer,'' a talk about Tibet and the

   ``Hall of Justice; early morning. Handcuffed: You going in.
Black eye: Me coming out. You smiled. I shrugged. Let's have a
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Jim Schock &LR;  found it in the Marin I-J police calls column:
``Larkspur. 8/13, 9:08 a.m., petty theft: Laundry was taken from a

<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got in (a) fight I was down in this discipline module,
which is like a hole. Three times a day, you see a pair of hands
and some food comes in. It's pretty awful. One day it opens and
there was this lieutenant, with some deputy he'd brought by to meet
me. I hadn't had a shower in five days, I was sleeping in my
clothes, my hair was all f_ up. But that Hollywood big-shot
entertainer thing came in, and I thought, `Well, I'd better come
to, I have company.' And this guy came in and said, `Listen, I know
you don't have a lot to read in here. I hope I wouldn't be crossing
the line if I brought a script by for you. It's about unicorns.
It's not what you think, there's a very human element to it.' ''

COMMENTARY: THE THIRD MAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The important thing to know is not who fired the shot but who
paid for the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist Eric Ambler wrote that in 1937. Ever since Dec. 21,
1988, the search for the answer has been central to the lives of
270 families _ the survivors of every person aboard Pan Am 103,
mostly Americans, and the 11 Scots killed on the ground by falling
pieces of plane and humans.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Washington, Scottish prosecutors will talk to the
families (no press) about the trial ahead in The Hague,
Netherlands, for two Libyan agents who have been indicted in
America and Scotland.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I doubt there will be a person in the room, including
prosecutors, or any intelligence official anywhere who does not
know that Moammar Gadhafi commanded his agents to blow up the
plane. They were on his secret service payroll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In The Hague, he controls their mouths as if they were in
Tripoli. They will deny he knew anything about anything _ if they
have any interest in the lives of family members back home in
Tripoli. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives of the Pan Am victims have prepared questions for
the visiting Scots:
</P>
<P>
   _ Since a U.N. document approved in Washington and London
promises that the trial will not be used to ``undermine'' the
Libyan government, which means Moammar and only Moammar, will you
be free to follow a probing line about his guilt?
</P>
<P>
   _ Since the press is not around, do tell us, do you believe in
fairy tales? Do you believe that two men working directly under the
supervision of Gadhafi's relatives could get the money, equipment
and false passports to pull the plot together in Tripoli, Malta and
Frankfurt, organize explosive experts and airport connections to
get the device aboard an American plane at precisely the right
time, and whisk back to Libya all safe and sound _ all without a
word about the operation getting through to Gadhafi, who would have
chopped their fool heads off if they dared carry out, without his
permission, a crime that wrecked his economy with sanctions?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ If you can't really believe such a cockamamie story, why is
your government and ours demeaning the sorrow of the Pan Am
relatives by the charade of a trial? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Since there is no death penalty in the Scottish law under
which the two men are to be tried, and killers are being freed
early in Northern Ireland, Israel and the Balkans, what is the
longest they could serve?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Since Scottish law permits defendants to be acquitted on a
verdict of ``not proven,'' is it possible they won't serve a day? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Oh, and what about the long, strong belief of Western agents
that Syria and Iran were also involved in the explosion plot _
until the Westerners were suddenly persuaded to believe it no
longer? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never has sorrow been more bitter to the Pan Am relatives than
now, when so many countries are becoming part of a conspiracy with
Gadhafi to rescue him by limiting the trial to his two agents _ and
accepting his golden word that he knew nothing, not a thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions against Libya for refusing to give up the agents were
``suspended'' when Gadhafi decided that, given the U.N. ``no
undermining'' condition, the Scots could have a chance to question
the two after all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rush to the Libyan trough began instantly. Zippo, full
diplomatic ties were restored with Libya, and construction and oil
contracts were signed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Am families know _ as do we all _ that the international
decision to accept a trial without Gadhafi even mentioned in the
indictments was motivated by those Libyan contracts. Money was what
our friends and allies settled for. Gadhafi got the rebuilding of
the Libyan economy he had smashed himself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For reporting that the Blair government has evidence that
Gadhafi personally ordered the Pan Am bombing, the Sunday Times of
London got a formal warning that any follow-up story would result
in the punitive injunctions allowed by British law. No denials;
just the warning.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the United States has not suspended the U.N.-ordered
sanctions it had supported. Good; we shall see. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions are not imposed out of peeve but to restrain rogue
nations and for the protection of their chosen targets. So it's a
wonder to relatives of the murdered, and to me, that America's
public and journalists do not think more about Dec. 21, 1988,
particularly when they board an American plane, and about who owns
the bullet.

SULLIVAN SAYS OUSTING KENNEDY WOULD BE `UPSET OF CENTURY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael J. Sullivan, the Massachusetts district
attorney, who hinted this week at a campaign against Senator Edward
M. Kennedy, says he and national Republican officials recognized
his campaign would be a ``huge uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who met here with officials of the Republican National
Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee to size
up his chances, said party leaders, while not discouraging, were
``frank'' about his odds of winning the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no rose-colored glasses I'm wearing, and they're not
wearing any rose-colored glasses, either,'' he told reporters at
the National Republican Senatorial Committee NRSC headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he recognized that ousting Kennedy, who is in his
eighth term, ``would clearly be the upset of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a former state representative and a twice-elected
district attorney in Plymouth County, Mass., said he will make his
decision in the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Globe earlier this week that Governor Paul
Cellucci and Lieutenant Governor Jane M. Swift had recruited
Sullivan to challenge the senior senator. If Sullivan decides to
run, he would be the first Republican candidate with substantial
political experience and backing to run against Kennedy since the
senator was first elected in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also said he is unsure about raising the millions of
dollars he would need to mount a successful campaign against
Kennedy, who already has $2.4 million in his campaign chest.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he is confident he could raise at least $3.5
million for the race, with an additional $650,000 from the NRSC,
but he would need more than that to pose a formidable challenge to
Kennedy, who is expected to raise at least $10 million for his
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge uphill battle,'' Sullivan said. ``This is the
classic David vs. Goliath campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   If he decides to run, Sullivan said, he will stress health care
for the elderly, education, crime prevention and taxes, but he has
not yet formed a solid campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Sullivan said he would not criticize
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about Senator Kennedy,'' he said. ``This is about
who Mike Sullivan is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he opposes abortion except in the case of rape,
incest, or to save the life of the mother; supports the death
penalty; and is against creating more gun-control laws. Instead, he
said he supports stronger enforcement of existing laws on illegal
possesion and use of guns.

PERROT'S DEATH MAY HIT CHILDREN ESPECIALLY HARD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEANNIE KEVER 
and DAVID BARRON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As news of Kim Perrot's death spread Thursday, two
things became clear:
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a basketball fan to mourn, and public shock
over the death of someone so young and physically fit _ Perrot, a
nonsmoker, died of lung cancer at the age of 32 _ will be tempered
by admiration for what she achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Kids, especially pre-teen and teen-age girls, were core members
of Perrot's unofficial fan club, and this twin legacy of grief and
inspiration may hit them especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think children are really struck by the fact that here was
this wonderful, talented athlete, and she died of cancer,'' Houston
psychologist Elizabeth Dybell said. ``One of the most important
things for children that it brings to mind is that we're all
vulnerable. Even if you're in terrific physical shape, something
terrible can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But kids should also remember that what they loved most about
Perrot will live on, Dybell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lived her dream and went for the gusto and was totally
involved in her passion. That's what we have to remind kids about.
She may have died young, but look what she did in her short life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a message to all of us to go out and seize the day,
because you don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot was a long-shot as a sports hero, a basketball player who
was really too short for today's game. At only 5-foot-5, she wasn't
a draft pick when the WNBA began forming teams in 1997, and she had
to muscle her way onto the Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. She quickly became not only a star point guard, but
the team's emotional center.
</P>
<P>
   Kids everywhere could relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just personified somebody who is really scrappy, a hard
worker, a really good person,'' family therapist Teddy Melhart
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's connection to the community may have begun on the
court, but soon, she was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke at schools and other public appearances, pushing her
message of physical fitness, education, persistence and saying no
to drugs. Even after announcing in February that she had been
diagnosed with lung cancer that had spread to her brain, she
remained active and visible, refusing to let surgery to remove a
brain tumor and a subsequent round of radiation treatments keep her
in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a popular column in Yo!, the Chronicle's weekly
section for kids, a chatty celebration of sports and determination
and trying your best. There, she also wrote of her battle against
cancer, displaying the same tenacity that had worked so well for
her on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of positive things she taught us, and the
sadness and grief comes as such a natural part of it,'' Dybell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Perrot say her delight in her fans was genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim just had such a joy for life,'' said Angela Blakeney,
communication manager for the Comets. ``She enjoyed meeting people,
whether young or old. The stories they would tell, the smiles they
would bring, flooded her heart and encouraged her to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has made its players accessible as role models, and
that captured the imagination of many kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the kids a role model of practicing, working hard,''
Dybell said. ``They don't see the hours of practice ... the
injuries. But they do see that they can set a dream and make it
happen. Kim's life and the women's team say you can make something
happen. You don't have to be passive.''
</P>
<P>
   The joy she and her teammates brought to so many is sure to
deepen the sadness they feel upon her death.
</P>
<P>
   Kids might also be angry, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a natural part of the grief process. `Why was she taken
so soon? She was so young, and she was so good. Why did she have to
die?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Parents sometimes make the mistake of brushing aside kids' anger
over death, Wright said. ``I think hearing that out helps the child
to process that.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to help kids, or anyone, deal with grief is simply
to be willing to listen, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as parents we have to be aware of the strong feelings
children may have about death and ... their intense sadness,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's death may spark memories of the deaths of family
members or even family pets, Wright said. For young children, it
may prompt fears of their own deaths, or the deaths of their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to listen and be accepting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And parents can acknowledge their own sense of loss, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say, `Yeah, I'm really sad, too. It's a sad day,'''
Wright said. ``The other thing is to acknowledge the loss, that
it's not right for her to be taken so soon, but (to say), `You can
carry her in your heart and always remember how wonderful she
was.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot would like that, Blakeney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her determination to live continued until the very end,'' she
said, ``and she would want the Comets fans and the people who
remember her to keep that in mind and to be inspired by the
strength that she had.''

GREEK CHURCH LEADER IN US RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unprecedent move Archbishop Spyridon resigned under
pressure Thursday as leader of the 1.5 million-member Greek
Orthodox Church of America after a bitter two-year campaign to oust
him by critics who claimed his authoritarian leadership alienated
too many of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon is the first leader in the 77-year history of the
organized US Greek church forced to resign because of poor job
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old American-born prelate submitted his resignation
to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Istanbul-based spiritual
leader of the world's 218 million Orthodox Christians and the man
who appointed Spyridon three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew appointed Metropolitan Demetrios Trakatellis, 71,
who leads the Orthodox Church in Greece and was passed over as the
US archbishop in 1996, as Spyridon's replacement. A former
professor at Harvard University and at Hellenic College in
Brookline, Trakatellis is well-known to priests, bishops and other
US church leaders as a highly-regarded scholar.
</P>
<P>
   For Spyridon, the beginning of the internal revolt that led to
his departure began in 1997 when he fired the president and three
professors at Hellenic College _ the church's flagship institution
_ after they allegedly refused to cover up an alleged sexual
misconduct incident involving a student and a visiting priest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing pressure from church members, including
metropolitans, priests, and many wealthy Greek Americans, to oust
Spyridon, Bartholomew stood by the embattled prelate for months.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Bartholomew was warned by American church
activists that if he did not do something about Spyridon the US
Greek Orthodox Church could split from Istanbul _ something that
would deal a devastating blow to the patriarch's authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Orthodox Church is by far the biggest, richest and
most influential of the more than a dozen Orthodox Christian
churches in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread of Spyridon's resignation, which is effective
Aug. 30, his critics and supporters alike expressed relief that the
controversy that was tearing apart the American church may finally
come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am elated with the election of Metropolitan Demetrios as our
next archbishop, but I am saddened things turned out the way they
did for Bishop Spyridon,'' said Metropolitan Methodios, the head of
the Greek Orthodox diocese of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it opens a new life to the Greek Orthodox Church of
America,'' added Methodios, who was one of five US bishops that
called for Spyridon's ouster earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   While his resignation letter never touches on the controversy
that engulfed much of his tenure, Spyridon did address in strong
language his many critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those few of every grade who during these past three years
have opposed this vital mission of the Church and have spared
little ordinance in an attack of words that has done far more
damage to our Greek Orthodox family than it has to those entrusted
with its leadership, I extend my heartfelt archpastoral
forgiveness,'' said Spyridon, who has been recalled to Turkey for
another assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon assumed his post amid high hopes that his American
upbringing would help him understand the sense of independence and
participatory democracy that had come to influence the US Greek
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   But his actions against the four men at Hellenic College and the
way he lashed out against critics soon turned the hope into
widespread dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the leadership was inappropriate for our particular
curriculum,'' said Thomas Lelon, executive director of Greek
Orthodox American Goal, a group led by promient Greek Americans
that coordinated the crusade to oust Spyridon. ``When a leader
makes decision without the advice and consent of the people that
constitute the church that becomes difficult for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   But other church activists were more sympathetic toward
Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Archbishop Spyridon resigned because he thought it was
for the good of the American church. He was unable to end the
controversy involving his tenure,'' said Michael Krone, a Boston
attorney and defender of Spyridon. ``I know alot of people are
happy but I am not. I think it's kind of sad what happened _ a
controversy was created and it never went away.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spyridon, his critics say, only exacerbated the acrimony
within the church by what they say was some of his heavy handed
dealing with critics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when the Reverend G. Stephanopoulos, dean of New
York's Holy Trinity Cathedral and the fatehr of former White House
aide George Stephanopoulos, publicly opposed Spyridon, the prelate
responded by stripping the priest of much of his authority.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to derail what they perceived as a system of
one-man rule, several dissidents filed lawsuits against the
archdiocese. The archdiocese responded by suing Goal to try and
prevent the group from using the archdiocese's mailing list. A
judge ruled against the church.
</P>
<P>
   But the feuding led to dozens of stories both in the Greek and
mainstream press that sullied the church's reputation and
embarrassed the Patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end for Spyridon, Greek Orthodox Church
activists say, came in January when Spyridon and the five US
metropolitans met with Bartholomew in Istanbul. While Bartholomew
encouraged them to work out their differences, tensions between
Spyridon and the prelates instead seemed to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Spyridon was summoned to Istanbul again, the
American leader was given one month to work things out. But fears
that the US church was close to breaking away from Istanbul finally
forced Bartholomew's hand.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every few months, small groups of local Democratic
officials journey to special seminars to learn how to combat a
party vulnerability: doubts among voters that the Democrats embrace
mainstream family values.
</P>
<P>
   Under the auspices of the Democratic Leadership Council, a
centrist party group, Anita F. Gottlieb, a consultant, takes the
Democrats through a mental exercise designed to stop them from
speaking in the numbing jargon of program names and acronyms and
instead to explain policy goals with value-laden statements about
social ills and about right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gottlieb tells them to visualize a ``values tree.'' The
roots of the tree are their values. The trunk is policy goals and
the branches are programs. With the tree in mind to reinforce the
idea that policy goals should grow from values, they then write
speeches to explain the ideas of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   That the council feels the need to run such workshops says
something about a persistent difficulty facing Democrats as they
head into the next election. Political strategists say the public
once again sees the Republicans as the party of values, considering
them more trustworthy on a range of moral and ethical matters like
honesty, belief in God, belief in personal responsibility and
knowing right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, this turn of events could not be more
frustrating. In his re-election campaign, President Clinton
neutralized the long-standing Republican strength on moral issues
like religion and violence in movies and on television by putting
together a set of policies that added up to a secular family values
agenda for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Now, polls show that the Democrats' traditional weakness in this
area has returned. And strategists say that just as many
Republicans had predicted months ago, some of the party's problems
stem from the public backlash against President Clinton's behavior
in the Monica Lewinsky matter, particularly among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception problem here that the Democrats have, I
think, on moral questions,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certainly a lot of it has to do with the last year and
a half and you cannot discount that,'' Dodd said, referring to
Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky and his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, a
nonpartisan group, found in a July poll that a greater number of
people _ 44 percent _ now think that the House did the right thing
in impeaching Clinton. That figure was at 35 percent last December
at the height of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures, coming six months after the Senate trial ended
with Clinton's acquittal, cannot be reassuring to Democrats. At the
same time, presidential preference polls show that Vice President
Al Gore is consistently running 15 percentage points or more behind
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Democrats go into 2000 with advantages.
Congressional Democrats have a decided edge on issues ranging from
Medicare to health care to education. And, the Republican cry for
deep tax cuts has not caught on with the public, according to
recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many public opinion surveys show that the two parties are about
even when voters are asked whether they prefer the Republicans or
the Democrats running Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats' disadvantage on values could become
magnified, depending on the mood of the voters, who, because of the
good economy, have turned their attention elsewhere. At times this
year, most particularly after the airstrikes against Yugoslavia and
the shootings in Littleton, Colo., anxiety over the nation's moral
compass has surged as a voter concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find as I go around Connecticut the public is really more
concerned about the moral future of the country than the economic
future,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``I think we have to
speak to that.''
</P>
<P>
   A June poll of 1,002 people, taken by a bipartisan team of
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, and Ed Goeas, a Republican
pollster, showed the Democrats' weakness and their areas of
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which party in Congress better represented the values of
personal responsibility, voters chose Republicans by 44 percent to
22 percent. On ethics and honesty, they favored Republicans over
Democrats by 39 percent to 20 percent. On faith in God, they picked
the Republicans by 40 percent to 18 percent. And on knowing right
from wrong, they favored Republicans over Democrats by 35 percent
to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only when asked which party better represented the value of
community, did those surveyed select the Democrats, 39 percent to
33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists differ on how much to attribute these
findings to disillusionment with Clinton. They also cite factors
like public concern with the war in Kosovo, the Republicans'
greater comfort with emphasizing God and religion, and lingering
public doubts dating from the 1960s over whether the Democrats
embrace mainstream values.
</P>
<P>
   Changing a long-standing image of a party takes time, said Ed
Kilgore, the policy director at the Democratic Leadership Council,
adding, ``I think you have to reprove yourself for two to three
administrations before you fundamentally change the perception of
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the council's seminars held this year in Arizona, Florida,
Pennsylvania, Utah and Wisconsin, Kilgore said, ``It's a
revolutionary exercise for a lot of Democrats. It's important to
make it clear that your policy positions reflect values the public
shares and that you are not proposing programs as an end in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are heading into the elections with strengths on
an array of issues not explicitly related to values. Asked in the
June poll which party in Congress would do a better job of
improving the health care system, voters selected Democrats over
Republicans 53 percent to 24 percent. On which party would better
improve education, the Democrats won 46 percent to 31 percent. On
which would strengthen Social Security, the Democrats led
Republicans 49 percent to 28 percent.

NERDY CAL TECH TOPS HARVARD IN MAGAZINE'S RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the revenge of the nerds.
</P>
<P>
   The widely-watched US News and World Report Best Colleges
rankings are out, and the establishment is in for a surprise: the
California Institute of Technology, self-professed school for
intense science types, is the nation's number one, knocking Harvard
off the pinnacle from which it has preened for all but two of the
last ten years.
</P>
<P>
   The annual release of the top 10 list prompted the usual griping
Thursday about the unfairness of ratings. But almost no one
questions their impact, on campus self-confidence as well as the
volume of applications. And on the often-overlooked Pasadena
campus, already graced by 27 Nobel Prizes, there was a sense of
winning another long-sought prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal Tech is a genuine national treasure, but it's not as well
known as it ought to be,'' said David Goodstein, a vice provost and
physics professor. ``The spotlight will be on us now. We're
delighted, happy and grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, the customary number one, officials sniffed that
rankings can be misleading _ a sentiment Goodstein freely admits to
expressing in past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precise rankings, we've always felt, are unfortunate,'' said
Bill Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid. ``It's
always nice to be seen as among the leaders, but everyone is aware
that no matter what the ranking is, there can always be
discrepancies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which fell below
its arch rival Cal Tech for the first time, there were even more
playful jibes to explain the upset. ``Yeah, David Baltimore is a
great guy,'' said spokesman Ken Campbell, referring to the longtime
MIT researcher who left Cambridge two years ago to become president
of Cal Tech.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rankings are based on a range of factors. When the
magazine started rating the schools in 1983, it looked only at
academic reputation. In 1987, it began considering factors like how
many students the school accepts and SAT scores, the ranking system
has been tweaked several times since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Cal Tech benefitted from a change that emphasized
per-student spending (a stratospheric $192,000 for each of 900
undergraduates, compared to $81,000 at Harvard.) Every single one
of Cal Tech's incoming freshmen ranked in the top ten percent on
high school graduation, a feat unmatched by any other school on the
list. Its student/faculty ratio was also unmatched, at a rare 3 to
one, compared to 8 to 1 at Harvard,
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine also notes that Cal Tech is not for everyone.
It ranks high, too, on the list of the nation's worst party
schools. The campus, US News says, is ``beautiful'' but also
``intense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Party animals and philosophy lovers who can't stomach quantum
mechanics are unlikely to find personal or academic happiness,''
the magazine concedes.
</P>
<P>
   And true, the news that the 108-year-old private institution
would be ranked number one _ vaulted from number nine on last
year's list _ probably prompted one of the most exuberant displays
of campus spirit in recent memory. ``We're thinking we should get
some of those foam fingers with `We're Number One,' '' said Jill
Perry, director of media relations, ``Even though we don't have
football!''
</P>
<P>
   Various classifications of schools _ by cost, by fun potential,
even by Internet access _ have flourished over the past ten years,
often to college officials' dismay. International students consider
the rankings even more than their American counterparts, admissions
officials say. But US News boasts the original and still the most
broadly-read of the rankings. The Web site that publishes the list
gets 250 hits every second, beginning soon after the list is posted
at one minute after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   All this may work to Cal Tech's advantage. In past years,
Goodstein said he has come east to try to recruit students in
Connecticut and Massachusetts and New York. Most applied to MIT and
Harvard, and if they applied to Cal Tech and got accepted, they
rarely decided to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grow up in the shadows of those universities, and often
they didn't know anything about us,'' he said. ``This will
undoubtedly help us in admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, though, at Harvard, joins scores of other
admissions officials who worry that students pay too much attention
to the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analogy I would use would be class ranking,'' he said.
``Some people feel that it's absolutely critical to be number one
or number two or number three. In some cases, a college is actually
better off, they may get better students, looking below.''

 WASHINGTON: to 28 percent. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democrats have been working on several fronts to respond to
the public doubts. Gore, most notably, has been making a sustained
effort to focus on values and define his own character.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds remarkably like Bush when he declares that America
should be judged ``not merely by the value of our possessions but
the values we possess.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bush called for more reliance on churches and
religious organizations, the vice president said these groups
should be eligible to receive federal money to help the needy.
</P>
<P>
   And in June he called Clinton's extramarital affair
``inexcusable,'' adding that ``particularly as a father I felt that
it was terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats have aggressively sought to turn the
policy agenda to issues on which they believe they have the upper
hand. They have pushed Republicans into high-profile legislative
battles over gun control and regulation of managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   And in his opposition to the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut
plan, Clinton has led the Democrats in portraying the proposal as
an obstacle to reshaping the Medicare system and creating a new
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two challenges,'' said Ms. Lake, who does polling
for the Gore campaign on women's issues. ``One is to talk about the
issues in values-oriented terms and two, to move the agenda from
values to these other issues because we are only going to have so
much credibility on values.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise run by the Democratic Leadership Council is just
one way that Democrats are trying to teach their elected officials
to show that programs like their education proposals actually
reflect their party's values.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for their part, say they have to be cautious in
capitalizing on the Democrats' vulnerability, so that their efforts
do not backfire as they have before.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign commercials that House Republicans ran last year
alluding to the Clinton scandal were widely judged to have
backfired, helping cost the Republicans five House seats. And much
of the party establishment has been struggling to get safely beyond
Pat Buchanan's fiery but divisive 1992 convention speech declaring
a cultural war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have to be extremely careful,'' Goeas said. ``Very
often when they see declining moral values they get put in a box on
abortion or gay rights. But when people talk values they really
talk as much about civility in society and virtue in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Republican presidential contenders like Buchanan or
Gary Bauer or Alan Keyes, who are vying for the allegiance of the
Republicans' social conservatives, still determinedly take stands
against abortion or else make a rejection of homosexuality a plank
of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But others like Bush, Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John McCain make a
more broad-brushed appeal to those concerned with the nation's
direction. They do not mention impeachment, but their allusions to
it are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talks of showing that ``politics, after a time of tarnished
ideals, can be higher and better.'' Mrs. Dole says, ``We've been
let down _ and by people we should have been able to look up to.''
And McCain says that to fight cynicism among young people ``we must
first challenge ourselves to give them an example worth
emulating.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the Republican goal is to let the eventual
presidential nominee set the party's themes and do nothing to allow
Democrats to change the focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for Republicans in Congress,'' said Linda
DiVall, a Republican pollster, ``is not to do anything that upsets
the advantage we have on morals, integrity and ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have passed a number of measures highlighting
their conservative cultural stands. They have approved a
Constitutional amendment against flag-burning, taken a stand to
allow the Ten Commandments to be posted in schools, passed a
measure prohibiting state and local governments from placing a
``substantial burden'' on a person's exercise of religion, and
approved a bill to make it a federal crime for an adult to take a
minor across state lines for an abortion in order to circumvent a
parental-notification law in the girl's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, of these measures will become law. And strategists
said they were likely to become campaign issues only on a
district-by-district basis, primarily in conservative areas of the
South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly values is a major problem for the Democrats,'' said
one House Republican strategist. ``But because it's a major problem
for Democrats, that doesn't mean you launch an expensive national
campaign on this one issue.''
</P>

ANGELL AGREES TO TEMPORARILY EDIT MEDICAL JOURNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As expected, Dr. Marcia Angell has agreed to serve as
interim editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine,
effective Sept. 1, the Massachusetts Medical Society announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous editor, Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, Angell will
have total control of the content and editorial policies of the New
England Journal of Medicine, said the medical society's president,
Dr. Jack Eigy. Angell said she also will have total control over
the use of the name, logo, and content, which she said is ``very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   A board-certified pathologist, Angell joined the Journal in 1979
and became its executive editor in 1988. She received her medical
degree from Boston University School of Medicine, and trained in
internal medicine at the Mount Auburn and University hospitals and
in pathology at Mount Auburn and New England Deaconess hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The medical society, which publishes the journal, is compiling a
search committee to select a permanent editor-in-chief. The panel
will have representatives from the journal's editorial staff and
the wider medical academic community.
</P>
<P>
   Angell said she plans to retire when a permanent editor takes
over, but she did not rule out the possibility of becoming a
candidate for the permanent position. However, she said she thinks
it is ``unlikely.''

AN ITALIAN GANDHI IS CHALLENGED BY THE INDIAN PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy )   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Immediately and deliciously billed as ``Sonia
versus Sushma,'' some first-rate political sport lies ahead in
India between the videshi bahu and the swadeshi beti: the
foreign-born daughter-in-law (who speaks heavily accented Hindi)
and the home-grown daughter (who wears vermilion powder in her
hair).
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Gandhi _ the Italian heiress to an Indian political
dynasty _ is leading her Congress Party into a month of staggered
elections that begin on Sept. 5. If Congress achieves a majority in
Parliament, she is the party's presumed choice for prime minister _
that is, if she has first won herself a seat in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In India, any candidate may run anywhere in the nation, so there
was great speculation about where Mrs. Gandhi would attempt her
maiden quest for elected office. On Wednesday, after a series of
political jukes and feints, she showed up about 1,100 miles from
New Delhi, filing her papers in Bellary, a Congress-friendly South
Indian district where the party has never lost the seat.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Gandhi succeeded in keeping her plans secret from the
press, she failed to outfox those she most needed to fool, her
opponents in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Sushma Swaraj, a former
chief minister of New Delhi who has one of the party's most
viperous tongues, was tipped off and arrived in Bellary 10 minutes
after Mrs. Gandhi to run for the very same seat.
</P>
<P>
   Just as her adversaries intended, Mrs. Gandhi _ the
daughter-in-law of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the
widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi _ was not only left
with egg on her face but a little pasta as well. Mrs. Swaraj went
right to work on the fact of her rival's foreign birth. ``I have
come here to fight for India's self-pride,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she continued the attack. ``As a videshi bahu, a
foreign-born daughter-in-law, Mrs. Gandhi is entitled to our love,
respect and security, but when that foreigner asks to be India's
prime minister just because she is one of her family's survivors,
this cannot be permitted,'' Mrs. Swaraj said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi quickly hedged her bet. Party members confirmed that
she would take advantage of a convenience in Indian law that allows
a candidate to run in two districts. Mrs. Gandhi will also be
competing in a northern state, Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That race won't be an easy one either,'' said a political
analyst, Mahesh Rangarajan. ``She'll be up against Sanjay Singh, an
old associate of the Gandhis. He's formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Gandhi, 52, raised as a Catholic in a small Italian town
near Turin, became an Indian citizen in 1983, 15 years after she
married Rajiv Gandhi at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   As a daughter-in-law in India's most famous family, she sat at
the ringside of history. The view was horrifying. Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by her own security guards in 1984. Rajiv Gandhi, whom
she had begged not to enter politics, was blown apart by a suicide
bomber in 1991. Sonia Gandhi withdrew from public life.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 she agreed to hit the hustings for a floundering
Congress Party. She appeared before adoring crowds who considered
her a brave widow with a magic name. Dressed in saris, she read
short speeches with the Hindi words typed out in Roman script.
</P>
<P>
   While this adventure in barnstorming did not prevent the BJP
from coming to power, it did show that Sonia Gandhi was the
Congress Party's best _ and perhaps only _ hope for a comeback. She
became the party's president in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, Congress won impressive victories against
the BJP in state elections, and its revival seemed almost
inevitable. But last April, Mrs. Gandhi, whose political instincts
had earlier been marked by prudence, unwisely helped topple the BJP
government without Congress having the votes in Parliament to
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   She then faced a rebellion within her own ranks as a few party
leaders questioned whether someone of foreign birth and scant
experience should be at the helm. Mrs. Gandhi resigned from the
party presidency, but then reconsidered after supporters pleaded
with her to stay and her detractors were expelled from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Now she finds herself in the midst of a short campaign season
with her Italian heritage being weighed against the Gandhi-family
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time in 14 years, she agreed to give
an in-depth interview, which will be televised Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   During the conversation, she insisted that she no longer feels
``one bit Italian.'' To the contrary, she said: ``I feel completely
Indian. I love India. I love the people here. India is in my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew that people find her Hindi hard to understand:
``Well, I do have this accent, and I don't blame people for making
fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sushma Swaraj is unlikely to accept these Indian bona fides.
``It's not hard to tell what this campaign is going to sound
like,'' said Jairam Ramesh, a Congress Party official. ``Sushma is
going to remind people that the button for India's nuclear weapons
is in the hands of the prime minister. She is going to ask, `Should
these hands be Italian?'''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Years back, Indian politics was a marvel of simplicity: Congress
always won. Now, no single party seems able to command a majority
in Parliament. Coalitions have to rule and these involve dozens of
smaller, state parties who often refuse to allow ideology to
interfere with their horse trading. In every election, the matter
of who's who and what's what is routinely turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming Parliamentary elections, Mrs. Gandhi's bloodlines
are one issue. Another is national defense. Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee's government has been enjoying resurgent popularity
since the Indian military bested hundreds of Pakistani-backed
soldiers in the remote mountains of Kashmir. Opinion polls are
predicting a decisive victory for Vajpayee and his BJP-led
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushma will know how to play up the defense angle,'' Ramesh
said. ``She is a great campaigner, full of life, full of
theatrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swaraj, 47, a lawyer and former socialist, joined the Hindu
nationalist BJP in 1984 and rose to become the party's first
spokeswoman. When the party came to power last year, she was named
information and broadcasting minister. She was frequently in high
dudgeon over low necklines, criticizing the sexual intimations of
modern TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushma is the Phyllis Schlafly of India,'' remarked Rajiv
Desai, who has created the advertising for Mrs. Gandhi's campaign.
``She is the quintessential traditional Indian woman with the large
bindi on her forehead and the red powder in her hair, and they've
picked her to stand out against Sonia Gandhi's foreignness.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, that comes with some risks. Polls show that a large
majority of voters say that Mrs. Gandhi's birthplace is not an
important factor in their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daughter-in-laws are very important to the Indian family, and
Sonia is regarded as having been a model daughter-in-law,'' said
Rangarajan, the political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a significant minority _ perhaps a quarter of all
voters _ do say the ``foreigner issue'' matters to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, this is India, and Mrs. Gandhi is Italian,'' said
another analyst Pan Chopra. ``When the pistol sounds, she starts
the race lugging quite a burden.''

 &HT;    Drug use questions detract from Bush's message in Ohio
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Questions about illegal drugs dogged Texas Gov.
George W. Bush on Thursday as he brought his presidential campaign
to Ohio for two days of hunting for votes and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked about my background all I'm going to talk about
it,'' said Bush, 53, shortly after he arrived here. ``I told people
I made some mistakes years ago. I did some things when I was much
younger ... I've learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's answer, repeated several times later during a Columbus
news conference, marked a retreat from a fuller statement he made
earlier in the day in Roanoke, Va., as he confronted what appeared
to be the first real media crisis of his campaign for the
Republican nomination and, he hopes, president.
</P>
<P>
   In Roanoke, he said, in effect, that he had not used illegal
drugs in the past 25 years since 1974 when he turned 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only could I pass the background check and the standards
applied to today's White House, but I could have passed the
background check and the standards applied on the most stringent
conditions when my dad was President of the United States _ a 15
year period,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 years before his father became president in 1989 would
have taken him to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to give the fuller explanation in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   In Roanoke, Bush referred to a question he answered on Wednesday
about whether he would conduct background checks for his staff at
the White House and whether he could pass such a test.
</P>
<P>
   His answer about himself and his ability to go beyond the
current standards appeared to refer to normal FBI background
checks, which go back seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, however, requires the FBI to ask
applicants about drug use since their 18th birthday. Asked in
Columbus to state the he had not used illegal drugs since he was
18, Bush declined.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, Bush's campaign press secretary, said that all
presidential administrations ask potential staff members about drug
use dating back to their 18th birthday, but don't automatically
disqualify those who answer ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when Gov. Bush's father was president, the senior
Bush disqualified many applicants with drug use during a 15-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said some people may like his answer to the drug question
and others may not. ``If they don't they'll find somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't answer the question more directly, Bush
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to send a signal to children that whatever I may
have done is OK. I think people in the baby boomer generation ought
to stand up and say drugs destroy your life and using alcohol will
make it hard to realize the American dream. I think that's the
message politicians ought to be sending. That's the message I'm
sending.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that when it comes to questions about politicians'
private lives, ``I believe it's important to say enough is enough.
I don't want to participate in national politics if this is what
it's coming to.'' Even as he said he was drawing the line, Bush
picked his own spot to cross over it. When asked about drug use and
his service as a pilot in the Texas National Guard before 1974, he
said: ``I never would have done anything to jeopardize myself. I
got airborne and I got on the ground very successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up over Bush's possible drug use once again
interjected questions about a candidate's personal life into
presidential campaigns, as happened with Gary Hart's in 1988
campaign over alleged womanizing, and then-candidate Bill Clinton
in 1992 over charges of draft dodging and philandering.
</P>
<P>
   The drug use questions detracted from Bush's visit to The
Enrichment Association of Community Healing, a faith-based program
in a predominantly black east Columbus neighborhood. TEACH helps
neighborhood residents develop skills that move them from welfare
to work. TEACH President John H. Gregory said it is unfortunate
that prying into Bush's private life diverted attention from the
positive message Bush was trying to highlight.
</P>
<P>
   University of Dayton political scientist David Ahern said such
prying ``hasn't been appropriate for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that it isn't something that will sell
newspapers and the newspapers will hold on to it for dear life,''
said Ahern, who added that his indictment also applied to broadcast
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in an age of tabloid journalism,'' he said. ``It
really takes the politics out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, national chairman
for publisher Steve Forbes' Republican presidential campaign, said
Forbes has said he did not use illegal drugs.

   ``I think anytime a person runs for president of the United

subject to questions by the public,'' said Ohio Democratic Chairman
David Leland.

questions about Bush's private life are a ``sideshow.''

Ministries and to attend a fund-raiser organized by Alex
Arshinkoff, Summit County Republican chairman.

<P>
   DENVER _ The nation's largest Lutheran denomination voted
Thursday to enter a sweeping agreement with the Episcopal Church
under which the two churches, which together represent nearly 8
million American Protestants, would fully recognize each other's
members and sacraments, exchange clergy when needed and join in
missionary and social service projects.
</P>
<P>
   For the 5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, the vote Thursday morning by its top policy-making body,
the Churchwide Assembly, reverses a decision made two years ago in
which the assembly narrowly rejected a similar proposal for ``full
communion'' with the 2.4 million Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   The decision here on a proposal likened more to a marriage than
a merger, since both churches retain their creeds and structures,
is a boost for an ecumenical movement among Protestants that had
been waning in recent years. It also demonstrates a growing
willingness among Christian leaders to establish closer, formal
ties despite the increasing religious pluralism in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote will probably be felt far beyond the United States,
encouraging closer cooperation between Lutherans and Anglicans in
Europe, Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate Thursday morning, the Rev. Ishmael Noko, a
Lutheran from Zimbabwe who is general secretary of the Lutheran
World Federation, an association of 128 churches with about 60
million members in 70 countries, told the voting members that
whatever they decided would also affect ``sister churches'' around
the globe. He predicted that full communion agreements would be
established between the fast-growing Lutheran and Anglican churches
in Africa within five years.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason cited by Lutheran and Episcopalian supporters of
the proposal was that it would allow the denominations to pool
resources, particularly in rural and inner-city areas where
congregations are often small and financially hard pressed. An
important provision would allow a clergy member in one denomination
to be fully accepted for work in the other _ to fill a vacancy, for
instance, or to take charge of two struggling churches of different
denominations that could not alone afford a pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Called to Common Mission,'' the proposal for full communion
with Episcopalians, passed by a vote of 716-317 _ 69 percent to 31
percent, and 27 votes more than the necessary two-thirds majority
_after three days of often contentious discussion at the Colorado
Convention Center here, where the assembly has been meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is subject to the approval of the Episcopalians, at
their next General Convention in July 2000. The Episcopal Church
passed the previous proposal for full communion by a majority of
about 95 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the pact with Episcopalians was not the only
full-communion agreement that Lutherans approved Thursday. Earlier,
the assembly adopted a proposal for full communion with the
49,000-member Moravian Church in America, a Protestant denomination
that traces its roots to the followers of Jan Hus, a 15th-century
leader and critic of the established church.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement, too, will be felt overseas, as a majority of the
world's Moravians, and millions of Lutherans, live in southern
Africa. The Lutherans' full communion with the Moravians takes
effect immediately, because it has been approved by the Moravian
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we made history in these two remarkable ecumenical
relationships,'' said the Rev. H. George Anderson, the Lutherans'
presiding bishop, the church's top official.
</P>
<P>
   The votes were the second time the Evangelical Lutheran Church
has moved to enter a series of full communion agreements. In 1997,
the church forged pacts with three denominations in Protestantism's
Reformed wing: the Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Church of
Christ and the Reformed Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   By reaching out to Episcopalians on Thursday, the Lutherans were
positioning themselves as the bridge church in Protestantism,
placing themselves at the center of a nexus linking church
traditions that emerged from the 16th century Reformation.
Episcopalians do not have full communion agreements with those
other Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   A strong supporter of the agreement with Episcopalians, Bishop
Stephen Bouman of the Lutheran Church's Metropolitan New York
Synod, said, ``The first thing I'm going to do is call up Bishops
Grein and Walker and tell them we have work to do together.''
Bishop Richard Grein leads the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and
Bishop Orris Walker is in charge of the Episcopal Diocese of Long
Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for full communion with the Episcopal Church has
been deeply controversial among Lutherans. Although the two
churches are close in matters of theology and liturgy, and both
ordain women, they have had significant differences over the role
and authority of bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Many who opposed the full communion proposal said it would
require them to embrace an idea of church hierarchy outside
American Lutheranism, the concept of the ``historic episcopate,'' a
belief among Episcopalians that their bishops represent an unbroken
line of church leadership extending to the earliest days of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The Lutheran denomination does have bishops, but they are
elected for six-year terms and are often regarded primarily as
administrators, returning to being pastors after their terms end.
By contrast, Episcopal bishops are elected for life, sit as a
separate governing body in their church's convention and play a
more visible role in public events of the church, confirming
adolescent members and ordaining priests and deacons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In approving the full communion proposal, Lutherans agreed that
their bishops would become part of the historic episcopate, such
that each time a new bishop is elected, he or she will be installed
in a ceremony at which at least three bishops, already in the
historic episcopate, lay their hands in prayer on the head of the
new bishop, symbolically passing on an ancient authority. In
addition, Lutherans agreed that a bishop would preside at the
ordination of pastors, a condition that has not previously been
required.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour debate that preceded the vote, dozens of
people spoke about the proposal. Those against it generally cited
their opposition to the historic episcopate, while those who
supported it often appealed to the ideal of Christian unity. Bishop
Roy Riley of New Jersey, a supporter of the agreement, said
Lutherans in his state number only 82,000 out of a population of 8
million. Citing growing Muslim and Hindu communities in New Jersey,
he said, ``We need partners.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading opponent of full communion with the Episcopalians, the
Rev. Roger Eigenfeld of Mahtomedi, Minn., said that those who had
fought the proposal would stay in the church and ``wanted to sit
down and talk'' with Anderson about how it would work. The bishop
will travel next month to Minneapolis, a center of much of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of a denomination,'' Eigenfeld said. ``There was
never an intention that we would split.'' Another leading opponent
of the proposal, the Rev. Brad Jensen of Duluth, Minn., said that
the Lutherans who voted in the minority needed to take the decision
in a spirit of ``Christian love.'' But he also said that a word he
had heard used to describe people who opposed the proposal,
``fearful,'' was objectionable and would not promote healing in the
church.

<P>
   GOLCUK, Turkey _ With almost every building either toppled or
twisted and the air reeking of garbage and decaying bodies, this
town of 80,000 has been a nightmare since Turkey's vast earthquake
on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday people here confronted a new catastrophe: the
relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a coordinated plan or anything resembling a
crisis-management center, tens of thousands of volunteers from
around Turkey arrived Thursday, outnumbering residents and promptly
creating bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   The highway into Golcuk was backed up 20 miles all day long,
often blocking ambulances and rescue equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds if not thousands of trucks brought bottled water and
bread, far more than local residents could consume. But despite a
total loss of piped water and electricity, no one thought to bring
portable toilets, generators or tents.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish naval base here, where as many as 200 sailors and
officers were killed, set up a civilian crisis center to coordinate
relief, but because it is in the center of town, most of the trucks
cannot get close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much help made a mess here,'' said Sabre Ozcan, a manager
at Istanbul's municipal water company, who found his own trucks
hopelessly bogged down. ``But you can't stop people from coming
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The time available to extract survivors from the rubble is
dwindling rapidly. Even Thursday , 2 1/2 days after the earthquake,
rescue workers could still hear voices through the debris. A
handful of people were pulled out alive Thursday, but workers at
many sites were stymied by the wrong equipment or simply no
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard voices several hours ago,'' said Vilmaz Atilla, who
was among those digging out an apartment building that had buried
six of his relatives and as many as 100 other people. ``But we
can't get at them, and it is getting dark. If we had a power
generator, we could work through the night. But we don't, and by
tomorrow it will be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Few cities were as utterly devastated as Golcuk. All but a
handful of its buildings were severely damaged. Every resident is
now homeless.
</P>
<P>
   All over town, clusters of survivors hold vigils as rescue
workers dig out bodies and occasional survivors from hundreds of
collapsed apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The city echoes with piercing sirens and the throb of
helicopters overhead. Cement dust covers everything and everyone,
but most people are understandably reluctant to use the plentiful
bottled water for washing.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as all that is, the utter chaos of Turkey's rescue
and relief efforts is making things much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Many civilians angrily complained that the Turkish military had
been less concerned about rescuing residents than about rescuing
sailors at the naval base. Bulldozers and earth-moving equipment
started excavating at the base almost immediately after the
earthquake, but many civilians had to beg or even hijack government
equipment as late as Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Izmit with tears in my eyes, begging for a crane,''
said Semsi Kilia, an electrical engineer, referring to the
provincial capital nearby. ``They said that this came from God, and
that the destruction was over such a wide area that they couldn't
move any faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilia managed to talk government officials into releasing one
construction crane on Tuesday but watched in anger as equipment
rolled through Golcuk and on to other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents said they had blockaded truck convoys and then
persuaded drivers to start using the equipment right here.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Golcuk had plenty of aid but much of it the wrong
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Army infantry units marched through town to help in relief
efforts, but the soldiers carried nothing more than shovels.
Tractor-trailers came loaded with excavation equipment, but the
roads were too paralyzed for many to get through. Ambulances and
other high-priority vehicles were obstructed at every turn, even
though police officers labored mightily to preserve an open lane on
the highway for them.
</P>
<P>
   International relief workers arrived from Israel, Russia and
Western Europe, but found no one to give them any clear orders or
supply translators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told they needed water here, but I can't give it
away,'' said the driver of a truck carrying bottled water donated
by an Istanbul textile company. ``I feel guilty because I know that
there are other towns that probably need it. But now we're stuck
and can't move anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos and confusion became even worse after the sun went
down.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Golcuk's residents had left and gone to villages in the
nearby mountains. Those who remained rigged shelters from scrap
wood and fabric and tried to prepare dinner without ovens or
stoves.
</P>
<P>
   With free space sparse, many prepared to sleep along roads that
were deafening with sirens, horns, shouting and the normal rumble
of engines.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, though stunned by the influx of volunteers, were
nonetheless grateful at the outpouring of help from all directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident has created a great deal of solidarity,'' said
Irfan Misirli, a grandfather who stood by an excavation site where
several family members were buried.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Nich who had packed up his car but could not get out
of town, said, ``It is a little disorganized, but we have received
all kinds of aid from almost every city in Turkey.''

CONSUMER SPENDING BOOSTS US TRADE DEFICIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US trade deficit climbed to a new high in June as voracious
American consumers riding a strong economy bought cheap imports
from China, Japan, and Latin America at record rates.
</P>
<P>
   According to US Commerce Department figures released Thursday,
goods and services purchased from other countries exceeded exports
by $24.6 billion in June, shocking analysts who had expected the
gap to be $4 billion smaller. The June figure is up from $21.2
billion in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a product of a very strong US economy and one that
doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon,'' Rick Egelton,
deputy chief economist at Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank in
Toronto told Bloomberg News. It's an economy that's ``sucking in
imports at a tremendous rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first six months of the year, the trade deficit
totaled $118.1 billion. That is up from $75.3 billion during the
first six months of 1998, and leaves the deficit on course to top
last year's record of $164 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While the news is a symptom of seemingly endless domestic
prosperity, the dollar tumbled in world markets as foreign
merchants sold off dollars for their own currencies. The falling
dollar sparked fears of inflation, triggering a 28-point decline in
the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 10,963.84. The
falling currency also signals an almost certain interest rate hike
when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tightening in August is pretty much locked in,'' Michael
Englund, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS in Belmont,
Calif., told Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the deficit, economies around the world,
weakened by Asia's economic collapse and a slowdown in Europe, made
imports cheaper at a time when demand in the United States was
growing, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists differ over what the deficit portends for the
nation's economic health. Some say burgeoning trade deficits cannot
be endured long-term because they must be financed by inflows of
foreign capital in the form of purchases of US stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are borrowing as a nation to consume so it does raise a
long-term financing question,'' Clyde Prestowitz Jr., president of
the Economic Strategy Institute, told the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Prestowitz acknowledged people have been warning of a calamity
from a growing trade deficit since the early 1980s, when the trade
deficit was about one-tenth as large as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists say the current high trade deficit is a
reflection of US prosperity, and American consumers' huge taste for
cheaper foreign goods has helped keep inflation in check during a
period of long expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surge of US imports is healthy for the world economy,''
KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland told the Post. ``Imports are acting
as a safety valve for the US economy, venting powerful domestic
demand pressures, thereby thwarting the return of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   US exports did grow slightly to $78.4 billion during the month,
led by gains in exports of cars, food, and industrial supplies. But
the 3.9 percent surge in imports overwhelmed those gains as
Americans spent a record $103 billion on foreign goods, mostly
computers, cellular phones, imported cars, and industrial supplies,
the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Deficits with Japan and China both widened in June. The gap with
Japan grew to $6.3 billion from $5.3 billion in May. The deficit
with China increased to $5.7 billion from $5.3 billion the month
before.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit with members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries rose to $2 billion from $1.6 billion in May and
$633 million in June 1998. The United States imports more than half
its crude oil.

DEMONSTRATION AGAINST MILOSEVIC SHOWS DIVISIONS AMONG OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also YUGOSLAVIA-SCENE) 
(rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Tens of thousands of people gathered on a
hot Thursday night in front of the federal Parliament to demand the
resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic, but they heard an
extremely mixed set of messages from rival leaders of the
democratic opposition here on how to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of at least 50,000 people _ some estimates exceeded
100,000 _ represented the largest anti-Milosevic rally since NATO's
air war against Yugoslavia, which forced Belgrade's troops out of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition's rivalries and clashing strategies were also
on display, with the drama of the night being the effort of Vuk
Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, the largest
party in the opposition, to hijack a rally he had sworn he would
not attend.
</P>
<P>
   In a clumsy bit of political fakery booed by many in the crowd,
Draskovic, who had withdrawn his name from the list of speakers,
essentially crashed the rally, coming on stage surrounded by
bodyguards, in response, he said, to the demands of his supporters
in the crowd. His ploy was an almost exact re-creation of a sudden
appearance by Milosevic at a rally on the same spot 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Draskovic was almost forced by the size of the turnout to
attend, he also criticized many of the ideas of other opposition
leaders, saying that early elections under fair conditions were the
only sensible way to change Serbia and finally oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic commands more voters than any other opposition
politician, up to 18 percent of the vote in recent polls, more than
those who favor the parties of Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians had been wary of calling a rally in
sophisticated Belgrade, where huge street protests against
Milosevic in 1996 an 1997 failed to bring him down. But the numbers
Thursday night were enough to give the opposition a lift, showing
the disgust of many people at their current isolation and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But the people are also disillusioned by the divisions among
opposition leaders, they said, and those divisions were on clear
display.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the rally, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the
Group 17, a set of economists and professionals, are calling for
Milosevic to resign and appoint a transitional government of
experts to serve for a year and then organize new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, Draskovic's
prime rival, called for Milosevic and the government to resign
within 15 days or face mass protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are still there after 15 days, then Serbia will go out
into the streets, not only in Belgrade, but in all towns, in 50
towns on the same day,'' Djindjic said. ``Everybody will go out
into the streets with one single message _ we will stay here until
you go. It's either Milosevic or Serbia, there can be no third
solution. This time we will go to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic heaped scorn on the idea of a transitional
government of experts _ ``of people no one had heard of a week
ago'' _ and said that it was clear now that Milosevic would never
agree to it. Draskovic also scoffed at the idea of a new government
formed in the streets, through civil unrest, saying: ``It's dust in
the eyes of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic then called for early elections in November, as
Milosevic's spokesmen are themselves suggesting, in their own
effort to divide the opposition. Draskovic then urged street
pressure to ensure early elections if Milosevic does not grant
them.
</P>
<P>
   And he called on ``all responsible leaders of the opposition''
to support his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker for the Alliance for Change called for a new
demonstration in Belgrade on Aug. 28, while another, for the Group
17, called for a new demonstration here on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the rally, Zoran Stankovic said: ``The only real message
is change. It's time for this government to go.'' But he said that
Milosevic only benefited ``when the opposition leaders speak in so
many voices.''
</P>
<P>
   One important political leader of the Alliance for Change
coalition, Nenad Canak, leader of the League of Social Democrats of
Vojvodina, said in an interview: ``The rally was fine concerning
the number of people and their energy. But it was not OK in terms
of the absence of vision, of how to focus this energy in a serious
way.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rallygoers gathered, government officials continued to
float the idea of early Serbian elections, perhaps as early as the
first week of November, creating further divisions among the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Change is not ready for elections and not
especially eager for them, so the government would be calling its
bluff. Draskovic, however, favors early elections to capitalize on
his better polling numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But new elections would not affect the position of Milosevic,
whose single, four-year term as Yugoslav president runs through
July 2001. While the opposition is calling for his resignation or
removal, early elections may divert the population from that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Normally elections for the Serbian Parliament and municipalities
would take place in 2001, while federal parliamentary elections
would take place in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for the self-styled ``democratic
opposition'' to oppose new elections, though its leaders would like
supervision of any vote by outside observers from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and a freer, more open
media, especially television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections are the best way to sober political drunks,''
Milosevic's party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, said Thursday. ``Our
stand is that there are many more important things than elections.
But if the other political parties say elections are necessary, we
are ready to go to elections. But they want to come to power
without elections.''

HAMILTON FEELING COMPETITIVE FOR MT. WASHINGTON CLIMB 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It might be early in the morning, and it might be hot, but Tyler
Hamilton will have plenty to smile about when he prepares to
bicycle up Mt. Washington Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Hamilton won the race two years ago, and set a
course record with his time of 51 minutes 56 seconds. For another,
he just got home from Copenhagen, where he won the Tour of Denmark
five-day stage race that finished Sunday. Hamilton took the lead
when he won the time trial last Saturday, 50 seconds better than
Denmark's Rolf Sorensen. Hamilton finished 13th in last month's
Tour de France, won by US Postal Service teammate Lance Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's race, which starts at 7:30, covers 7.6 miles with a
12-percent grade. Riders don't win anything _ just a medal that
shows they finished _ unless the course record is broken. The man
or woman who accomplishes that is given an Audi.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how he finishes, Hamilton will stay on the move. He is
scheduled to fly to Chicago Sunday to ride in the national
criterium championships, then return home briefly before heading
back to Europe to race in the three-week Tour of Spain, followed by
the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who lives in Spain for part of the year but is from
Brookline, Mass., said being back in the States is good because he
can be with his wife, Haven. And when he goes on training rides,
he's gotten more attention as he pedals through Littleton and
Concord, Mass., out to Wachusett Mountain and back. ``I guess
because people notice the Postal Service jersey,'' he said. `But it
doesn't feel normal, because I'm never here. So it's still hard
because I can't really kick back, I still have important races to
do.''

 BELGRADE: without elections. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vojislav Seselj, leader of the ultra-nationalist Radical Party
that now helps rule both Serbia and Yugoslavia, said separately
Thursday that he favored early elections to resolve Serbia's
post-Kosovo troubles. He said there was no agreement with other
ruling parties to call them, but there was a deal to hold them if
the opposition wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are even going so far as to say, `Let the opposition
parties name a date for the elections and we will call them,''' he
said. Seselj then suggested that local elections come first _ since
the opposition has its only power base in cities across Serbia won
in local elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They only took their seats after massive street protests against
election fraud forced Milosevic to back down _ while saving his own
seat, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's power base is the city of Belgrade, with its
powerful television station, Studio B. His rivals believe he would
do almost anything to retain the station.
</P>
<P>
   So to divide the opposition further, government officials leaked
a story that Draskovic had secretly met Milosevic on Monday to
discuss early elections and to agree not to speak at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic angrily denied the entire story, as did his top aides,
one of whom said ``it would be idiotic'' to have had such a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic aides suggested the leak was from Djindjic. Whatever
the truth, the leak succeeded in further poisoning the
relationship, if that were possible, between Draskovic and
Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is a master political tactician,'' said one senior
Alliance official . ``He's great at changing the subject and buying
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, early elections are a serious risk for Milosevic. The
government, whose support is weak after the loss of Kosovo, could
lose its majority in the Serbian Parliament if the opposition could
ever mount a united, professional campaign. And there is said to be
a debate inside the government about the wisdom of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior government officials privately expressed confidence
Thursday that they would win a majority or could create one,
despite all their problems, while some senior opposition officials
also believe, with despair, that Milosevic, his wife and Seselj
could retain power in a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting longer, until winter bites hard and the country is
inevitably short of heat and electricity due to inefficiency,
sanctions and NATO airstrikes, could only harm the government's
standing.
</P>
<P>
   The government had made various efforts, both subtle and crude,
to cut down the size of the rally. Wednesday night, state
television announced the arrest of a Montenegrin man possessing ``a
highly explosive device'' with a timer and warned of other possible
bombing attacks at ``massive public gatherings,'' urging caution to
citizens and especially to parents.
</P>
<P>
   The government ordered the payment of overdue pensions for
Thursday and moved the televising of a popular lottery program from
Saturday night to Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the police did not interfere with what was a peaceful rally,
and they were not much in evidence, though riot police were
stationed in buildings should they have been needed.

<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Thursday that
a New York Times article about corruption in Bosnia left readers
with the misimpression that $1 billion in foreign aid had been
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In lengthy remarks at his daily briefing at the State
Department, Rubin said that the article, which appeared on the
front page of The Times on Aug. 17, referred to a report that does
not exist and lumped together money lost by foreign aid agencies
with far larger sums lost either through misuse of Bosnian public
funds or uncollected taxes.
</P>
<P>
   During the briefing, Rubin said that The Times article had hurt
the Clinton administration's efforts to gain support for foreign
aid in Congress because people had drawn the conclusion that an
enormous amount of foreign aid money had been lost in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rosenthal, The Times' foreign editor, said: ``The article
drew a distinction, although perhaps not forcefully enough, between
foreign and Bosnian public funds. Rubin contacted us about a long
list of what he considered to be factual errors in our article.
After a lengthy review, we decided to print a correction of a few
errors in tomorrow's Times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing Mr. Rubin said or our review caused us to question the
basic premise of the article, which is that investigators in the
Office of the High Representative in Bosnia believe that widespread
corruption has taken place,'' Rosenthal said. ``These conclusions
were contained in many thousands of pages of bound volumes from
which American investigators attached to the OHR read to our
correspondent during an interview in Sarajevo.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Stiglmayer, the OHR spokeswoman, was quoted by The
Associated Press on Wednesday as saying that the report in The New
York Times was ``largely correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Paul Klein, who heads the U.N. mission in Bosnia, wrote
an article for the Sarajevo publication Dnevni Avaz on June 16
saying that ``hundreds of millions'' in the local currency,
exchangeable for German marks, ``are disappearing from public funds
every year.'' Klein also referred to a ``Federation Financial
Police report containing a weighty 4,000 pages of evidence'' about
corruption in the canton of Tuzla.

   CORRECTION:
</P>
<P>
   The opening paragraph of a front-page article on Tuesday about
an international investigation of widespread corruption in Bosnia
referred incompletely to the losses estimated at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   According to the anti-fraud unit of the Office of the High
Representative, which is the international agency helping to carry
out the 1995 peace agreement for Bosnia, at least $20 million of
that total was in foreign aid from a variety of countries. But the
vast majority of the money was either stolen from Bosnian public
funds or lost through Bosnian officials' failure to collect taxes,
either through corruption or mismanagement. These specifics
appeared later in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Those conclusions, among others, were drawn from thousands of
pages of case files prepared by the Federation Financial Police, a
Bosnian law-enforcement agency supervised by the Office of the High
Representative. Two American members of the anti-fraud unit of the
Office of the High Representative discussed the case files with a
correspondent for The Times and read from them during an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The article also referred imprecisely to a file of 4,000 pages
that dealt with Tuzla. The jurisdiction covered was the Canton of
Tuzla, not the city, which is part of the canton.
</P>
<P>
   Through an editing error, the article also characterized the tax
revenues of the Muslim-Croat Federation incorrectly. It indeed
raises revenue, but falls short of its budget.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial, based on the article, also referred imprecisely to
the loss of $1 billion. It should have said that total included
Bosnian public funds along with international aid.

MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER ADMITS TEXAS STUDENT IS HIS
DAUGHTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican voters, who will choose a president next
year in the most democratic elections ever held in this country,
are getting a chance early in the campaign to decide how much they
care about candidates' personal transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida Ochoa, a leading contender for the governing
party's nomination, acknowledged Thursday that he has a daughter
out of wedlock and that her mother works in the Mexican consulate
in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said Labastida, 57, admitted that he is the
father of Paloma Labastida, a 21-year-old student at the University
of Texas at El Paso, in response to a report that appeared
Wednesday in Norte newspaper in Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican border
town directly across from El Paso. Labastida was never married to
her mother, Alma Rosa Chavira, who works in the consulate providing
support services for Mexicans in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chavira was transferred to the consulate in February of this
year, three months before Labastida resigned from his job as
interior minister, the most powerful cabinet post, and announced
his run for the presidential nomination from the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. She and her daughter had been living
in Mexico City, according to university registration records in El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   While four contenders are vying to represent the PRI, Labastida
is believed to be President Ernesto Zedillo's choice for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in his campaign said Labastida's wife and other
children have long known that Paloma was his daughter, and he has
maintained a ``close relationship'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognized that daughter many years ago. That's why she has
his last name,'' one campaign official said. He said that Labastida
had taken pains to keep her existence from the public at the
request of Ms. Chavira.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said that Ms. Chavira had a long career
working for the government and denied that Labastida had used his
influence to secure her a public job, or pressured her to leave
Mexico in advance of his primary run.
</P>
<P>
   But the Foreign Relations Ministry, which sent Ms. Chavira to El
Paso, did not provide any information about Ms. Chavira's career or
qualifications for work in the consulate. The ministry referred all
questions to the consul in El Paso, Armando Ortiz Rocha, who said
he said he knew nothing about Ms. Chavira's professional
background.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that she is a ``serious, honest and highly efficient
employee.'' He added that he knew of no special circumstances
surrounding her transfer to El Paso and said she receives the same
salary, about $3,000 a month, as other employees at the lowest rung
of the consulate's administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ms. Chavira had been the victim of ``persecution by
unscrupulous journalists.''He said a report by the newspaper Norte
that he had threatened to fire employees who discussed Ms.
Chavira's presence was ``absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norte reporter, Rafael Nunez, discovered in a brief
telephone conversation with Ms. Chavira that she, in contrast to
virtually all other consular officials, did not speak English. In
response to a direct question from Nunez, Ms. Chavira denied that
she had a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Paloma Labastida left blank the sections of her university
registration form where she was asked to give the names of her
father and mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when Mexican presidents enjoyed the absolute power
of monarchs during their single six-year terms and hand-picked
their own successors, extra-marital affairs, and mixing private and
public business, were considered routine prerogatives. One former
president, Jose Lopez Portillo, installed his lover, Rosa Luz
Alegria, in a cabinet position.
</P>
<P>
   But as the voters' influence has grown, top-ranking Mexican
politicians have become more discreet. Zedillo leads a quiet family
life out of public view.

 &HT;    Bush edges closer to answer on cocaine
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, moving the line in the sand
but declining to erase it, got more specific Thursday about when he
didn't use illegal drugs but continued to refuse to say when _ and
if _ he ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Roanoke, Va., Bush, now 53, indicated he has not
used illegal drugs since he was 28. Beyond and before that, he's
not saying. Bush has acknowledged he drank too much until he gave
it up at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 20 years ago, I did some things. ... I made some mistakes
and I learned from those,'' Bush said. ``That's all I intend to
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, possession of cocaine in Texas was a second-degree
felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the drug question has become the first thing in his
presidential campaign to compete with the message of compassionate
conservatism he is presenting to supporters and contributors at
events across the country. The drug question has become a drumbeat,
with reporters asking it repeatedly in recent days at news
conferences, on talk shows and in editorial columns _ even though
no one has produced evidence that Bush has ever used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   By not answering, Bush hopes to change the tone and tenor of
American politics, though he acknowledged that it ``may cost me
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to tell people that we need to clean up the
process,'' Bush said Thursday. ``I am going to tell people that the
politics of personal destruction has got to end. I am going to tell
people I made mistakes and that I have learned from my mistakes.
And if they like it, I hope they give me a chance. And if they
don't like it, they can go find somebody else to vote for _ that's
the wonderful thing about democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has steadfastly refused to answer questions about whether
he has ever used cocaine. But in the past two days, he has answered
some specific questions about whether he used cocaine during
certain times in his life.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush said he could meet the seven-year standard
currently used to measure prospective federal employees seeking
high-level security clearance. On Thursday in Virginia, Bush said
he could have been cleared under the background checks his father
used when he was president from 1989-1993. The elder Bush asked top
aides if they had used illegal drugs in the previous 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only could I have passed in today's White House, I could
have passed the standards applied under the most stringent
conditions when my dad was president, a 15-year period,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyden Gray, White House counsel for President Bush, said
Thursday the younger Bush _ an adviser to his father but never on
the government payroll _ was not asked to undergo a background
check while his father was president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was not disqualifying,'' Gray said of the
background check on drug use. ``There were legions of people in the
Bush administration who had used illegal drugs, but for whom it was
not disqualifying because it was in the distant past.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, when he begin a stint with the National Guard, Bush
signed a statement saying he had not been ``addicted to the use of
habit-forming drugs such as narcotics or barbiturates.''
</P>
<P>
   The persistent press questions about Bush's possible drug use
have become the first thing to force Bush to detour from the
message on which he wants to focus. That message includes a warning
to children to avoid drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be governor too, but you've got to make the right
choices,'' he told kids Thursday at a Roanoke youth center. ``When
someone says drugs are cool, you've got to say drugs are not
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   But in downtown Roanoke, the drug question was toted around by a
man with a one-word sign: ``Snort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just answer the question. Did you do it? Don't feed the
frenzy, just answer the question,'' the man yelled.
</P>
<P>
   The same advice came Thursday from Bruce Gronbeck, a University
of Iowa professor of communication studies, who said the drug
question will cloud Bush's campaign until he answers it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as journalists pursue it, as long as it is an issue,
it is going to dog him,'' Gronbeck said. ``And the longer it dogs
him, the more important it becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gronbeck said, however, that Bush will find a very forgiving
public if the answer to the drug question is a long-ago yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will forgive past transgressions, but they won't
forgive incompetency,'' he said, predicting that Bush will be seen
by some as an incompetent politician if he doesn't answer the
question in an effort to make it go away.
</P>
<P>
   All other major presidential candidates have said they have
never used cocaine. Most have not questioned Bush's refusal to
answer the question. Some have been more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Bush is making a big mistake in not settling
the issue and getting it behind him,'' said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch.
``Why not just say you didn't, if you didn't? And if he did, say
why, and how he overcame it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Texas voters, the story line is familiar. In the 1990
gubernatorial race, provoked by Democratic candidate Jim Mattox's
allegations, reporters continuously asked Ann Richards, who also
was seeking the Democratic nomination, if she had ever used
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, candid about her past as an alcoholic, steadfastly
declined to say whether she ever used illegal drugs. Richards won
the nomination and the election. In 1994, then-challenger Bush
declined to make the question an issue in his race against
Richards.

A LETHAL STRAIN OF DRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIA POSES HEALTH RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.D., Ill., Tenn., Ga., Mass., N.Y.)  (th) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 200 people in Minnesota and North Dakota
have become sick _ and four children have died _ over the past two
years after becoming infected with a drug-resistant germ that until
recently has been confined to hospitals and nursing homes, federal
health officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fatalities are the first to be reported in the United
States, and are worrisome because they suggest that a lethal strain
of staphylococcus aureus may threaten the public. It is not known
whether the germ has spread to other parts of the country, although
some cases were reported last year among youngsters in Chicago and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These serve as a warning sign, sort of like the canary in the
coal mine, that there may be problems that lie ahead,'' said Dr.
Tim Naimi, the medical epidemiologist who investigated the outbreak
for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal
agency whose headquarters are in Atlanta. ``It's sort of like an
old fox has gotten into a new and much larger henhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The germs exist in the nostrils and skin and can be passed
through hand-to-hand contact, but are typically harmless unless
they enter the body through a cut or a scrape, which enables them
to travel through the bloodstream and attack a variety of organs.
</P>
<P>
   There are drugs that kill the bacteria. But unless doctors have
tested for it, patients may not get treated in time. And because it
is difficult to tell when a patient is infected, the disease
control agency is urging health-care providers to obtain cultures
from people who may have illnesses caused by bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Naimi said parents should not be alarmed but should take
common-sense precautions, like cleaning out infected cuts, washing
hands frequently and seeking medical care if their children appear
sick.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts said the deaths, which are being reported in
Friday's issue of the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Report, were
a frightening development.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's scary,'' said Dr. Stuart B. Levy, director of the
Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts
University. Levy said it was particularly unsettling that robust
youngsters lost their lives, as opposed to newborns, the elderly or
people with immune disorders, who are more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have kids dying of staph aureus infection in our
communities,'' he said, ``it tells us there is something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the dead children were not made public, and
the disease control agency provided only sketchy details of their
cases. The children ranged in age from 1 to 13 and had a variety of
symptoms, including extremely high fever, rash, dangerously low
blood pressure and difficulty in breathing.
</P>
<P>
   All were treated in the hospital with very powerful antibiotics
that should have worked against the germs. But they did not because
the children's doctors had not expected to see infection with a
drug-resistant germ, and thus did not realize quickly enough that
the children needed such strong medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physicians were essentially blindsided,'' Naimi said,
``because this problem is so new.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims included a 7-year-old African-American girl from
urban Minnesota, who died in July 1997 after doctors diagnosed an
infection in her right hip joint that eventually spread through her
bloodstream to her lungs; a 16-month-old American Indian girl from
rural North Dakota who died in January 1998, two hours after being
admitted to a hospital with a fever of 105 degrees, dangerously low
blood pressure and a rash; a 13-year-old white girl from rural
Minnesota who died last January, seven days after she arrived at a
hospital coughing up blood, with pneumonia eating away at her lung
tissue, and a 1-year-old white boy from rural North Dakota who died
last February after suffering a lung infection that rapidly
developed into pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   That the cases were scattered across the two states and the
children are racially diverse suggests that the germ is widespread
across the region, Naimi said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the deaths the ``tip of the iceberg'' and said that at
least 200 other people, most of them children and healthy young
adults, had also been infected. Those cases were not included in
Friday's article and, because they were still being investigated,
he said he could not elaborate except to say that the patients had
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, experts have been warning that misuse of
antibiotics is creating a wave of drug-resistant bacteria, or
``superbugs,'' and that doctors are running out of medications to
control them. The current outbreak, experts say, is another another
unsettling example of that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting staph infections all the time,'' said Dr.
Joshua Lederberg, a leading expert in antibiotic resistance at
Rockefeller University in Manhattan. ``Habitually, we have just
reached for the nearest antibiotic. We haven't worried about it.
Now we have to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Staph is a common organism; about one in five people carry the
germ, and in most of them it causes no harm. The earliest cases of
drug-resistant staph infections were reported in hospitals in 1968
and were given the abbreviation MRSA, for Methicillin-Resistant
Staphylococcus Aureus. (Methicillin is a close cousin of
penicillin.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the bacteria became resistant to two large families
of drugs, the penicillin family and the cephalosporin family, which
together make up a class known as beta-lactam antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   If treated quickly enough, the germs will succumb to an
antibiotic called vancomycin, but doctors regard it as the drug of
last resort; they try to use it as infrequently as possible so that
germs do not develop resistance to it, too.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beta-lactams are the most widely used antibiotics, both in
outpatient clinics and in hospitals, Naimi said. By 1997, the
disease control agency said, half of all hospital-acquired staph
infections were resistant to these drugs, up from 2 percent in
1974. These infections often kill the hospital patients who acquire
them.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City alone, methicillin-resistant staph infection
killed 1,409 people in 1995, said a recent report by the Institute
of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most experts believed that only intravenous drug
users or people in hospitals or nursing homes became infected with
MRSA germs. But last year the Journal of the American Medical
Association published a study that documented cases of so-called
``community-acquired MRSA'' in otherwise healthy children in
Chicago. Naimi said there had also been recent cases in a day-care
center in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But Levy of Tufts University said some experts refused to
believe the reports. He gave a talk about the recent infections at
a conference of microbiologists in May, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people denied that it exists,'' he said, insisting that
the infected patients ``must have passed through a hospital at some
point.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the children who died in Minnesota and North Dakota had
visited a hospital or nursing home, Naimi said, nor did they have
any exposure to anyone who did.
</P>
<P>
   Naimi said the lethal bacteria appear to be a slightly different
strain from those typically found in health care institutions,
suggesting that the staph bugs did not escape from the hospital,
but rather mutated in the environment. ``We don't know how it
happened,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ Imports surged in June, driving the nation's trade
deficit to another record, as Americans, feeling flush in the
strong economy, continued to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit swelled to $24.6 billion, the Commerce Department
reported Thursday, an increase of 16.3 percent from the revised
figure for May. The sharp growth _ fueled by rising imports from
Japan, China, Western Europe and Mexico _ surprised many economists
who had predicted that the gap would begin to narrow because the
economies of Asia and Europe were growing stronger and recovering
from the economic turmoil of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Imports rose almost 4 percent, to $103 billion in June, topping
$100 billion for the first time. American exports, meanwhile, rose
by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trade report is the last significant economic report before
Federal Reserve policy-makers meet on Tuesday to debate whether
short-term interest rates should be raised to slow the economy and
prevent inflation from accelerating. While a widening trade gap can
be a drag on economic growth, the surge in imports shows that
consumers are continuing their spending spree while saving little,
a significant concern of the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors and Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to nudge
its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a point, to 5.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper imports have helped to keep prices low and inflation in
check, so far. But the dollar has been weaker of late, and many
economists contend that the spending spree on imports may help to
drive up consumer prices. And sustained record deficits could cause
the dollar's value to tumble further, making American stock and
bond markets less attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dollar extended a slide Thursday after the release
of the trade data. The dollar is now at a seven-month low compared
with the yen. Treasury prices and stocks also fell Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have as big of a deficit in one month as we once had in
an entire year,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, the president of the
Economic Strategy Institute, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar often falls with a widening trade deficit because
investors choose other markets when they see the deficit as a
portent of possible problems.
</P>
<P>
   The widening trade gap is also an economic measure that
Republicans may seize upon in this campaign season as evidence that
all is not well with the American economy. Sluggish exports are a
sign that American manufacturing is weak. And many American
laborers, like steelworkers and Midwestern farmers, consider the
widening gap as a bad omen for their personal futures.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on Capitol Hill, Catherine Mann, a senior fellow at
the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that
though the deficit had not yet created a crisis, it was clear, from
a long-term perspective, that ``the United States is living beyond
its means.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mann told the members of the Trade Deficit Review Commission
that the sustained rise in U.S. stock markets had caused investors
to feel more confident about the future value of their wealth and,
in turn, was prompting them to reduce the amount they save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are spending beyond their personal incomes,'' she
said. ``At some point in time, in my estimation roughly two years,
the rest of the world will say, `We're not so happy about lending
to you anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan deficit-review commission _ with members ranging
from Carla Hills, who was chief trade negotiator under President
Bush, to George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers Union
_ was created last year to study the causes and effects of the
trade gap. The commission plans to report on its findings after
holding hearings around the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statistics released Thursday, consumers snapped
up more foreign automobiles, computer accessories and diamond gems.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with China widened at a time when the Chinese may
soon try to resume talks with the Clinton administration in their
bid to join the World Trade Organization. The administration has
requested a study of how China's addition to the WTO would affect
the U.S. economy. The study is expected to be completed this month,
but a spokeswoman at the office of the U.S. trade tepresentative
said the report would most likely remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The total trade deficit for the first six months of the year was
$118 billion _ 57 percent higher than the cumulative gap for the
first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing in Washington Thursday, Charles Schultze, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, said the increasing
deficits could eventually lower Americans' standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not some catastrophe,'' Schultze said. ``It will
probably take care of itself, but in ways we don't like.''

BANK OF NEW YORK AGGRESSIVELY COURTED RUSSIAN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bank of New York, in an effort to expand a
lucrative business in Eastern Europe over the last several years,
aggressively pursued relationships with many of Russia's largest
banks, a strategy that might have contributed to embarrassing
questions about money laundering that the bank now faces.
</P>
<P>
   The bank specialized in setting up cash and securities accounts
for Russian banks in the United States, a higly competitive market
that the bank dominated, according to American bankers and
financial analysts. The accounts allowed Russian institutions, many
of which collapsed last year beneath piles of debt and speculative
investments, to easily transfer money outside of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At first, doing business with Russian banks seemed like a
fruitful new business. But now the bank is under federal
investigation for channeling billions of dollars through accounts
in what is suspected to be a major money laundering operation by
Russian organized crime, law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said Wednesday that it has been cooperating with the
investigation, which involves the use of bank facilities to
transfer funds from Russia to other countries. The bank said there
are no allegations of wrongdoing and declined to comment further.
It also suspended two senior officers pending the outcome of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bank entrusted responsibility for much of the fast-growing
business in Eastern Europe to Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a
senior vice president whom federal investigators believe to be at
the heart of a money laundering scandal inside the bank. Ms.
Kagalovsky, who was one of the employees suspended Wednesday, has
not been accused of any crime. But it remains unclear whether there
was wrongdoing by her or other individuals, and how adequately the
bank supervised their activities and their Russian customers.
</P>
<P>
   One of her best customers was Inkombank, a fast-growing Russian
bank that transacted more than 250 payments a day through the Bank
of New York. Inkombank brought its business to the Bank of New York
from the Republic New York Corp. in 1992, because Ms. Kagalovsky
promised to be less vigilant than Republic about the way in which
Inkombank's accounts were handled here, according to Emanuel E.
Zeltser, a former attorney for Inkombank.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky assured Inkombank's representatives that ``Bank
of New York would be much more understanding about how to manage
correspondent accounts than Republic,'' Zeltser said. Republic
officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank of New York was very happy with the money Natasha and
Galitzine were making and routinely let them run their own show,''
Zeltser said referring to Ms. Kagalovsky and Vladimir Galitzine,
another Bank of New York officer. Bank of New York said Galitzine
was unavailable for comment. An individual familiar with the
investigation of the bank said that Galitzine has not been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined who at the bank supervised Ms.
Kagalovsky. The bank declined comment further, and Ms. Kagalovsky
was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Ms. Kagalovsky, the wife of Konstantin
Kagalovsky, a prominent Russian banker and oil executive, was a
vociferous and active cheerleader in pushing Bank of New York to
expand its presence in Russia in the early and mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 memo to Thomas Renyi, who was then the president of
the bank and is now the chief executive, Ms. Kagalovsky and another
executive made note of how important one Russian bank, Inkombank,
was to the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inkombank is our largest generator of fee income, and they are
now the largest clearing bank in Russia for domestic
transactions,'' the memo noted. The memo, which Bank of New York
declined to comment on, was given to The New York Times by Zeltser,
who said he acquired it as part of a lawsuit he has filed against
Inkombank over unpaid fees. Lawyers representing Inkombank declined
to comment about the bank's involvement with Bank of New York or
Zeltser's lawsuit.

 &HT;    Baseball greats to enter Braves Hall of Fame
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thirty-three years ago, Atlanta took possession of a
major league baseball franchise. Today, the Atlanta Braves
recognize what all that really means.
</P>
<P>
   The charter class of the Braves Hall of Fame will be inducted
this afternoon at Turner Field, left-hander Warren Spahn, third
baseman Eddie Mathews, right fielder Hank Aaron and right-hander
Phil Niekro all installed in the franchise's new tribute to its
past.
</P>
<P>
   For the club, the Hall of Fame is a place to show off more than
120 years of history spanning three cities, four ballparks and some
1,400 players who have worn a Braves uniform. Yet for the players,
a designated Braves hall means something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played for the Boston Braves, the Milwaukee Braves and when
the club moved to Atlanta, I felt like we were players without our
alma mater,'' said Spahn, 79. ``This makes me feel like we are a
part of the Braves organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The induction ceremony will be held in the park's monument grove
area and is expected to draw 400. The hall itself will be quartered
within the Braves Museum underneath the left field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Sports artist Bart Forbes was commissioned to produce oil
portraits of the first quartet, which will hang in the hall. Each
inductee will also be commemorated in a plaque to be installed in a
walkway leading into the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted to be one of the first people to be put in the
Braves hall of fame,'' said Spahn.
</P>
<P>
   The first class was a no-brainer. Though 42 players now in the
National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., played for the
Braves at one time, only four of those spent the bulk of their
careers with the organization. Those four were on the same
Milwaukee roster for just one season _ 1964 _ when the franchise
had ebbed from the championship teams of the late '50s and had
entered the financial slide that led to the move to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One name conspicuously missing from the group was removed by
special request. The team had originally included center fielder
Dale Murphy to go in with the same group but the two-time National
League MVP asked if his induction might be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Currently serving on a Mormon mission in Boston, Murphy would
not be able to travel to Atlanta for the ceremony and the Braves
agreed to put off his induction until 2000, when he could take
part.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the charter inductees will stand up against any
team in the majors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Aaron: Baseball's all-time home run king is in the midst of a
special celebration summer, commemorating the 35th anniversary of
his record 715th homer. Though 755 remains his most conspicuous
number, Aaron also set the all-time marks for games played,
at-bats, total bases and RBI while accumulating a .305 career
average. (Cooperstown election: 1982).
</P>
<P>
   _ Mathews: He piled up nine straight 30-home run seasons en
route to becoming just the seventh player ever to reach 500. No
other Brave played in Boston, Milwaukee and Atlanta and Mathews
later returned here to manage. Philadelphia's Mike Schmidt might
have passed him for most homers by a third baseman (548) but Ty
Cobb never told Schmidt he had a perfect swing. That's what he told
Mathews (Cooperstown election: 1978).
</P>
<P>
   _ Niekro: Originally a free agent who took eight years before
landing a spot in the rotation, Niekro's 314 wins rank him 14th on
the all-time list. He owns virtually every Atlanta pitching record
and for many of the dark seasons in club history, provided the best
reasons for fans to come to the park. He finished 44 games over
.500, perhaps his grandest accomplishment of all, given some of the
clubs he played with. (Cooperstown election: 1997).
</P>
<P>
   _ Spahn: No left-hander did it better, Spahn's 363 victories the
most recorded by any lefty in history. He won 20 games 13 times,
including a series of six straight 20-win seasons, and still holds
the NL mark for career innings (5,243 2/3). Both his no-hitters
came after his 39th birthday. Somehow, he won the Cy Young only
once. (Cooperstown election: 1973).
</P>
<P>
   This first group was selected by the Braves' front office,
though the selection and timing of the ceremonies are still in
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple things we have not determined yet,'' said
Bob Wolfe, the team's senior vice president for administration.
``One, we expect this to be an annual induction but we don't know
that we'll continue to do it in August each year. We might
ultimately determine that it's best to do it in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we also have to determine how to go forward with the
selection process. We just wanted to get this first one behind us
first.''
</P>
<P>
   And the timing of the first one couldn't be better, for some.

   ``I pull for 'em. I've got some favorites,'' Spahn said. ``I

always admired. And Greg Maddux is definitely my favorite pitcher

 &HT;    Graziani on hot seat
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The Falcons are going to keep three
quarterbacks on the final roster, and Tony Graziani is one of three
on the current roster.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to indicate that Graziani has a good chance to be
around to pick up his $325,000 salary this season. But he's not
assuming anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, (coaches) have less and less patience for you, and
if you don't get the job done, they'll find someone who will,''
Graziani said. ``I'm not the new guy they need to check out
anymore. I've been here three years, and it's time for me to step
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 215-pound reserve will get a chance Saturday night
against Baltimore. After starter Chris Chandler plays a possession
or two, the left-handed Graziani will get most, and perhaps all, of
the remaining time under center.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves has said Graziani is pressing Danny Kanell for
the right to backup Chandler. Graziani threw several nice passes
Thursday, but he's been erratic since training camp started July
29. ``I go out there and try to learn as much as I can,'' he said.
``It seems like every day ... something surprises me that
shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani added 12 pounds by working out between his rookie
season, when he was drafted in the seventh round out of Oregon, and
last year.
</P>
<P>
   He started at Carolina as a rookie but was pulled at halftime
after completing four of 18 passes in the rain. Two interceptions
helped the Panthers win 21-12. He finished the season with a 3.7
passer rating.
</P>
<P>
   In his one start last year, Nov. 29 at St. Louis, he directed an
11-play, 54-yard drive as the Falcons took a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But he finished 8-of-18 for 108 yards and again was pulled at
halftime. His final play, as the Falcons were driving, was an
ill-advised pass across the field _ off one of his many scrambles.
It was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani finished the season with a 42.4 passer rating. For his
career, his rating is 24.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be more consistent,'' he said. ``There's so much
to learn in this league that you've got to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, who has a career rating of 66.1 and 20 starts in three
seasons with the Giants, got lukewarm reviews after last Friday's
35-31 win over Detroit. Two interceptions stood out.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, it'll be Graziani's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those unspoken things everybody understands,''
Graziani said. ``In this business, if you don't get it done, you're
gone.''

REAL QUIET JOINS CLASSIC DROPOUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A leg fracture has made Real Quiet the latest
Horse of the Year contender to drop out of the Aug. 29 Pacific
Classic at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, a fracture in the splint bone behind the 4-year-old
colt's right shin, was discovered in X-rays after swelling appeared
following a workout Sunday morning at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very severe injury, certainly not
life-threatening,'' Eoin Harty, an assistant to trainer Bob
Baffert, said Thursday from Del Mar. ``But it'll put him out for at
least 90 days. He won't race again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Harty described the injury as ``no worse than breaking a
finger.'' Yet the timing prompted speculation owner Mike Pegram
will retire the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner in time
for the 2000 breeding season.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, whose biggest local victories came in the '97
Hollywood Futurity and the June 27 Hollywood Gold Cup, has won 6 of
20 starts and more than $3.2 million. He missed a $5 million Triple
Crown bonus when Victory Gallop beat him by a nose in the '98
Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, news of his injury came a week after Victory
Gallop was retired with a suspensory-ligament tear.
</P>
<P>
   Without Victory Gallop, Real Quiet and NTRA Champions on Fox
series points leader Behrens, the Pacific Classic figures to have a
small, all-Californian field. Mazel Trick looks like a heavy
favorite in the 1\-mile race against Bobby Frankel barnmate Barter
Town, Baffert-trained General Challenge and River Keen, and Malek.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens is passing up a shot at a $330,000 series bonus _ and
the $600,000 winner's share of the $1 million Pacific Classic purse
_ because trainer Jim Bond wants to keep him in the East before the
$4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park in Florida.

VENUS WILLIAMS PLANS TO DRESS FOR SUCCESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Venus Williams made a smash debut at the U.S.
Open, where she was the first unseeded finalist in four decades.
But last year, when she designed a different dress for each of her
seven possible matches, Williams fell a round short and never
unveiled the red, white and blue costume she aimed to wear in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   With the Open set to begin at the U.S. Tennis Association's
National Tennis Center on Aug. 30, Williams, who will be seeded a
career-best third with the recent retirement of Steffi Graf, is at
it again. While in search of her first Grand Slam title, she has
helped Reebok concoct seven dresses for the tournament, including a
one-shoulder outfit she designed herself.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the week hard at practice in Florida for her Open
tune-up next week in New Haven, Conn., the 19-year-old Williams
will put herself and some of her Open outfits on display at the
Official All-Star Cafe in Manhattan on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not she wins the Open, Williams said she intended to
wind down her 1999 season in October in order to sign on for a
semester of fashion design at a Florida college she would not name,
the better to keep the paparazzi in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday Williams said she hoped to be in the Open spotlight
from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be on top of your game and be ready, and, most of
all, mentally prepared,'' Williams said. ``I'm definitely trying my
best to get to No. 1; I'm definitely trying my best to win Grand
Slams. Both are high on my priority list.''

SAFETY OF FLORIDA'S STORM SHELTERS IS QUESTIONED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The very name _ shelter _ promises safety.
</P>
<P>
   When hurricane winds have buckled banana trees, the lights have
begun to flicker and the weather forecaster's voice has vanished
into static, countless Floridians have, over decades, abandoned
their coastal homes for the safety of schools and other sturdy
buildings farther inland.
</P>
<P>
   But now a draft report on the ability of those shelters to
withstand a strong hurricane, like the infamous Andrew in 1992, has
called into question just how safe the state's safe havens would be
if struck by winds of 155 miles an hour or more from a Category 3
or higher hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The report, conducted by the state and a private engineering
firm in Maryland, found that 95 percent of some 800 shelters tested
in coastal Florida failed to meet at least one standard on a
15-point safety check list.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, state officials said, that those structures
would buckle under a hurricane's wind. While some of the buildings
did fail inspection because their walls were not made of concrete
reinforced with steel, others failed because they had no storm
doors or were in areas that flood, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is in its beginning stages, is intended ``to
identify opportunities for improving buildings,'' said Craig
Fugate, bureau chief for preparedness and response for the Florida
Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors failed some shelters because of poor roof drainage _
which can cause a roof to cave in _ and others for problems like
being near nuclear power plants, proximity to trees and the absence
of a generator, important in case of a power failure.
</P>
<P>
   The initial draft of the report, which was made public in
Wednesday's issue of The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, has drawn a
heated response from some emergency management officials in
Florida's coastal counties, some of whom have said the study picks
nits and might cause undue alarm, perhaps even scaring people away
from shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials said they did not want people to
be in their cars along highways when a storm strikes because they
did not want to go to shelters closer to home. Even worse, the
officials said, is if people shun shelters altogether and stay in
their homes closer to the coast, in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shelters are like lifeboats,'' said Larry Gispert,
director of Emergency Management for Hillsborough County, on
Florida's west coast. ``They are not cruise ships. You're not going
to be comfortable. There will be crying babies, lots of shouting, a
lot of chaos and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. But it is a
safer alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Safer is the key word,'' added Gispert, whose shelters have
not yet been tested under the new guidelines. ``We're not going to
guarantee that the school's gymnasium roof won't blow off. We're
just providing a safer environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspections, based on Red Cross criteria, were not intended
to close down shelters but to identify problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the shelters inspected are just brick and glass school
buildings, built decades ago, said state officials. But newer
buildings, some built in the last decade under more rigid building
codes, also failed inspection. In Miami-Dade County, where
Hurricane Andrew led to a frenzy of new construction, 44 of the 62
shelters failed.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials said the initial draft was full of mistakes,
even identifying the wrong buildings as shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Florida's counties can each decide, in time of
emergency, which shelters to open. Around the state, emergency
management officials said that, despite the concerns raised about
their shelters, they would open them anyway, because they had no
choice.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, where all 19 shelters were found below
standard, officials denounced the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to still open up the facilities, '' said Paul
Melelli, Director of the Department of Public Safety in Palm Beach
County. ``We believe the shelters aren't unsafe.''

SURVIVORS LEAD CALLS TO PUNISH THE BUILDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TURKEY-QUAKE, TURKEY-GOLCUK.)

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Earthquake survivors are turning their anger
not at nature, but at the builders of high-rise death traps.
</P>
<P>
   In Yalova, a seaside resort near Istanbul, relatives and
neighbors of victims burned the car and stoned the house of a local
contractor, seven of whose 16 buildings collapsed when the
earthquake hit.
</P>
<P>
   The builder, who once boasted in an interview that he was able
to provide affordable housing by using cheap materials, dodged his
attackers and slipped away, according to local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Saddetin Tantan, the nation's interior minister,
joined the chorus, promising to bring harsh punishment against the
builders of shoddy housing and their friends in local city halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contractors who built those buildings and those who issued
permits committed murder,'' Tantan said in an interview in the
newspaper Hurriyet. ``The builders and the bureaucrats were
involved in organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake was not needed to expose the sorry state of
Turkey's urban construction, as many people are pointing out. It
has been an open secret that many apartment blocks in Istanbul and
other cities have been in violation of local housing codes, built
by contractors who skimped on materials, added on extra stories,
avoided soil tests and ignored earthquake-proof requirements.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report done by the Turkish Architects and
Engineers Association, more than half of all buildings in Turkey
fail to comply with construction requirements, even though 98
percent of the country's population lives in earthquake-prone
zones. In Istanbul, where the population has been growing at a rate
of almost half a million a year, the rate of noncompliance was
estimated at 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake in the early hours of Tuesday provided new
evidence of this pattern, in chilling detail. Some buildings in
Golcuk and Izmit, at the epicenter, were left standing, while
buildings in Western Istanbul, 60 miles away, across the Bosphorus
Straits, collapsed into pieces. In a dramatic example, a
seven-story building in Eskisehir, far from the epicenter on the
central Anatolian plain, fell to the ground, killing 26 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built factories and villas and apartment complexes in
Izmit, in Golcuk and other towns that were hit by the earthquake,''
said Ishak Alaton, founder of Alarko, a Turkish construction
company. ``There is not a single crack in any one of them.
Everything is perfect. This proves that if you use the right
equipment, materials and techniques, nothing happens, even in a
quake this bad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Turgut Oztas, an associate professor of applied
geology at the Istanbul Technical University, the quake, when it
reached Istanbul, probably registered a magnitude of 5.5, a
severity that buildings put up in compliance with earthquake codes
should easily have weathered. Yet about 100 buildings in Istanbul
collapsed, killing more than 400 people in the city.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 map shows Istanbul's hardest-hit districts, including the
neighborhood of Avcilar on the shore of the Sea of Marmara, to be
inside the highest risk zone, meaning that new construction should
have met the most stringent building codes.
</P>
<P>
   But Oztas, who joined a team of architects and engineers who
went to Avcilar on Tuesday to collect samples of crushed building
material, said he believed that, judging from the pulverized
concrete, it had been heavily diluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not with the regulations,'' Oztas said. ``The
problem is the breaking of the rules and regulations, which has
gone out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Many blame Turkey's voracious political system for the breakdown
in enforcement, as local officials, seeking votes for their
parties, grant favors to local contractors and housing to the
migrants who have streamed into Turkey's cities in the last
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Korhan Gumus, a director of the Human Settlements Association, a
group that has defended citizens' rights, puts part of the blame on
an uninformed public, which has never been made aware of the
dangers of cheap housing. ``The experts direct all their advice to
the government, which does not want to share it, and ignores the
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Geological Engineers Branch of the Turkish
Architects and Engineers Association, Oztas is one of many who have
repeatedly warned of the precarious state of Turkey's housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been speaking for several years but no one was
listening,'' he said. ``Unfortunately in Turkey it is not experts
who are guiding politics but politics who are guiding experts. In
Turkey, everything ends up in the hands of the politicians.''

TREASURIES FALL FOR FIRST TIME IN 4 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities fell Thursday for the
first time in four days, as traders reacted to the unexpected
widening in the nation's trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the price of a 30-year bond was down 13/32 to
101 12/32, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, up to 6.03 percent, from 6 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit deepened to $24.6 billion for June from $21.2
billion in May. Analysts had expected a narrowing, with a deficit
of $20.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders also reacted to the worsening deficit, sending
the dollar down against the yen, euro and most other currencies,
and that hurt investor demand for U.S. government securities,
especially among foreign investors who fear possible currency
translation losses when they sell their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The counterbalance to the day's weakness was that the Federal
Reserve was in the market as a buyer for the second consecutive day
Thursday, purchasing coupons with maturities ranging from Feb. 28,
2001, to May 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at IDEA Global.com, a
financial consulting firm, said that the trade report and the
weakening dollar did not have as much of an effect on Treasuries as
might have been expected because market participants limited their
trading ahead of next week's policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles expects the Fed to raise the federal funds rate that
banks charge each other for overnight loans by a quarter of a
percentage point and to lift the discount rate that the Fed charges
member banks by a similar amount. ``However, I don't see how a 5.25
percent federal funds rate is going to significantly alleviate the
imbalances the Fed is worried about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another report that traders were watching Thursday, the
Philadelphia Fed said that regional business activity indicated a
continued pick-up. Its index of general business conditions
increased to 12.0 in August from 7.8 the month before.

CLINTONS ARRIVE FOR ISLAND VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST TISBURY, Mass. _ Free from the tumult of personal scandal
that plagued his last visit, President Clinton Thursday returned to
the warm embrace of Martha's Vineyard for nine days of golf,
celebrity soirees, and a new summer endeavor: Hillary Rodham
Clinton's exploratory campaign for the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and daughter Chelsea arrived for their fifth
vacation at the island haven the same as they have for their
happiest sojourns: beaming, waving, anticipating sunset sails,
private strolls along stunning seascapes, and late-night laughs
with longtime friends.
</P>
<P>
   Like old times, hundreds of well-wishers cheered from behind
wooden barriers at the Martha's Vineyard Airport as Air Force One
touched down at 5:45 p.m., under a brilliant sun. For the Clintons,
who own no property, the Edgartown estate of Cambridge, Mass.
hotelier Richard L. Friedman has become the closest they have to a
home outside Washington, their summer White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to have a good time?'' Clinton asked reporters
aboard the presidential aircraft as the family's flight to the
Vineyard began at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' the president said, answering his own queston.
``That's our story and we're sticking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport crowd serenaded Clinton with ``Happy Birthday,''
before he was whisked off to celebrate his 53d birthday Thursday
night with his family and a dozen friends at the Chilmark summer
home of his longtime confidant and Washington lawyer Vernon E.
Jordan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reported guests were Maurice Tempelsman, former
companion to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; former Clinton budget
director Franklin Raines; NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol and his
wife, actress Susan Saint James; CNN correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault and her husband, Ronald Gault; investment banker
Steven Ratner and author William Styron.
</P>
<P>
   But there was immediate evidence that this vacation will be like
no other. As Clinton worked the crowd with his labrador Buddy, the
loudest cheer of the brief reception broke out for Mrs. Clinton,
whose blossoming political career is expected to doninate the
family's getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who last August was privately seething over her
husband's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, this year has positioned
herself as the Democratic frontrunner in the race to succeed
Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go, Hillary, go!' supporters shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, but she got more applause than the president,''
said Jenni Correia, 40, of Simsbury, Conn., who waited two hours
with her four children to meet the Clintons. ``We're all rooting
for her.''
</P>
<P>
   With the president in a supporting role, Mrs. Clinton is
scheduled to fly to Nantucket Friday to raise an estimated $100,000
for her campaign, one of six vacation fundraisers that are expected
to net $700,000. She will be honored on Nantucket Friday night by
the American Ireland Fund, a non-profit peace organization whose
recognition of Mrs. Clinton is expected to boost her standing with
New York's Irish American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's emergence in the political arena comes in the
eclipse of her husband's lame-duck presidency. But Clinton, who
seems to have effortlessly shifted from campaigning for himself to
campaigning for his wife and Vice President Al Gore, expressed only
joy as he bounded off Air Force One, greeted on the tarmac first by
Jordan, then Friedman and his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons took turns holding the Friedmans' five-month-old
son, Jake, before they met the rest of the official welcoming
party, including Martha's Vineyard politicos and two of Chelsea's
friends, Kiva Iscol and John Dower.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic Clinton moment, the president evoked tears from a
well-wisher, Fatima Figueroa, 56, of Worcester, who stuck a red
rose into the pocket of his business suit as he greeted the airport
crowd. Clinton hugged and kissed Figueroa as he thanked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried like a baby because I was able to do what I've always
wanted to do, give the perfect rose to the perfect president,''
Figueroa said afterward. ``I don't care if I die tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the impeachment cloud that hovered above
Clinton last summer has lifted. No more self-inmposed seclusion for
the president. No more golf deprivation. No chilly distance between
the Clintons, who interacted easily throught the trip from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart indicated the president
was so committed to relaxing that he does not intend to ``generate
any news'' on the Vineyard, other than his weekly radio addresses
each Saturday. This would be in stark contrast with last year, when
Clinton anounced from the Vineyard the US bombing of camps in
Afghanistan allegedly run by terrorist Ahmed Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The Vineyard has been a source of solace for Cinton in his
darkest hours, from the atermath of the suicide of his lifelong
friend, Vince Foster, the deputy White House counsel, in 1993, to
the shame of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the salty air on a schooner off the Vineyard that
James Taylor one summer sang for Clinton ``You've Got a Friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Comeback Kid is back. His family has forgiven his
humiliating sex scandal. And Friedman's 20-acre compound on the
shores of Oyster Pond is no longer a refuge from the storm but a
haven for rest and rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there lingers Mrs. Clinton's political agenda. Indeed,
the Clintons nearly forsook a Vineyard vacation for an extended
retreat in New York so Mrs. Clinton could enhance her standing
there. In the end, they compromised, deciding to spend the second
half of their vacation in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are scheduled to leave the Vineyard Aug. 28 for
East Hampton, N.Y., where they will attend a Democratic Party
weekend retreat and stay at the summer home of Hollywood filmmaker
Steven Speilberg. From Long Island, they will travel to Skaneateles
in the Finger Lakes region of northern New York before returning to
Washington in time for the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But first, there will be golf aplenty for Clinton, including a
weekend round wth Senator John F. Kerry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were born in 1964, you've probably begun to notice signs
of aging: fallen arches, a bald spot, a tummy that no longer tucks.
Isn't it inspiring to find a 35-year-old that still looks and feels
young?
</P>
<P>
   With its 1964{ Mustang, christened at the last World's Fair held
in New York, Ford invented the so-called ``pony car'' _ sporty
personal transportation at a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   Although the market is quite different these days _ people who
once had Mustangs, Camaros and Barracudas are more likely to drive
sport sedans or sport utilities _ the formula still works. Seven
million Mustangs have been sold since '64; sales were up 25 percent
this year, through July.
</P>
<P>
   Like all long-lasting models, there have been highs and lows,
including some bloated and toothless Mustangs in the early '70s,
followed by the silly Pinto-based Mustang II. The car's resurgence,
though, has coincided with a return to its roots, starting with a
thorough redesign for 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ford restyled the car for the anniversary with
touches from the past. The long hood and short deck are still
there, but are now set off by the sharp edges of New Edge design;
there is a prominent, nonfunctional hood scoop, triangular side
scoops and three-part taillamps much like the original's. Even the
emblem on the grille is familiar; on base and GT models, the pony
again gallops within a gleaming corral.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this back-to-basics approach with that of two long-time
rivals, the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, which have had
declining sales for years. While the Mustang looks and feels much
like its predecessors, the Camaro and Firebird are larger, sleeker
and altogether different in style from their 1967 progenitors.
General Motors is pondering the future _ if there is one _ of its
pony cars.
</P>
<P>
   All these cars have kept a rear-drive configuration; all have
adequate front buckets plus a cramped back seat and a small trunk.
All come with V6 or V8 engines.
</P>
<P>
   The new Mustang is not nearly as simple as the original, which
offered a limited-slip differential to improve traction; the new
car can be had with a sophisticated traction control. The '64{
offered power steering for $80 extra; power steering, much improved
over the years, has long been standard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The original's base price was $2,368 (equivalent to about
$13,000 now). Today's Mustangs start below $17,000, but even the
Cobra can be had for less than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the 1999 Mustang preserves much of the
original's free spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in total sales is due to a surge for the base coupe
and convertible, while GT and Cobra sales have been relatively
flat. The base model has the same look, although without dress-up
items like a rear spoiler and dual exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, my test car, an electric-green base convertible, got a
lot of looks. Its 3.8-liter V6 cranks out 190 horsepower _ 40 more
than last year _ and felt zippy enough. Showoffs can still fishtail
and burn rubber if so inclined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The test car had a $22,000 sticker, about the same as a
yawn-inducing Taurus. The Mustang isn't as practical as that sedan,
but it will make you feel less old. &QL;

 &HT;    Tide of turmoil slams Bama
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhardt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ A steady stream of cars pulls into the
parking lot off Paul W. Bryant Drive. After finding a spot, each
driver and his passengers jump out of the vehicle and walk quickly
toward the light.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't rushing to church. But they are heading for the next
thing to it here. The Alabama football team is holding its first
preseason practice in pads, and the whole family is invited.
</P>
<P>
   The people who have come out to the Alabama practice field on
this warm Tuesday night appear to be upbeat and ready to celebrate
the start of the season less than three weeks away. But underneath
the surface, tension again runs through the Alabama family.
</P>
<P>
   This season was going to be the one in which Alabama took a
major step toward what the faithful believe is its rightful place,
at the top of the football hierarchy. After seasons of 4-7 and 7-5,
Alabama had been picked by many experts to win the SEC's Western
Division and play for the conference championship. Breaking with
tradition, which is no small occurrence here, the school was
touting a player, running back Shaun Alexander, for the Heisman
Trophy. Optimism, in short supply for the past two years, was
rampant.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed Aug. 5 when coach Mike DuBose stood before
television cameras and admitted that he had engaged in an improper
relationship with a former secretary and had ``misled'' everyone in
May when he denied it.
</P>
<P>
   By then, university President Andrew Sorensen and athletics
director Bob Bockrath had worked out a plan they hoped would end
the episode. The former secretary, Debbie Gibson, would be paid
$350,000 to withdraw claims of sexual harassment and sexual
discrimination.The money would come out of DuBose's salary over the
next 30 months. The length of his contract would be reduced from
five years to three, but he would not be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the penalties) are pretty harsh,'' Bockrath said
later, ``not only from a monetary standpoint, but in the attention
it draws on one individual. I think (DuBose) has paid a substantial
price.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many people, it wasn't enough. Thousands of fans took
DuBose's indiscretion personally. On talk shows and in media polls
taken after the announcement, a majority said DuBose should have
been fired immediately.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose supporters asked for compassion and said that firing the
coach a month before the season would have been folly. But they
were drowned out by the passion of those who thought DuBose had
sullied the reputation of their most prized institution: the
Alabama football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've hurt this university and the people who love it,''
DuBose said. ``That hurts, because I love this university. It still
hurts. But we've paid a price, and that part has been put behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. The controversy continues in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ The university's board of trustees met Aug. 10 for four hours
and grudgingly supported the plan of Sorensen and Bockrath. Board
president Sid McDonald said DuBose would keep his job. But it was
implied that the board could change its mind if other problems
occur. ``The scars won't heal quickly,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least one Alabama newspaper is digging around to see if
DuBose committed any other personal indiscretions. Nothing has been
reported.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several advertisers in the team's game programs have asked
that DuBose's picture be removed from their ads and replaced by a
generic football picture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sorensen was quoted as wondering if he could trust DuBose in
any matter, even in following NCAA rules. Sorensen declined an
interview request for this article. Spokeswoman Janet Griffith said
the comments were taken out of context from a frenzied news
conference after the board of trustees meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After the publicity when the story broke two weeks ago, most
Alabama officials were unwilling to speak on the record this week
and hoped that the story would go away. DuBose was an exception.
</P>
<P>
   But discussions with those behind the scenes indicated that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bockrath met with the assistant coaches last week and told
them that if they took care of business ``on the field'' things
would work out. The thinking is that if Alabama wins eight or nine
games _ including the Nov. 20 game at Auburn _ DuBose will keep his
job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several big-money boosters sent letters of support to the
coaching staff. Their message was: ``Do your job and everything
will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If DuBose is retained after this season, odds are good that
the two years taken from his contract will be reinstated;
otherwise, the contract situation could damage recruiting. If
DuBose is not retained, his buyout would be reasonable for the
school to absorb.
</P>
<P>
   The administration apparently will wait until after the season
to decide DuBose's fate. Then, and only then, will school officials
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   But DuBose doesn't think the situation has left him twisting in
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be evaluated on what we do, but from that
standpoint, that's not different than any other year,'' he said.
``But given the circumstances, I can see why others would sit back
and say the verdict is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's players insist that the controversy is overblown and
that they do not have to win to save DuBose's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' said Alexander, whose Heisman candidacy has been
minimized. ``Coach stood up before us, said he made a mistake and
apologized for it. Now we all move on. The only thing keeping this
thing alive is you guys (in the media).''
</P>
<P>
   At practice Tuesday evening, everyone was trying to put the best
face on a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   Sorensen, looking somewhat out of place in a shirt and tie,
arrived early and gave his annual address to the team. The players
hung on every word as he gave DuBose an unequivocal vote of
confidence. Paul Bryant Jr., the wealthy son of the legendary
coach, watched quietly in the background, as king-makers do. Polly
DuBose, the coach's wife, dutifully made the rounds of friends, and
friends of friends, accepting hugs and reassurances at every stop.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what matters is what happens on the field. September
promises to be interesting. After the Vanderbilt game are games
with Houston and Louisiana Tech at Birmingham's Legion Field. Then
Arkansas comes to Tuscaloosa on Sept. 25. It will be the first game
on campus and one that will be key to Alabama's hopes in the West.
If the Crimson Tide is 4-0 going into its Oct. 2 trip to Florida,
Bama has a chance for a very good season.
</P>
<P>
   But one stumble, or even an ugly victory against a lesser
opponent, and DuBose runs the risk of his detractors coming back in
full force. And the critics will be relentless. The only way to
keep the negativity at bay is to win _and win impressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've lost the trust of some people here, and that kind
of trust you don't get back overnight,'' said DuBose, who is 11-12
in two years as coach. ``It's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who do not win at Alabama, time is always running
out.

IMPORTS PUSH TRADE DEFICIT TO NEW HIGH

 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imports surged in June, driving the nation's trade
deficit to another record, as Americans, feeling flush in the
strong economy, continued to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit swelled to $24.6 billion, the Commerce Department
reported Thursday, an increase of 16.3 percent from the revised
figure for May. The sharp growth _ fueled by rising imports from
Japan, China, Western Europe and Mexico _ surprised many economists
who had predicted that the gap would begin to narrow because the
economies of Asia and Europe were growing stronger and recovering
from the economic turmoil of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Imports rose almost 4 percent, to $103 billion in June, topping
$100 billion for the first time. American exports, meanwhile, rose
by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trade report is the last significant economic report before
Federal Reserve policy-makers meet on Tuesday to debate whether
short-term interest rates should be raised to slow the economy and
prevent inflation from accelerating. While a widening trade gap can
be a drag on economic growth, the surge in imports shows that
consumers are continuing their spending spree while saving little,
a significant concern of the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors and Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to nudge
its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a point, to 5.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper imports have helped to keep prices low and inflation in
check, so far. But the dollar has been weaker of late, and many
economists contend that the spending spree on imports may help to
drive up consumer prices. And sustained record deficits could cause
the dollar's value to tumble further, making American stock and
bond markets less attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dollar extended a slide Thursday after the release
of the trade data. The dollar is now at a seven-month low compared
with the yen. Treasury prices and stocks also fell Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have as big of a deficit in one month as we once had in
an entire year,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, the president of the
Economic Strategy Institute, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar often falls with a widening trade deficit because
investors choose other markets when they see the deficit as a
portent of possible problems.
</P>
<P>
   The widening trade gap is also an economic measure that
Republicans may seize upon in this campaign season as evidence that
all is not well with the American economy. Sluggish exports are a
sign that American manufacturing is weak. And many American
laborers, like steelworkers and Midwestern farmers, consider the
widening gap as a bad omen for their personal futures.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on Capitol Hill, Catherine Mann, a senior fellow at
the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that
though the deficit had not yet created a crisis, it was clear, from
a long-term perspective, that ``the United States is living beyond
its means.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mann told the members of the Trade Deficit Review Commission
that the sustained rise in U.S. stock markets had caused investors
to feel more confident about the future value of their wealth and,
in turn, was prompting them to reduce the amount they save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are spending beyond their personal incomes,'' she
said. ``At some point in time, in my estimation roughly two years,
the rest of the world will say, `We're not so happy about lending
to you anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan deficit-review commission _ with members ranging
from Carla Hills, who was chief trade negotiator under President
Bush, to George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers Union
_ was created last year to study the causes and effects of the
trade gap. The commission plans to report on its findings after
holding hearings around the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statistics released Thursday, consumers snapped
up more foreign automobiles, computer accessories and diamond gems.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with China widened at a time when the Chinese may
soon try to resume talks with the Clinton administration in their
bid to join the World Trade Organization. The administration has
requested a study of how China's addition to the WTO would affect
the U.S. economy. The study is expected to be completed this month,
but a spokeswoman at the office of the U.S. trade tepresentative
said the report would most likely remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The total trade deficit for the first six months of the year was
$118 billion _ 57 percent higher than the cumulative gap for the
first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing in Washington Thursday, Charles Schultze, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, said the increasing
deficits could eventually lower Americans' standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not some catastrophe,'' Schultze said. ``It will
probably take care of itself, but in ways we don't like.''

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 CHECKING OUT YOUR REFERENCES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. During a long job search _ more than three years _ I have
suspected that one of my references is giving a poor recommendation
of me to potential employers. Despite good qualifications and good
interviews, I am rarely offered a position. After rejections, I
often ask if my references might have affected the outcome, but I
never hear any specifics. How can I know if a reference is chilling
my prospects? How should I respond if my suspicions prove true? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, don't assume that someone is out to get you.
Even if your job search is being undermined at the
reference-checking stage, the problem may be nothing more than
human error.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate human-resources departments can wipe out people's
careers by providing incorrect information, said Terra Dourlain,
managing director of MyReferences.com, an employment verification
and reference-checking firm in Jamestown, N.Y. If what you are
saying doesn't jibe with what your interviewer is hearing from
those offices _ about job titles, salary or your reason for leaving
the company _ it can make you ``look like a liar,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When starting a job hunt _ or even at this late stage _ it's a
good idea to call the human resources departments of previous
employers, Ms. Dourlain advised: ``Say, `I'm putting together my
resume and would like to confirm the information you have.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finding whether a particular co-worker or supervisor is casting
you in an unflattering light, however, can be trickier. ``You will
not get feedback from any potential employers, nor should you put
them in that kind of position,'' said Dale Winston, chief executive
of Battalia Winston International, an executive search firm in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Many people hire outsiders like reference-checking firms to call
around to their references, particularly when the split with a
former employer was less than amicable. Even if you had a good
relationship with employers and co-workers, Ms. Dourlain said,
``not everyone has the ability to give other people credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another path is to approach your references directly _ not to
make accusations, but to get a sense of how they view you and your
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a meeting,'' Ms. Winston suggested. ``Say to them, `What
kind of a job do you think is appropriate for me now? What do you
think some of my strengths and weaknesses are?'''
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a better sense of what _ or who _ the problem is,
you can build a strategy for future interviews, Ms. Dourlain said.
If someone is spreading false information, you may want to call a
lawyer _ not to go to court, but to fire off a strongly worded
warning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In less extreme cases _ for example, if Reference X is killing
you with faint praise _ the knowledge can help you control the
damage. You can subtly steer your potential employer toward other
references.
</P>
<P>
   And if you surmise that someone simply isn't comfortable giving
other people credit, you can alert your interviewers that he isn't
the effusive type. &QL;

 &HT;    Call Georgia Tech's offense line the QB's bodyguards
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chris Brown remembers it all too well. It was a sight
he did not see during last season's loss to Florida State, and it
upset him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going back to the huddle,'' said Brown, Georgia
Tech's junior right tackle, ``and I didn't see Joe Hamilton in
there. I didn't know until then he'd been hurt and was out of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Not seeing Hamilton, the Yellow Jackets' quarterback and Heisman
Trophy contender, on the field indeed is frightening for Tech
players, coaches and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, at 5 feet 10 and 186 pounds, has been remarkably
durable _ even though he is exposed to plenty of contact in a
diverse offense, which can have him running the option, rolling out
or luring would-be tacklers with play-action tosses and short
screen passes to running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Add the senior's propensity not to shy away from contact, and
Hamilton often has Tech supporters holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the game of football, and injuries happen,'' says
Hamilton, who is 13-3 in his past 16 games as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those losses, however, came against Florida State, and
Hamilton was injured both times.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is among four returning starters to an offensive line that
helped produce 4,276 total yards and 39 touchdowns a year ago,
while allowing just 16 sacks in 280 pass attempts. He is aware that
if the Jackets are to supplant FSU atop the ACC, Hamilton has to
stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do our jobs, Joe won't get hurt,'' Brown said. ``We take
that thought to mind each and every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, offensive line coach Doug Marrone has a
talented and experienced bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a 6-6, 315-pound All-ACC candidate, has started 18 games.
At right tackle is 6-8, 335-pound All-America candidate Jon Carman,
a senior who has started the past 16 games. Right guard Brent Key,
a 6-4, 280-pound junior, has started 24 games in a row. Senior Noah
King, a 6-2, 277-pounder, moves to center after starting at guard
last season. At left guard is senior Jason Burks, a 6-5,
287-pounder who was named second-team All-ACC in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is to pick up where we left off and get better
every day,'' said Marrone, a fifth-year member of the staff who
played at Syracuse when head coach George O'Leary was an assistant
for the Orangemen. ``We can't afford any inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who played the offensive line and fullback at New
Hampshire, says consistent play will be the main challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have the physical tools,'' he said. ``Now, it's
just, mentally, can they get it done?''
</P>
<P>
   The backups are brawny, too: senior Bill Madigan (6-5, 298);
sophomores Jason Kemble (6-4, 299), Jesse Moody (6-5, 300) and
Brian Meager (6-5, 275); junior Kevin Knapp (6-4, 287); and
redshirt freshman Dustin Vaitekunas (6-7, 314).
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the No. 11-ranked Yellow Jackets are not overwhelmed
by high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our personal goals are the same as every year,'' he said. ``We
want to set out and improve each Saturday. If we do that, we'll
even exceed all the high expectations.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the days since Steve Forbes' second-place finish
in the Iowa straw poll, the wealthy publisher's campaign aides have
done plenty of crowing.
</P>
<P>
   They have talked about a ``two-man race'' in the Republican
presidential primaries, reducing the eight contenders other than
Forbes and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to starry-eyed asterisks.
They have unequivocally designated Forbes the only candidate with
the organizational agility and economic stamina to keep pace with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But with the next competitive statewide contest more than four
months away, Forbes faces serious tests, both political and
financial, in his effort to maintain the claim that he is Bush's
biggest threat.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' aides said this week that one way they will draw pointed
attention to contrasts between Forbes' and Bush's positions on
various issues in an effort to show that the Republican field has
narrowed. That approach has prompted complaints from Bush's aides
that Forbes is poised to take a negative tack and turn the race
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' aides challenged that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we'll focus on is an issues agenda,'' said Bill
Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, ``and the one who has to respond
to it is the front runner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who has to be overtaken,'' Dal Col said. ``He
can't keep running and hiding. Eventually, he has to address
issues, and when he does, he's on our turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' aides would not say whether they intend to attack Bush
explicitly in forthcoming advertisements. But a spokeswoman for
Bush said that Forbes seemed to be laying the groundwork for a
repeat of his performance in 1996, when he unleashed withering
television commercials against Bob Dole, the Republican
front-runner and eventual nominee, that haunted Dole well into the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that he's on the road to doing the same thing,''
the spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker said that Forbes' campaign had begun conducting a
poll in Iowa this week to see if voters would feel more negatively
about Bush if they were given selective information about his
record. She said they were told, for example, that he had advocated
a raise in the sales tax in Texas but not that he had supported an
overall tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Appell, a spokesman for the Forbes campaign, said Thursday
that he would not discuss the specifics of any polls that the
campaign was doing. In a sign of the intensifying friction between
the two campaigns, Appell added that Bush's aides were overreacting
and obviously running scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to take the subject away from issues by
accusing of this, or accusing us of that,'' Appell said. ``They're
panicking a little bit because they're in trouble. Someone's come
along and popped their little bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one interpretation of Forbes' performance in Iowa, the
true meaning of which has been dissected and debated more
vigorously than the showing of any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes won 20.8 percent of the vote, while Bush, the top
finisher, won 31.3 percent. Elizabeth Dole came in third with 14.4
percent, while Gary L. Bauer came in fourth with 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Mrs. Dole and Bauer and several political analysts said
that Forbes' success primarily reflected his lavish spending to woo
and entertain voters in a ritual that often rewards the candidates
who are the most extravagant, solicitous hosts.
</P>
<P>
   In national polls, Forbes continues to lag behind Bush, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona and Mrs. Dole. The latest survey of
registered Republican voters in New Hampshire, a state with an
early primary, shows Forbes near the bottom of the field, even
though he has advertised extensively there.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the American Research Group, which was released
Thursday, interviewed 450 Republicans. Only 3 percent said they
favored Forbes, putting him seventh place in a field of nine
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, there's no evidence that he's getting any
traction,'' said Roger Stone, a Republican strategist. ``I frankly
don't know how much more this guy has got to spend before he
figures out that money can't buy you love.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' aides, however, noted that Forbes' poll numbers in Iowa
built steadily as he spent more time there and said that when
voters in other states take as careful a look at the candidates as
Iowans did, Forbes' support will grow in those places, too.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that Forbes was committed to spending whatever it
takes to remain competitive with Bush, who has raised more than $37
million so far. Forbes has raised more than $2.7 million, and has
added more than $6.5 million of his own money to that sum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But to keep pumping cash into his campaign, he may have to
liquidate some assets, as he did during his 1996 bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. On the way to spending more
than $37 million that time around, he had to sell some of his
shares in Forbes Family Holdings, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated the amount of the company he currently owns to be
worth more than $50 million, according to the financial disclosure
form that he filed with the Federal Election Commission in May.
</P>
<P>
   But because the company is privately held, his stake in it is
less instantly converted into dollars for his campaign than are his
publicly traded stocks, bonds and mutual funds, a portfolio that
Forbes estimated to be worth between $5.8 million and $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col declined to discuss the liquidity of Forbes' assets but
said that Forbes would not come up short on money for the campaign.
``He's got the personal resources,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Forbes seems at least as determined as he was in 1996, and
possibly more so. Then, he came across as the champion of a single
issue: his proposal for a flat tax. Now, he speaks just as loudly
about conservative religious themes, like opposition to legal
abortion, that seem to depart from past statements that the
Christian Coalition did not speak for most Christians and that Pat
Robertson was ``a toothy flake.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kennedy, a strategist for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, who dropped out of the race this week, said of Forbes:
``He's a better candidate than he was in 1996. His agenda is much
broader. His presentation is more polished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy added that Forbes ``has a tendency to go a step too
far. You saw that in 1996, with his negative advertising campaign.
It ultimately sunk his candidacy.''

ECONOMIC LOSS ESTIMATED TO REACH TENS OF BILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TURKEY-GOLCUK, TURKEY-BUILDINGS.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Economic losses caused by the devastating
45-second earthquake will reach tens of billions of dollars,
according to early damage estimates announced Thursday, and the
government probably will have to find several billion more in an
already tight budget to pay for emergency reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers continued to pull survivors and victims from the
ruins of buildings, bringing the number of dead to more than 7,000
and the injured to more than 30,000. Turkish officials said
thousands were still missing, and the hope that they will be found
alive is dwindling. Newspapers predicted that the death toll could
soar to 10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The director of Turkey's leading observatory, Mehmet Ali
Isikara, said he had detected ``unusual movement'' in seismic
structures that could produce another tremor. More than 200
aftershocks were reported in the region on Thursday alone. In
response to the warning, the governor of Bursa, a province south of
Istanbul, urged the province's 2 million residents to spend the
night outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit sought to calm rising public anger
at the disorganized relief effort. Looking pale and shaken as he
emerged from a crisis session, he said that although the nation was
in mourning, ``good news comes from all areas'' as more survivors
are found.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of ordering an army mobilization or other drastic
measures to increase the pace of the rescue effort, as some have
urged, Ecevit announced only a plan to send tents to affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tent cities will be set up in the worst areas,'' he said on
Thursday. ``From today, they will be able to make use of health,
cleaning and food facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the quake area, people complained bitterly about the lack
of relief workers and equipment. Television stations broadcast
scenes of people picking through rubble with their bare hands and
even fighting over scarce shovels and bulldozers. Many towns have
not seen a single government worker, and are relying on foreign
volunteers or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Izmit, near the epicenter of the quake, the country's biggest
refinery continued to burn. Thousands of residents were evacuated
as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers from abroad continued to pour into Turkey. The
United States announced plans to send three warships with 3,100
sailors and Marines aboard. The vessels are fitted with operating
rooms and medical equipment, and the crews include physicians and
paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department announced that five Americans were among
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   As the initial shock over the quake eased, government officials
and other specialists began planning what can be done to revive the
shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy was already in a serious position,'' Ecevit said.
``Now it will be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a
crucial $5 billion loan, and Turkish leaders have pledged to cut
the national budget and make other reforms that may now prove
difficult or impossible. At the same time, countless businesses
have been destroyed, most of them small and mid-sized companies
like those that have fueled this country's remarkable economic boom
in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than serious,'' said Abdurrahman Ariman, general
secretary of the Foreign Investors Association. ``The loss could be
$25 billion, but the effects will be much wider than that. This is
the most productive region of our country, and the destruction of
infrastructure there is complete, let alone the damage that
industries sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We already had serious problems in other regions, and now we
have to talk about reconstructing the whole country,'' he said.
``It's not a one-dimensional problem. It will take years to deal
with, and Turkey can't handle all of it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's economy has boomed for most of the 1990s, racking up
growth rates of 7 percent to 8 percent in most years. Although
there has been a slump in exports since last summer's Russian
financial crisis, and a near-collapse of tourism after terrorist
attacks here several months ago, most experts have agreed that the
economy here is fundamentally sound and should continue to grow.
But in the wake of the earthquake, no one is certain if those
predictions remain valid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Industry has been terribly affected, and I don't know how
we're going to put it together again,'' said Ayse Bugra, a
professor of economics at Bosporus University in Istanbul. ``There
are all kinds of problems. Roads are a mess, and there is no rail
transportation in the area even though it's the country's main
industrial region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destruction of the petroleum refinery will probably mean
that oil prices will go up, which will fuel inflation. Many
companies were not properly insured, so there will be a lot of
bankruptcies and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even though this is a disaster for the economy, it can be
an opportunity if certain decisions are taken,'' Ms. Bugra said.
``The refinery should definitely be moved to another place outside
the earthquake zone. Incentives should be given to companies that
lost buildings to relocate in other parts of the country, which
would not only take them outside the danger area but would address
the great regional imbalances in our economy. Insurance and
construction regulations should be tightened. These would be
rational steps, and now, before people forget about this, is the
time to take them.''
</P>
<P>
   One sector of the economy that is likely to boom in the coming
months is construction. Gazi Ercel, president of the Central Bank,
said he expected the government to allocate about $4 billion to
rebuild ruined businesses and $2 billion to $3 billion more to
rebuild the destroyed refinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a burden on our budget, but we have a GDP of $200
billion, so it should be bearable,'' Ercel said. ``We'll also have
a very low growth rate this year, probably less than one percent,
but investments in construction will help somewhat. All in all,
it's a sizable burden, but I think the Turkish economy, together
with generous and timely foreign aid, will be able to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, suggested that the fund might modify its demands to
take the needs of earthquake victims into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF will do all it can to help the Turkish government deal
with this disaster,'' Camdessus said. ``We stand ready to help them
in any way that we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Turkey's principal business association, Erkut
Yucaoglu, said that even though losses would probably exceed $20
billion, the earthquake was ``not completely devastating in an
economic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will slow down the economy, but we can get through it,''
Yucaoglu said. ``I hope there will be a level of understanding
abroad for the budget increases and other steps we'll have to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey deserves some soft loans and long-term credits at this
moment to cope with the rehabilitation of various sectors of the
economy, as well as funds to cope with the social side of the
problem,'' he said. ``I think foreign lenders are ready to look at
things here with a softer heart at this moment.''

DEBT: THE NEXT GENERATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Md.)   (af) 
By JAMES SCHEMBARI  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baby boomers are returning to school in increasing numbers, to
work on graduate degrees or to finish their undergraduate work as
they try to advance their careers. But that zeal has created a
unique financial squeeze that education experts say can only
tighten: As they pay off loans for their own education, past or
present, parents are taking on additional debt for their children's
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   SLM Holding Corp., known as Sallie Mae, the nation's largest
financer of student loans, says that baby boomers (people born from
1946 through 1964) hold about 25 percent of its loans, or $11.5
billion. Boomers with both types of college debt _ for their own
and their children's educations _ are carrying an average debt of
almost $23,000, Sallie Mae says, of which $14,500 is for their own
educations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder if the parents can keep up with paying for
their children's education and still pay their own loans,'' said
Kenneth Redd, a senior research associate at Sallie Mae. ``It does
add up after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Education, the number of students
in higher education who were 35 or older more than tripled from
1970 to 1996, from 823,000 to 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sallie Mae, citing privacy restrictions, would not
identify borrowers who were paying off both types of debt,
university officials say they see them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every financial aid office has spoken to a family with
a child going to college while keeping up with their own loan
situation,'' said Ronald W. Johnson, director of financial aid at
the University of California at Los Angeles. ``It is going to
continue. We may eventually see grandparents, parents and then the
child all part of that whole scenario as well.'' Intergenerational
debt, he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Frishberg, director of student financial services at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, said the situation would probably
worsen. The most common term for a student loan is 10 years, but
starting in 1993, students were allowed to take 25-year loans,
meaning that more people will be paying for school deep into middle
age. ``They can get into a 25-year loan repayment and really get
hit when their own children start school,'' she said. ``Now some
alumni are saying, `We can't give because we're already giving:
We're still paying back our loans.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hauptman, a higher-education finance consultant in
Washington, said that if the federal government limited borrowing
by setting tighter rules for the loans, schools would have to
control their rising costs. But, he said, ``no one is willing to
take the steps to reduce the debt burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents having trouble with their own debt burdens do have a way
to reduce the immediate pressure. They can switch to different
payment schedules offered by Sallie Mae to reduce monthly payments
in the early years of a loan. The price, of course, is higher
payments later _ and a higher overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   A standard 10-year student loan for $10,000 at a maximum
interest rate of 8.25 percent results in monthly payments of $123.
By the end of the term, a borrower has paid $14,718.
</P>
<P>
   But under a different schedule, the same loan could have
payments of $69 a month for the first four years, then $177 a month
for the last six years. That would mean total payments of $16,012,
or $1,294 more than under the standard formula. So be careful.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Sallie Mae says, is that even if parents have
outstanding debt from their own school years, it won't be held
against them when they apply for loans for their children. That is
true, of course, only if the parents haven't defaulted on their own
college loans. In some cases, parents can also consolidate their
loan with their child's, making one monthly payment.
</P>
<P>
   Redd of Sallie Mae said he worries that parents could eventually
have trouble meeting other obligations, like mortgages, because of
accumulated college debt.
</P>
<P>
   And Hauptman, the consultant, said it might take a while for the
impact of all this debt to be felt. ``To what extent does this
change people's behavior?'' he said. ``Do they postpone child
bearing, postpone marriage because of the debt? Those questions
have still not been answered.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Jarrett pulling out of sight
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Jarrett's 300-point lead in the Winston Cup
standings is so large that the No. 88 Ford driver could finish last
and next-to-last in the next two races and still be No. 1 in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Some NASCAR drivers already are waving the white flag on the
1999 season, as the circuit prepares for Sunday's Pepsi 400 in
Brooklyn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ninth-highest scoring team since Daytona (on July
3), and we have fallen 166 points behind him in just those four
races,'' Steve Park said. ``I don't see any way he can lose the
lead as long as he finishes races.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you think, 'Well, his luck could go bad.' Yeah, it
could,'' Kyle Petty said. ``But he'd have to be the unlucky 13th
cousin of that guy in 'Lil' Abner' who had the rain cloud over his
head all the time to be unlucky enough to lose it now. No matter
how good Mark (Martin) or the guys behind him are, he'd have to
fall off a cliff to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has the biggest lead in August in modern NASCAR history.
In 1993 after the Michigan race, Dale Earnhardt led Jarrett by 259
points. Last year, Jeff Gordon won the Winston Cup championship by
364 points, but his lead was 97 points after 21 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jarrett falls out of the next five races, it'll get
interesting,'' Gordon said with a chuckle. ``I don't see that
happening. They're on a roll. Things are going their way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon captured the 1998 title by tying a record for season
victories with 13, while Jarrett is succeeding with consistency.
After wrecking in the season-opener at Daytona and placing 37th,
Jarrett has had 20 consecutive finishes of 11th or better.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett gained the top spot after winning at Richmond in May. He
then finished in the top five in nine of the next 10 races. He has
increased his points lead in each of the last nine races. His lead
over Mark Martin is a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has five victories to Jarrett's four, but Jarrett is 482
points ahead of Gordon, who is fifth in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've analyzed over the past few years what we needed to do
and what others have done to beat us,'' Jarrett said. ``And it
certainly doesn't always come out to the guy that wins the most
races. Certainly, you've got to win your share, but it's the team
that has the fewest problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, to this point, we've been the team with the fewest
problems. If we can continue that trend, then we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the giant margin, the Robert Yates Racing team isn't
celebrating. Yates, a team owner since 1988, has twice seen his
drivers make a run at the title, and both outcomes were
heartbreaking. A wreck in the final race in Atlanta in 1992 cost
Davey Allison the title. Two years ago, Ernie Irvan was speeding
toward the championship before being involved in a life-threatening
crash during practice at Michigan in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the race for the championship is still very open,''
Yates said. ``I've run second too many times and blown big leads
enough times to know it's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Todd Parrott said: ``I guess it's a nice lead to
have, but no lead is ever big enough until it is mathematically
over. A lot of things can happen; you just never know. But it is
still a good feeling to know we are racing hard every week and
gaining points every week.''

MARKET PLACE: NUMBER CRUNCHERS THROW ASIA INTO A TIZZY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ There is no shortage of explanations for why Asia's
stock markets have popped up and down like targets in a carnival
shooting gallery over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and China are turning up the volume in their heated war
of words. North Korea is developing missiles that could threaten
Japan or South Korea. Ethnic strife is on the rise in politically
tense Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, though, none of these flashpoints caused the
bumpy ride in Asia's markets. Instead, shareholders from Seoul to
Singapore were thrown into a tizzy by a team of anonymous
number-crunchers in Geneva, who made changes in a closely watched
Asian stock index.
</P>
<P>
   That a stock index could exert so much influence across so many
markets says a lot about the changing nature of investing _ and the
herd mentality of investors as they venture back into
recession-ravaged Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to find people who think independently about
how to invest in Asia,'' said Mac Overton, a former fund manager in
Hong Kong. ``They are terrified about underperforming the
benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark of choice here is the MSCI, which stands for
Morgan Stanley Capital International. From its offices in Geneva,
this subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter calculates 3,000
stock indexes a day, covering 24,000 stocks in 51 countries. It
bundles these country indexes into regional indexes. Analysts say
Morgan Stanley's Asian indexes are by far its most influential.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, Morgan Stanley announced it would reinstate Malaysia
in two of those indexes, the All-Country Far East Free and Emerging
Markets Free indexes, as of next February. It had dropped Malaysia
last September when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad imposed
controls on Malaysia's currency market.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley also said it would adjust its portfolios to
double the weighting of Taiwan _ a nod to the greater openness of
Taiwan's markets. To restore Malaysia and bolster Taiwan, Morgan
Stanley will reduce the relative weighting of other Asian countries
in the indexes.
</P>
<P>
   That could be crucial to how much foreign investment flows to
these countries. A growing number of overseas funds use these
indexes to judge their own performances. When Morgan Stanley
changes the weighting of various countries, fund managers rush to
align their own portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the news had a drastic effect on the markets.
Stock exchanges in Malaysia and Taiwan soared, while other markets,
like Hong Kong and Singapore, swooned. When Morgan Stanley
announced a later adjustment that could lift Singapore's weighting,
Singapore bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are likely to have the most lasting impact on
Malaysia, which has been spurned by foreign investors since
Mahathir effectively dug a moat around the country's capital and
currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very symbolic step for us,'' said Razak Baginda, the
executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a
research firm in Kuala Lumpur. ``Having been seen as a pariah
state, the Morgan Stanley listing signifies that we are once again
a legitimate place to invest.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Morgan Stanley Capital International said they
were well aware of the influence they wield. They seemed the
slightest bit sheepish about the market tumult they set off over
the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our business, strangely enough, to move markets,''
said John Fildes, the executive director of Morgan Stanley Capital
International in Hong Kong. ``We aim to be a lagging indicator, not
a leading indicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock indexes are popular in Asia for the same reason they
became popular in the United States and Europe. Funds that manage
billions of dollars for endowments and pension funds want
benchmarks against which to measure their performance. Some funds
are bound by their charters not to invest in stocks or countries
that are excluded from these indexes.
</P>
<P>
   But Fildes said stock indexes have become even more influential
here in the aftermath of the regional economic crisis. Burned by
the spectacular market meltdowns in South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia, fund managers are counting on indexes as a way to hedge
their bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Asian tigers were generating high returns, people
were not so reliant on the benchmark,'' Fildes said. ``But the
volatility of the last two years has made people much more
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, fund managers are substituting the research and
analysis of Morgan Stanley for their own judgment. Given Morgan
Stanley's vast influence, it is no surprise that its changes have
drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said it was premature to restore Malaysia to the
index, since it was not clear whether the government would fully
eliminate capital controls after they expire on Sept. 1. Officials
in Malaysia have said they are unlikely to allow its currency, the
ringgit, to trade freely.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan's case, some fund managers said Morgan Stanley should
have treated the escalating tensions with China as a disincentive.
Others noted that while Taiwan's government has loosened some
restrictions, like foreign ownership of local companies, it still
routinely restricts capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the Morgan Stanley index have led to some dubious
investment decisions, according to Bill Kaye, the senior managing
director of the Pacific Group, a hedge fund in Hong Kong. He noted
that the Taiwan market had risen by more than 8 percent since last
week despite the fact that Taiwan and China may be edging close to
an armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no intelligent basis for that kind of investment
whatsoever,'' Kaye said. ``It's absolutely byzantine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fildes has spent the last week responding to these criticisms.
He noted that Morgan Stanley left open the possibility that it
would not reinstate Malaysia if the government did not phase out
capital controls. As for Taiwan, ``political risk is something for
a fund manager to decide about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Fildes acknowledged somewhat wearily, ``Any changes in
the indexes can be emotive.''

 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ned Jarrett won Winston Cup championships in 1961 and
1965. If son Dale can hold on this year, the Jarretts would be the
second father-son combination to win titles in the series. Lee and
Richard Petty were the charter members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be pretty special for us to be in the same category
with the Pettys,'' said Ned, who worked as a spotter for his son at
Indianapolis, Charlotte and Rockingham this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all like to see our children do better than we did.
Of course, I was fortunate enough to win championships twice. But
if Dale could win it this year, it would mean more to me than both
of those championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A: TO THE POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup points standings are always a hot topic,
especially this year with Dale Jarrett's 300-point lead. Mike
Helton, chief operating officer for NASCAR, discussed the issue
earlier this week:
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution: With Jeff Gordon last year and
Dale Jarrett now, we've had two seasons in a row where dominant
drivers have virtually run away in the points standings by the late
summer. Is this good for the sport?
</P>
<P>
   Helton: It depends on whether or not the term ``run away'' is
accurate, and I don't think it is. Going back to dominance, with
the way Jeff Gordon has been winning so many races and
championships races in recent years, it puts an individual on the
map, so to speak. It makes him a cut above everyone else, or it
seems that way. You can debate whether (the dominance) makes a guy
more popular or unpopular, but what you can't debate is, at the end
of the day, more people know his name and associate him with
racing, which is a good thing. Dale Jarrett, by winning races and
sitting atop of the points standings, is experiencing that right
now. But it doesn't mean the points battle is over. Three hundred
points seem like a lot if you are running second, third, fourth or
fifth, but it doesn't seem like a lot to the guy who has the
cushion because you just don't know what can happen.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Isn't it awkward for Jarrett to be so far ahead, yet Gordon
has won the most races this year and is all the way back at fifth
in points?
</P>
<P>
   Helton: That's not awkward, and it's not uncommon. That's what
the Winston Cup points championship is all about, being competitive
consistently. Some of that comes from maybe having better luck (at
times) than the next guy, but the championship is about
consistently being the best guy out there. What Dale Jarrett has
done is be successful all along. Every race on every weekend, he's
up front in the top 10 or top five.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Is there any chance of NASCAR changing the points system to
reward a driver more for victories than consistency?
</P>
<P>
   Helton: We take a look at it quite often. We continue to study
and keep an open mind on what changes work well for the time. So
far, we're pretty comfortable with the points standings we have,
and we don't see any changes in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Bill Elliott leads all active drivers with
six poles and seven Winston Cup victories at Michigan Speedway. The
bad news for Elliott is that his last victory at the track was 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   BORED WITH POINTS RACE?
</P>
<P>
   If Dale Jarrett has you bored with the points standings, then
look a little further down the list. Rusty Wallace, Terry Labonte
and Mike Skinner are separated by five points in eighth, ninth and
10th.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HE SAID
</P>
<P>
   ``In January, if someone had told me that I'd be sixth in the
points 21 races into the season, I'd have said they were crazy. We
just wanted to make each race and finish as many laps as possible.
Everything else has been a bonus this year.''

 &HT;    Evernham moving up?

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up is hard to do, but it appears inevitable for Jeff
Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham. The two have teamed to win
Winston Cup titles in three of the past four seasons. Evernham
again confirmed this week that he hopes to move into a managerial
position with Hendrick Motorsports. He declined to discuss a
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' Evernham said. ``For the last couple of
years, I've said I don't know how much longer I'm going to be a
crew chief. Right now, we're not ready to comment on what could or
would or should happen. As I said last week, I don't want to
comment or tell anybody the truth, because the stuff everybody is
making up is a lot better than I could come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said, ``Everything that's going on right now at Hendrick
Motorsports, I'm 100 percent in support of.''
</P>
<P>
   Cup debut for Kenseth
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kenseth, who trails leader Dale Earnhardt Jr. by one point
in the Busch standings, is making his Winston Cup debut on Sunday.
Kenseth, who will compete on the top circuit for Roush Racing next
year, will be driving a No. 17 Ford from Mark Martin's stable
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Motor Speedway
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Boot has taken another big step in sponsorship with
Atlanta Motor Speedway. The Franklin, Tenn., footwear company will
sponsor the Nov. 20 season-ending ARCA race, now called the Georgia
Boot 400. Georgia Boot already sponsors the Winston Cup Pole Day on
Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   GRAND NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   Air Jamaica team back
</P>
<P>
   The AllCar Motorsports and Air Jamaica Vacations Chevy team is
returning to the Busch Series after two months of preparation and
will compete in all remaining races. Steve Grissom, who has been
the team's ``player-coach'' since mid-May, will drive the car in
the Michigan 200 on Saturday. ``It's asking a lot of a group of
racers to just work in the shop for two months, but they did it,''
owner Dave Carroll said. The team had a disastrous debut this
season, wrecking 13 cars in its first nine races and going through
three different engine builders. . . . The Lysol brand will
continue to sponsor the No. 98 car of driver Elton Sawyer and Akins
Motorsports through the 2000 season. Sawyer, in his 18th year of
competing in the Busch Series, is fifth in the points standings.

<P>
   Carelli to aide Harvick
</P>
<P>
   Rick Carelli and Kevin Harvick are rival drivers, but they will
be on the same team in tonight's Ram Tough 200. Carelli, who drove
the No. 6 Chevy to three career victories before getting hurt,
signed a one-race deal to be a consultant with Harvick's No. 98
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what my job responsibilities are. I'm just
gonna be there this weekend to sort of help them out,'' Carelli
said. ``It's really just a trial deal.'' Carelli is the defending
champion of the Ram Tough 200.

THINK AGAIN: ARE RANDOM CHOICES REALLY BEST?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (af)  
 By ALINE SULLIVAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can investors beat the market? Yes, says Professor Andrew W. Lo,
unfashionably.
</P>
<P>
   Lo teaches finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and was co-author of ``A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street,'' a new
book that takes pointed issue with the thesis of the 1973 book ``A
Random Walk Down Wall Street,'' by Burton G. Malkiel, and its
famous assertion that ``a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a
newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do
just as well as one carefully selected by the experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo does not see it that way. With enough expertise to identify
undervalued companies or discover price patterns, he and A. Craig
MacKinlay write, some people can beat the market, though most
investors would do best to stick with inexpensive index funds. Last
week, Lo took some time to explain his ideas and their
implications. Here are excerpts of the conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has your challenge to the conventional wisdom that index
funds will always outperform investment managers over the long haul
won you plaudits on Wall Street? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's funny. When ``A Random Walk Down Wall Street'' was
published, it was extremely controversial. But this hasn't been.
That is probably because I agree that it is very, very hard to beat
the market. But there are people out there who can do it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is market-beating more likely in specific sectors or markets,
say Internet issues or small-capitalization stocks generally? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are opportunities in every sector. But in some mature
sectors, such as mining, the opportunities are few and far between,
because they have been picked over by so many experienced analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the opportunities are greatest in the Internet sector,
because it is a new business in which the traditional valuation
models don't apply and because there are just so many uninformed
investors trading the stocks. The best bet is to figure out how
these investors analyze the companies and keep one step ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there more opportunities in less efficient markets away
from Wall Street? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The United States has the most sophisticated financial
markets in the world, which does not leave much room to maneuver.
But it also offers investors the greatest access to information and
the ability to execute trades quickly and efficiently. So it is a
mixed bag of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Equally attractive are markets that are on the cusp of being
able to trade electronically, such as those in Britain, Japan and
Australia, but don't yet have huge numbers of day traders.
</P>
<P>
   But opportunities come and go. More investors may be coming into
markets everywhere, but that doesn't mean that the markets are
really getting more efficient, even in the United States. It does
mean that there is more access for savvy investors who watch the
money flows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do informed investors have a greater edge in small caps that
few people follow? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The small-cap sector definitely has a lot of anomalies for
the savvy manager to exploit. Look at Manuel Asensio. He has done
very well by focusing exclusively on shorting securities. He is
able to piece together information in a different way and find
companies that have something wrong with them. Of course, that type
of advantage deteriorates over time, as others figure out the
technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there evidence that some managers can sustain success over
long periods? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Great investors need to have the right combination of
intuition, business sense and investment talent. Warren Buffett and
Peter Lynch have certainly added value for their investors over a
sustained period of time. So have some traders, such as George
Soros. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What insight would you offer to would-be great investors? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most people are overconfident about their own abilities. That
is probably a good thing. But we would be horrified if a
physician's aide engaged in heart surgery. Managing a portfolio is
almost as complicated. Most investors should work at becoming a lot
more savvy about their own risk perspective. Then they should turn
to the experts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can private investors identify the right experts to
consult? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ask why can they add value, and why hasn't it already been
done. If someone says he can do it because he is a smart guy _
well, there are a lot of smart guys out there, and very, very few
beat the market. But if it is because they are looking at data in a
way that no one ever has or have a new computer model, take a
closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Retaining an investment relationship is very complex. After an
investment professional has made a certain amount of money, say $20
million to $30 million, he or she doesn't have the same hunger to
make more. That is why Peter Lynch got out of Magellan, and it was
the right thing to do. Others don't know when to call it quits.

THEORY LINKS DROP IN CRIME TO RISE IN ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERICA GOODE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one is certain why crime rates have plummeted in the United
States over the last decade. But that fact has not prevented
politicians from gleefully taking credit for the downturn, or
academics from ruminating endlessly on its causes.
</P>
<P>
   The newest theory about why crime is down, however, put forward
in a report by two highly regarded economists, is drawing both
outrage and intense debate _ even before the full report has been
published or subjected to peer review.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Dr. John J. Donohue III of Stanford Law School
and Dr. Steven D. Levitt of the University of Chicago contend that
a large share of the drop in crime in the 1990s _ perhaps as much
as half _ can be attributed to the sharp increase in abortions
following the Supreme Court ruling in Roe vs. Wade in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer crimes are being committed now, the researchers contend,
because many of the children who might have grown up to commit
those crimes were never born. Within a few years of the Roe vs.
Wade decision, which established a constitutional right to
abortion, up to a quarter of pregnancies in the United States ended
in abortion, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue and Levitt base their thesis on economic analyses of
crime rates from 1985 to 1997, examined as a function of abortion
rates two decades before.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the decline in crime, they found, coincided with
the period when children born shortly after the Roe vs. Wade
decision would be reaching the late teen-age years _ the peak ages
for criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   States that were the first to legalize abortion, Donohue and
Levitt found, including New York, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii,
were also the first to experience a decrease in crime.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in states that legalized abortion in 1969 or 1970,
the researchers found, the cumulative decrease in crime between
1982 and 1997 was greater than for the rest of the nation. The
decrease in murder was 16.2 percent greater, the decrease in
violent crime over all was 34.4 percent greater, and the decrease
in property crime was 35.3 percent greater.
</P>
<P>
   Also, states with the highest abortion rates, the researchers
found, had larger reductions in crime than states with low abortion
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely explanation for these findings, the researchers
assert, is that abortion has occurred selectively, decreasing the
number of children likely to commit crimes as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the reduction,'' Levitt and Donohue write, ``appears
to be attributable to higher rates of abortion by mothers whose
children are most likely to be at risk for future crime.''
Teen-agers, unmarried women and black women, for example, have
higher rates of abortion, the researchers note, and children born
to mothers in these groups are statistically at higher risk for
crime in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The economic benefit to society of abortion in reducing crime,
the researchers suggest, ``may be on the order of $30 billion
annually.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of the report, a draft of which was posted on a
Web site of the Social Science Research Network, is not a popular
one. When it was reported in The Chicago Tribune on Aug. 8, it
provoked angry op-ed columns, tirades on radio talk shows and
expressions of indignation by groups on both sides of the abortion
divide.
</P>
<P>
   And the economists have been accused of everything from
promoting eugenics to recommending abortion as a means to reduce
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes great skill to simultaneously infuriate the right and
the left,'' said Dr. Alfred Blumstein, an expert on crime rates and
University Professor at the Heinz School of Carnegie Mellon
University, observing the ferocity of the response.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Joseph Scheidler, executive director of the
Pro-Life Action League, called the study ``so fraught with
stupidity that I hardly know where to start refuting it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally if you kill off amillion and a half people a
year,''  &UR; S &LR; cheidler said, ``a few criminals will be in that number.
So will doctors, philosophers, musicians and artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, an
organization based in Washington, commented that even if the
report's findings were right, ``the question in a certain sense is,
`So what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has any policy implications whatsoever,'' Ms.
Kissling said. ``Abortion is a profoundly private decision'' that
women make based on ``their own lives and circumstances,'' and not
public benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And in a recent column, Carl Rowan wrote, ``I've seen a lot of
far-fetched and dangerous ideas passed off as `social research,'
but none more shallow and potentially malicious than the claim that
the drop in crime in the United States can be attributed to
legalized abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumstein and other criminal justice experts acknowledged that
the economists may well have demonstrated that abortion rates have
had an effect on crime, though until the paper is published and
subjected to academic scrutiny, they said, it is difficult to
assess the findings.
</P>
<P>
   But they expressed skepticism that abortion's effect on crime
was as great as Donohue and Levitt posited. Declining crime rates,
Blumstein said, appear to be the result of many complicated
factors, including the dwindling of the crack cocaine epidemic, an
improved economy, greater job opportunities for low-income youth
and the steady growth of the prison population.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Changing attitudes among teen-agers and innovative policing
strategies may also be contributors, other experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very able guys,'' Blumstein said of Donohue and
Levitt, ``and I'm prepared to believe that they've discerned an
effect. But I think they've gone too far in claiming that it can
account for half of the decline, when there are a multitude of
effects going on that are much more proximate to the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David J. Garrow, a historian at Emory University and author
of ``Liberty and Sexuality'' (University of California Press,
1998), a history of the abortion debate, called the economists'
theory ``interesting and original.'' But he questioned the
researchers' knowledge of abortion history and was skeptical of the
usefulness of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy implication of this paper is that if you renewed
Medicaid funding for abortion at the federal level, you'd
dramatically reduce crime 17 years from now,'' Garrow said. ``But
are we going to find any interest group in America that is going to
make that argument? No. Neither side in the debate wants to touch
it with a 10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Levitt said in an interview that the research was
``by no means a complete explanation'' and that he and Donohue were
aware ``that the world is complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that they did not intend their work to influence public
policy. ``Our paper should have little to no impact on any policy
regarding abortion,'' Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in our paper that either indirectly or
directly suggests that we condone denying anyone the right to have
children if they want to have children,'' Levitt added. ``We've
been accused of having a eugenic agenda and it just is not an
accurate appraisal of what we're doing at all. If anything, what
our paper says is that when you remove a government prohibition
against a woman choosing, the woman makes choices that lead to
better outcomes for her children.''

 SPORTS COLUMN:   McGWIRE'S ACT BACK AT SHEA 
 (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is where we came in. Unlike the movies, however,
this is no time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Before the days of tenplexes and sixteenplexes, some moviegoers
would arrive at theaters after the movie started, watch the rest of
it, then see the part they missed when it immediately started over
and leave when one of them said, ``This is where we came in.''
</P>
<P>
   But just because the St. Louis Cardinals come to Shea Stadium
Friday night on the exact same date that they visited Queens last
season is no reason for fans to leave and miss the rest of the Mark
McGwire Show.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's back, he's still hitting home runs and he's still
worth watching; his act has not grown stale. In fact, McGwire may
be even more remarkable the second time around. His record surge of
70 home runs last season certainly did not sate his appetite for
launching majestic 450-foot fly balls followed by those 360-foot
trots around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire meets the New York Mets with a steadily ascending number
of home runs, 48 at the moment but not for long. Last season, the
teams played a doubleheader at Shea on this date, Aug. 20, and
McGwire arrived with 49 home runs. Before the first game, he
maintained his cautious approach to talk of breaking Roger Maris'
record of 61, even though he needed only 13 home runs in the
Cardinals' remaining 38 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody gets to 50 by September, they have a shot down the
stretch run to either tie, break or get close to it,'' McGwire
said, stating what he said had been his longtime view and refusing
to acknowledge that he had a chance to break the record. But, it
was noted with Einsteinian mathematical deduction, 49 was only one
away from 50. ``I'll say it once I hit 50,'' he said. ``I gotta
stick with my statement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of the first game of the doubleheader,
McGwire drove away the cautious approach, hitting No. 50 against
Willie Blair, a Mets relief pitcher. In the first inning of the
second game, he connected for No. 51 against Rick Reed, putting him
only 10 away from the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say I do have a shot,'' McGwire conceded after the
doubleheader, ``but it's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough? It might have been tough for McGwire to play under the
pressure and the attention he created for himself, but it sure
didn't look tough. He didn't just break the record; he obliterated
it. Whacking a 509-foot home run here, a 501-foot home run there,
McGwire slugged 19 more home runs. When Maris broke Babe Ruth's
legendary record, he squeaked by it by one. After McGwire reached
62, he hit eight more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost before No. 70 landed beyond the left-field fence at Busch
Stadium on the final day of the season, people were asking McGwire
if he thought his record would ever be broken. A silly question, of
course, and McGwire has refused to address the thought this season.
</P>
<P>
   But here he is coming into Shea Stadium with 40 games remaining
and needing 23 to reach 71. Sounds like a lot of ground to cover in
a short time, right? But last season, McGwire hit 23 home runs in
the Cardinals' last 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one difference between this series and the other
series the Mets and the Cardinals have played the past two seasons,
it's that Rick Reed will not be pitching in it. McGwire has hit six
home runs against Mets pitchers last season (four) and this (two),
and Reed has thrown three of the pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched to him in spring training, so it's no big surprise
to me,'' said Octavio Dotel, the Mets' rookie, who is scheduled to
face McGwire Sunday. But, a reporter said to the youngster, ``This
is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Dotel responded. ``I don't worry about all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tam, who was playing cards with Dotel, looked up at that
point and said, ``He hits them off everybody, doesn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Just about. McGwire has hit home runs so frequently the past few
seasons that few pitchers have been able to avoid his magical bat.
On May 8 of last season, he hit the 400th of his career against
Reed at Shea, and just 15 months later he hit No. 500. No one, not
Babe Ruth, not Henry Aaron, had ever reached those milestones in
successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Now McGwire has 505 home runs. He is already 15th on the career
list. If he hits 17 more this season, he will catapult himself into
the top 10 at No. 10, leapfrogging Mel Ott, Eddie Mathews, Ernie
Banks, Ted Williams and Willie McCovey. And next season he can
surpass Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Reggie Jackson,
Harmon Killebrew and Frank Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, with just 65 home runs this season and another 65
next, or any combination of 130, certainly not beyond the realm of
McGwire's possibility, he can gobble up that historic home run
ground as if it were a game of pepper. At the end of the first
season beginning with a 2, McGwire can be No. 4, trailing only
Aaron, Ruth and Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   Like home runs or not, fans, baseball people and the rest of us
have to realize this is a prodigious feat we are witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a person just like me,'' Dotel said. ``I don't have to be
scared. I know he's a great player and I respect him, but I don't
have to be scared of him.''
</P>
<P>
   No pitcher should be. But pitchers and hitters alike should be
in awe of the heights McGwire has scaled. He has made the show
worth sitting through again.

   Walt Disney Co. says it will sell its Fairchild Publishing

   This week's volatility in stock markets across Asia can be
traced to a team of anonymous number-crunchers in Geneva, who made

 &HT;    Atlanta family pieces together tragedy of Turkey earthquake
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice and Julie Bryant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For 12 hours, as they lay pinned in the rubble of
their collapsed apartment building in northwest Turkey, Nizam Kilic
talked to his daughter-in-law, Jan. He told her to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic is married to one of Nizam's sons, Bubar, a Marietta
anesthesiologist. She and their five children were vacationing with
her in-laws in the resort town of Yalova when the five-story
building in which they were sleeping collapsed during Tuesday's
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Kilic did his best to comfort her amid the fear and the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she couldn't hear him anymore. He stopped talking,'' said
Cigdem Kilic, who is married to another of Nizam's three sons and
also lives in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Kilic and four of Jan's children died. Nizam Kilic's wife,
Turkan, suffered severe head injuries and is partially paralyzed.
She remained in critical condition Thursday night at a Turkish
hospital. Jan Kilic also suffered head injuries but was conscious
at American Hospital in Istanbul. One daughter, Natalie, 3 1/2, was
pulled out of the rubble. Her only injury: a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, as fresh details emerge, the magnitude of disaster
grows more clear.
</P>
<P>
   The death count climbed Thursday to more than 7,000. But that
number is expected to increase significantly, with 35,000 listed as
missing. Another 34,000 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The five Kilic family members were the only confirmed American
fatalities so far.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Natalie's siblings _ Jeffrey, 6, Jennifer, 5, and
David, 2 _ died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jan heard the youngest baby cry a little bit,'' Cigdem
Kilic said. ``Then she didn't hear her anymore either.''
</P>
<P>
   That youngest baby, Katie, was born Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion and lack of communication, word is
starting to get back to Georgia about what happened early Tuesday
morning halfway around the world. Jan Kilic's parents were able to
talk with her by phone for the first time Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had some head swelling that's going down and some lower
back and neck problems, but she's expected to make a full
recovery,'' said her brother, Billy Kemp. ``She's tired, but
clinging to the fact that Natalie survived.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a hope she didn't have at first.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 hours, she lay trapped beneath rubble. Then she and her
mother-in-law were rescued minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan was on her way to a makeshift hospital and she thought all
of her children were dead,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie was pulled out 12 hours later. Jan Kilic would not find
out about her daughter's survival for nearly two days.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic's own rescue came about because of the valor and
determination of emergency officials and some of her husband's
family still living in Turkey. They refused to leave the area
despite a mandatory evacuation because of a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was because of their extraordinary efforts that there were
three survivors out of 100-plus people who died in that building,''
Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kilics are the only known survivors of the building
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``His relatives risked their lives by climbing and digging
through the rubble,'' said Cigdem Kilic. ``One of them saw
something in the corner, but someone said that person was dead.
Then his cousin saw dust moving up and down around her nose and
realized she was breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers lifted Jan Kilic up and found Jennifer underneath.
Jennifer and Jeffrey ``looked like they were sleeping,'' Cigdem
Kilic said. Katie and David were more badly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Bubar Kilic and his two brothers, also Marietta
anesthesiologists, arrived in Turkey on Thursday. Bubar, who had
stayed in Marietta, was supposed to join his family this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Jan Kilic in the hospital, the three brothers
took an ambulance by ferry to the seaside resort of Yalova to bring
the bodies back to Istanbul. Yalova is a popular vacation
destination for many middle class Turkish families, and the Kilics
have a summer home there.
</P>
<P>
   Babur Kilic and his older brothers, Timur and Cengiz, found the
bodies at a makeshift morgue at an ice skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   Timur and Cengiz Kilic carried out the bodies in their arms and
transported them by ambulance to the morgue at American Hospital in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babur has not seen the kids yet,'' said Cigdem Kilic, Timur's
wife. ``Tim did not want him to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Timur Kilic described for his wife a scene of devastation unlike
any he could ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband said this was the worst day of his life,'' she
said. ``He was crying. He's a doctor and he sees dead people, and
he said he's never seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kilics want to bring Jan and Turkan back to the United
States for treatment as soon as possible. They also want to bring
back the other family members for burial in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in touch with the State Department, arranging
transportation for the bodies to be flown back here,'' Billy Kemp
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Marietta, worried family and friends continued their vigil,
some searching for news, others seeking solace. Few found meaning.
</P>
<P>
   At the two-story east Cobb home of Jan and Bubar Kilic, a steady
flow of cars pulled into the driveway. Inside, family members who
had come from out of state tried to bring comfort.
</P>
<P>
   In a family room, they talked quietly as they watched CNN
coverage of the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, teachers and administrators from the Casa dei Bambini
Montessori, where four of the Kilic children attended, held a quiet
service at the Holy Family Church in Cobb County. School director
Florence Johnson said the school would continue to support the
family through prayers and close communication.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners at Mount Vernon Baptist Church, where Jan Kilic
worshipped, remembered a vibrant and loving family.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sam Boyd said Jan Kilic joined about six years ago and
is involved in a women's Bible study, Sunday school and worship
services. Her husband, known to his friends as ``Bobby,'' is not a
member but comes occasionally.
</P>

   ``It's quite devastating,'' said Gwen Jenkins, preschool
minister at Mount Vernon. ``I've been in a state of shock.
Different ones of them will flash in my mind, and I know I'll never
get to see them again _ not in this life.

<P>
   ``I'll not get to see Jennifer coming down the hall with her
blonde hair swinging. Little David always had a smile on his face.
He was learning to talk and was always trying to tell me something.
Of course, I didn't always know what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Natalie is just getting to the verbal stage and is
expressing herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffrey was always the big brother. He was always looking out
for the little ones. When Jan would drop them off at their
classrooms, he would tell them, `Go on in, now''' and make sure
they got in OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katie, the youngest, was so sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be quite a loss for our preschool.''
</P>
<P>
   She said faith will help them get through this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that one day we'll get to see them again,'' Jenkins
said. ``When we get to heaven, they'll welcome us. Were it not for
our faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I can't imagine
being able to cope with something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The first test will come this weekend.

<P>
   ``I'm not sure what Sunday morning is going to hold,'' Boyd

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a battle between two giant publishing
companies, Walt Disney Co. has decided to sell its Fairchild
Publishing division, which publishes Women's Wear Daily and W, for
$650 million to Conde Nast Publications, the glossy, high-profile
publisher of magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would merge two of the fashion world's most powerful
publishing entities and their distinct publishing styles: the
frills-free but provocative style of Fairchild with the
no-expenses-spared ethos of Conde Nast, a company that will send
luggage overnight by Federal Express if a fatigued fashion editor
does not want to carry it on a flight. A Disney executive said the
agreement would be announced either Friday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications,
and Disney confirmed that S.I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Conde
Nast, had offered close to $650 million for the company _ which
includes influential trade publications like Women's Wear Daily and
Daily News Record and consumer fashion magazines W and Jane _ and
that Disney executives had accepted Newhouse's offer. Executives at
Hearst Magazines, the other bidder for Fairchild and the publisher
of magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Town &AMP; Country, would not
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which is not the largest financial transaction in the
magazine industry in recent years but one of the most influential,
will certainly alter the advertising landscape that preoccupies
magazine publishers. Fairchild publishes Women's Wear Daily, the
influential daily that covers the American fashion industry and
determines the fortunes of designers, and W, one of the
fastest-growing and profitable consumer fashion titles in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will assure Conde Nast's continued dominance in
the fashion magazine industry, in part because advertisers will be
offered package rates to advertise in several magazines at once,
including both Vogue and W.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes advertising rates more attractive because Conde Nast
can put W in with the rest of the package,'' said Roberta
Garfinkle, the director of print media at the McCann-Erickson
advertising agency. ``That's the key. And advertisers will be drawn
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And designers said that the purchase signaled Conde Nast's
continued confidence in the fashion industry. ``I think that,
unlike Harper's Bazaar, which has to change drastically, Women's
Wear and W are not going to change too much, because they are both
so successful,'' Bill Blass said. ``They both have a unique niche
in the fashion industry, and they are unlike anybody else. They are
daring, but with a certain restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   The merging of the companies means that Conde Nast will own more
fashion advertising dollars than any other magazine publisher. That
is an expanding field worth hundreds of millions of dollars in
revenue each year and includes advertising for toiletries and
cosmetics, apparel and accessories, home furnishings and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel and accessories advertisers spent $536 million in
American magazines from January to July this year, an increase of
8.8 percent compared with the period a year earlier, according to
the Publishers Information Bureau. Virtually every fashion designer
_ from Calvin Klein to Donna Karan _ is expanding into home
furnishings and supplies, an advertising category that is up 16.2
percent, to $614 million for January to July. And retail
advertising is up 32.2 percent, to $313 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the deal, W magazine, has taken apparel advertising
from magazines at both Hearst and Conde Nast. In 1998, W boasted
2,005 advertising pages for the year, while Harper's Bazaar _
previously second to Vogue _ lagged behind at 1,542. Vogue led the
field with 2,681 pages of advertising last year, and in second
place, with 2,068 pages, was Elle, published by the
Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines unit of Lagardere Group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, W generated $33.5 million in advertising revenue for
Fairchild, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, and by
1998 that figure had increased to $87.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet what Conde Nast proposes to do with the
numerous trade titles that Fairchild publishes _ small, profitable
publications like Supermarket News, Brand Marketing, Footwear News
and Children's Business _ but one Conde Nast executive said that
the company would prefer to keep them because they turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Los Angeles magazine, also published under the
Fairchild umbrella, is also not clear. A Disney executive said that
Disney might prefer to keep that magazine as a kind of home-town
periodical.

</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Disney has wrestled with the issue of
whether to sell Fairchild since 1995, when Disney _ never a
traditional magazine publisher _ acquired Capital Cities/ABC, then
the longtime parent company of Fairchild. And for a while,
Fairchild seemed destined for the auction block: in 1997, Disney
even announced a decision to sell the division, then retracted it a
week later. But Disney has been under pressure recently from Wall
Street to revive its core businesses, such as its theme parks and
movie studio and sell its nonstrategic assets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already sold some of the noncore assets it
acquired with Capital Cities. In April 1997, Disney sold four
newspapers acquired in the deal, including The Kansas City Star and
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Disney sold the trade publisher Chilton to the
British-Dutch company Reed Elsevier for $447 million and
Institutional Investor Inc. to Euromoney Publications for $142
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen P. Black, the president of Hearst Magazines, was eager
to acquire Fairchild, a Disney executive said. And a deal with
Hearst seemed almost a fait accompli because the Hearst Corp. has
several affiliations with Disney: Hearst television stations are
affiliates of ABC, which is owned by Disney, and Hearst owns 20
percent of ESPN, of which ABC owns the balance. Hearst also owns a
small piece of ESPN magazine. And ABC and Hearst are both investors
in two cable services: Lifetime and Arts and Entertainment. But the
Hearst Corp.'s recent acquisition of The San Francisco Chronicle
for $500 million may have chilled the company's ardor for more
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for Disney and Hearst declined to comment. Maurie
Perl, a spokeswoman for Conde Nast, said that the company did not
comment on acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In the famously gossip-prone magazine industry, where glee at
other's misfortune is freely displayed and fortunes rise and fall
with the speed of a season's hemlines, the purchase of Fairchild
further cements the intensifying rivalry between Conde Nast and
Hearst Magazines, which is as competitive as two avid New York
shoppers fighting for the last pair of discounted Manolo Blahnik
slippers at a Seventh Avenue sample sale.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tina Brown _ who edited two Conde Nast titles, Vanity
Fair and The New Yorker _ signed on with Hearst to produce her new
magazine, Talk. (The other partner in Talk is Miramax Films, a unit
of Disney.) In June, Hearst announced that Katherine Betts, the
fashion news director at Vogue, would become editor in chief of its
primary fashion title, Harper's Bazaar _ and Ms. Betts has hired at
least four of her former Conde Nast colleagues to accompany her in
remaking the magazine, earning the ire of her former co-workers at
Conde Nast.

BRADY EXCITED ABOUT BIGGER OFFENSIVE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A couple of times a day, Marcus Brady gets a
chance to see the improvement in Cal State Northridge's offensive
linemen. As the Matadors' starting quarterback, Brady couldn't be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a big difference,'' Brady said. ``They're out there
working hard and getting them in shape. Coach (Bob) Connelly is
getting them ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady gained 392 yards rushing as a freshman last year. He lost
360, mainly because he was sacked 49 times.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the pounding he was taking last year, some
wondered if Brady, the Big Sky Conference's Newcomer of the Year,
was going to be able to take three more years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Ponciano, CSUN's former head coach, hired Connelly away from
Texas A&AMP;M, where Connelly was a graduate assistant, and brought in
massive offensive linemen like Johnny Acosta (6-foot-5, 300 pounds)
and Ernie Fierro (6-4, 300).
</P>
<P>
   Acosta and Fierro, along with incumbent starters Julio Alcala
(6-4, 285) and Keith Kincaid (6-4, 285) have helped the offensive
line become a strength instead of a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started in the spring, when I got here,'' Connelly
said. ``It is a young group, but (the players) have made great
strides. Coach Ponciano wanted more toughness; a more physical
offensive line to help the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady says a better offensive line means a better running game _
CSUN averaged just 84 yards per game on the ground last season _
which, in turn, means less obvious passing situations where he can
get sacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we can keep defenses on their heels,'' Connelly
said. ``There's no question that will be a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   The line has been bolstered in the past two days by the addition
of Javier Ortiz, a sophomore transfer from Fresno State. Ortiz, who
is 6-2 and 290, already has shown versatility to play center or
guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors also could get more help if Taffe Aina (6-5, 305)
becomes eligible. Aina has dropped almost 50 pounds since spring
and if he is cleared to play will start at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   __ Butterflies: Bruce Molock hears the grunts, the snarls and
the chippy comments from the defense when he lines up in the
backfield during team drills.
</P>
<P>
   Molock is a freshman from Antelope Valley High. He and fellow
rookie running backs Marquis Brignac (Taft), Brandon McElvaine
(Highland) and fullback Crayton Milton (St. Francis) are targeted
when they get into the backfield _ simply because they are
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, I was a little intimidated,'' said Molock,
an All-Golden League selection last year. ``It's like playing in an
all-star game but faster.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bumps and bruises: Senior noseguard Sean Beard hurt his right
leg in a field-goal drill Thursday morning. Beard, who broke the
same leg when he was leg-whipped in the Southern Utah game last
season, was helped off the field and was walking with a cane an
hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman offensive lineman Isaac Aronson, who at 6-7 is the
tallest player on the team, broke his right hand last week and
hasn't been able to do more than run. Aronson was expected to
redshirt this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready to go: Sean Atkins shows up for every practice, knowing
that even if his eligibility issue is resolved, he won't be able to
play this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Atkins, a sophomore defensive back from San Fernando High,
is hoping to get three full years with CSUN instead of two. He
transferred in the spring from fellow Big Sky member Sacramento
State, and under NCAA rules, players who transfer within a
conference must sit out two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Atkins said he wasn't supposed to get any scholarship money
until the spring, after he played sparingly last fall. He decided
to transfer to CSUN when his younger brother, Bryson, a defensive
back from Alemany High, signed with the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shannon, CSUN's compliance director, is working with the
NCAA to get Sean Atkins cleared to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Shannon) is working on it as we speak,'' Atkins said.

ALCOA AND REYNOLDS REACH MERGER AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcoa Inc., the world's oldest and largest aluminum company,
announced Thursday that it had agreed to merge with the No. 3
producer, Reynolds Metals Co., in a relatively swift negotiation
that left some Reynolds shareholders grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In an all-stock deal, Reynolds' shareholders will receive 1.06
shares of Alcoa for each Reynolds share. At Wednesday's closing
price of $66.875 for Alcoa, this deal would be valued at around
$4.4 billion, or $70.8875 a share for Reynolds' stockholders. While
accepting this deal, however, Reynolds left open the door for
another buyer to come along, as both companies agreed to allow
Reynolds to solicit takeover bids for the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, which made its first bid for Reynolds last week, agreed
to this somewhat unusual clause because Alcoa executives believed
that Reynolds would find no other bidders, people close to the
merger talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 day shopping-window allows Reynolds, which has been
looking for a potential buyer for nearly a year now, to placate
shareholders who have been angry at Reynolds' management for not
selling the company earlier and for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge against Reynolds is Richard Grubman, managing
director at Highfields Capital Management, a Boston firm that owns
6 percent of Reynolds. In a letter to the Reynolds' board Thursday,
Grubman said, ``You have allowed Alcoa to steal the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubman was especially angered by a rejection last March by
Jeremiah J. Sheehan, the chief executive of Reynolds, of a
1.42-a-share exchange offer from Alcoa. At the time Sheehan was
telling shareholders that no one was interested in acquiring
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your behavior is reprehensible,'' Grubman wrote, adding, ``You
sold us out.'' Grubman also accused Reynolds of ``squandering $2
billion of shareholder value'' and said that Reynolds ``effectively
lied to shareholders'' and ``has reached a new low in corporate
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Grubman nor Reynolds would comment on this letter
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day solicitation window also allows McCook Metals, owned
by the Chicago investment firm Michigan Partners, to make a bid, if
it is interested. Last week, McCook wrote to Reynolds expressing
interest in topping Alcoa's bid, but provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers close to the deal said McCook did not seem serious:
``There was no price, no financing, no nothing. It was all air,''
one said. Calls to McCook Metals were not returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to make it difficult for anyone to halt this merger, the
agreement between Alcoa and Reynolds also contains a $100 million
break-up fee, which would increase the cost of acquiring Reynolds
by about $1.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the deal is completed, Alcoa would still remain the
world's No. 2 aluminum producer after APA, a new company to be
created by the three-company, two-continent merger of Alcan
Aluminium Ltd. of Canada, Pechiney in France and Alusuisse Lonza
Group of Switzerland. That three-way $17.6 billion merger, was
announced last week and would create a huge global competitor for
Alcoa, with projected revenues of $21.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   An Alcoa-Reynolds merger would create a company with $20.5
billion in projected revenues and 120,000 employees in 36
countries. But nearly all those revenues would be derived from
aluminum production, while around $4 billion of APA's projected
revenues would come from non-aluminum assets. This merger wave was
brought on by global overcapacity for aluminum and prices that have
plunged to five-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is good for Alcoa, good for Reynolds shareholders
and good for the aluminum industry,'' said Richard Aldrich, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``With fewer players, there will be
less redundant capacity, which is a long-term plus for the
industry.'' Aldrich dismissed Grubman's complaints as ``20-20
hindsight'' and said he doubted another buyer would come along, but
cautioned that ``anything is possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alcoa and Reynolds executives said they expected that combining
the two companies would realize around $200 million in cost savings
_ a number some analysts said was low _ and they expected antitrust
problems to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious antitrust problem is that the two companies
would represent more than 50 percent of the smelting capacity in
the United States, although analysts say the companies will
probably argue that smelting, a low-margin commodity business,
should be viewed as a global industry, and not as a domestic one.
</P>
<P>
   Other problem areas are minimal. Reynolds is best known for
making such consumer products as aluminum foil and beverage cans,
while Alcoa makes aluminum for heavy industries like planes and
autos. While both companies serve the auto industry, Alcoa is
bigger in castings like engine blocks, while Reynolds makes
aluminum components for wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The two overlap in producing alumina, a compound from which
aluminum is produced. In 1997, Reynolds sold an Alabama rolling
mill to another buyer, after the government rejected its sale to
Alcoa. As a result, say analysts, another antitrust impediment was
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that there won't be some asset divestiture,''
said James Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research. ``But I do
believe that the companies are complementary. Alcoa's management
has said that Reynolds begins where Alcoa stops and I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Alain J.P. Belda, Alcoa's chief executive, said, ``The new
company will be better positioned to address the ongoing
globalization of the metals industry and the new competitive
landscape this is creating.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' chief executive, Sheehan, said, ``Reynolds
shareholders will receive an attractive price for their shares and
still have the opportunity to participate in the upside potential
of the combined company.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tumazos, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the proposed
union ``creates no problems, only opportunities.'' His only concern
was that the automakers, as major users of aluminum, might seek to
lock in long-term, low-price aluminum supply contracts from the
combined company to protect themselves from any potential
monopolistic pricing.

DOLLAR'S DROP AGAINST YEN RENEWS FOCUS ON U.S. POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JAPAN-BANKS, ASIA-MARKETPLACE, TRADE-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An apparent shift in Japanese policy and the report of a record
U.S. trade deficit helped send the dollar lower Thursday against
the Japanese yen and the new European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar, despite its recent 4 percent plunge against the
yen, remains healthy against the world's other major currencies.
Against the euro, which was predicted by many analysts to rally
after its January debut, the dollar is still up almost 10 percent
this year. The dollar also rose Thursday against the currencies of
two of the United States' major trading partners, Canada and
Mexico. Adjusted for trade patterns, the dollar is just above its
20-year average value against all its trading partners, according
to Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there has not been across-the-board selling against
the dollar,'' said Paul Podolosky, a currency strategist at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts are worried that the growing American trade
deficit could be a problem for the dollar in the future, as it was
in the late 1980s. In addition, if the American economy begins to
slow down as the rest of the world is reviving, that could put more
downward pressure on the dollar as investors leave the American
markets and the dollar to invest in markets that appear to have
more potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, however, a falling dollar would not
necessarily be a problem for the United States, analysts said, as
long as the decline was orderly and not extreme.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading Thursday, it cost $1.06300 to buy one euro
compared with $1.05230 on Wednesday, a 1 percent fall in the
dollar's value. Against the Japanese yen, the move was smaller
because much bigger declines came earlier in the week. On Thursday,
the dollar slipped to 111.40 yen against the dollar, down from
112.03 on Wednesday. The dollar fell 1.8 percent against the yen on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the selloff of the dollar against the Japanese yen
that has refocused attention on the dollar and, at the same time,
American policy toward it. During this slide against the yen, some
analysts have begun to raise questions about Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers' commitment to the strong-dollar policy of his
predecessor, Robert Rubin. Although Summers has supported the
policy in public statements, doubts about his commitment _ even if
mistaken _ have undermined the dollar a little, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar selloff and yen rally began in early July when the
dollar was worth about 122 yen. Since then, the value of the dollar
against the yen has declined more than 9 percent. The driving force
has been the move by big institutional investors back into the
Japanese stock market, which has soared this year. That move was
prompted by the expectation _ based so far on just one quarter's
economic data _ that the Japanese economy is turning around.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerated move this week was set off by comments from
Japanese officials that analysts have interpreted to indicate that
the government is not ready to intervene in the currency markets to
support the yen. That is a switch from a policy of aggressive
intervention to weaken the yen earlier this summer. In June and
July, the Japanese sold yen for dollars six times in an effort to
keep the value of the yen from rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government, through the Bank of Japan, had
intervened because of the fear that the rapidly appreciating yen _
as the dollar declines _ would undermine the economy. A stronger
yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and less competitive. And
a slump in exports could derail what is, at best, a struggling
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think intervention is imminent,'' said Karen Parker,
director of currency research at Chase Manhattan Bank. Until this
week, many traders expected intervention at the 110-yen level.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the switch, Ms. Parker said, is the
realization by the Japanese that intervention, without the
participation of the United States, is not working. In addition,
Japanese officials are hoping that their economy is on the rebound,
which would make the rebound in the yen less worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   With the apparent change in policy, Ms. Parker said she thought
the yen could move to a value of 105 to 108 to the dollar. At that
point, she said, intervention would be more likely.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in the euro on Thursday was started by a report that
the German business-confidence index, compiled by the IFO economic
research institute in Munich, rose to 93.6 in July from 92.9 in
June, the third consecutive monthly gain. A strong increase in the
confidence report in July helped set off the rally in the euro at
the end of last month. At that point, the euro, the new currency of
11 European countries, was down 13 percent for the year. Since
then, it has risen almost 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced that the
trade deficit jumped to $24.6 billion in June, a record.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit has not been a problem for the dollar or the
American economy so far. In fact, as the deficit was increasing
over the last year, the dollar was strengthening.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker said the deficit could be more of a drag on the
dollar now, given the changing circumstances of the world economy.
Last year, when Asian economies were in recession and Europe was
sluggish, it was easy to attract foreign investment here to cover
the deficit. But with Europe and Asia rebounding, that could get a
little more difficult. And to attract investors who are seeing new
opportunities elsewhere, the dollar may have to weaken, interest
rates rise and stocks stop climbing.

 Looking for a Few Good Recruits
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Florenda De Vera woke before dawn two days ago, kissed civilian
life goodbye and took off on a journey that probably will change
her forever _ a four-year enlistment in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more excited than scared,'' De Vera confided in a phone
call before her departure for Lackland, Texas, where the Air Force
puts recruits through six weeks of basic training.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old graduate of San Francisco's Lowell High School
explained why she took what some of her friends consider a radical
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of cousins and friends who go through college but
don't have a stable job, they just party,'' she said. ``I don't see
myself that way. I want to succeed at an early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sentiment, music to the ears of military recruiters, is a
song they don't hear often enough these days. For the first time
since the draft ended in 1973, some services can't find enough
recruits to fill their ranks. The Pentagon was shocked last year
when the Navy fell 7,000 recruits shy of its target of 55,000 new
``boots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time any service missed its goal,'' said
Defense Department spokesman Tom Begines. ``We think the booming
economy is a major factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the draft ended after the Vietnam War, the military has
been able to fill its ranks by appeals to patriotism and adventure
as well as through offers of job training and cash inducements. The
most popular lure has been the promise that Uncle Sam will pay up
to $50,000 to help veterans go to college after their four years of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   But Begines, an Army lieutenant colonel, said today's bullish
job market makes military service less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jobs are plentiful, and young people who want to go to college
have a lot more money available to them, especially from the
states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Navy seems to have rebounded from its 1998
recruiting shortfall, this year the Air Force expects to miss its
goal of 34,000 recruits by 2,000. The Army also may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   These woes have sparked a few comments about reviving the draft,
but military planners don't consider that a serious possibility _
leaving recruiting brass like Lt. Col. Robert Spracale, who
oversees Air Force recruiting in Northern California, to face 18-
to 25-year-olds who have many options besides the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to attract kids who can earn $10 an hour at the
In-n-Out Burger,'' Spracale lamented. ``Why would they leave home
and momma while they can stay at home, buy a car and go to
school?''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is so concerned about hitting its recruiting
target that it recently employed its favorite tactic _ it called in
an air strike. A TV air strike, that is.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Air Force will buy TV advertising this
year. It has a $76 million budget to broadcast four 30-second
spots, including one in Spanish, touting enlistment as a way to
earn money for college or learn job skills.
</P>
<P>
   The new Air Force campaign is part of the $268 million that all
four armed services will spend this year on TV ads. The largest
share, $95 million, will go to the Army, which has the biggest
recruiting target _ and has achieved just 86 percent of its goal so
far this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these sudden recruiting shortfalls, there seems to be
little serious discussion of reviving the draft. At a recent press
briefing, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that while a few
members of Congress were talking about the draft, the House
Appropriations Committee voted to end funding for the Selective
Service _ the system that requires 18-year-olds to register in case
the draft is ever revived.
</P>
<P>
   Because they don't expect _ or necessarily want _ a return to
the draft, military planners have struggled to understand their
recruiting woes. Begines, the Pentagon spokesman, explained that
the economy isn't the only factor. Rather, the bullish civilian job
market seems to have tipped the scales on a good-news, bad-news
scenario that has been sneaking up on recruiters ever since the
collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for recruiters has been that since the end of the
Cold War, the armed forces have shrunk from 2.1 million in 1989 to
1.36 million today.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has reduced recruiting needs, Begines said. A
decade ago, the armed forces had to sign up 300,000 youngsters a
year to fill their ranks. A smaller military means recruiters need
only 200,000 warm bodies this year.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the shrinking military also has hurt recruitment
by reducing the pool of veterans in civilian life. Research
indicates that more than 70 percent of new enlistees have a family
member with prior military service. Half have a parent who served.
With fewer role models around to encourage prospects, recruiters
have had a tougher time getting young people to consider military
service, Begines said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has done polls to measure the willingness of young
men _ and more recently young women _ to consider military service.
Willingness to serve has dropped since 1989. A decade ago, 26
percent of white men and 54 percent of black men professed a
willingness to serve. The latest polls show just 20 percent of
whites and 30 percent of blacks are ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Polls that break out Hispanic men, going back to the mid-'90s,
show they have the highest propensity to serve _ about 44 percent
in the 1998 survey.
</P>
<P>
   In regard to women, a 1998 survey reveals that 7 percent of
white women, 23 percent of black women and 26 percent of Hispanics
said they would consider enlistment in one of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup of the armed forces during the past 20 years has
changed correspondingly, with greater numbers of minorities and
women in uniform. In 1976, whites constituted 76 percent of those
in uniform, blacks 16.6 percent, Hispanics 4.6 percent and Asian
Americans 2.8 percent. By 1997, whites had shrunk to 65 percent of
those in uniform, with blacks and Hispanics increasing to 22.1
percent and 7.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, women have increased their presence in the military,
rising from 4.6 percent of all military personnel in 1976 to 13.7
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Within these economic and societal trends, recruiters hustle to
meet their annual quotas. Ironically, despite its booming economy
and liberal reputation, Northern California produces close to its
share of enlistments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relative to our size, we are one of the strongest recruiting
areas in the nation for the Marine Corps,'' said Maj. Paul Kennedy,
whose Alameda command hit its goal last year, enlisting 1,065 good
men _ and 75 good women.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the Corps so far has been immune to the recruiting
woes facing the other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're familiar with marketing strategies, the Marines have
a well-identified brand,'' he said. ``Our pitch is: `Do you have
what it takes to be one of us.' That's different from the other
services, which stress what's in it for the recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   A sample of this approach occurred during the recent X-Games, a
sporting event held this year in San Francisco _ and one the
Marines has sponsored for the past three years. At this year's
event, the Marines set up a booth that challenged people to do
chin-ups. Over nine days, 7,000 men and women tried to do the 20
pull-ups needed to pass a Marine fitness test.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Hogue, a spokesman for the Army's Northern California
recruiting command in Sacramento, stressed incentives in explaining
how local Army recruiters hope to meet their goal of 5,200
enlistees _ when they're only at 60 percent of quota with less than
two months to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got a message: There's a $4,000 bonus for people who
enlist between now and September 30,'' Hogue said.
</P>
<P>
   Such bonuses are one-time rewards that get added to the normal
lures when services seem shy of reaching their quotas. By far the
most popular regular inducement to military service is the ability
to earn money to go to college. Recruits can earn up to $30,000 for
a two-year hitch, or $50,000 for a four-year commitment. The money
is paid out by the Veterans Administration after the person leaves
the service and enrolls in college. The top payment of $1,388 a
month can be used to pay for tuition, books and living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have offered a few more incentives'' to lure recruits in
the strong economy, said Navy Cmdr. Nancy Sanders, who has sent
2,119 Northern Californians to ``boot camp'' this year, just
slightly ahead of her goal of 2,078. The Air Force's Northern
California enlistments also are just above target, with 1,386
prospects headed for basic, 10 more than quota.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with the exception of the Army, which has raised its
local quota in the past three years, the flow of recruits from
Northern California is so strong that it undermines the argument
that the economic boom is causing the nation's enlistment
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some of us who believe the real problem is a lack of
leadership and poor morale in the armed forces,'' said Chuck
Spinney, a civilian analyst in the Pentagon. Spinney is part of a
small, unofficial group of civilian and military analysts who think
the military's real problem is that skilled military are not
re-enlisting in sufficient numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many soldiers and airmen believe their leaders are
politically correct careerists more interested in their own
promotions than taking care of the troops,'' Spinney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally and vehemently disagree,'' said Gen. Lloyd Newton,
commander of all recruiting and training for the Air Force. Newton,
who flew 269 combat missions in Vietnam also was the first African
American pilot to join the Thunderbird precision-flying unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can spell the word `computer,' much less operate one,
you have a job these days,'' Newton argued. ``We just didn't have
these recruiting problems before.''

 Quantum Plans to Lay Off 800  
 By Henry Norr 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Hard hit by fierce competition and shifting markets, Quantum
Corp.'s Hard Disk Drive Group plans to lay off 750 to 800 employees
and restructure its business to focus on drives for sub-$700 PCs.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 of the layoffs, which will take place over the next
year, will affect workers at the company's Milpitas headquarters,
warehouse and configuration center, according to a Quantum
spokeswoman. The others will come from company facilities in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of the low-cost PC market has become a challenge
for virtually every company in the PC supply chain, and Quantum is
no exception,'' said John Gannon, president of the drive group, in
a press release announcing the moves.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum is the volume leader in the PC hard-drive market. In the
three months ended June 27, its disk drive group suffered a net
loss of $43.2 million (52 cents per share). The loss ate up most of
the $51.5 million earned by the company's tape and storage systems
group, which makes higher-priced products for the corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   For the current quarter, analysts surveyed by First Call
predicted a loss of 56 cents per share for the hard-disk group.
Since last month, the two Quantum groups have been listed
separately as tracking stocks on the New York Stock Exchange,
replacing the company's previous stock.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum will take a special charge of $50 million in the current
quarter to cover the restructuring. Once complete, the changes will
generate savings of $100 million per year, the company estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Other makers of disk drives, including Seagate Technologies and
Western Digital, have also been suffering as the PC market shifts
toward lower-cost models. Quantum CEO Michael Brown has previously
attacked competitors for compounding the problem by seeking to
expand their market share by reducing prices.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's statement, he said, ``Quantum will continue to
speak out strongly against the destructive pricing practices that
are plaguing our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also said, though, that the newly announced restructuring
moves won't immediately alleviate the competitive price pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Katzive, vice president of Disk/ Trend, a research company
in Mountain View, said no single drive company is responsible for
the price wars. ``They're all in the soup together, and they all
blame each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say, though, that a new low-cost Seagate drive called the
U4 has put significant price pressure on all PC drivemakers.
</P>
<P>
   While Quantum will concentrate on low-cost drives and
consolidate some unannounced product-development programs, the
company said it will continue to compete in the high-performance
segment of the drive market.

EX-BROKER PLEADS QUILTY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Victor Wang, the former chairman of Duke &AMP; Co., a
defunct New York brokerage firm, shuttled Thursday between
Manhattan and Brooklyn, pleading guilty to three crimes in two
courts.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Supreme Court Thursday morning, Wang pleaded guilty
to charges of enterprise corruption brought by Robert Morgenthau,
the Manhattan district attorney. In the afternoon, he pleaded
guilty to federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering
presented by Loretta E. Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern
district of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's guilty plea in state court is part of a 109-count
indictment brought against Duke and its principals last May. He is
the 11th defendant to plead guilty to felony charges in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused Duke, Wang and 17 other employees of the
firm of defrauding investors by manipulating the prices of six
stocks that had been underwritten by the firm. Assisting Duke in
the manipulations, according to prosecutors, were two small
brokerage firms, Bishop Allen Inc. and the First Cambridge
Securities Corp. Both are defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's plea to federal charges stems from a plan he designed
with two officers of Stratton Oakmont, a defunct Long Island
brokerage firm that was the subject of numerous regulatory run-ins
before it closed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, between 1991 and 1993, Wang bought
stocks underwritten by Stratton Oakmont in a phony account set up
to benefit the Stratton officers, whom prosecutors did not
identify. When the stocks were sold at a profit, Wang paid the
Stratton officers two-thirds of the after-tax profits from the
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's links to Stratton were strong. He started Duke in 1993
after he had been an executive at Stratton. He also served as chief
executive of Judicate Inc., a firm specializing in alternative
dispute resolution that was taken public by Stratton.
</P>
<P>
   Duke had two offices, one in midtown Manhattan, another in Long
Island. About 35,000 customers invested $171 million with Duke. The
firm was the subject of 26 regulatory actions before it closed in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant plea from a significant offender,'' said
James M. Kindler, chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan.
Kindler would not comment on what information Wang might be able to
provide his office on other investigations active there.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 34, faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison under
both courts' charges. Federal prosecutors are also seeking $650,000
in illegal proceeds made by Wang. He will probably be sentenced in
the fall. A telephone call to his lawyer Thursday was not
returned. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday's pleadings indicate that the turf battle over Wang
that erupted between federal and state prosecutors in May has been
resolved. At that time, federal prosecutors removed Wang from a
cell in Rikers Island, where he was being held after his indictment
by a New York State grand jury, without notifying the district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   It was feared that Wang would agree to plead guilty to federal
charges as a way to avoid state liability. Under New York's double
jeopardy law, someone pleading guilty to a federal crime cannot be
prosecuted for a similar crime by the state.
</P>
<P>
   But with Wang pleading guilty in both state and federal court
Thursday, it is clear that the prosecutors have made peace.
</P>
<P>
   Wang was also the subject Thursday of a complaint brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC accused Wang and three
Duke brokers of orchestrating a huge market manipulation intended
to bolster the stock price of Paravant Computer Systems, now known
as Paravant Inc., which Duke had taken public in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg A. Thaler, Charles T. Bennett and Jeffrey S. Honigman,
former principals and brokers at Duke, participated in the
manipulation, which generated more than $10 million in illegal
profits, the SEC said.

 Best Buy Ready for Opening Of 5 Stores
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Consumers will have more shopping choices _ and electronics
retailers will have more competition _ today (friday)  &LR; when Best
Buy opens five megastores in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The grand opening will leave Best Buy, the largest electronics
chain in the country, with seven stores in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The stores opening today are in Dublin, Milpitas, Pinole,
Pleasant Hill and San Carlos. Best Buy opened a Marin City store
earlier this year and one in Santa Rosa in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By next fall, Best Buy, which is based in Eden Prairie, Minn.,
intends to open an additional nine superstores, including three in
San Francisco, bringing its total to 16 in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming in and they intend to win,'' said Mary Tolan,
global managing partner for retail with Anderson Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   After operating in the red as recently as two years ago, Best
Buy has staged a remarkable turnaround and is now considered the
most aggressive company in its sector.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy chief executive Richard Schulze, who founded his
company as a single store called Sound of Music in 1966,
demonstrated a touch of that aggressiveness yesterday morning while
reviewing the new Best Buy store in San Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   Schulze squinted at a sign towering over Highway 101 in which
Best Buy's name is displayed below that of Breuner's, an adjacent
furniture store. ``Check the lease and try to get our name on
top,'' Schulze directed one of his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy is now going head-to-head with Circuit City, which is
headquartered in Richmond, Va., and operates 19 stores in this
area; Burlingame's Good Guys, which runs 15; and smaller merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys is considered vulnerable. The company has been racking
up losses for three years and is undergoing a painful
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The company's founder, Ron Unkefer, returned to lead Good Guys
last month, taking over from former chief executive Robert Gunst.
He has closed three departments, suspended plans to remodel and
open stores, and has discontinued sales of computers and home
office equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Gordon, an analyst with Banc of America Securities in
San Francisco, estimates that Good Guys stores located near Best
Buys will lose at least 10 percent of their sales, ``which is a lot
for a retailer that's struggling anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to track sales shifting between
retailers, Schulze said he believes most of the dollars Best Buy
has attracted from other retailers in the Los Angeles area have
come from Good Guys.
</P>
<P>
   But Unkefer said smaller dealers are the ones who suffer most.
``Our sales volumes for our Southern California stores and our
margins are very similar to the margins and sales volumes of our
Northern California stores,'' which have not had to compete with
Best Buy, Unkefer said. ``So I don't see the impact of Best Buy on
our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy tends to become the dominant retailer in its markets,
with about 20 percent of the market share in its categories, said
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and accessories make up about 35 percent of Best Buy's
sales, televisions and stereos make up 28 percent and software and
CDs account for 23 percent. The remaining 9 percent is in sales of
large appliances such as ranges and refrigerators, warranties and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy's sales totaled $10 billion last year, compared to $9.3
billion for Circuit City and $928.5 million for Good Guys, which
sells consumer electronics almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer said Good Guys stores offer twice the selection of
consumer electronics merchandise as Best Buy, including several
high-end brands, such as Mitsubishi, that aren't carried by mass
merchants like Best Buy and Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 25 percent of Good Guys merchandise can be found at
Best Buy, ``and our prices on the items where we overlap are very
competitive,'' Unkefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulze said the biggest difference between Best Buy and its
rivals is that Best Buy sales associates are not as pushy because
they do not work on commission.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Good Guys, Best Buy is trying to push higher-margin,
high-tech products like high-definition TVs and digital camcorders.
Its stores feature demonstration counters where consumers can try
the latest equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The new Best Buy stores are shiny and attractive, but still have
a mass-merchant, warehouse feel, with towering ceilings and
linoleum floors. Cardboard boxes holding refrigerators and other
appliances line the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Newer Good Guys stores are far more upscale, with comfortable
living room areas where shoppers can sit on sofas and try a variety
of televisions and stereo systems. The stores also showcase sexy
new technologies like thin-screen TVs, adding an element of
entertainment that Best Buy stores do not enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an underserved market for the top half of the line,''
said Unkefer. ``When it's done correctly, (high-end companies like
Good Guys) can thrive and prosper ... by offering the next level up
in quality of customer service and amenities.''

FRANCE VOICES DISSATISFACTION WITH U.S.-LED BOMBING OF IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France vented long-simmering uneasiness Thursday over
the continuing American-led bombing raids on Iraq, setting the
stage for what diplomats here expect to be a confrontation with the
United States at the U.N. General Assembly next month.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the third occasion on which the French Foreign
Ministry has taken issue with the American and British bombing
raids. The total raids this year have reached two-thirds the number
that the United States, France, Britain and other NATO allies flew
this spring against Yugoslav military forces in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   French public opinion supported the attacks on Yugoslavia, but
there is widespread criticism here of the stalemate in Iraq.
Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement has often complained at
Cabinet meetings that France should not support a policy that
victimizes innocent Iraqi civilians without being able to do
anything to shake President Saddam Hussein's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-summer France has also been circulating detailed
proposals for resolving the impasse. An American diplomat said
Thursday that the proposals were not as rigorous as British and
American demands, which are that Iraq must agree to let U.N. arms
inspectors search for forbidden weapons before there can be any
talk of relaxing international economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really see a way out of this difficulty with Paris
until we sit down and talk about it at high level,'' the American
official said. ``We're not really on the same track as the
French.''
</P>
<P>
   The French say that by the time Iraq threw out the inspectors
last year, they had tracked down and destroyed all the existing
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons capacity they were ever
going to find.
</P>
<P>
   Now, French officials say, there should be a new monitoring
system _ not to try to find whatever banned weapons are still
hidden, but to make sure that Iraq does not try to build new
factories to make more weapons. As soon as the monitors are in
place, economic sanctions can be lifted, they say, 100 days at a
time depending on how Iraq behaves.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any inspection system, in the French view, would be
better than none, and they say there is none now except aerial
surveillance, punctuated by bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   The French proposal would replace the U.N. Special Commission
that Saddam expelled with a new ``control commission'' charged, as
the U.N. team was, with making sure Iraq did not again become a
security threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To avoid this threat, inspectors need to come back to Iraq,''
a summary of the plan by the Foreign Ministry says. ``The return of
the inspectors cannot be imposed by military action. It will be
obtained only through the restored unity and authority of the
Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, the plan says, is ``a serious and efficient
long-term armaments control system with investigation capacities
identical to those of the United Nations Special Commission but
with renewed structures and working methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what those ``renewed structures and working methods''
would be is not spelled out, but French officials have told their
American counterparts that American and British proposals to the
United Nations stand no chance of being accepted by Iraq. The
French hope to get Baghdad's acceptance for their own plan.

 Safeway Signs On With Net Scrip Firm
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Electronic Scrip Inc., which has devised an Internet fund-raising
scheme for schools and nonprofits, is about to get a big boost from
grocery-store giant Safeway, which said it is signing up to
participate in the company's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Scrip's product is called eScrip. It's an online
version of scrip _ gift-certificates that schools and nonprofits
buy from businesses, such as grocery stores and restaurants, at a
discount and then resell at face value to their supporters,
pocketing the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Paper-based scrip programs have been around for 10 years, but
the organizations that use them to raise funds say they can be a
hassle. Schools have to raise the money to buy the certificates
upfront. Also, they must rustle up volunteers to sell scrip and
protect the certificate from loss or theft.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Lambert, a Safeway spokeswoman, said the grocery chain
plans to phase out its participation in all paper-based scrip
programs in the near future and focus solely on eScrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be on the cutting edge of technology,'' she said.
``And frankly, schools and parents are tired of dealing with paper.
EScrip is just much more convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   With the eScrip system, parents or other members register their
credit card and ATM numbers with San Mateo's Electronic Scrip.
Every time they use the cards to make a purchase from a
participating merchant, a portion of the sale is donated
automatically to the preselected organization of their choice.
Unlike paper scrip, which is free to participating parents, eScrip
costs $10 a year for each person who registers credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Scrip, which just launched in January, also is
responsible for recruiting merchants to participate. So far, it has
signed on smaller grocery stores such as Draegers and Andronico's,
and a host of other businesses, including Crate &AMP; Barrel and Budget
Rent a Car. But Safeway is its biggest coup to date.
</P>
<P>
   That's because about 80 percent of all funds raised through
scrip come from grocery stores. Also, having a marquee name on its
roster will help Electronic Scrip attract more people and
organizations to its program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect our membership to grow from about a thousand people
currently to hundreds of thousands of people in California alone
within the next 18 months,'' said Ian Diery, CEO of Electronic
Scrip.
</P>
<P>
   Designated schools or charities will receive 2 to 4 percent of
their supporters' Safeway eScrip purchases, depending on how much
they spend a month.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Carr, a parent who is active in the Portola Valley
Schools Foundation, which participates in eScrip, said the program
has a big influence on where parents shop. ``This will give Safeway
a real advantage over Lucky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Scrip agreed to an exclusive relationship with
Safeway, meaning that eScrip will not be available at other major
grocery chains, such as Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  There are 190 Lucky stores in Northern California, compared
with 215 stores for Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Enochson, a spokeswoman for the Lucky chain, said loyal
shoppers should not despair. She said the company plans to roll out
its own fund-raising program called Community Partners Card that it
will manage itself.
</P>
<P>
   Program members will receive a separate card that can be used at
any Lucky store. The amount of their purchases will be recored
automatically, and a percentage of the sale will be transferred via
check to the appropriate organization. Enochson did not say when
the program would go into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Esber, a parent in the Palo Alto Unified School District,
which also participates in eScrip, admitted that the program might
force some parents to change their shopping habits from Lucky to
Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have raised that issue with us,'' Esber said. ``We are
certainly not in this to promote any particular vendor. We just
want to raise money for our schools.''

(af) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My first Mustang, a used 1968 hardtop with a 289 V8, came with
the basic Mustang handling upgrade: two sandbags in the trunk. For
better grip in snow _ as well as a car that didn't try to change
direction each time it hit a bump in hard cornering _ a little
ballast helped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 35 years after the Mustang's introduction, it is time to
dump the sand for something more sophisticated: an independent rear
suspension. Alas, this is available only on the 8,095 SVT Mustang
Cobras built this year, at a $4,000 premium over similarly equipped
GTs. Other Mustangs, including the GT, keep the old live axle.
</P>
<P>
   The new suspension is a Mustang watershed, giving the car
newfound sureness and putting it within range of European sport
coupes _ in road manners, if not in overall sophistication. Is it
worth the premium? After comparing the models, I will say this: The
Cobra is as different from the GT as two cars sharing the same
basic body, transmission and frame (and, to Ford's chagrin, maybe
even the same power output) can be.
</P>
<P>
   After the first couple of fast corners in the Cobra, your fear
of sewer-grate apexes disappears. The car goes where you point it
on turn-in, and it doesn't change its mind when the first bump
comes along. A normal slight penchant for understeer (a tendency to
move ahead on a turn) can be pushed into oversteer (turning too
sharply) whenever the driver, and not not the car, decides.
</P>
<P>
   And the slightly heavier independent rear suspension _ a modular
unit that bolts onto the same mounting points as the live axle _
and slightly lighter V8 improve the Cobra's weight distribution to
about 55/45 front-rear. (The GT is about 57/43.)
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra's ride is also significantly more comfortable. Road
joints are far less jarring, and the noise level is improved to
where the Cobra is almost tolerable for a long trip _ although that
may change when Ford replaces its exhaust system to help correct a
horsepower shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In the GT, I had to blast the optional Mach 460 sound system to
appreciate its virtues. (Tip: Keep the engine revving high enough
to mask the whine from the GT's drivetrain.) In the Cobra _ which
has the same sound system as standard equipment _ classical music
is within the realm of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra also has standard all-speed traction control, a nice
addition on wet surfaces. That is now an option on all other
Mustangs, and although the system engages heavy-handedly, it's
worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Cobra's engine _ a 4.6-liter aluminum-block V8
with double overhead cams and 32 valves _ was supposed to get a
15-horsepower boost to 320 with redesigned intake ports and
combustion chambers, giving it 60 more horsepower than the
single-overhead-cam, 16-valve engine in the Mustang GT. So after a
week in the jackrabbit GT, imagine getting even more power _ with a
20th-century rear suspension, too.
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't tax your imagination. At first, I thought that the
Cobra _ meant to be more like a European GT car _ had been tuned to
be more mannerly. But I, like a number of Cobra buyers, was left
with the feeling that some of those 320 horses had been rustled.
Gear ratios in the five-speed manuals are the same, and the
manufacturer's power and torque curves showed little clear
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra had fewer than 400 miles on the odometer, so the
clutch shouldn't have been slipping. Maybe my memory of the GT was?
As it turned out, my mind had not failed me _ this time, anyway;
Ford is preparing new intake manifolds and exhaust systems to bring
the cars up to the advertised power level.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, my right foot preferred the GT. If you just
want to flex your muscle car, whatever mischief you could wreak
with the Cobra you could do as easily with the GT. And if the GT's
engine roar gets tiresome, you can putter around in the 2,000-rpm
range without the car's bogging down. Beyond 2,000 rpm the GT and
the Cobra have lots of passing power.
</P>
<P>
   This may all change to the Cobra's benefit once the new parts
are added, but if you are thinking of buying an SVT Cobra, consider
a comparison test drive with a GT, to be sure you're getting both
the better handling and the extra horsepower you're paying for.
</P>
<P>
   The GT convertible's handling wasn't exactly terrible, thanks to
some suspension improvements, and anyone who hasn't driven the new
Cobra should find the new GT an improvement over the old one. But
over bumps, the twitchy back end reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect the GT's ride to be smooth. The optional
P245/45 tires on 17-inch aluminum rims transmitted road joints and
uneven pavement with little dampening and lots of noise. The
optional leather buckets with power adjustments for the driver
(standard on Cobra) were comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Both cars came with power four-wheel antilock disk brakes, and
they performed surely and evenly, with good feel. Steering was the
same in both _ power rack and pinion _ but felt heavier in the GT.
The system features numerous improvements, although the GT's
steering effort _ along with the bodybuilding clutch in both cars _
puts muscle on the drivers of these muscle cars.
</P>
<P>
   Interior trim on each car is little changed from the previous
Mustang's straightforward, plasticy and just good enough to keep
the car's price down without looking shoddy. When I took the GT
through a car wash, there were dribbles down the door windows. Both
cars had gearshift mechanisms that did not go from second to third
without some deliberate placement _ and into fourth without
whacking the fold-out cup holder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra and GT convertibles had some body flex over bumps, but
if my wife's '94 Mustang is an indicator, the hardtops probably
won't be rattlers. And the GT's boomy engine keeps you from
realizing how much exterior sound filters in with the top up.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hall, a spokesman for SVT _ Special Vehicle Team, Ford's
performance operation _ said there had been no discussions about
offering the Cobra's suspension on other versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always with the Cobra, it's the technology hotbed for the
Mustang,'' he said, but Ford likes to keep the Cobra distinct from
the GT, which is meant for muscle-car fans who pay relatively less.
</P>
<P>
   So for most Mustang buyers, there is no cure yet, but there is
hope.
</P>
<P>
   And sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: The Cobra beats the GT in the turns (as it
should); the GT holds its own on the straights (as it shouldn't).

 &HT;    Ayala returns to ring after 16 years
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The opportunity to see if Tony Ayala Jr. was
indeed a changed man after 16 years in prison came even before the
first fight in his improbable comeback.
</P>
<P>
   At a pre-fight interview, his opponent, Manuel Esparza,
sauntered to the mike. Esparza, 21, was only 4 years old when Ayala
last fought in San Antonio. Back then, Ayala unleashed all the
savage fury he had in and outside of the ring, battering a helpless
Robbie Epps even after the referee had declared Ayala a winner in a
first-round technical knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Esparza, who will fight Ayala in a 10-round middleweight bout
tonight in San Antonio, was still shy of his third birthday in 1981
when Ayala pounded Jose Baltazar into submission in two rounds and
then spit on him to avenge a pre-fight insult to the boxer known as
Torito.
</P>
<P>
   Like a wine-sodden tourist in Pamplona, Esparza couldn't resist
running in front of a bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to ask you a quick question,'' he said, turning to
Ayala. ``Do you like mayonnaise or mustard? Because I'm going to be
feeding you some fist sandwiches all night, brother. Hopefully, a
lot of people will come out to see the fight to see what happens to
the ex-champ and the new champ.''
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough to get him gored, Esparza added, ``I told
him if I win, you buy me a beer. If he wins, I'll buy him a box of
Rogaine. If he's lucky, I'll buy him a case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my, that's worse than Robbie Epps in 1982,'' said emcee
Lester Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala stopped fiddling with his sunglasses and the wristband of
his watch. He got up to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been much for words, I've always let my fists talk
for me,'' Ayala said. ``He (Epps) crossed a boundary. As far as I
was concerned it got personal, it affected my family. This time
around the topic seems to be my hairline.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience, liberally sprinkled with Ayala friends and camp
members, laughed. But Ayala continued, ``You know what? I've never
considered myself a pretty boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Friday I'll be in there every single minute of every
single round. Win, lose or draw I will leave my heart there. That
is a promise. I wish you good luck. I hope your bite is as tough as
your bark. I don't think it is. All through my career I've met guys
like you, guys who talk a lot of (garbage).''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Esparza tried to fire back.
</P>
<P>
   A little later Ayala promised to again be the warrior of old in
the ring. ``My heart has not changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A rising star falls
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Torito II, as Ayala is billed, is the same as the
original incarnation. He's short on political correctness, temper
and tact, long on machismo. It was, after all, Ayala's rage in the
ring _ and a left hand that could stun an elephant _ that set him
apart as a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Former manager Lou Duva once said, ``Forget Leonard, forget
Hagler and yeah, forget Mike Tyson. Rocky Marciano and Tony Ayala
were the guys. Not even Muhammad Ali, great as he was, had it quite
like those two.''
</P>
<P>
   Until New Year's Day 1983, it looked like Ayala would get a
chance to rumble with the likes of Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler
and Thomas Hearns, and earn the huge paydays such fights would
bring. He had a $750,000 title shot against Davey Moore on the
horizon. He was just 19, was 22-0 with 19 knockouts and was the
most feared force in boxing, walking through other boxers' best
shots like he was some kind of Terminator.
</P>
<P>
   But Ayala was feared outside of the ring as well. He was
involved with booze, drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   After a New Year's Eve party, Ayala, armed with a knife, broke
into the New Jersey apartment of a 30-year-old woman and raped her.
He was later found guilty of six charges, including aggravated
sexual assault, and sentenced to 15 to 30 years, 15 of which were
mandatory. When he first became eligible for release, he was turned
down. Finally, in April, after 16 years behind bars, Ayala was set
free.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said Tony Ayala Sr. was part of his son's problems,
that his whole boxing clan of four sons had been raised like pit
bulls. Yet Ayala Sr. tears up when he relates, ``The fact that I
have my family together means a lot to me. Christmas, holidays,
birthdays _ we'd set a place for him at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Jr. also said there's more than boxing this time around,
that friends and families have become more important to him. Yet
boxing was always what he did best.
</P>
<P>
   There were doubts, however, about whether he could pull off the
most remarkable comeback in boxing's history.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back up to speed
</P>
<P>
   Imagine eating prison food for 16 years, getting released to a
world where you can finally have anything your tastebuds desire,
and then having to lose almost 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have to be a sick puppy to enjoy training,''
Ayala said. ``It's boxing, bed. Boxing, bed. That's about all you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala has run on the track and up and down hills at dawn under
his father's critical eye. He's worked and sparred in his father's
bandbox, iron bar-laced Zarzamora Street Gym on San Antonio's west
side. The gym is gradually getting a bright, fresh coat of green
and yellow paint, but it's still dark, stark and breathtakingly
hot. It's 90 degrees, and that's before the boxers start working
out and the curious drift in and sit on discarded bowling alleys
pews to watch Ayala. Then, the body heat pushes the gym's
temperature near the century mark.
</P>
<P>
   There, on a street lined with such businesses as Chino's Cantina
and a bail bondsman, Ayala has been getting work against quality
fighters, including local junior middleweight James ``Cowboy''
Coker, who is 19-1 and will fight Lalo Gutierrez on tonight's card.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ayala was sporting a small shiner, courtesy of Coker.
``My dad runs the toughest boxing gym in the world. I hurt him. He
hurts me,'' Ayala explained.
</P>
<P>
   Coker said, ``He's 100 percent improved, or 75 percent from when
he started. It's a bunch. When you come in there and you haven't
sparred any, day after day you finally get back in the swing of
things. He knows how to box. He knows the punches to throw, he's
just got to get 'em going again. He likes to move in with his hands
up, cover up and then once he gets inside let a barrage go. That's
the way he still fights. Lead in a little with a pumping jab and
then once he gets to you, swarm you. He's a master at cutting off
the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing to me is a dangerous sport, and I know exactly what I'm
doing,'' Ayala warned. ``There are no time-outs. There are no
substitutes. You're in there, fighting with 8-ounce gloves, and
punches hurt. I haven't met an opponent yet who can stand up after
10 rounds of taking my shots. Nineteen of my fights ended in
knockouts. I was young then. I'm 36 now. But I have the confidence
that I can go as hard as I need to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about Ayala's condition and fear over backlash about his
criminal past have kept the sport's biggest promoters playing a
watch and wait game _ at least for the moment. Torito's career,
after all, stopped just before he became household-name famous. He
was known to boxing fans, many Hispanics, and San Antonioans, but
not to the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I remembered the name Tony Ayala, but
that was about it. He hasn't been in my mind since he was gone. But
the people in San Antonio, he never left their minds. It was an
ongoing saga those 16 years,'' said promoter Nick Huzella.
</P>
<P>
   So Ayala's return comes not in some glitzy Las Vegas casino but
the Freeman Coliseum. It's not the most glamorous of settings, but
it is Ayala's home town.
</P>
<P>
   Said Brian Raditz, director of psychology at Trenton State
Prison and Ayala's manager/adviser, ``I've known Tony for 16 years
now and this Friday night will be a very emotional night for all of
us. It's something that we've pictured and dreamed about for a
number of years. ... Tony's desire and passion are back.''

A SUBURB SEES THE FUTURE IN ITS OLD DOWNTOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. _ Ellen K. Dean has seen the future of this
middle-class Chicago suburb, and it lies in its past.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, commercial development in Downers Grove and
hundreds of similar towns across the country meant accommodating
strip malls and ``big box'' chain retailers. But Ms. Dean, Downers
Grove's economic development director, says that model is played
out. If her city wants a vibrant retail future, she believes, it
will find it on its old Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of cities are getting into the idea that the big box is
the future, but I think they are becoming commodities, and their
product can be gotten on the Internet,'' Ms. Dean said, stepping
carefully through the reconstruction work the city has undertaken
to brighten its downtown streetscape, including installing new
sewer pipes and new pavement on Main Street. ``We think specialty
retailers like the ones here are the future, and so is downtown.
The future is more interactive and people-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious effort to revitalize downtown Downers Grove, where
many of the brick buildings date from around the turn of the last
century, reflects a broader trend seen in other smaller towns
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from successful projects in big cities like
Chicago, suburban communities that for years seemed content to
allow malls to proliferate while old downtowns deteriorated have
begun to reverse course and rediscover the potential in their
historic cores.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is epitomized in Downers Grove, Evanston and Highland
Park around Chicago, and Santa Monica and Pasadena near Los
Angeles, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Communities have tried to re-inject life into their downtowns
before. One wave of such projects crested about two decades ago, as
cities and towns in many regions tried to combat the burgeoning
strength of new edge-of-town shopping centers by sprucing up Main
Streets, turning busy shopping blocks into pedestrian malls and
erecting parking ramps downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Some projects succeeded in forestalling shoppers' flight to the
malls for a time, but many proved as futile as they were expensive,
as vacant storefronts continued to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, urban commercial neighborhoods have turned to
organizing business improvement districts, which use money from
parking fees or local tax surcharges to pay for cosmetic
improvements and stepped-up services like street cleaning _ but
again with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   But one important factor is different this time around. The new
wave of Main Street projects is a response not to the strength of
shopping centers but to their perceived new weakness, prompted in
part by the explosion in Internet retailing.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reasons that new shopping centers once emptied old
downtowns _ convenience and lower prices _ the Internet has now
begun to siphon off a significant share of sales from shopping
centers' big tenants. And just as important to city officials like
Ms. Dean, it has cut into sales tax revenue in mainstay categories
like airline tickets, books, records, clothing and, especially,
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when one of our car dealers told me that 25
percent of his sales now go on the Internet,'' she recalled.
``That's the kind of thing that makes me shake in my boots.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many communities are still trying to attract as many
new big-box retailers, strip centers and malls as possible. Towns
and small suburban cities like Downers Grove still depend on them
for a huge share of the sales and property taxes that finance their
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are clear signs, even in a healthy commercial market
like metropolitan Chicago, that this style of retail development
has passed the saturation point.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Knitter, president of Great American Realty in Oak Park,
another Chicago suburb, estimates that there are already roughly
200 giant, empty store buildings surrounded by acres of parking in
the region, representing 10 million square feet, with an additional
5 million square feet due to become available in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Knitter said a number of factors are contributing to the
oversupply, with revenue losses to Internet commerce fairly low on
the list. He cited intense competition among national chains that
has flattened many second-tier local competitors, as well as many
retailers' unwillingness to occupy space deserted by failed stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is superstition about going into a failed
location,'' said Knitter, a retail real estate consultant whose
firm specializes in the Midwest market. ``But people often want to
build their own building with their own footprint, rather than go
into someone else's. A Walgreen's is always a certain number of
square feet _ they don't want to change the configuration; they
want them to look the same and be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The casualties are scattered liberally between downtown Chicago
and its western suburban ring. Some have been razed and
redeveloped, occasionally by other retailers, while others have
been converted into educational or medical centers. The rest remain
vacant, awaiting new uses, which Knitter thinks could eventually
include housing, recreational facilities or even pet cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   In Downers Grove, the trend is manifested in a big store on
Ogden Avenue that has been vacant for five years and in the city's
failure to attract new retail development on several
shopping-center-size parcels.
</P>
<P>
   So the city has decided to concentrate instead on restoring Main
Street to what it once was: an attractive strolling, shopping and
dining destination for the surrounding region and a convenient and
desirable place for singles and ``empty nesters'' to live.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dean points to the many essential services found downtown _
city hall, the library and the post office are there _ and its
intimate, pedestrian-friendly atmosphere, rare in newer suburbs.
The 300 retail businesses operating downtown differ markedly from
typical mall fare and include independent bakeries and restaurants;
the city's one brew pub, the Founder's Hill Brewing Co.; a
consignment store; a locally owned five and dime, and a movie
theater, the Tivoli, that dates from 1928. An adjacent park
features a band shell for outdoor concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown provides something unique _ the entertainment,
meet-and-greet venue,'' Ms. Dean said over a soft drink at
Founder's Hill. ``This can't be duplicated on the Internet at all.
Virtual reality is not reality. This is.'' &QL;

BANK OF NEW YORK AGGRESSIVELY COURTED RUSSIAN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 5 grafs at end.) (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bank of New York, in an effort to expand a
lucrative business in Eastern Europe over the last several years,
aggressively pursued relationships with many of Russia's largest
banks, a strategy that might have contributed to embarrassing
questions about money laundering that the bank now faces.
</P>
<P>
   The bank specialized in setting up cash and securities accounts
for Russian banks in the United States, a higly competitive market
that the bank dominated, according to American bankers and
financial analysts. The accounts allowed Russian institutions, many
of which collapsed last year beneath piles of debt and speculative
investments, to easily transfer money outside of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At first, doing business with Russian banks seemed like a
fruitful new business. But now the bank is under federal
investigation for channeling billions of dollars through accounts
in what is suspected to be a major money laundering operation by
Russian organized crime, law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said Wednesday that it has been cooperating with the
investigation, which involves the use of bank facilities to
transfer funds from Russia to other countries. The bank said there
are no allegations of wrongdoing and declined to comment further.
It also suspended two senior officers pending the outcome of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bank entrusted responsibility for much of the fast-growing
business in Eastern Europe to Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a
senior vice president whom federal investigators believe to be at
the heart of a money laundering scandal inside the bank. Ms.
Kagalovsky, who was one of the employees suspended Wednesday, has
not been accused of any crime. But it remains unclear whether there
was wrongdoing by her or other individuals, and how adequately the
bank supervised their activities and their Russian customers.
</P>
<P>
   One of her best customers was Inkombank, a fast-growing Russian
bank that transacted more than 250 payments a day through the Bank
of New York. Inkombank brought its business to the Bank of New York
from the Republic New York Corp. in 1992, because Ms. Kagalovsky
promised to be less vigilant than Republic about the way in which
Inkombank's accounts were handled here, according to Emanuel E.
Zeltser, a former attorney for Inkombank.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky assured Inkombank's representatives that ``Bank
of New York would be much more understanding about how to manage
correspondent accounts than Republic,'' Zeltser said. Republic
officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank of New York was very happy with the money Natasha and
Galitzine were making and routinely let them run their own show,''
Zeltser said referring to Ms. Kagalovsky and Vladimir Galitzine,
another Bank of New York officer. Bank of New York said Galitzine
was unavailable for comment. An individual familiar with the
investigation of the bank said that Galitzine has not been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined who at the bank supervised Ms.
Kagalovsky. The bank declined comment further, and Ms. Kagalovsky
was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Ms. Kagalovsky, the wife of Konstantin
Kagalovsky, a prominent Russian banker and oil executive, was a
vociferous and active cheerleader in pushing Bank of New York to
expand its presence in Russia in the early and mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 memo to Thomas Renyi, who was then the president of
the bank and is now the chief executive, Ms. Kagalovsky and another
executive made note of how important one Russian bank, Inkombank,
was to the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inkombank is our largest generator of fee income, and they are
now the largest clearing bank in Russia for domestic
transactions,'' the memo noted. The memo, which Bank of New York
declined to comment on, was given to The New York Times by Zeltser,
who said he acquired it as part of a lawsuit he has filed against
Inkombank over unpaid fees. Lawyers representing Inkombank declined
to comment about the bank's involvement with Bank of New York or
Zeltser's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Inkombank, like many of it counterparts in Russia, is now
insolvent. Another Russian bank that had accounts with Bank of New
York was Menatep, part of an industrial empire overseen by Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, one of Russia's prominent financiers, called
``oligarchs.'' Bank of New York had an active relationship with
Menatep and helped the bank list its stock for trading in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are trying to determine whether some of
the money that was channeled through the Bank of New York came from
Menatep. Menatep, and related companies in Russia, are suspected by
Western investors and Russian regulatory authorities of having
looted money from the country, allegations that Khodorkovsky and
his representatives have firmly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Through Ms. Kagalovsky, Bank of New York had a personal
connection to Menatep. Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin, is a
former senior executive at Menatep and is now the vice chairman of
Yukos, an oil company that is the flagship of of Khodorkovsky's
troubled business empire. Ms. Kagalovsky did not respond to an
interview request.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser, the former Inkombank attorney, said that the
Kagalovskys were married in the mid-1990s, when Bank of New York
began doing business with Menatep. An American official close to
the money laundering investigation of the Bank of New York
described the Kagalovskys' business connection as ``extraordinarily
provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kagalovskys own a condominium on East 47th Street in
Manhattan that Ms. Kagalovsky bought in January 1997, for $796,000,
according to real estate records. It appears that Ms. Kagalovsky
paid cash. The property records show no loan.

STOCKS CLOSE LOWER FOR 2ND STRAIGHT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unexpected worsening of the nation's trade deficit
sent stocks into a skid Thursday, and despite a partial recovery,
prices closed lower for the second straight session.
</P>
<P>
   The market has been pressured recently by various signs of
economic pickup in Japan and Europe, where currencies tend to
strengthen against the dollar as investors buy relatively more
appealing foreign shares. The government's report of a $3.4 billion
jump, instead of a small decline, in the trade deficit pushed the
dollar down further and set off speculation about how the Federal
Reserve would view this trend, a fresh source of upward pressure on
prices, at its policy meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global economy is recovering,'' said Lorraine Wang, an
equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Where we're
concerned is the U.S. dollar, which is bad for inflation.'' The Fed
is widely expected to increase the overnight lending rate a
quarter-point next week, and Ms. Wang predicted the rise would not
be its last.
</P>
<P>
   Although other analysts disagreed, investors found little reason
to buy on Thursday, especially ahead of Friday's expiration of
stock options and index options; these expirations often lead to
big price swings.
</P>
<P>
   With most Internet and other high-tech issues in retreat, the
NASDAQ market slumped 36.3 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,621.43,
the biggest loss among the main gauges.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down by as much as
118 points in the morning, ended with a loss of 27.54 points, or
two-tenths of a percent, to 10,963.84. Eighteen of its 30
components fell, although none by more than Alcoa's decline of 1
11/16, to 65 3/16. Reynolds Metals, which accepted a sweetened
takeover offer from Alcoa, fell 2 11/16 to 65 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's expensive,'' said Neil Eigen, a managing director
at J.&AMP;W. Seligman. ``It's very difficult to make the case that
stocks go a lot higher.'' Some bank stocks stood out among the
day's losers, with Chase Manhattan down 2 9/16 to 82 7/16 after
being downgraded by a leading analyst who said the high-flying
shares, still up nearly 18 percent this year, may have little room
left to grow. Bank of New York fell 1 5/8 to 37 after a report that
Russian criminals may have used it to launder money, and Citigroup
fell 1 5/32 to 45 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined 9.25 points, or
seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,323.59, as 277 of its components
fell while 202 rose and 21 were unchanged. Microsoft accounted for
the most damage, slipping 1 3/16 to 83 13/16, while Royal Dutch, up
1 1/16 to 64 11/16, was the biggest plus.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more optimistic strategists was James Paulsen, chief
investment officer at Wells Capital Management. He said the economy
was clearly slowing down and that interest rates were likely to
ease soon, clearing the way for a resumption of the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think stocks will probably take off again and go on to new
highs,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   At least two companies made successful market debuts. Wink
Communications, engaged in interactive TV, sold 4.75 million shares
at 16, and they spurted to close at 35 11/16. Netro Corp., which
provides broadband wireless access, sold 5 million shares at 8, and
they nearly tripled, closing at 23 1/2 on turnover of 18.8 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 673.7
million, slightly less than on Wednesday. Declining issues
outnumbered advancing ones by 1,643 to 1,382, while 93 made new
52-week lows, and 44 made new highs.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell in major European markets but gained in Brazil and
rose more than 3 percent in Hong Kong. Japan's Nikkei 225, up 31
percent so far this year, was slightly lower.

 &HT;    EDS: Corrects name of Babur Kilic throughout.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Atlanta family pieces together tragedy of Turkey earthquake
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice and Julie Bryant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For 12 hours, as they lay pinned in the rubble of
their collapsed apartment building in northwest Turkey, Nizam Kilic
talked to his daughter-in-law, Jan. He told her to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic is married to one of Nizam's sons, Babur, a Marietta
anesthesiologist. She and their five children were vacationing with
her in-laws in the resort town of Yalova when the five-story
building in which they were sleeping collapsed during Tuesday's
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Kilic did his best to comfort her amid the fear and the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she couldn't hear him anymore. He stopped talking,'' said
Cigdem Kilic, who is married to another of Nizam's three sons and
also lives in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Kilic and four of Jan's children died. Nizam Kilic's wife,
Turkan, suffered severe head injuries and is partially paralyzed.
She remained in critical condition Thursday night at a Turkish
hospital. Jan Kilic also suffered head injuries but was conscious
at American Hospital in Istanbul. One daughter, Natalie, 3 1/2, was
pulled out of the rubble. Her only injury: a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, as fresh details emerge, the magnitude of disaster
grows more clear.
</P>
<P>
   The death count climbed Thursday to more than 7,000. But that
number is expected to increase significantly, with 35,000 listed as
missing. Another 34,000 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The five Kilic family members were the only confirmed American
fatalities so far.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Natalie's siblings _ Jeffrey, 6, Jennifer, 5, and
David, 2 _ died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jan heard the youngest baby cry a little bit,'' Cigdem
Kilic said. ``Then she didn't hear her anymore either.''
</P>
<P>
   That youngest baby, Katie, was born Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion and lack of communication, word is
starting to get back to Georgia about what happened early Tuesday
morning halfway around the world. Jan Kilic's parents were able to
talk with her by phone for the first time Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had some head swelling that's going down and some lower
back and neck problems, but she's expected to make a full
recovery,'' said her brother, Billy Kemp. ``She's tired, but
clinging to the fact that Natalie survived.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a hope she didn't have at first.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 hours, she lay trapped beneath rubble. Then she and her
mother-in-law were rescued minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan was on her way to a makeshift hospital and she thought all
of her children were dead,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie was pulled out 12 hours later. Jan Kilic would not find
out about her daughter's survival for nearly two days.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kilic's own rescue came about because of the valor and
determination of emergency officials and some of her husband's
family still living in Turkey. They refused to leave the area
despite a mandatory evacuation because of a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was because of their extraordinary efforts that there were
three survivors out of 100-plus people who died in that building,''
Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kilics are the only known survivors of the building
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``His relatives risked their lives by climbing and digging
through the rubble,'' said Cigdem Kilic. ``One of them saw
something in the corner, but someone said that person was dead.
Then his cousin saw dust moving up and down around her nose and
realized she was breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers lifted Jan Kilic up and found Jennifer underneath.
Jennifer and Jeffrey ``looked like they were sleeping,'' Cigdem
Kilic said. Katie and David were more badly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Babur Kilic and his two brothers, also Marietta
anesthesiologists, arrived in Turkey on Thursday. Babur, who had
stayed in Marietta, was supposed to join his family this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Jan Kilic in the hospital, the three brothers
took an ambulance by ferry to the seaside resort of Yalova to bring
the bodies back to Istanbul. Yalova is a popular vacation
destination for many middle class Turkish families, and the Kilics
have a summer home there.
</P>
<P>
   Babur Kilic and his older brothers, Timur and Cengiz, found the
bodies at a makeshift morgue at an ice skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   Timur and Cengiz Kilic carried out the bodies in their arms and
transported them by ambulance to the morgue at American Hospital in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babur has not seen the kids yet,'' said Cigdem Kilic, Timur's
wife. ``Tim did not want him to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Timur Kilic described for his wife a scene of devastation unlike
any he could ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband said this was the worst day of his life,'' she
said. ``He was crying. He's a doctor and he sees dead people, and
he said he's never seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kilics want to bring Jan and Turkan back to the United
States for treatment as soon as possible. They also want to bring
back the other family members for burial in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in touch with the State Department, arranging
transportation for the bodies to be flown back here,'' Billy Kemp
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Marietta, worried family and friends continued their vigil,
some searching for news, others seeking solace. Few found meaning.
</P>
<P>
   At the two-story east Cobb home of Jan and Babur Kilic, a steady
flow of cars pulled into the driveway. Inside, family members who
had come from out of state tried to bring comfort.
</P>
<P>
   In a family room, they talked quietly as they watched CNN
coverage of the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, teachers and administrators from the Casa dei Bambini
Montessori, where four of the Kilic children attended, held a quiet
service at the Holy Family Church in Cobb County. School director
Florence Johnson said the school would continue to support the
family through prayers and close communication.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners at Mount Vernon Baptist Church, where Jan Kilic
worshipped, remembered a vibrant and loving family.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sam Boyd said Jan Kilic joined about six years ago and
is involved in a women's Bible study, Sunday school and worship
services. Her husband, known to his friends as ``Bobby,'' is not a
member but comes occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Jan and Babur met as students at the University of Alabama, Boyd
said. She's an electrical engineer and he was a math undergraduate
before receiving his medical degree there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great blend in the sense that she's a very active
business person with a great amount of skill and knowledge, and
she's a very sensitive and nurturing mother,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Others couldn't help but think of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite devastating,'' said Gwen Jenkins, preschool
minister at Mount Vernon. ``I've been in a state of shock.
Different ones of them will flash in my mind, and I know I'll never
get to see them again _ not in this life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll not get to see Jennifer coming down the hall with her
blonde hair swinging. Little David always had a smile on his face.
He was learning to talk and was always trying to tell me something.
Of course, I didn't always know what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Natalie is just getting to the verbal stage and is
expressing herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffrey was always the big brother. He was always looking out
for the little ones. When Jan would drop them off at their
classrooms, he would tell them, `Go on in, now''' and make sure
they got in OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katie, the youngest, was so sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be quite a loss for our preschool.''
</P>
<P>
   She said faith will help them get through this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that one day we'll get to see them again,'' Jenkins
said. ``When we get to heaven, they'll welcome us. Were it not for
our faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I can't imagine
being able to cope with something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The first test will come this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what Sunday morning is going to hold,'' Boyd
said.

PALMER'S PRESENCE PROVES POWERFUL AT NASHAWTUC CC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ His third shot to the par-5 18th was an
indifferent wedge that was pulled slightly, coming to rest on the
fringe some 35 feet from the pin. When his putt came up 6 feet
short, Arnold Palmer winced, gave that vintage forehead-wrinkled
disgusted look skyward, and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   A casual pro-am Thursday at Nashawtuc Country Club, a prelude to
the start of the BankBoston Classic, would end with a three-putt
bogey, but in the settling dusk it mattered little to the people
who truly count in Palmer's world _ the fans. They have provided
the stage, paid the bills, and given him the life he has been
blessed with.
</P>
<P>
   And though it was not quite an Army, it certainly was a loyal
following. It also was a rewarded following for Palmer was, well,
Palmer. Which is as good as it gets if you prefer your heroes to be
gracious. Palmer shook hands, greeted old friends, and didn't miss
a request for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   For parts of five decades he has graced the American sports
stage and as he nears his 70th birthday, Palmer remains more
important than ever. In a world of people who wear their hats
backward, he is a constant reminder that manners and discipline
count for something, an old-fashioned person who doesn't think it's
a particularly bad thing to be called that.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he remains the conscience of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Palmer was the one Ben Crenshaw telephoned last
week, the guiding force needed to help the Ryder Cup captain get
through a difficult PGA Championship week. The pay-for-play
controversy crushed Palmer as well as Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely disappointed in our people. They don't seem to
understand what this competition is all about. The money and the
lifestyle the game has afforded them . . . '' Palmer said, shaking
his head. ``I'm a little sorry the controversy came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer will be the main attraction the next three days at
Nashawtuc, his first competitive appearance in the area since 1988.
The excitement has nothing to do with how he now plays; it has
everything to do with what he stands for. Lee Trevino once said,
``People would rather watch Arnold take the clubs out of his trunk
than watch us play.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? The stories explain the legend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Player recalls a visit to a gold mine in South Africa.
``Gold bars were everywhere and the man says, `Anyone who can pick
one up can have it.' So Arnold tells me he'd like to try and I
asked the man, `Can my American friend here give it a try?'
</P>
<P>
   ``So Arnold goes over and picks one up. There was such a look of
fright in the man's face. He tells Arnold, `Sir, I just work here.'
Arnold looks at him and says, `You did work here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years later, Player smiles at the memory. ``Such a look
of fright on the poor man's face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the GTE Northwest Classic in Seattle and Palmer turned to
his caddie, Greg Aune, prior to teeing off in the third and final
round. ``I'm going to do something special today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-5 closing hole, Palmer needed a birdie to shoot his
age, 66. ``Everyone knew what was going on,'' said Aune and the
challenge had Palmer focused as if he were stalking a Masters title
in his prime. He killed a drive, said Aune, and had 215 to the
green. ``He had a 5-wood. I couldn't have put a better club in his
hand.'' And? ``And he hit it fat, left it 40 yards short of the
green. I said, `Oh no,' and covered my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Aune couldn't bear to watch the third shot, which Palmer knocked
to 2 1/2 feet. Nor could he witness the putt, which Palmer knocked
dead center. Aune did see the smile, though, a grin that comes with
only the greatest of triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ask those who know Palmer best if he's as good as his press
clippings and they will tell you no, emphatically. ``He's better,''
said Richard Connolly, a close friend of Palmer's for 20 years.
``He walks with kings and queens, but eats hamburgers and hot
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   What he has never understood is why others can't feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   Like one of the first Shark Shootouts at Sherwood CC in Thousand
Oaks, Calif., after which the players talked of a quiet restaurant
up in the hills, away from the crowd. ``What's wrong with that
place,'' asked Palmer, pointing to a local pub, and he was told it
was too crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then that's where we're going,'' said Palmer, and off he went
to have a cheeseburger and a beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no phony baloney with him,'' said Aune. ``He is every
bit as good in person as he is in private.''
</P>
<P>
   It reminds one of what a fellow pro once said of Palmer: ``He
doesn't realize he's Arnold Palmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Which helps explain why, after winning the 1985 Ford Senior
Players Championship by 11 shots at Canterbury Golf Club in
Cleveland, Palmer found himself talking casually to a writer. Said
writer was rushing to a high school reunion and Palmer thought it
sounded like a good idea. So there went Palmer, as a guest, to the
writer's high school reunion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is always asked how much longer he'll play, but everybody
knows Palmer is, above all, a competitor. The passion for the game,
for the challenge, will always be with him.
</P>
<P>
   Like the day he saw a sportswriter he knew playing a round.
Palmer, whose house was on the course, left his garage and offered
the writer some new clubs. The writer declined, pointing to a new
set of Jack Nicklaus irons. Palmer winced, then left as play
continued.
</P>
<P>
   A few holes later, Palmer appeared on the tee. There would be a
match, he announced. The writer objected, thinking the price was
too high.
</P>
<P>
   It was to no avail. ``Let's see how good those Nicklaus clubs
are now,'' said Palmer, a sly grin on his face, a twinkle in his
eye, and a challenge in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, he'll bring that same passion to Nashawtuc CC.
Regardless of what he shoots, the game wins.

KIM PERROT, LEADER OF WNBA CHAMPIONS, DIES OF CANCER AT 32  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Texas, Sweden, Germany, Israel, France)   By MAUREEN BALLEZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Kim Perrot, the tiny floor leader of the Houston
Comets team that has won the first two Women's National Basketball
Association championships, died here Thursday. She was 32.
</P>
<P>
   She died at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
after a public battle against lung cancer. She recently had been
seeking alternative treatment in Mexico after undergoing surgery on
Feb. 24 to remove tumors in her brain, where the cancer had spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought Kim Perrot would be a two-time WNBA
champion?'' she said when she accepted her second championship ring
during a Comets home game on June 22. ``When no one else believed
in me, my teammates and the fans stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, who was 5 feet 5 inches and 130 pounds, was indeed an
unlikely professional champion despite a record-setting career in
college. She held 26 school records at the University of
Southwestern Louisiana, where she remains the career scoring leader
with 2,157 points. In her senior season, she led the nation in
scoring at 30.1 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, she did what other American female basketball
players had to do at the time: she went abroad to play
professionally, spending one year each in Sweden, Germany, Israel
and France.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of college women's basketball, coupled with the
high-profile Olympic championship team at the 1996 Atlanta Games,
put women's basketball on the American sports map. Perrot returned
to the United States and attended an open tryout with the Houston
Comets, who signed her as a developmental player. Her work ethic
impressed her coaches, and by the end of the WNBA's first season,
Perrot was in charge of league's best team. In her two-year career
she averaged 4 assists, 7.2 points, 2.6 steals and 2.9 rebounds a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot is survived by her mother, three brothers and two
sisters.

LEVY OFFERS INSIGHT WITHOUT EGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marv Levy really didn't need this.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, a television network known for its
``attitude'' called the 74-year-old former NFL coach, who stepped
away from the game two years ago because he didn't want to deal
anymore with the grind.
</P>
<P>
   They had an offer: Come to L.A. on the weekends and be part of a
new Sunday-morning NFL pregame show. Oh, and if it works out, stick
around for the weekend to work the telestrator for the nightly news
show as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   This is someone who not so long ago had to take time off from
coaching to beat prostate cancer, which made losing four straight
Super Bowls with the Buffalo Bills seem almost incidental. He
retired after 47 years of coaching in 1997 after his team lost six
of its last seven games and turned a 6-10 season into no fun at
all.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of it, Levy really DID need this job from Fox.
He practically asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net introduces Levy and the newest of Sunday-morning
grid-gab genre with its ``NFL This Morning'' show that'll debut on
Sept. 12 at 8 a.m., leading into the network's NFL better-known
pregame studio show. On the set at the Fox compound in Century City
with Chris Myers and former Rams great Jackie Slater, Levy will
expound on what might be his most passionate diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Levy is content with renovating an apartment in Chicago with his
wife. He's doing OK with motivational speaking, happy to talk about
how the cancer is out of his system. A concerned wife might contact
him and ask if he'll make a personal call to her husband, to make
him go to the doctor to get the blood test that detects prostate
cancer before it becomes a fatal inconvenience. And he's happy to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL . . . there's something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have too high regard for the game to just want this to have
something to do,'' said Levy, who maintains a regimen of running
three miles a day as well as working out in the weight room. ``My
health is excellent. The cancer has been gone for four years and
I'm so excited to get back close to football. There's no slowing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But putting your mug on TV at a place like Fox? Levy has some TV
experience doing NFL games for NBC and the USFL for ESPN, and when
he left coaching made it known in TV circles he'd like to try
broadcasting again. But how does someone who looks more like Buster
Keaton fit in with a network dedicated to a bunch of ex-NFL party
boys who seem to be on their own career ego agenda?
</P>
<P>
   By playing it straight with some deadpan humor that even someone
like Keaton would have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Levy can spot a phony on TV and he doesn't appreciate it. This
is, after all, a guy with a master's degree in English from
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a still-laced Calvin Coolidge, but I don't
want humor to distract,'' said Levy, who was one of the coaches NFL
Films liked to hook up with a microphone during one of its
productions. ``TV makes the NFL very entertaining for fans, but
I've seen too many shows where they think the fans want to see one
guy rib the other guy. I don't want this to be an exercise in
buffoonery. It demeans the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real success of the game depends on the three participants
_ the players, the fans and the media. I don't want to make any of
those adversarial. I want to make this show to appeal to the
spectrum of men and women, young and old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can bring enthusiasm and inject a bit of humor when
it works. That's the only way to approach this. I used to say to my
teams right before the games in the locker room: `Where else would
you rather be than right here, right now?' That's how I feel about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The only game in town: For one year _ 1970 _ Levy worked for
the Los Angeles Rams, a special-teams assistant coach under George
Allen. He remembers the Coliseum filled with NFL fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real event, those Rams games on Sunday, and the fans
were rabid,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   And because the magic stadium sits empty for the fourth NFL
season in a row, Levy is saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was an analyst doing games in the USFL, we went to the
Coliseum (for a game against the Express) and I interviewed the
team owner before the game,'' said Levy. ``He said attendance had
not been very good, but the weather hadn't been good either that
spring. But the day of the game, the newspapers said: `Beautiful
weather expected for the weekend, 1 million expected at the
beaches.' And that's Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe today they're not the same fans you see in Cleveland or
Buffalo or Green Bay because there are so many other things to turn
your attention. But in my opinion, a team belongs there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems almost any place the NFL goes, it's going to ask for
public financing. But I never knew all the machinations to what
goes into financing a team. I had a tough enough time trying to
figure out what Bruce Smith is saying.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Promo this week by KABC Channel 7's Bill Weir: ``Dodgers and
Angels highlights at 11 . . . please watch anyway.'' &QL; 
__ We aren't bowled over by KXTA-AM (1150) luring Terry Bradshaw to
do an hour show each weekday at noon starting Monday, but at least
it does remove a chunk of the time left for the guys who follow. &QL; 
__ John Elway's number-retirement ceremony at halftime of the Sept.
13 Denver-Miami game will be shown instead of the usual highlight
package on the season-opener of ABC's ``Monday Night Football.''
But be warned: Starting with the second week, it'll be Chris Berman
live from the ESPN Zone restaurant in New York's Times Square. Can
the ball drop early this year? &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ OK, so KFI-AM's Tom Leykus needs to fill in an hour of
programming Tuesday, but did it have to be a full-on assault on
KTLA-Channel 5's Claudia Trejos? &QL; 
__ It's going to cost someone at least $3 billion to televise the
NCAA men's basketball tournament past 2002. CBS has first crack
since it holds the current rights and has been negotiating. If CBS
doesn't reach a deal by next week, the network could lose the
rights, with ABC/ESPN, Fox and ISL U.S._ a company that has the
rights to the men's and women's soccer World Cups _ said to be
ready to jump into the bidding. CBS paid $1 billion in 1991 for a
seven- year deal, extended it to 2002 with an extension in 1995
worth $1.73 billion.

STUDY BOLSTERS CASE FOR PIG-DONOR TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For some time, scientists exploring the use of pigs
as organ donors have faced intense criticism over fears that
cross-species transplants could unleash a dangerous animal virus in
humans. Now British researchers say they have encouraging evidence
that pigs' organs are safe enough to begin testing in people.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study yet of people treated with pig tissue,
though not whole pig organs, researchers at Imutran PLC of
Cambridge, England, a biotechnology company that is breeding
genetically modified pigs for their hearts, livers and kidneys,
examined the blood of 160 such patients from around the world,
looking for evidence of a particular pig virus.
</P>
<P>
   None of the patients showed conclusive evidence of infection by
that virus, although the blood of four contained pig antibodies, a
finding that Imutran attributed to some other virus, whose identity
and source, the company said, were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts, however, said the presence of the
antibodies could mean that these four patients had been infected
with the particular pig virus in question at some point after
treatment with the tissue.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the results showing no evidence of widespread
infection were not especially surprising. But there was one
startling discovery: among those patients whose treatment had
consisted of having their blood filtered through pig spleens, pig
cells were still circulating in the bloodstream eights years after
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this study is an important milestone in the
development of this potentially lifesaving technology,'' Dr.
Corinne Savill, Imutran's chief operating officer, said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Savill described as ``good news'' the finding that ``people
are walking around with pig cells in their circulation for up to
eight years and still we cannot detect any infection.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Jonathan S. Allan, a virologist at the Southwest
Foundation for Medical Research in San Antonio, had a different
interpretation. ``If pig cells are still there,'' Allan said,
``there is still a potential that a pig virus could be expressed
and infect the patient at some later time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 62,000 Americans are waiting for human-organ
transplants. And with demand for organs far outstripping supply,
scientists at Imutran, a subsidiary of the Swiss pharmaceutical
giant Novartis International AG, and other biotechnology companies
have spent a decade investigating the use of pigs bred with human
genes as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Already some tests are under way using gene-altered pig cells _
as opposed to cells from ordinary farm pigs, as was done with the
patients in the Imutran study _ as therapy for Parkinson's disease
and other disorders.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Food and Drug Administration, as well as
British regulatory authorities, have said they want better evidence
that pig tissue is safe before allowing tests of ``whole organ''
cross-species transplants to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Imutran study, being reported in Friday's
issue of the journal Science, do not necessarily mean that testing
of cross-species transplants, called xenotransplants, will now be
permitted, said Dr. Philip Noguchi, who supervises xenotransplant
research for the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, which participated in the study by doing its own
laboratory analysis, said the outcome did not completely allay
their safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Noguchi noted, for instance, that most of the subjects of the
Imutran study had been exposed to pig tissue for only days or
months, not years as an organ recipient would be.
</P>
<P>
   The worries over the use of pigs has focused on a single virus,
called porcine endogenous retrovirus, or PERV. Most viruses can be
bred out of pigs, but PERV cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago a British virologist, Robin A. Weiss, proved that
PERV could infect human cells in the test tube. That raised the
question whether the virus, which does not make pigs sick, could
infect people, and, if so, what harm it could do.
</P>
<P>
   Because PERV is a retrovirus, it integrates its own genetic
material into the cells it infects, in the same manner as HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. Experts say that like HIV, PERV could be
latent for years before causing any symptoms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 160 patients in the Imutran study were treated with pig
tissue over a period of 12 years, for various durations and for a
variety of conditions. Over the last 18 months, at Imutran's
request, their doctors took blood samples for the company to
analyze.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the patients, 100, who came from a hospital in St.
Petersburg, Russia, had their blood filtered through pig spleens.
Fifteen burn patients from Germany had pig skin grafts. Still
others received injections of pig pancreas cells for diabetes.

BATS ARE QUIET, BUT FANS AREN'T AS YANKS LOSE TO ROYALS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The foreign sound of the New York Yankees being booed
at Yankee Stadium erupted in several sections Thursday once Jason
Grimsley stumbled to a 3-0 count on Jermaine Dye in the 11th
inning. The Kansas City Royals had loaded the bases, in part
because Derek Jeter had committed another error, and the score was
tied. It was an inopportune time for Grimsley to be suddenly
searching for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The noise escalated even more after Grimsley's fourth pitch
dropped out of the strike zone to force in the go-ahead run in a
game the Royals eventually won, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   From Jeter's miscue to Grimsley's misfiring to a wild throw by
Ricky Ledee and an awkward attempted catch by Jorge Posada, the
Yankees climaxed a sluggish homestand with an inning that would
have made the Toms River East Little Leaguers blush.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone's seven gritty innings were wasted because the
Yankees scored only once off a starter named Blake Stein and five
relievers. Bernie Williams, who again did not start because of a
stomach virus, narrowly missed a chance to win the game as a
pinch-hitter when he lined out to third with two on in the 10th.
Then the emotional pendulum swung dramatically, and the Yankees
imploded in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly way to lose a game,'' Cone said. ``After an
exciting game, to have that happen was a real downer.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Yankees should not panic. They still have a
comfortable lead in the American League East and are almost assured
of barreling into the post-season. But the Yankees went 3-4 against
the vastly inferior Royals and Twins in the past week, and they
have scored only eight runs in their last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Why has the offense disappeared? Especially against Stein, who
won for the first time in the major leagues since Aug. 19, 1998,
and Dan Reichert, who won, 3-0, on Wednesday after entering the
game with a 12.08 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a little funk,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   The funk was defensive in a sloppy 11th. After Johnny Damon's
single, a sacrifice bunt and an intentional walk to Carlos Beltran,
Mike Sweeney slapped a grounder into the shortstop hole. Jeter
glided to his right to corral it, but he picked up his head to peer
at third, and that prevented him from fielding the ball cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game in which Jeter made a
devastating error that helped the Royals rally. His throwing error
on Wednesday resulted in the Royals' first run in the Yankees' 3-0
loss. Jeter has 13 errors, but three in his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I caught it, I was going to third,'' Jeter said. ``It
bounced up and hit the heel of my glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley's matchup with Dye was quick and painful for the
Yankees. It went sinker for ball one, sinker for ball two, fastball
for ball three, the beginning of the boos and then another fastball
for ball four. Damon trotted home with the Royals' second run, and
Grimsley heard the taunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid to see good baseball,'' Grimsley said. ``We played
well up until that last inning. I didn't do my job and we end up
losing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa followed with a fly ball to medium center field. It
would have taken a powerful and accurate throw for Ledee, playing
center in place of Williams, to even dream about nailing Beltran.
As Ledee stood under the ball, he realized that he needed to
retreat another step, so he did not get any momentum going forward.
Instead, he stepped back and unleashed a high, wild throw that
landed about 30 feet to the left of the plate. Posada scampered up
the line to smother the ball, but it ricocheted off his foot and
into the Royals' dugout. The throw was hideous. The attempted catch
was unsightly. Two runs scored _ one on the sacrifice fly and one
on the error _ and the Royals led, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I threw it, I knew something bad was going to happen,''
Ledee said. ``It was an ugly way to lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost it before then by going 0 for 8 with runners in
scoring position. In addition to Williams not starting the last
three games, the Yanks have a bevy of players who are struggling.
Scott Brosius was 0 for 28 before he singled in the 10th, Posada is
7 for 37, Jeter is 3 for 16, Chili Davis is 0 for 14 and Chuck
Knoblauch is 1 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   After stranding seven men in the first three innings, the
Yankees did not have another runner in scoring position until Jeter
sacrificed Brosius to second in the 10th. After Paul O'Neill was
intentionally walked, Al Morman whiffed Tino Martinez. Williams was
the pinch-hitter against Brad Rigby and some fans leaped when he
lashed a bullet toward third, but Randa dived to his left and made
a nifty leaping catch. The play stopped the Yankees and made the
ugly 11th, and the booing, possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans were spoiled all day because everything was so
tight,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``All of a sudden, we let it get
away.''

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ ``We are going to start by demolishing the
British Embassy,'' said Ulrich Lissek, pointing to a squat building
opposite his office. ``Then we're going to take over the
headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party over there. And that
will be just the start of our radical project.''
</P>
<P>
   Lissek may sound like a holdover from some 1960s revolutionary
movement, but he is in fact the chief spokesman for Deutsche
Telekom, the now privatized German telecommunications company that
is in the vanguard of an unlikely plan to transform Bonn's culture
from bureaucratic stodginess to Silicon-Valley sprightliness.
</P>
<P>
   As the German government departs for Berlin this month after a
50-year sojourn on the Rhine, ``Boomtown Bonn'' sounds like an
unlikely slogan. But it is the one making the rounds here as
Telekom and its various subsidiaries buy up great swaths of real
estate, computer company start-ups multiply, and an Internet
banking group thrives.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to all predictions on ``Black Thursday'' _ the day in
June 1991 when Parliament voted to move the German capital back to
Berlin _ Bonn is prospering. Unemployment in the region is 7
percent, far lower than the 16 percent in Berlin, real estate
prices are rising, and only 1.5 percent of office space is vacant,
compared with more than 10 percent in the new capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period of angst is over,'' said Barbel Dieckmann, the
mayor. ``We were a successful capital and we would have liked to
remain the capital, but now we feel Berlin has many reasons to envy
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonn, a city of 330,000 people, is still a genteel place where
the whiff of capitalist enterprise is scarcely overwhelming. But
the city's attempted makeover appears genuine and has wide
implications for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The country is trying to make a painful shift from a highly
regulated society where the state accounts for close to 50 percent
of economic activity to a nimbler, more entrepreneurial system
better able to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bonn's ability to shift from ponderous, state-heavy
predictability to a place on Germany's telecommunications and
information-technology frontier may provide a measure of how far a
culture that is still generally risk-averse may be altered.
</P>
<P>
   With over four million Germans jobless, over 10 percent of the
workforce, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder believes it's time for a
Germany burdened by a graying population and soaring youth
unemployment to rethink itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough of the nanny state,'' Economics Minister Werner Mueller
said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lissek of Telekom agrees. ``We want to engineer a vast shift
from the functionary's culture, which does not prize the client, to
being the most customer-friendly company in the world,'' he said.
``There is a culture of envy here that makes wealth somehow
shameful. We want to make wealth respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   These aims are evident in the vast modern atrium of Telekom's
new Bonn headquarters, where the price of the company's stock in
Frankfurt, New York and Tokyo flashes on one side and an ``Online
Screen'' offers travel and shopping services on the other. For what
was until 1993 a staid state-owned corporation, this is a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road, on land where the British Embassy now stands,
Telekom is planning a $550 million building for about 5,000
employees. Its mobile-phone unit has bought up an old cement
factory on the banks of the Rhine and is planning another huge
development there.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the giant, hundreds of small Bonn computer
companies are springing up, full of Germans talking a remarkably
glib line in ``interfacing,'' ``stock options,'' ``the TeleBonn
concept'' and ``Silicon Valley type models.'' A new Bonn-based
online banking service, Bank 24, hired over 1,000 people last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a three-piece suit, Stefan Huthmacher, the chief
executive of a software and consultant company called Comma Soft,
scarcely looks like a denizen of Palo Alto. But as he shows a
visitor the ``Japanese meditation room,'' complete with screens and
prints, where employees are encouraged to seek inspiration, he
explains that the West Coast has been a model to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to develop the garage start-up mentality among
students in Germany,'' he said. ``One of our problems is that we
persisted too long with classical heavy industries, and did not
adapt our education system fast enough to new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, Huthmacher, a 44-year-old former
university physicist, said that his company had possible openings
for 100 people, but cannot find qualified people to fill the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem to find people,'' he said, ``because
German universities still fail to teach the right disciplines. We
sell knowledge. In an industrial area like the Ruhr, that is still
a hard concept to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The company, which develops networking systems for large
companies or public entities based on Microsoft software, has 125
employees and is planning to go public soon. It recently applied
for permission to put up a building _ a process that can take years
in Germany _ and saw in the city administration's acceptance within
weeks a sign that Bonn is really changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to re-educate our population to look forward,''
said Michael Swoboda, the president of the Bonn Chamber of
Commerce. ``We believe at least 250,000 jobs will be created in
telecommunications and information technology in Germany in the
next five years, and we plan to get a big chunk of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Riek, 25, has created 16 jobs in two years at his
start-up company ID-PRO, a software consultant firm. A former
student of Bonn University, he illustrates the crossover from
university to technology and business that the city now hopes to
nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Of about $1.5 billion that Bonn received as compensation for the
move of the capital to Berlin, the largest part has been spent on a
new science and telecommunications research center called Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany's problems are simple,'' Riek said. ``We suffer from
what I call a `digital gap,' and we don't understand service.
Teachers in general know little about computing, and
business-client relationships are about confrontation rather than
cooperation. My hope is that Bonn can offer some new models.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dieckmann, the mayor, said she was confident of the city's
success. But in good German fashion Bonn is also hedging its bets.
Various U.N. agencies have been lured to the town. Six ministries
are remaining. One or two federal authorities _ including the
Anti-Trust Commission _ are moving from Berlin to Bonn to provide a
counterweight to the departure of over 15,000 civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even hope some spies will remain,'' she said. ``After all,
we are going to be a telecommunications capital, and I've been told
that industrial espionage is very much the wave of the future.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcoa Inc., the world's oldest and largest aluminum company,
announced Thursday that it had agreed to merge with the No. 3
producer, Reynolds Metals Co., in a relatively swift negotiation
that left some Reynolds shareholders grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In an all-stock deal, Reynolds' shareholders will receive 1.06
shares of Alcoa for each Reynolds share. At Wednesday's closing
price of $66.875 for Alcoa, this deal would be valued at around
$4.4 billion, or $70.8875 a share for Reynolds' stockholders. While
accepting this deal, however, Reynolds left open the door for
another buyer to come along, as both companies agreed to allow
Reynolds to solicit takeover bids for the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, which made its first bid for Reynolds last week, agreed
to this somewhat unusual clause because Alcoa executives believed
that Reynolds would find no other bidders, people close to the
merger talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 day shopping-window allows Reynolds, which has been
looking for a potential buyer for nearly a year now, to placate
shareholders who have been angry at Reynolds' management for not
selling the company earlier and for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge against Reynolds is Richard Grubman, managing
director at Highfields Capital Management, a Boston firm that owns
6 percent of Reynolds. In a letter to the Reynolds' board Thursday,
Grubman said, ``You have allowed Alcoa to steal the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubman was especially angered by a rejection last March by
Jeremiah J. Sheehan, the chief executive of Reynolds, of a
1.42-a-share exchange offer from Alcoa. At the time Sheehan was
telling shareholders that no one was interested in acquiring
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your behavior is reprehensible,'' Grubman wrote, adding, ``You
sold us out.'' Grubman also accused Reynolds of ``squandering $2
billion of shareholder value'' and said that Reynolds ``effectively
lied to shareholders'' and ``has reached a new low in corporate
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Grubman nor Reynolds would comment on this letter
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day solicitation window also allows McCook Metals, owned
by the Chicago investment firm Michigan Partners, to make a bid, if
it is interested. Last week, McCook wrote to Reynolds expressing
interest in topping Alcoa's bid, but provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers close to the deal said McCook did not seem serious:
``There was no price, no financing, no nothing. It was all air,''
one said. Calls to McCook Metals were not returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to make it difficult for anyone to halt this merger, the
agreement between Alcoa and Reynolds also contains a $100 million
break-up fee, which would increase the cost of acquiring Reynolds
by about $1.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the deal is completed, Alcoa would still remain the
world's No. 2 aluminum producer after APA, a new company to be
created by the three-company, two-continent merger of Alcan
Aluminium Ltd. of Canada, Pechiney in France and Alusuisse Lonza
Group of Switzerland. That three-way $17.6 billion merger, was
announced last week and would create a huge global competitor for
Alcoa, with projected revenues of $21.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   An Alcoa-Reynolds merger would create a company with $20.5
billion in projected revenues and 120,000 employees in 36
countries. But nearly all those revenues would be derived from
aluminum production, while around $4 billion of APA's projected
revenues would come from non-aluminum assets. This merger wave was
brought on by global overcapacity for aluminum and prices that have
plunged to five-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is good for Alcoa, good for Reynolds shareholders
and good for the aluminum industry,'' said Richard Aldrich, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``With fewer players, there will be
less redundant capacity, which is a long-term plus for the
industry.'' Aldrich dismissed Grubman's complaints as ``20-20
hindsight'' and said he doubted another buyer would come along, but
cautioned that ``anything is possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alcoa and Reynolds executives said they expected that combining
the two companies would realize around $200 million in cost savings
_ a number some analysts said was low _ and they expected antitrust
problems to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious antitrust problem is that the two companies
would represent more than 50 percent of the smelting capacity in
the United States, although analysts say the companies will
probably argue that smelting, a low-margin commodity business,
should be viewed as a global industry, and not as a domestic one.
</P>
<P>
   Other problem areas are minimal. Reynolds is best known for
making such consumer products as aluminum foil and beverage cans,
while Alcoa makes aluminum for heavy industries like planes and
autos. While both companies serve the auto industry, Alcoa is
bigger in castings like engine blocks, while Reynolds makes
aluminum components for wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The two overlap in producing alumina, a compound from which
aluminum is produced. In 1997, Reynolds sold an Alabama rolling
mill to another buyer, after the government rejected its sale to
Alcoa. As a result, say analysts, another antitrust impediment was
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that there won't be some asset divestiture,''
said James Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research. ``But I do
believe that the companies are complementary. Alcoa's management
has said that Reynolds begins where Alcoa stops and I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Alain J.P. Belda, Alcoa's chief executive, said, ``The new
company will be better positioned to address the ongoing
globalization of the metals industry and the new competitive
landscape this is creating.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' chief executive, Sheehan, said, ``Reynolds
shareholders will receive an attractive price for their shares and
still have the opportunity to participate in the upside potential
of the combined company.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tumazos, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the proposed
union ``creates no problems, only opportunities.'' His only concern
was that the automakers, as major users of aluminum, might seek to
lock in long-term, low-price aluminum supply contracts from the
combined company to protect themselves from any potential
monopolistic pricing.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday named Beth Nolan, a
deputy in the Justice Department, as his new counsel, succeeding
Charles F.C. Ruff. Ruff left the White House two weeks ago to
return to private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nolan, 47, a native of Irvington, N.Y., has served as a
deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel at
the Justice Department since 1996. Before that, she taught law at
George Washington University, taking a leave from 1993 to 1995 to
serve as associate counsel to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked Cheryl D. Mills, Ruff's deputy, to become
chief counsel, but she declined.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Clinton said of Ms. Nolan: ``While
Chuck Ruff is a tough act to follow, I know of no one better than
Beth to succeed him.''

BUSH IMPLIES HE HAS USED NO DRUGS IN LAST 25 YEARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has vowed not
to answer questions about whether he has ever used illegal drugs,
answered a few Thursday morning and suggested he had not used drugs
in the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief, informal news conference as he campaigned in
southwestern Virginia, Bush fielded questions for the second
straight day about drug use, and explained why he chose to answer a
question from The Dallas Morning News on the subject Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had been asked ``what I thought was a relevant
question:'' whether as president he would insist that his
appointees undergo full FBI background checks, which include
questions about past drug use. He would, he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I pass the challenge of a background check?'' Bush said
he was then asked. ``My answer is `absolutely.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he could swear that he had not used drugs within the
period required by the Clinton administration of potential
employees _ the previous seven years. Then he went further, saying,
``Not only could I pass the background check and the standards
applied to today's White House, but I could have passed the
background check and the standards applied on the most stringent
conditions when my dad was president of the United States _ a
15-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   That would appear to mean that Bush has not used drugs since
1974, or 15 years before his father's administration, which ran
from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   C. Boyden Gray, President Bush's former White House counsel,
confirmed the 15-year standard, which he said was later relaxed to
10 years. White House spokesman Barry Toiv said that prospective
Clinton administration employees were asked to disclose illegal
drug use for the last seven years, or since age 18, whichever was
less. Some high-level political appointees are asked whether they
have ever used illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, at a second campaign event later Thursday in Columbus,
Ohio, declined to answer whether he could deny using illegal drugs
since he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the American people all I'm going to tell them''
on the subject, he said. ``I hope the people appreciate a candidate
who comes along and says, enough is enough. Enough is enough
digging into people's background years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At his appearance here, Bush said, without giving specifics,
that ``over 20 years ago,'' he did ``some things'' that he now
considered wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the people of this country that over two decades
ago I made some mistakes, when I was younger. I have learned from
those mistakes.'' It was not clear whether he was referring to drug
use or to drinking to excess, which he has acknowledged, or
something else. Bush gave up drinking some years ago and now sticks
to alcohol-free beer.
</P>
<P>
   All the presidential candidates were asked on Wednesday by The
Associated Press whether they had ever used drugs. Spokesmen for
all of Bush's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination
said no. Aides to the Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, admitted that the candidates had used
marijuana in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to reply, and he said in an interview Thursday
night during a flight here that he was determined to end what he
called ``the politics of personal vilification'' and ``give my best
shot at cleansing and re-invigorating the system.''
</P>
<P>
   But to his evident irritation, the governor was peppered at
every stop with questions about drugs _ not from voters, several of
whom said they supported his position, but from reporters. Only one
of several hundred people with whom Bush spoke at a farmer's market
here pressed him to make a fuller statement about drug use. That
was a man in modish sunglasses who refused to give his name, but
said he was a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had answered the Dallas paper's query about FBI
background checks, while refusing to answer most others touching on
the subject of drugs, because it was ``a relevant question about
how I would conduct my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people need to know if there will be
security checks administered on White House personnel. It is a very
good question.''
</P>
<P>
   If the American people ``don't like my position,'' Bush said
here, ``they can go out and find someone else to vote for. That's
the great thing about the American system.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance in New Orleans earlier this week, Bush was
asked whether Texas would follow Kansas' lead and de-emphasize the
teaching of evolution in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he thought such decisions were best left to local
school boards and that he believed children should be taught about
evolution. But he said he saw nothing wrong if teachers wanted to
reflect other views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe children ought to be exposed to different theories
about how the world started,'' Bush said, adding he would not
mandate such teaching.

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a battle between two giant publishing
companies, Walt Disney Co. has decided to sell its Fairchild
Publishing division, which publishes Women's Wear Daily and W, for
$650 million to Conde Nast Publications, the glossy, high-profile
publisher of magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would merge two of the fashion world's most powerful
publishing entities and their distinct publishing styles: the
frills-free but provocative style of Fairchild with the
no-expenses-spared ethos of Conde Nast, a company that will send
luggage overnight by Federal Express if a fatigued fashion editor
does not want to carry it on a flight. A Disney executive said the
agreement would be announced either Friday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications,
and Disney confirmed that S.I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Conde
Nast, had offered close to $650 million for the company _ which
includes influential trade publications like Women's Wear Daily and
Daily News Record and consumer fashion magazines W and Jane _ and
that Disney executives had accepted Newhouse's offer. Executives at
Hearst Magazines, the other bidder for Fairchild and the publisher
of magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Town &AMP; Country, would not
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which is not the largest financial transaction in the
magazine industry in recent years but one of the most influential,
will certainly alter the advertising landscape that preoccupies
magazine publishers. Fairchild publishes Women's Wear Daily, the
influential daily that covers the American fashion industry and
determines the fortunes of designers, and W, one of the
fastest-growing and profitable consumer fashion titles in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will assure Conde Nast's continued dominance in
the fashion magazine industry, in part because advertisers will be
offered package rates to advertise in several magazines at once,
including both Vogue and W.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes advertising rates more attractive because Conde Nast
can put W in with the rest of the package,'' said Roberta
Garfinkle, the director of print media at the McCann-Erickson
advertising agency. ``That's the key. And advertisers will be drawn
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And designers said that the purchase signaled Conde Nast's
continued confidence in the fashion industry. ``I think that,
unlike Harper's Bazaar, which has to change drastically, Women's
Wear and W are not going to change too much, because they are both
so successful,'' Bill Blass said. ``They both have a unique niche
in the fashion industry, and they are unlike anybody else. They are
daring, but with a certain restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   The merging of the companies means that Conde Nast will own more
fashion advertising dollars than any other magazine publisher. That
is an expanding field worth hundreds of millions of dollars in
revenue each year and includes advertising for toiletries and
cosmetics, apparel and accessories, home furnishings and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel and accessories advertisers spent $536 million in
American magazines from January to July this year, an increase of
8.8 percent compared with the period a year earlier, according to
the Publishers Information Bureau. Virtually every fashion designer
_ from Calvin Klein to Donna Karan _ is expanding into home
furnishings and supplies, an advertising category that is up 16.2
percent, to $614 million for January to July. And retail
advertising is up 32.2 percent, to $313 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the deal, W magazine, has taken apparel advertising
from magazines at both Hearst and Conde Nast. In 1998, W boasted
2,005 advertising pages for the year, while Harper's Bazaar _
previously second to Vogue _ lagged behind at 1,542. Vogue led the
field with 2,681 pages of advertising last year, and in second
place, with 2,068 pages, was Elle, published by the
Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines unit of Lagardere Group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, W generated $33.5 million in advertising revenue for
Fairchild, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, and by
1998 that figure had increased to $87.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet what Conde Nast proposes to do with the
numerous trade titles that Fairchild publishes _ small, profitable
publications like Supermarket News, Brand Marketing, Footwear News
and Children's Business _ but one Conde Nast executive said that
the company would prefer to keep them because they turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Los Angeles magazine, also published under the
Fairchild umbrella, is also not clear. A Disney executive said that
Disney might prefer to keep that magazine as a kind of home-town
periodical.

</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Disney has wrestled with the issue of
whether to sell Fairchild since 1995, when Disney _ never a
traditional magazine publisher _ acquired Capital Cities/ABC, then
the longtime parent company of Fairchild. And for a while,
Fairchild seemed destined for the auction block: in 1997, Disney
even announced a decision to sell the division, then retracted it a
week later. But Disney has been under pressure recently from Wall
Street to revive its core businesses, such as its theme parks and
movie studio and sell its nonstrategic assets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already sold some of the noncore assets it
acquired with Capital Cities. In April 1997, Disney sold four
newspapers acquired in the deal, including The Kansas City Star and
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Disney sold the trade publisher Chilton to the
British-Dutch company Reed Elsevier for $447 million and
Institutional Investor Inc. to Euromoney Publications for $142
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen P. Black, the president of Hearst Magazines, was eager
to acquire Fairchild, a Disney executive said. And a deal with
Hearst seemed almost a fait accompli because the Hearst Corp. has
several affiliations with Disney: Hearst television stations are
affiliates of ABC, which is owned by Disney, and Hearst owns 20
percent of ESPN, of which ABC owns the balance. Hearst also owns a
small piece of ESPN magazine. And ABC and Hearst are both investors
in two cable services: Lifetime and Arts and Entertainment. But the
Hearst Corp.'s recent acquisition of The San Francisco Chronicle
for $500 million may have chilled the company's ardor for more
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for Disney and Hearst declined to comment. Maurie
Perl, a spokeswoman for Conde Nast, said that the company did not
comment on acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In the famously gossip-prone magazine industry, where glee at
other's misfortune is freely displayed and fortunes rise and fall
with the speed of a season's hemlines, the purchase of Fairchild
further cements the intensifying rivalry between Conde Nast and
Hearst Magazines, which is as competitive as two avid New York
shoppers fighting for the last pair of discounted Manolo Blahnik
slippers at a Seventh Avenue sample sale.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tina Brown _ who edited two Conde Nast titles, Vanity
Fair and The New Yorker _ signed on with Hearst to produce her new
magazine, Talk. (The other partner in Talk is Miramax Films, a unit
of Disney.) In June, Hearst announced that Katherine Betts, the
fashion news director at Vogue, would become editor in chief of its
primary fashion title, Harper's Bazaar _ and Ms. Betts has hired at
least four of her former Conde Nast colleagues to accompany her in
remaking the magazine, earning the ire of her former co-workers at
Conde Nast.

`MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN:' THE EVER-CHANGING SCENERY OF
WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We're all in God's hands,'' says the chaplain. The
old woman beside him answers, ``I don't think it has gotten that
bad yet.'' At another point she observes, ``I have learned that
nothing comes when you think it will, not even the season.'' At one
point a major pays one of the woman's sons, whose name is Elvis,
the highest compliment: ``You have the makings of a young Marcos.''
The woman describes her only daughter as ``half-GI.'' She will
eventually lose all her children to war.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``Mother Courage and Her Children,'' but in the Ma-Yi
Theater Company's admirable if sometimes stiff production, numerous
changes have been made. Bertolt Brecht's original Mutter Courage's
name has been translated to Nanay Isog, and the setting has been
changed, from the 30 Years' War to the Philippine conflict between
1971 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The play's original setting ``may have less impact for a nation
that has continued to suffer from its colonial past,'' Rodolfo
Carlos Vera, who wrote the adaptation, has said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we felt compelled to pull Mother Courage's cart
through the villages of Jolo, Zamboanga and the Maguindanao
regions,'' he continues. ``We realized that what happened in
Mindanao in the 1970s resembled the three decades of war in
17th-century Europe, differentiated mainly by magnitude and
geography.'' The resulting message seems to be that all wars are
bad in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're peace-loving people,'' says Nanay (Ching Valdes-Aran),
holding a knife to the neck of a soldier who wants her son to sign
up and fight. Ms. Valdes-Aran's portrayal of the matriarch who
makes her living by war (she sells wares from a traveling cart to
soldiers) has both strengths and weaknesses. Her bearing, that of a
woman beaten down and exhausted but not defeated, is convincing,
and she is a competent actress, but her singing voice lacks both
power and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily most of the rest of the cast has strong voices, so the
production's several musical numbers are largely effective. (Fabian
Obispo is the composer; Vadim Feichtner and Nicky Paraiso are the
musical directors.) Apparently this is not the case with Tess Lina,
who plays Ynez, the loose woman who marries a warlord. She recites
some of her lyrics, in the style of Rex Harrison in ``My Fair
Lady,'' while another actress, several feet behind her, sings them.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Eastman's set _ gray corrugated tin walls and a yellow
stage floor with a pattern that looks like dirty footprints _ is
just right. Doing the battle scenes by strobe light, however, is a
painfully cliched choice, and it doesn't fit the overall tempo of
Tazewell Thompson's direction.

U.S. INDICTS SUPREMACIST IN MAILMAN'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal grand jury Thursday indicted the white
supremacist Buford O. Furrow Jr. on three felony counts in the
murder here last week of a Filipino-American letter carrier, as the
government focused its prosecution on charges that could result in
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, has been held without bail since he turned himself
in and confessed to the killing and to the shooting of five people
at a Jewish community center last week.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with the murder of a federal employee, Joseph
Santos Ileto; with the use of a firearm in the murder, and with the
illegal possession of a firearm by a felon. Furrow has a previous
felony assault conviction in his native Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The murder charge and the charge that he used a firearm in the
killing of Ileto, 39, both carry a possible death penalty. Furrow
is scheduled to be arraigned on Aug. 30, when he will enter his
plea. His court-appointed lawyer, Sean Kennedy, did not return
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was a clear indication that the prosecutors
wanted to pursue the case without delay and obtain the harshest
possible sentence for Furrow. It also answered any lingering
questions about whether the federal or state prosecutors in the
district attorney's office would proceed first with charges against
Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   The two offices filed separate criminal charges last week, but
sought to stress their cooperation Thursday. U.S. Attorney
Alejandro N. Mayorkas said that one or perhaps two prosecutors from
the district attorney's office would be appointed special assistant
U.S. attorneys to assist in the federal case, an effort to present
a united front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Garcetti and I decided together that at this juncture this
is the best course of action,'' Mayorkas said, referring to
District Attorney Gil Garcetti.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings began in the morning of Aug. 10 at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center in the neighborhood of Granada
Hills. Furrow admitted he fired more than 70 bullets from an Uzi
submachine gun, hitting five people, including three children. All
survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow said he carjacked a Toyota a few miles away, and then
spotted Ileto on a quiet street, where he was delivering mail.
Furrow said he decided to kill Ileto, shooting him nine times at
close range, because he was not white and was a ``target of
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, for years a member of the Aryan Nations, a hate group
based in Idaho, turned himself in to the FBI in Las Vegas the next
morning. He had slipped through a massive police dragnet after the
shootings and told police he had wandered around the streets of
Hollywood, reportedly getting a haircut, shopping for a baseball
cap and drinking a few beers before taking an $800 taxi ride across
the desert and spending the night in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He was casual enough after the shootings that he made his way
about 20 miles to Hollywood and then went to Scorecard, a sporting
goods store, and tried on Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves
baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Sanders, the store's manager, said that Furrow wandered
in alone around 2 p.m. Aug. 10, and that the only notable part of
the visit came as Furrow responded angrily when a salesperson joked
about Furrow's thick neck and offered to get him an extra large
cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't take it well,'' Sanders said, adding that Furrow
bought nothing and just walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain about how Furrow assembled his arsenal,
including an assault rifle, hand grenades and more than 5,000
rounds of ammunition; whether he had any assistance in locating
targets in a city he apparently did not know well, and how he
managed to slip past the police.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that Furrow may face further firearms
charges for the attack on the community center, and civil rights
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether anyone else would be charged and whether the
number of charges might be increased, Mayorkas would say only,
``The investigation is continuing.''

GREEK ORTHODOX ARCHBISHOP RESIGNS IN FACE OF DISSENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Greece, Italy, Turkey, Ohio, Mass.)   By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The highest ranking cleric of the Greek Orthodox Church in the
United States, Archbishop Spyridon, who has domain over a flock of
1.5 million, resigned Thursday after more than a year of unrest and
dissension in the denomination and growing demands by priests and
laity for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop, who is 54, did not specify a reason for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   He is to be replaced by Metropolitan Demetrios Trakatellis of
Greece, who is 71. A former professor at Harvard Divinity School
and at the Holy Cross School of Theology in Brookline, Mass., one
of two institutions in the United States that prepare students for
the Greek Orthodox priesthood, he was elected by the Ecumenical
Synod presided by Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, who
has responsibility for the church in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the archbishop, who directed the largest and
richest of the various Orthodox Christian churches in this country,
is effective Aug. 30. The incoming archbishop is expected to arrive
in the United States in about three weeks, according to the
Religion News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday, will be
temporarily assigned to a post in Turkey, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A church spokesman would not comment on whether the archbishop
had voluntarily stepped down, but clearly the pressure to force him
out had been mounting in recent months, culminating in proposals
early this year that the American church sever its ties to the
mother church in Greece and declare itself autocephalous, or
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the archbishop said that he had diminished the
quality of education at Holy Cross by dismissing some of its most
respected professors and administrators, that there were
irregularities in the handling of church financial matters, that he
ruled in an autocratic manner permitting no dissension and that he
failed to recognize that the church was no longer an immigrant
institution but one rooted in American practices and philosophy.
Some local churches began to withhold their funds from the central
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, even Spyridon's most steadfast supporters seemed
relieved that the battle was over and the threats of schism
quelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will be healing and peaceful,'' said one of the
archbishop's closest associates, John A. Catsimatidis, president of
the Archdiocesan Council, the church's highest organization of
laity. ``I know that Demetrios will do everything possible to bring
everybody together.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of Spyridon, Catsimatidis said: ``I profoundly regret his
forthcoming departure. I will always cherish my friendship with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that he was doing a generally good job,'' he said.
``He was trained in Europe and was thrown into the fire in America
without being familiar with some of the American ways.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop was born in Ohio but received much of his
theological training in Greece and Italy and spent most of his
adult life there.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of resignation issued via the Internet Thursday, the
archbishop said, ``There is grace upon grace for my heart is clean
of any malice, ill will or judgment of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his announcement enumerated his accomplishments,
including reaching out to interfaith couples and members of other
faiths, speaking up for victims of the war in Serbia and expanding
the church's press office.
</P>
<P>
   About his critics _ the most vociferous of whom were members of
an organization called Greek Orthodox American Leaders, or GOAL _
he said, ``Their attack of words has done far more damage to our
Greek Orthodox family than it has to those entrusted with its
leadership.'' But he added, that to them, ``I extend my heartfelt
archpastoral forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissatisfaction with Spyridon came to a head in January when
the five American metropolitans, the senior bishops who preside
over large dioceses and wield significant power, went to Istanbul,
Turkey, and petitioned Bartholomew for the removal of the
archbishop. They were sent home and told to make peace with him.
</P>
<P>
   One of those metropolitans, Methodios, who presides over the
Boston diocese that encompasses most of New England, returned from
Istanbul Thursday, where he said he had an audience with the
patriach on unrelated matters. ``I am delighted with the selection
of Metropolitan Demetrios, a scholar and deeply spiritual man of
prayer,'' he said. ``I had the privilege of being with him in 1984
when I came as a bishop to Boston and he was a professor at Harvard
Divinity School and at Holy Cross, and have had many opportunities
to work with him since.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dean G. Popps, spokesman for GOAL, which may now disband, said,
``The long ordeal and period of disorderliness in the affairs of
our archdiocese appear to be over. We are prayerful and supportive
of the new archbishop, Demetrios, who will have a monumental task
ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Robert G. Stephanopoulos, dean of the Archdiocesan
Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan, who was stripped of
most of his administrative and liturgical responsibility, though
not his title, by the archbishop for signing a letter of criticism,
joined the chorus of approval Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied that every effort was made to help Spyridon
in service to the church, but a lot of mistakes were made,'' said
the dean, who is the father of George Stephanopoulos, the former
presidential adviser. ``It was not a very pleasant experience, but
now that it is over, we are hopeful that we have an individual who
can bring us all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Stephanopoulos, who expects to return to his former
position, said, ``Now I will have something to do again.''

BUSH SAYS HE HAS NOT USED DRUGS SINCE 1974 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, relenting
somewhat to demands that he reveal whether he has ever used illegal
drugs, said Thursday he has not used drugs since 1974. But he
balked at any questions about drug use before then, saying, ``I
made mistakes years ago. I've learned from those mistakes.``
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's remarks on the drug issue came on the
second day of his efforts to end a controversy that has dogged him
on and off since he first ran for governor in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's attempts only opened him up to more questions as,
over the course of two days, he set up _ and then nudged back _ a
statute of limitation on disclosing whether he used drugs that does
not conform to that required of many White House employees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Dallas Morning News questioned him about a
requirement that federal employees answer questions about drug use
to receive high-security clearance. The standard for the Clinton
White House is seven years without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not used drugs in the last seven years, but
wouldn't go back further than that.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday morning, however, he held a news conference in
Roanoke, Va., at a campaign stop and volunteered that he could not
only pass the Clinton administration's background check, but the
check used by his father's White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that under his father's administration those working
for the White House had to disclose whether they had used drugs in
the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only could I pass the background check and the standards
applied to today's White House, but I could have passed the
background check and the standards applied on the most stringent
conditions when my dad was president of the United States,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That means, Bush aides said, if the younger Bush had gone to
work for his father when he took office in 1989, he could not have
used drugs since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the GOP front-runner added: ``I have told the people of
this country that over two decades ago I made some mistakes, when I
was younger. I have learned from those mistakes.'' He refused to
elaborate on the drug question. But throughout Bush's candidacy, he
has discussed other aspects of his personal life, including his
drinking, his marriage and his religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   However, the federal disclosure requirements developed by
President Bush's White House also required that applicants say if
they had used drugs since they were 18 years old. The new question
was designed after it was revealed that Supreme Court nominee
Douglas Ginsburg had at one time smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, 53, drew a line at an afternoon news conference in
Columbus, Ohio, and adamantly refused to discuss whether he used
drugs before 1974, when he was 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the American people all I am going to tell them,'' Bush
said. Even as he gave a partial answer to the drug question, Bush
insisted that to discuss it further would be harmful to the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is important to put a stake in the ground and say
enough is enough when it comes to digging up people's backgrounds
in politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he hoped voters would accept his answer. If not, he
said, ``they can go find someone else to vote for.``
</P>
<P>
   The White House's ``Questionnaire for National Security
Positions'' asks whether an applicant has ``illegally used any
controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack
cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin,
etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,
tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said that form is filled out by
job applicants who need security clearances. Toiv said most
applicants in this administration must answer the question
concerning use of those substances in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But Toiv said about 1,500 employees of the White House follow
further instructions that tell them the drug question must be
answered back to their 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush's statement Thursday
focused on whether he could meet the standard for employment at the
White House, not to how he would answer the standard drug question
for national security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's answering the standard. He's making clear that
he would adhere to the standard. As of today, he could adhere to
the standard,`` Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the drug question on the national security
questionnaire is not meant for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for security purposes. It's not used by you,`` Tucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush would not talk about drug use between the ages of 18
and 28, he responded to a question about whether he used drugs
while he was in the Texas Air National Guard from 1968 to 1973 by
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have done anything to jeopardize myself. I got
airborne and I got on the ground very successfully.``
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Bush's Guard unit at Ellington Air Force Base
in Houston, retired Gen. Walter B. Staudt, said illegal drug use
was, of course, banned for members of the unit, but as for drug
testing, ``Nobody had invented it. I never heard of anybody doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug issue overshadowed Bush's visit to a faith-based
organization that helps welfare recipients on the east side of
Columbus find work. Bush, accompanied by Ohio Gov. Robert Taft, met
with members of The Enrichment Association of Community Healing
Center in a housing project whose neighborhood was once dubbed,
``Uzi Alley'' because of frequent gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was told that the Christian-based organization that
received taxpayer funding helped people move from welfare to work
by assisting them in resume writing, child care and rent payments.
</P>
<P>
   But the news conference that followed the visit to TEACH was
dominated by the drug questions. Local residents had mixed
responses as to whether presidential candidates should be pressed
on past drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for somebody leading the country, you really need to
know,'' said one resident, who identified himself only as Greg.
</P>
<P>
   But another local resident, Bill Case, dismissed the drug
question as irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about what he did in the past. I care about what
he is going to do in the future,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   After his trip to the housing project, Bush moved on to more
affluent quarters for a fund-raiser hosted by Leslie Wexner,
founder of The Limited clothing-store chain. The event was expected
to generate another $200,000 for Bush's already brimming campaign
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush will be in Akron, where he will visit a
faith-based homeless shelter and attend a fund-raiser.

 &HT;    Braves make up for lost time
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The past three days at Coors Field sucked plenty of
life out of the Braves' offense and left John Rocker with a
terrible case of altitude sickness.
</P>
<P>
   But it ended well for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   In a game lasting more innings than any they had played this
year, they came away with a 9-7 victory in 14 innings Thursday to
pull within a half-game of the first-place Mets in the National
League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so numb to the fact that somebody was going to win the
game,'' said Chipper Jones, whose three-run home run gave the
Braves a 4-2 lead back in the eighth. ``Nothing mattered when it
was after about the 12th. I was saying if you're going to do it, do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Andruw Jones, who doubled to left field with two out in
the top of the 14th. Randall Simon followed by sending the first
pitch from left-handed reliever Roberto Ramirez into right field to
score Jones for the go-ahead run. After an intentional walk to Jose
Hernandez, Eddie Perez provided some insurance with a single that,
aided by a Lenny Harris error, allowed two more runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all tired,'' Simon said. ``Everybody wanted to go
home. He started me with a curveball, so I thought he'd come back
with a curveball or a slider. I just tried to stay back and use my
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' three runs in the 14th equaled their production off
Rockies pitching in the previous two games, both losses. Bruce Chen
got his first career relief win after pitching a scoreless 13th,
but he needed help in the 14th from Terry Mulholland, the starting
pitcher two days earlier. It was Mulholland's first save as a
Brave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more hungry than anything else,'' said Mulholland, who
said he could have gone another inning.
</P>
<P>
   After two uncharacteristically low-scoring games and a 2-1
Colorado lead after seven innings in this one, Coors Field made up
for lost time in the eighth and ninth innings. The Braves and
Rockies scored nine times and traded the lead twice before a Bret
Boone run-scoring single with two outs in the ninth set it up for
extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field made up for lost time in the eighth and ninth
innings. The Braves and Rockies scored nine times and traded the
lead twice before a Bret Boone run-scoring single with two outs in
the ninth set it up for extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most innings played in a game at Coors Field since
the first played in the stadium on April 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker blew a save opportunity for the second consecutive day.
On Wednesday, a three-run home run by Larry Walker in the ninth
inning saddled him with his first loss since June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a bases-loaded walk to Angel Echevarria followed by a
bases-loaded double by Jeff Barry in the eighth turned a 4-2 lead
into a 6-4 deficit. A two-out, two-run rally by the Braves off
Rockies closer Dave Veres in the ninth saved Rocker from another
loss.
</P>
<P>
   In three appearances here this season, Rocker allowed seven runs
while recording only two outs for a 94.45 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the day was for the closers, it was another good one
for the starters.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz, who was pitching with a sore elbow and sore groin,
and who has now gone a career-high nine games without a win, gave
another very winnable performance. He held the Rockies to two runs
on five hits with no walks and eight strikeouts, the most
strikeouts he's had since his nine on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it feels like two years,'' Smoltz said of his
winless streak. ``I just keep plugging along and doing what I set
out to do and try to give the team a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile, the Rockies' free-agent flop, looked like anything
but against the Braves for the first seven innings, limiting them
to one run on four hits while striking out five. But he let the
Braves break out of their offensive trance and take a 4-2 lead in
the eighth by giving up a walk to Gerald Williams, a single to
Boone and Chipper Jones' 32nd home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had scored only four runs in their previous 25
innings.

 &HT;    Sore-handed Jordan rests most of game
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Brian Jordan did not start Thursday to rest his injured
right hand. He continues to be bothered by a bad bruise from being
hit by a pitch June 22.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who has played 18 games in a row (he entered in the
eighth inning), might have a CT scan done when the Braves return
home this weekend to determine if he's hurt more than doctors
originally thought. The pain and swelling has spread to other parts
of his hand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're hurt, you're hurt,'' Jordan said. ``You want to
play here (in Coors Field), but it doesn't matter. I am (upset). I
hate watching baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams replaced Jordan in right field. Ryan Klesko hit
cleanup and played left field for the first time since Aug. 6, when
he switched from first base at mid-game against the Giants. His
last start in left field was Aug. 4 against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took fly balls the day before yesterday,'' said Klesko, who
has started 46 games in left field and 44 games at first base this
season. ``The ball carries differently here. You really have to
concentrate to get under fly balls here. No matter how long you've
been coming here, you really have to concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Simon started at first base for the first time since
Aug. 4 in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies rested Larry Walker and Dante Bichette, though both
pinch hit.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker: `Mental breakdown'
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker was more angry about two walks in a row than
Wednesday's winning homer to Walker. Rocker walked Neifi Perez and
Terry Shumpert before Walker's ninth-inning blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mentally into it,'' said Rocker, who ended a streak
of 14 consecutive scoreless outings in 15 2/3 innings. ``I don't
know (why). There are just some days you have more trouble
concentrating than others. It's just a mental breakdown. There's no
reason to go out there and not have better command.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had thrown Walker two good sliders _ one for a ball, one
for a called strike _ before hanging the fateful 1-2 slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what messes you up here,'' said Rocker, who has allowed
six runs in one-third of an inning in two outings at Coors Field.
``In Atlanta, that pitch probably would have been a high strike.
Here, it doesn't move. (Kevin) Millwood showed you can throw good
breaking balls here ... (but) if you have the slightest lapse in
concentration, an average pitch turns into a real bad pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's homer was the first Rocker has given up to a
left-handed hitter this season.

 &HT;    Tide of turmoil slams Bama

<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ A steady stream of cars pulls into the
parking lot off Paul W. Bryant Drive. After finding a spot, each
driver and his passengers jump out of the vehicle and walk quickly
toward the light.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't rushing to church. But they are heading for the next
thing to it here. The Alabama football team is holding its first
preseason practice in pads, and the whole family is invited.
</P>
<P>
   The people who have come out to the Alabama practice field on
this warm Tuesday night appear to be upbeat and ready to celebrate
the start of the season less than three weeks away. But underneath
the surface, tension again runs through the Alabama family.
</P>
<P>
   This season was going to be the one in which Alabama took a
major step toward what the faithful believe is its rightful place,
at the top of the football hierarchy. After seasons of 4-7 and 7-5,
Alabama had been picked by many experts to win the SEC's Western
Division and play for the conference championship. Breaking with
tradition, which is no small occurrence here, the school was
touting a player, running back Shaun Alexander, for the Heisman
Trophy. Optimism, in short supply for the past two years, was
rampant.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed Aug. 5 when coach Mike DuBose stood before
television cameras and admitted that he had engaged in an improper
relationship with a former secretary and had ``misled'' everyone in
May when he denied it.
</P>
<P>
   By then, university President Andrew Sorensen and athletics
director Bob Bockrath had worked out a plan they hoped would end
the episode. The former secretary, Debbie Gibson, would be paid
$350,000 to withdraw claims of sexual harassment and sexual
discrimination.The money would come out of DuBose's salary over the
next 30 months. The length of his contract would be reduced from
five years to three, but he would not be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the penalties) are pretty harsh,'' Bockrath said
later, ``not only from a monetary standpoint, but in the attention
it draws on one individual. I think (DuBose) has paid a substantial
price.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many people, it wasn't enough. Thousands of fans took
DuBose's indiscretion personally. On talk shows and in media polls
taken after the announcement, a majority said DuBose should have
been fired immediately.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose supporters asked for compassion and said that firing the
coach a month before the season would have been folly. But they
were drowned out by the passion of those who thought DuBose had
sullied the reputation of their most prized institution: the
Alabama football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've hurt this university and the people who love it,''
DuBose said. ``That hurts, because I love this university. It still
hurts. But we've paid a price, and that part has been put behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. The controversy continues in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ The university's board of trustees met Aug. 10 for four hours
and grudgingly supported the plan of Sorensen and Bockrath. Board
president Sid McDonald said DuBose would keep his job. But it was
implied that the board could change its mind if other problems
occur. ``The scars won't heal quickly,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least one Alabama newspaper is digging around to see if
DuBose committed any other personal indiscretions. Nothing has been
reported.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several advertisers in the team's game programs have asked
that DuBose's picture be removed from their ads and replaced by a
generic football picture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sorensen was quoted as wondering if he could trust DuBose in
any matter, even in following NCAA rules. Sorensen declined an
interview request for this article. Spokeswoman Janet Griffith said
the comments were taken out of context from a frenzied news
conference after the board of trustees meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After the publicity when the story broke two weeks ago, most
Alabama officials were unwilling to speak on the record this week
and hoped that the story would go away. DuBose was an exception.
</P>
<P>
   But discussions with those behind the scenes indicated that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bockrath met with the assistant coaches last week and told
them that if they took care of business ``on the field'' things
would work out. The thinking is that if Alabama wins eight or nine
games _ including the Nov. 20 game at Auburn _ DuBose will keep his
job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several big-money boosters sent letters of support to the
coaching staff. Their message was: ``Do your job and everything
will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If DuBose is retained after this season, odds are good that
the two years taken from his contract will be reinstated;
otherwise, the contract situation could damage recruiting. If
DuBose is not retained, his buyout would be reasonable for the
school to absorb.
</P>
<P>
   The administration apparently will wait until after the season
to decide DuBose's fate. Then, and only then, will school officials
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   But DuBose doesn't think the situation has left him twisting in
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be evaluated on what we do, but from that
standpoint, that's not different than any other year,'' he said.
``But given the circumstances, I can see why others would sit back
and say the verdict is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's players insist that the controversy is overblown and
that they do not have to win to save DuBose's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' said Alexander, whose Heisman candidacy has been
minimized. ``Coach stood up before us, said he made a mistake and
apologized for it. Now we all move on. The only thing keeping this
thing alive is you guys (in the media).''
</P>
<P>
   At practice Tuesday evening, everyone was trying to put the best
face on a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   Sorensen, looking somewhat out of place in a shirt and tie,
arrived early and gave his annual address to the team. The players
hung on every word as he gave DuBose an unequivocal vote of
confidence. Paul Bryant Jr., the wealthy son of the legendary
coach, watched quietly in the background, as king-makers do. Polly
DuBose, the coach's wife, dutifully made the rounds of friends, and
friends of friends, accepting hugs and reassurances at every stop.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what matters is what happens on the field. September
promises to be interesting. After the Vanderbilt game are games
with Houston and Louisiana Tech at Birmingham's Legion Field. Then
Arkansas comes to Tuscaloosa on Sept. 25. It will be the first game
on campus and one that will be key to Alabama's hopes in the West.
If the Crimson Tide is 4-0 going into its Oct. 2 trip to Florida,
Bama has a chance for a very good season.
</P>
<P>
   But one stumble, or even an ugly victory against a lesser
opponent, and DuBose runs the risk of his detractors coming back in
full force. And the critics will be relentless. The only way to
keep the negativity at bay is to win _and win impressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've lost the trust of some people here, and that kind
of trust you don't get back overnight,'' said DuBose, who is 11-12
in two years as coach. ``It's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who do not win at Alabama, time is always running
out.

McNOWN AMONG McUNKNOWNS? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four years ago this month, a freckled freshman
named Cade McNown arrived in Westwood to begin a record-setting
career.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was UCLA's fourth-string quarterback, stuck
behind unproven veterans Ryan Fien, Rob Walker and Steve Buck. But
it did not take long for depth-chart tectonics to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Buck broke his thumb early in training camp and never recovered
the lost ground. Walker was ineffective and Fien, the starter,
suffered concussions in the first two games. By late September,
McNown had emerged from the morass to claim the starting job and he
never let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the 1999 season opener, UCLA's quarterback
quagmire has come full circle. Once again, there are four
candidates, myriad questions and no easy answers. Is there another
McNown in the group or are they simply a bunch of young Bucks?
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Bruins coach Bob Toledo and offensive coordinator
Al Borges will select two candidates to compete for the starting
job. Based on practice performance, it appears junior Drew Bennett
and redshirt freshman Cory Paus have surged ahead of sophomore
Scott McEwan and redshirt freshman Ryan McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to formulate some ideas,'' Toledo said. ``We've
seen what they've done and what they haven't done. We've charted
them, but we're going to wait for (a scrimmage) Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus, a 6-2, 220-pounder from New Lenox, Ill., has been the most
consistent and the most accurate. He doesn't have a great arm
(neither did McNown), but he throws a tight spiral that's pillow
soft. He's an instinctive leader, tough and confident, with a knack
for big plays. Tuesday, he threw the pass of the preseason _ a
majestic 40-yard strike over receiver Jon Dubravac's outside
shoulder, inches beyond three defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cory has been really consistent,'' McEwan said. ``He's
throwing the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bennett and McEwan constantly evaluate the competition _
``I even check how everyone else is doing in the weight room,''
McEwan said _ Paus keeps his gaze internal and his plan practical.
His goal wasn't to win the job in spring practice, for instance,
but to stay within range of Bennett, whose experience gave him a
huge early advantage. This week, Paus has been focused on surviving
the first cut and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to keep myself in the top two and stay in the
race,'' he said. ``If I can keep it like that, I'll probably play
in the first game. All I want to do is get to that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Paus wins the job outright or splits time with Bennett _
Toledo is considering a two-man platoon for the opener _ depends on
how quickly he learns the offense. There are dozens of passing
plays, a plethora of patterns within each play and several options
for each pattern. McNown needed 18 months to absorb it. Bennett has
had three years, and Paus, 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a good grasp of all the plays and reads,
and what plays are good with what defenses,'' Bennett said. ``I
know where the (third and fourth) receivers are on all the
routes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett's head has outperformed his arm. He worked on
mechanics all summer _ refining his footwork and balance, honing
his release point _ yet his passes often flutter. His immense
athleticism and grasp of the offense might be enough to beat Boise
State and Fresno State, but Pac-10 defenses will feast on his
floaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Drew has a downside, he needs to be a more consistent
thrower,'' Borges said. ``But he's ironing that out.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan, a Thousand Oaks native, also has thrown better in recent
days and might have gained ground. He has the strongest arm of the
group and trails only Bennett in experience. But is there enough
time for McEwan to overcome a skittish start, which he attributed
to flawed mechanics? Toledo has shown no sign of wavering on the
weekend deadline. There's barely enough time to prepare two
quarterbacks for game conditions, much less three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing my whole future ahead of me in one week,'' said
McEwan, who has used his redshirt year. ``There's a lot of
pressure, but quarterbacks have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann, out of Agoura High, doesn't appear bothered by pressure
or mechanical flaws. He has a prototype delivery and good pace on
his passes. But McCann is not as experienced as Bennett and not as
accurate as Paus _ at least not yet. By next week, who knows? An
injury here, a slump there, and the quarterback shuffle could begin
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a tough situation,'' Borges said. ``It's the
epitome of paralysis by analysis. The guys are trying to absorb so
much stuff, and there's so little time, and they're trying to
impress the coaches and they're trying to make plays. It's not
easy.''

 MARION JONES WANTS TO GO WHERE NO WOMAN HAS GONE BEFORE: FOUR GOLD
MEDALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones has been asked to address the same
topics for months, and Thursday, as she sat next to Michael Johnson
and Maurice Greene on a makeshift stage with a microphone in her
hand and a lazy stretch of the Guadalquivir River in the
background, she was asked again by a much larger audience than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Was she ready to peak at the world track and field championships
here? Were her long-jumping difficulties no longer difficulties?
Which relay would she run and why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get this meet started now,'' Jones said with
only 48 more hours of prologue to endure and the just-barely
finished 60,000-seat stadium in Seville in clear view in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has done this to herself, stamping out subplots with her
surpassing talent and willfully, cheerfully, convincingly,
generating the highest expectations by proclaiming well in advance
what she wants to achieve. Four gold medals in Seville and five
next year at the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, are what she wants,
although it is not what she predicts. Therein lies the difference,
and part of Jones' appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Muhammad Ali braggadocio,'' said Craig Masback, the
chief executive of USA Track and Field, who has watched Jones both
sprint and field questions with style.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some awkward questions to handle lately in the
wake of the positive drug tests that have led to the suspension of
the American sprinter Dennis Mitchell and cast a shadow over the
Olympic gold medalists Javier Sotomayor and Linford Christie. On
Wednesday night, Jones discovered that another familiar name had
been added to that list: Merlene Ottey, the Jamaican who was
running remarkably fast before the 23-year-old Jones was born and
who withdrew from these championships after the banned steroid
nandrolone was detected in a test administered last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody could have thought this was going to
happen,'' Jones said. ``Obviously in the past couple of weeks our
beautiful and lovely sport has been marred by all of this. I think
the athletes wish we could have come here to Seville and put all of
that in the past and start on a positive note. Once again, we've
started on a negative note, but we can only hope that our wonderful
performances in a couple of days will overshadow everything that
has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones won two gold medals in her first world championships in
Athens, Greece, two summers ago, in the 100 meters and in the 4 x
100-meter relay. This year, her goal is to win the 100 and 200, the
long jump and then either the 4 x 100 or 4 x 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Women have won four medals at the same world championships, but
no woman has won four gold medals. After an opening ceremony on
Friday night, Jones will begin her quest with a burst of activity
on Saturday. The qualifying round for the women's long jump begins
at 10:30 a.m. Fifteen minutes later, the first round of the 100
begins. The second round of the 100 is on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go out there and hopefully on my first jump
qualify and be able to concentrate on the 100 after that,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jones makes it look easy, track and field experts know
the truth. ``Any time you try to knock off even three events, it's
a huge tussle,'' said Lance Harter, the coach of the American
women's team in Seville. ``But to be considered a relay candidate,
too, with the number of rounds she has to go through, is
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smith, who coaches Greene and Inger Miller, an American who
could pose a slight threat to Jones in the 200, said: ``She's going
to stand on that podium four or five times. It's just a matter of
which color she's going to stand there with. But I'm going to be
watching very intently to see it happen. There is going to be some
history being made, and I think the sport needs that. And,
actually, she needs challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is nearing her peak and will have plenty of chances to
show off with three world championships and two Olympics in the
next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion Jones is arguably the best athlete in the world right
now and what I call the first female athlete who will have a chance
to transcend sports as Pele and Ali and Michael Jordan did on a
worldwide basis,'' said Masback, who, in light of track and field's
minor status in the United States, has a major stake in that
prediction coming true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, what is the universe of female sports stars?''
Masback asked. ``Tennis stars basically, who traditionally are
hermetically sealed and grew up on country clubs and, at least
historically, are not people of color. With all due respect to the
women's soccer World Cup, how many countries are serious about
soccer for women? But track and field, there are 150 or 160
countries of the 210 here who have serious women's programs. And so
when Marion is the world champion, it means something, and the
world will come to know her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' biggest challenge in Seville should be the long jump, in
which she finished 10th in Athens. Though her times and margins of
victory have not been as awesome this season, she has not lost a
sprint since 1997, but she has been beaten three times in the long
jump in that span: in last year's Grand Prix final by Heike
Drechsler, in this year's U.S. championships by Dawn Burrell and by
Drechsler at a meet in Linz, Austria, on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had problems the last couple of competitions with my
rhythm on the runway,'' she said. ``But since Linz, we've gone back
to the drawing board, and I'm ready and excited to get out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The long jump final is on Monday night; the first two rounds of
the 200 on Tuesday; the semifinals on Wednesday and the final on
Friday. Then, she said, she will choose between the 4 x 400 and 4 x
100 relays.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the decision likely will unfold this way: ``Trevor
Graham, my coach, has told me that after my three individual events
are done and hopefully I'm happy with three wins there, he said
he's going to look into my eyes and tell if I'm ready to run a 400
meters or not.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jones already has three golds by then, Graham will probably
see a lot more than that in his pupil's eyes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When John Fairchild was sent to Paris in 1955 to run
the European offices of his family's newspaper company, which
included Women's Wear Daily, he found that his reporters were
seated in the last row at the twice-a-year couture shows. Why not
front and center? To the titans of French chic, Women's Wear Daily
was little more than a trade rag devoted to ladies suits and
corsets.
</P>
<P>
   Fairchild changed all that. Asked Thursday what he did to
improve his seating _ and raise the stature of his trade
publication so that in time it became known as ``the Bible of
fashion'' _ Fairchild laughed and said, ``I got mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fairchild, who retired in 1996, would not comment on
news of the pending sale of Fairchild Publications, which is owned
by Walt Disney, to Conde Nast, he seemed to favor such an
acquisition. ``If the sale goes through, my reaction is they will
get the jewels,'' he said, referring to the likelihood that Conde
Nast, a unit of Advance Publications &UR;  &LR; that owns Vogue, Vanity Fair
and Glamour, will have Women's Wear Daily and its sister
publication, W.
</P>
<P>
   Under Fairchild, who became publisher in 1960, Women's Wear
Daily became as feared as it was ruthlessly observant of the
changing social scene. He discovered that the most interesting
people on Seventh Avenue were not the manufacturers, but the
unheralded designers behind the scenes, people like Bill Blass, who
were often at chic parties with their clients. Women's Wear Daily
helped create the cult of celebrity that developed around
designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very changeable, and a lot depended on who he last
spoke to,'' said June Weir, a former Women's Wear Daily fashion
editor.
</P>
<P>
   But it was news, and a sense of the new in fashion, that gave
Women's Wear Daily (and later W) its provocative edge, and that
could make or break a designer. A former staff member recalled that
Fairchild and an editor once chided a designer for planning
elaborate hats with his clothes. The designer took the advice, but
in Women's Wear Daily's glowing review of his collection that
followed, the headline said, ``Hats Off!''
</P>
<P>
   If Women's Wear Daily and W created excitement around fashion
and its ever-changing cast of characters, its feuds were also
legend, whether with Geoffrey Beene, Yves Saint Laurent or Giorgio
Armani. Norman Norell, once hailed by Women's Wear Daily as
``Fashion Great,'' was eventually diminished to ``Old Master.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Fairchild,'' said Carrie Donovan, a former fashion editor
at Vogue and The New York Times, ``everything was personal; yet he
never missed the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Patrick McCarthy, the current chairman and editorial
director, the personal is not so apparent _ or as capricious.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Women's Wear Daily still had bite, Fairchild
demurred and said with a laugh, ``Times have changed, and maybe I
was wrong.'' He added, ``Back then, we were fighting for our
survival.''

3 JAPANESE BANKS DISCUSSING $1.3 TRILLION COMBINATION

 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Three major Japanese banks confirmed Thursday that they
were in discussions about a possible merger that would create the
world's largest financial institution, with $1.3 trillion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, if completed, would be the biggest step taken
by individual Japanese banks to overcome the effects of the
nation's protracted recession, which has left the banking industry
hobbled by bad debts. It also could help the three Japanese banks
adapt to the government's deregulation of the financial markets,
which is creating new competition in the banking and securities
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the banks said in a brief statement that they were
working toward forming a joint holding company. Their statement
followed a report in Japan's leading business daily, Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, that they had been negotiating an alliance aimed at
bringing about an integration of their activities within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's report led to speculation that more such mergers
would be coming in Japanese banking, and this contributed to a
rally in bank stocks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo shares rose 11 percent,
Industrial Bank of Japan shares gained nearly 9 percent and Fuji
shares gained 1 percent before the Tokyo Stock Exchange halted
trading in them shortly before the banks confirmed that they were
in talks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is unclear whether such a combination would
succeed, partly because of the sheer magnitude of the three-way
merger. Their combined assets would surpass the $899 billion in
assets of Deutsche Bank (with Bankers Trust), making such a
combination potentially the world's biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   It would also surpass what would have become the world's biggest
bank if Banque Nationale de Paris had succeeded in acquiring
Paribas and Societe Generale. The assets in that three-way deal
would have totaled around $1 trillion. Banque Nationale won
shareholder approval only from Paribas.

<P>
   Regardless of whether a Japanese bank deal comes to fruition,
analysts said there would probably be more consolidations in an
industry that remains bloated and inefficient. Many banks are still
struggling under the weight of hundreds of billions of dollars in
loans that soured when the Japanese real estate market collapsed in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And though interest rates here have fallen to record lows, which
should stimulate more lending and help bank profits, the balance
sheets of many institutions remain weak.
</P>
<P>
   The 3 banks are among 15 that were beneficiaries of an enormous
government-financed rescue package in March. Although they are all
saddled with large bad debts, the banks concentrate in different
businesses that could complement each other, were they to merge
into one huge force.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Bank of Japan, for example, is the only domestic bank
that still specializes in long-term loans to Japanese companies.
Its two competitors, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon
Credit Bank, were seized by the government after they became
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Bank would regain its presence in the securities business
through IBJ Securities, a subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of
Japan that is one of the most profitable securities operations in
the country. Fuji lost its securities business link nearly two
years ago when an affiliate, Yamaichi Securities, collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Dai-Ichi Kangyo, one of Japan's biggest lenders, would benefit
by gaining the customers of the two others.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks combined have 41,000 employees in 772 branches
in Japan and abroad. But any merger of this size would probably
lead to cost-cutting and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoting unidentified banking officials,
said the three institutions would divide their operations in
retail, corporate and investment banking, hoping to realize large
economies of scale.  &QL;

PERROT, INSPIRATIONAL LEADER OF HOUSTON COMETS, DIES OF CANCER AT
32

<P>
   Houston Comets guard Kim Perrot, whose fighting spirit and
tender heart inspired cheers in times of triumph and prayers as she
struggled for her life, died Thursday afternoon, ending her
six-month battle with brain and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She was 32.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot came to Houston in 1997, a shy woman who at 5 feet 5
inches tall was given little chance of making the Houston Comets'
10-player roster during the inaugural season of the Women's
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she endure, she led the Comets to two WNBA
championships as the team's emotional leader. After she was
diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, the on-court firebrand
became a cheery, tireless spokeswoman for construction of Kim's
Place, a residential facility for children suffering from
life-threatening illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family promise that dream will endure in the wake of
Perrot's death shortly before 3 p.m. CDT Thursday at M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim was an inspiration to each of us, and she touched all of
our lives in so many ways,'' the Perrot family said in a statement
released by the Comets. ``We will always love her and cherish her
in our heart, and we know that each of you will, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the bedside was Perrot's closest friend on the
Comets, Cynthia Cooper. The rest of the team received word of her
death after arriving in Los Angeles, where the Comets will play the
Los Angeles Sparks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Comets coach Van Chancellor said he has lost his best friend, a
woman who was as close to him as a daughter and a player who, when
the coach's words failed, could move her teammates to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things went bad, Kim was the person who held this team
together,'' Chancellor said. ``She leaves a void in my life that
can never be filled. How do you lose someone you loved so much?''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA President Val Ackerman said, ``The entire WNBA family is
devastated by this tragic loss. We will always remember Kim as a
woman of great heart and indomitable courage who refused to be
daunted by any challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot had spent much of the past month in Tijuana, Mexico,
receiving alternative treatment for lung cancer that had spread to
her brain. But her condition worsened, and she was flown back to
Houston early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot received word of the cancer diagnosis Feb. 19. It was a
bolt from the blue for Perrot, a nonsmoker and the most physically
fit member of the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, during an emotional news conference at the
Comets' Westside Tennis Club practice center, Perrot clutched at
the hand of Chancellor, her friend, father figure and coach, and
fought back tears as she disclosed her condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a fighter all my life,'' she said. ``This is just
another fight, and I'm going to win this one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later at M.D. Anderson, Perrot underwent surgery to
remove a golf-ball-sized tumor from her brain. Four smaller tumors
also were found in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot also had advanced alveolar adenocarcinoma, which accounts
for only 2 percent to 4 percent of lung cancer cases but is the
most common form of lung cancer in nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   In cases such as Perrot's, when tumors spread to the brain, the
cancer is ``virtually incurable,'' said Garrett Lynch, acting chief
of oncology at Baylor College of Medicine. Average survival is
three to six months, and only 15 percent of patients survive one
year.
</P>
<P>
   Though chemotherapy was offered as an option, Perrot chose
instead to travel to Tijuana for alternative treatment. The family
has declined to discuss details of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said patients sometimes seek alternative therapies in
Mexico such as shark cartilage, laetrile (an extract from apricot
pits purported to cause regression of cancer), vitamins and herbs.
Lynch said laetrile was not shown to be effective in a National
Cancer Institute study. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of
shark cartilage are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her illness, Perrot once again became a familiar face at
Comets practices and games early this season. On June 18 at Compaq
Center, she received her 1998 WNBA championship ring from
Chancellor and Rockets executive Carroll Dawson. She felt strong
enough six days later to travel with the team on a two-game trip to
Detroit and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But after a day and a half in Detroit, Perrot flew back to
Houston because of ``job-related business,'' she said. Over the
next month, her visits to the Comets became far less frequent and
of shorter duration.
</P>
<P>
   But Perrot was at Compaq Center on July 11 when the Comets
hosted the Sacramento Monarchs. The Comets built a 23-point
first-half lead, then began to wither in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``During one timeout,'' said Chancellor, ``she came into the
huddle behind me, and I didn't even see her, didn't know she was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `Coach, you know I love you.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the Comets held on for a five-point victory, the lingering
memory for Chancellor was not the win, but Perrot's words. He burst
into tears while recounting them earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Perrot returned to Tijuana. Cooper said she planned
to return to Houston in mid-August to begin chemotherapy. During
the first week of August, however, Cooper was summoned to Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's OK,'' Cooper said, ``but she's finding the fight a
little tougher than she expected.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, the Comets were told Perrot had taken a turn for the
worse. Team owner Leslie Alexander arranged for her to be flown to
Houston and for her family to join her.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette, Perrot was a
member of the U.S. national team in 1989 and 1990. She scored 58
points in a game against Southeastern Louisiana, the second-highest
single-game total in NCAA history, and she led the nation in
scoring her senior year with an average of 30.1 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   After playing professional basketball for six seasons in Sweden,
Germany, Israel and France, she was invited to try out for the
newly formed WNBA in 1997. Chancellor fondly recalls her as being
``the 58th player on a 55-player roster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had no chance of making our team,'' Chancellor said.
``None. But she proved everybody wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of person Kim Perrot is. She was the most
lovable person you'd ever want to meet, but put a challenge in
front of her, and she'd fight you tooth and nail.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuts and bolts of Perrot's career _ 7.2 points per game, 230
assists and 153 steals _ were overshadowed by her leadership and
her impact on those she met in hundreds of public appearances
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got up every day having to prove herself being 5-5, and
she overcame more things. It made her tough,'' said the Rockets'
Dawson. ``I believed in everything she said she was going to do.
She was an extraordinary person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably talk to as many people a day in my job as anybody.
It's always before business starts: `How's Kim doing?' She touched
a lot of people. The world's not as good as it was before 3
o'clock.''
</P>
<P>

TENNANT, BLUTE TELL CONFLICTING TALES ON CRUISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Breaking his silence over the scandalous harbor cruise
that that has rocked the state's political establishment,
Republican operative Alexander Tennant Thursday fingered ousted
Massport director Peter Blute as the event's organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant also said he had, at Blute's invitation, joined a
similar cruise last August with about 15 people, including Massport
officials, at which there was heavy drinking and socializing. He
said Blute had also organized that trip and the agency paid the
$575 tab for the boat's rental.
</P>
<P>
   Blute denied Tennant's account and said the 1998 summer outing
was ordered by Massport board member George Cashman to view harbor
facilities and was not for pleasure. Cashman was not available for
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is careening out of control,'' said Blute when told of
Tennant's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Massport officials say private boats are hired from time to time
for official cruises, especially for out-of-town VIPs. Usually
alcohol is served aboard the cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Massport would not provide details Thursday of the cruises or
how much they cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bring board members out there all the time,'' Blute said in
an interview with the Globe. ``It was not like the one that
happened the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the previous trips involved the Nauticus, the cabin
cruiser the agency rented for Tuesday's now infamous voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant's first public comments since Tuesday about the cruise
revealed a rift between him and Blute, his friend of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess all around,'' said one top Cellucci insider.
</P>
<P>
   The two men caused the first major scandal of the Cellucci
administration after they were photographed by The Boston Herald
drinking beer and champagne with women dressed in beachwear. One of
the women, identified by sources as Gidget Churchill, a part-time
actress and stunt double, bared her breasts for the Herald
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Blute was forced to resign by Governor Paul Cellucci, who was
reportedly furious at Blute's behavior and the embarrassing photos.
Cellucci, who is on vacation in Florida this week, and Lieutenant
Governor Jane Swift have severed all ties with Tennant, who has
used his connections to Cellucci to boost his lobbying business.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant said Blute set up the cruise in July, and invited
Tennant to come along.
</P>
<P>
   But Blute Thursday insisted his account that Tennant had
requested he set up Tuesday's party cruise is correct. He pointed
out that he had boarded the boat alone, while the others aboard
were Tennant's guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one who brought the people,'' Blute said. ``There
was nobody from Massport except myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Blute has admitted arranging through Massport for the boat's
rental, but said it was always assumed ``private parties'' would
reimburse the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Tennant also revealed details of the cover story he
and Blute came up with late in the afternoon, after realizing they
had been spotted by the media drinking and socializing with the
women aboard the Nauticus.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant said he, Blute and Maureen Stemberg _ a well-known
Boston socialite who joined the cruise on its final leg _ decided
together they would tell the media that Stemberg, ex-wife of
Staples chief Tom Stemberg, would pay for the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   As the story blew up Wednesday, more questions were asked, and
Stemberg balked, Blute reimbursed the agency $834 for the boat
rental.
</P>
<P>
   Blute said he went along with the initial story, a decision he
admits was a serious mistake. But he insisted that the story had
been created by Tennant to cover up the fact that the Massport was
paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   Blute expressed frustration at his friends continuing the debate
over his behavior, which he said showed a serious error in
judgment. TV news reporters were stationed outside his Shrewsbury
home Thursday and he was granting interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Another Massport official expressed frustration with Tennant, a
lobbyist who has made inquiries recently at Massport for his
client, Arthur Winn, who wants to build luxury housing on the East
Boston waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy has been harrassing the hell out of us for Arthur
Winn,'' said one Massport insider. The source said Tennant had
wanted Blute and others to restrict the bidding so that Winn's
competition would be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant said Thursday he could not discuss his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Angry at media coverage, Tennant also fiercely defended his
right to carry on a lifestyle that includes socializing at Boston
night spots and political circles with one or several young women.
He said he and his wife had agreed to separate nearly three years
ago and that he is free to conduct his private life as he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do with my time is nobody's business but my own,''
Tennant said. ``If someone has a problem with my lifestyle they
should deal with me and stop harrassing my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennant said the media Thursday descended on his family home and
frightened his wife and children. He said he and his wife had
wanted to keep their separation private to protect their children.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant also said he deeply regretted the embarrassment he had
created for Cellucci. ``I feel very badly if I caused him any
embarrassment,'' Tennant said. ``It certainly was not my
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood why Cellucci had to cut his ties with him.
``Paul had to do what was in his best political interest,'' Tennant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, interim Massport executive director Scott L. Kafker
said the agency was trying to move beyond the shock of Blute's
resignation and concentrate on business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction to everyone is to stop spending time worrying
about this stuff and get back to work,'' Kafker said.
</P>
<P>
   Kafker also forcefully reminded senior Massport staff of the
agency's ethical rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday's events are obviously extraordinary and very
disturbing,'' Kafker said. ``There are rules that prevent the use
of public moneys for non-public purposes. We are trying to make
sure nothing slips through the cracks here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafker, who is not considered a candidate to permanently replace
Blute, would not speculate about how long he might serve as acting
executive director.

WOMAN WHO BARED BREASTS A STUNT DOUBLE, ACTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY AND FRANK PHILLIPS AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The mystery woman who bared her breasts at a news
photographer at the end of a controversial harbor cruise this week
had only days earlier attended a private fund-raiser for Governor
Paul Cellucci, sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was identified as Gidget Churchill, a stunt double and
actress who has appeared on the television shows ``Melrose Place''
and ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' and the movies ``Celtic Pride,'' and
``Clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's on-line resume says she has also doubled for such
actresses as Jennifer Aniston and Kathy Ireland, and appeared in
the racy Showtime series ``Red Shoe Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's identity became known Thursday, as pictures of her
baring her chest appeared repeatedly on television, serving as a
tawdry defining image for the cruise-boat scandal that claimed the
job of Massport executive director Peter Blute Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Churchill was aboard the 70-foot cabin cruiser
Nautica Tuesday afternoon as a guest of Massport consultant David
McCool, a former advance man for the governor. Neither McCool nor
Churchill returned calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of the cruise first appeared in the Wednesday Boston
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill also attended a Cellucci fund-raiser last week
arranged by Massport board member and local Teamster leader George
Cashman and by Lorna McCool, David McCool's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Both Blute and GOP lobbyist Alexander ``Sandy'' Tennant, who
joined Blute on the cruise that has rocked the Cellucci
administration, said they did not know Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea who she is,'' Blute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's resume was posted at the Web site of Gravity Works,
a California-based company that specializes in amusement park
rides, extreme sports equipment, and movie and television stunts.
</P>
<P>
   The resume lists stunts she has performed for 11 movies and
television shows. The stunts include ``Bike Fall, Near Miss,'' for
the television show ``Double Rush,'' ``High Fall'' for ``The Brady
Bunch Movie,'' and ``Non-Descript Stunts'' for ``Clueless'' and
``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Skills'' featured on the resume include SCUBA diving,
jetskiing, motorcycling, and rapelling.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill has also been identified as a longtime supporter of
the Make a Wish Foundation, which raises money to grant wishes to
children with severe illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's resume listed no date of birth, but sources said she
is in her mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   As the political world buzzed about the cruise-boat debacle,
insiders pondered why a woman would expose herself to a
photographer in broad daylight and in the company of a top state
official. To some, a stunt artist for hire like Churchill fit
neatly into conspiracy theories that imagine Blute as the victim of
an elaborate political dirty trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's speculation all over the city about whether this is a
set-up,'' said one source close to Massport.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other sources pointed to Churchill's attendance at the
Cellucci fund-raiser with David McCool, a close friend of Blute and
Tennant, as a sign that she was not likely to be part of a plot to
embarrass the former Massport chief.

WHAT makes athletes special also makes them vulnerable. Sometimes
they are too strong, too tough and too headstrong for their own
good. They drink too much or drive too fast or they do both at once
because they think they can, because they wrongheadedly believe
they are immortal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show me a hero, and I will write you a tragedy,'' F. Scott
Fitzgerald once said. But Kim Perrot was a different kind of hero,
and a different kind of tragedy. Once, her story was as uplifting
as any I have ever covered. Today, honestly, it's the saddest.
</P>
<P>
   See, Kim didn't do anything wrong. You kidding? She did
everything right. She worked twice as hard as the next player, she
believed in herself when almost no one else wanted to, and she
politely refused to accept no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Van Chancellor, the Comets' coach, admits he wrote her off the
first day of practice, ranking her as the longest shot among dozens
trying to stick. Yet nobody, except perhaps two-time WNBA MVP
Cynthia Cooper, came to value her more than Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   A spindly, unheralded 5-foot-5 woman making a living, albeit it
a humble one relative to that of her hulking male counterparts, as
a professional basketball player? Ridiculous. And miraculous. If
anybody, anybody, could have defeated the kind of cancer that was
destroying her lungs and attacking her brain, it was going to be
Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   No one could have, of course. This was bad, bad stuff. The worst
imaginable. Medical people who heard what her illness was when we
were told of it at a tear-stained February news conference _ Kim
bravely opted to break the news herself _ shook their heads. They
understood. They couldn't say it, but she never stood a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes miracles aren't an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``In incidents like this,'' Rockets/Comets executive Carroll
Dawson said, ``when you're so close to someone, you tend to think
more with your heart than you do with your head. She had overcome
everything. I believe she thought she was going to beat this, and I
did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Kim probably realized from the start the magnitude
of what she was confronting. It wasn't something simple like making
a basketball team or gaining a starting job or contributing hugely
to two championship runs. Guts, heart and desire, all of which she
possessed in such abundance, making her a front-and-center Comet
despite many obvious physical shortcomings, wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's relentlessly positive outlook and sunny disposition
might have prolonged her life a little _ and touched a great many
other lives in the process _ but they wouldn't save her. We weren't
in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   She died Thursday afternoon, six months after the awful clock
started ticking. Everything that could have been done was done,
down to the obligatory last-ditch, futile pilgrimage to Mexico for
``experimental'' treatment. You only hope she went comfortably,
without pain or fear, having made peace with her god.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, meanwhile, were already in Los Angeles, where they
must play the most seemingly empty and unimportant of basketball
games tonight. But, honestly, it's a game they must win because
that's the one truly appropriate way to honor the memory of someone
as determined and courageous as Perrot was.
</P>
<P>
   As pros, you suck up, you give your all and you win. Then you
grieve. Then you win again Saturday and you grieve some more. Then
you keep on winning until you have your arms around another WNBA
title.
</P>
<P>
   For Kim, this one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, it won't be easy. That's the way you
want it, though, because nothing came easy for Perrot. Had she not
achieved a measure of celebrity for her basketball achievements,
very few of us would have paid notice to her passing. Lots of folks
died Thursday without newspaper stories and columns being written
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Kim willed herself to be special. Kim made herself be noticed _
the right way. Her path never detoured across a police blotter or
through a detox center. But while you loathe the screaming
injustice of a unique athlete and a good person dying young, in her
prime, you find a modicum of solace in your memories of her.
</P>
<P>
   The way she ran Van Chancellor's offense, at once reading,
interpreting and creating. The way she flustered, irritated and
occasionally embarrassed larger, more celebrated opponents with her
scrappy defense. The way she and Cynthia Cooper came to be of the
same mind, instinctively reacting to what the other would do _
before she did it.
</P>
<P>
   We had already come to miss that, and accepted how it could
never be again. Just the same, the finality of the news of Kim's
death cut a hole in us anyway. You realize there's no answer, but
you can't help it. Over and over, you still ask why.

AIKMAN EXPECTING COWBOYS' REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Jogging the memory can be a painful
experience, even if you have three Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to take you through the period we just came out
of ... \Rwhere\S we did nothing on the football field to indicate
we were doing anything right,'' Aikman said of the Cowboys' 6-10
season two years ago and one playoff victory since their last Super
Bowl victory in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'm not surprised that people have their doubts. But
slowly, in my opinion, we're regaining some respectability.`
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys might be 25-1 Super Bowl long shots in Las Vegas.
They might be panned as a team in decline and criticized for having
had only one draft choice since the '93 draft _ Larry Allen _ make
the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Aikman isn't afraid to look ahead. And, for the
first time in a while, it has become easier than looking behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to get some young players in here who are
really going to help this team,'' Aikman said. ``But for the
longest time, we were losing great players and doing nothing to
replace them. We weren't bringing in any youth that would sustain
us.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer Ekuban. Peppi Zellner. Dat Nguyen. Wane McGarity.
Solomon Page. Of the Cowboys' eight draft choices, these five, and
maybe a sixth, barring injury, should make this team and should
make significant contributions as rookies in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ellis. Flozell Adams. From the '98 draft come two '99
starters, at least.
</P>
<P>
   David LaFleur. From the '97 draft comes this key player to the
'99 offense, according to no less an authority on the Cowboys'
offense than its quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be the offense that we hope to be, then
\RLaFleur\S is going to be a very integral part of it,'' Aikman
said. ``He is extremely important to us in the running game. He's
also important to us in the passing game. In a two-back offense, if
you don't have a tight end who can win in passing situations,
you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7, 280-pound LaFleur only recently has returned to
practice after suffering a broken right ankle in workouts on May
11. A week later, he underwent back surgery to repair a herniated
disk.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur is scheduled to make his preseason debut tomorrow night
at New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely playing,'' LaFleur said yesterday. ``I don't
feel totally back to where I was \Rbefore breaking the ankle\S ...
but then I wasn't the fastest tight end in the first place. I'm
struggling with \Rthe ankle\S, but I'm getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur welcomes the pressure put on him by Aikman, saying,
``Everybody wants to be involved as much as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The '98 Cowboys offense was disappointing in four of its last
five games. Not coincidentally, LaFleur missed 3 1/2 of those five
games with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur doesn't have to be the reincarnate of Jay Novacek for
this offense to prosper. LaFleur simply needs to block like an
offensive tackle and beat mostly linebackers on short to
intermediate routes. But he has to be able to do it consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the tight end in this offense isn't going to be
like the tight end with Novacek in it a few years ago,'' LaFleur
said. ``But coach Gailey and the offensive staff are taking it upon
themselves to involve the tight end more. I hope I can step up and
fill the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin try to
recapture their lost youth and magic, there is the arrival of this
young talent, looking to sustain the Cowboys in a way that drafts
earlier this decade could not do.
</P>
<P>
   And if this doesn't translate into a movement by the so-called
experts to pick the Cowboys to repeat as NFC East champs and make a
strong run in the playoffs, well, Aikman isn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody has anything good to say about any
team in the NFL,'' said the six-time Pro Bowl quarterback, who is
starting his 11th season. ``I could say the same thing: `This team
or that team is not going to win the Super Bowl. This team or that
team doesn't have a chance,' and you know what? I'm going to be
right 30 out of 31 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to win a Super Bowl. Minnesota had a great year,
but who cares? Denver won the Super Bowl. Was Minnesota's season
better than ours season last year? Statistically, it was. But I
don't know if they feel any better about their season than we feel
about ours. This game is about winning the Super Bowl. If you don't
do that, it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk how the \RCowboys\S struggled over four of the
last five games and how Minnesota piled up 50 points a game. Who
cares?'' Aikman concluded. ``Minnesota lost in the NFC Championship
Game and had a great statistical year. Five years from now, nobody
is going to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, no one remembers.''

PARIBAS CHAIRMAN MAY BE FIRST CASUALTY IN FRENCH BANK BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The chairman of Paribas is expected to hand in his
resignation when the bank's board meets next week in the aftermath
of the company's takeover by Banque Nationale de Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Andre Levy-Lang, had strongly favored an alliance
of Paribas with another French rival, Societe Generale. He would
become the first top executive casualty since the five-month battle
among the banks reached a climax last week when Banque Nationale
won 65.1 percent of Paribas shares in a tender offer, but gained
only 31.5 percent of the stock voting rights at Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   Levy-Lang, 61, who together with the chairman of Societe
Generale, Daniel Bouton, had announced in February a merger of
their banks, had fought Banque Nationale's hostile bid for both its
rivals with a whirlwind of visits to major financial capitals,
trying to convince analysts and asset managers of the superiority
of the two-way alliance. He was expected to head the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The bid made in March by Banque Nationale was only partly
successful. France's bank regulators are expected to announce the
official outcome of the bids next week, and a banker with access to
Levy-Lang said he planned to resign then.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation from Paribas, which he has run since 1990, would
mean the departure of one of France's best-known bankers. A
soft-spoken yet hard-driving executive, Levy-Lang stood out among
his generation of French bankers for having spent part of his
career in the United States. Though a graduate of one of the elite
French training schools, he had a degree in business administration
from Stanford University and worked in Minneapolis in the 1960s for
a unit of Schlumberger.
</P>
<P>
   The share price of all three banks seesawed Thursday, reflecting
skittishness about the outcome of the standoff between Banque
Nationale and Societe Generale. Banque Nationale shares fell
slightly, while Societe Generale and Paribas shares rose
fractionally.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bouton of Societe Generale urged the government to force
Banque Nationale to divest itself of its Societe Generale shares,
many bankers say that Paris will put pressure on Banque Nationale
and Societe Generale to reach an accommodation, perhaps through a
cross-shareholding and some form of business cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kalff, chairman of the Dutch bank ABN Amro, one of Europe's
most expansion-minded banks, said during a news conference Thursday
that his company was `'very interested in Societe Generale.'' But
he added that ``everybody can see the signs the French authorities
want a French solution.''

MAVERICKS COACH'S TRIP TO CHINA NOT A BIG JOKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, it seemed like a logical request.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the People's Liberation Army contains an estimated 2.5
million soldiers. Surely, they could have spared one tall, skinny
private.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, though he and the boss flew all the way
to Beijing for one Chinese take-out order, Don Nelson will be
returning empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chinese team's manager, it is ``not the right
time'' for 7-foot-1 Wang Zhizhi to abandon his homeland for a
career with the NBA's Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   (Supply own joke here).
</P>
<P>
   Qian Limin, who runs the Army team, the Bayi Rockets, did say it
was ``a nice thing'' that Wang was selected by the Mavs in the June
NBA draft. Speaking in Mandarin, Qian also politely left out all
mention of the Jason Kidd trade.
</P>
<P>
   The item made ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' and the daily notes
section of sports pages across the United States. A good chuckle
probably was had by all.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be realistic here. Did Nelson and owner Ross Perot Jr.
really expect young Wang to be waiting in his barracks, duffel bag
packed, eager to elope with basketball's global Welcome Wagon, the
Mavericks?
</P>
<P>
   No. The idea was simply to secure Wang's draft rights by
tendering him a contract offer. Under China's Military Service Law
of 1984, all men _ and women _ between the ages of 18 and 22 are
liable for at least three years of compulsory military service.
Eventually, therefore, his military commitment will be satisfied.
And if Wang ever plays anywhere where the Chinese flag isn't flown,
Nelson wanted to make sure that it is Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Second-round draft picks are not odds-on choices to
log prompt NBA playing time, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to defend this latest Tour de Nellie for a second. The
trip builds goodwill. There was also no guarantee, given the
vagaries of the international mails, that the contract offer would
have ever reached Wang's company mail call.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Nelson likely finally got to see Wang work out first hand.
</P>
<P>
   The trip reminds me of a personal quest that I undertook at the
1976 Montreal Olympics, during the days when the media was still
allowed to roam the hallways of the Athletes Village. The team from
back home, the then-New Orleans Jazz, had caused a mild stir that
spring by drafting the NBA rights to Soviet Union center Alexander
Belov. The Jazz had no clue of what to do after that.
</P>
<P>
   Yours truly volunteered to test the negotiating waters. I was
escorted through the winding halls of the delegation village by Jim
``Hoss'' Brock, the great former Cotton Bowl impresario, who was
assisting the U.S. Olympic Committee's public-relations contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, it must be noted, never met a stranger and has the
defining habit of referring to everyone he speaks to as ``Hoss.''
</P>
<P>
   With Brock leading the way, we finally found the temporary
quarters of the Soviet Olympic Committee. A floor-to-ceiling
hammer-and-sickle flag hung behind the main desk. A giant framed
portrait of Lenin stared back from the near wall. The bald
gentleman behind the desk had two rows of military medals draped
over his left breast.
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath and began to explain why I wanted to talk
to Belov, the future center of the New Orleanigrad Jazzkis. The man
nodded. I rambled. The man nodded. I think I said something about
good restaurants to find Chicken Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   Brock intervened. ``Well, what about it, Hoss? Think you can
help my man?'' he asked the Soviet Olympic comrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible,'' I remember the man saying. ``Mr. Belov
plays for us. It is not possible for him, therefore, to play in the
United States. Have a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   I slithered out of the room. I'll bet they don't get rid of
Nellie that easily.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, of course, the NBA's policy of global warming
has been refined and all Hosses identified.
</P>
<P>
   It drives most Mavericks fans crazy. They don't understand why
Nellie has to fly all the way to Beijing or Melbourne to find
prospects when there are perfectly good players in New York or
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, there are 1.24 billion people in China. They
come in all shapes and sizes. Wang is not a giant among dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   He is, perhaps, the Mavericks' future, as is Dirk Nowitzki,
Michael Finley and maybe even Bruno Sundov. Nelson can boldly think
of the future because, thanks to Perot, he has a contract that
guarantees him either the owner's patience or his money, whatever
runs out first.
</P>
<P>
   As Wang's Chinese team manager said, this isn't ``the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He can say that again.

NEWELL HEAPS PRAISE ON MAVS' 18-YEAR-OLD ROOKIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever problems Mavericks rookie Leon Smith had during the
early days in minicamp, they have been nonexistent at Pete Newell's
Big Man camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp, held this week in Honolulu, is a showcase for post
players aspiring to develop their skills. Newell has been impressed
with the work turned in by the 18-year old Smith, who is 6-foot-11
and weighs 235 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got loads of talent, he's quick and he can jump,'' Newell
said. ``He has the body of a person who can play at a high level
while weighing between 270-275 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a big jump from the high school to the NBA. But
he's playing with NBA players here, and he's doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first day of the Mavericks' minicamp last month,
Smith walked out of camp after assistant coach Donnie Nelson told
him to run wind sprints. But Newell has detected no rebellious acts
from Smith, who graduated from Chicago's Martin Luther King High
School last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listens very well, and I'm very happy about his
receptiveness,'' Newell said. ``What I had heard he did in the
Mavericks' camp, I've seen none of that down here, and all of my
NBA coaches have seen none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, they all say he's very coachable, he has a good
attitude, and he works real hard. There's nothing that he's done
here that indicates that he can't be coached or taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks center Shawn Bradley is also attending Newell's camp
for the first time since he entered the NBA in 1993. Newell said he
had always wanted to work with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's been fine, although he had a little trouble with his
back the first day, and we had to keep him out of the contact part
of the scrimmages,'' Newell said. ``But he's very athletic, and he
has good agility for a man his size.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had always shied away from Newell's camp, saying the
summer was the time he dedicates to spending more time with his
family. Newell is happy the six-year veteran finally had a change
of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's footwork is so good that he's good enough to go out
and guard a lot of guys away from the basketball,'' Newell said.
``So, there's no reason why he can't be a dominant player in the
NBA if he dedicates himself.''

HIT QUIZ SHOW MISSES ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC wanted its new summer series ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' to bring back the days when game shows were among
the biggest hits in all of television.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing it wanted was a return to the days when some of
the answers on those shows were open to question. But in an odd _
and by all accounts unscandalous _ confluence of events this week,
both things seemed to come to pass, as ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' which began its broadcasts on Monday, rocketed to
ratings as the breakout hit of the summer, and then wound up
embarrassed by a mistake that eliminated the show's best contestant
so far, even though he gave the right answer.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the twists of television fate, the unjustly
dispatched contestant was going for the $64,000 question.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody at the show or at ABC was being accused Thursday of
anything more than sloppy research, however, and the contestant is
already invited back to continue his quest for $1 million on Aug.
29, the last day of the show's scheduled two-week run.
</P>
<P>
   It is nothing like the days of programs like ``Twenty-One'' and
``The $64,000 Question,'' when contestants became national folk
heroes by succeeding week after week, displaying mental acuity
that, in the case of ``Twenty-One,'' was mainly the product of
being given the answers beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' has consciously aimed to
re-create the excitement of the old prime-time quiz shows, taking
contestants to a New York studio with stark lighting and camera
shots that emphasize sweaty tension over testy questions. But
nobody was doing the contestant, David Honea, any favors.
</P>
<P>
   In the show that was taped on Wednesday and broadcast last night
at 8:30, Honea, a doctoral student in computer engineering from
Raleigh, N.C., washed out on a question about which of four Great
Lakes (not including Lake Superior) has the largest area. He said
Lake Huron (right); the show said Lake Michigan (wrong).
</P>
<P>
   That decision cost Honea $32,000. He had won that much in the
game's complicated format, in which a player advances to different
dollar levels after answering multiple-choice questions. Had he
been fairly judged on the $64,000 question, he would have been only
four questions away from the ultimate total of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   After being told by the show's host, Regis Philbin, that he had
lost, Honea accepted his fate gracefully _ along with a check for
$32,000. He mentioned his doubts to the show's executive producer,
Michael Davies, only after he was off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he kept picturing a list, and he could see Huron
ahead of Michigan,'' Davies said. The producer then consulted an
almanac. ``It said he was right,'' Davies said. ``I felt awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls were made to the show's researchers. More almanacs were
consulted. Lake Huron won in every case. Davies explained that one
of the show's researchers, ``a really excellent researcher,'' he
said, though he declined to name her, had essentially tried to do
too much in putting the question together.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said she had made a note that Philbin might use on the
air saying that if a contestant guessed Lake Michigan, Philbin
could say that was wrong, though Lake Michigan is bigger in volume,
not area. Somehow the issue of which lake was larger in volume
became confused with which was bigger in area and Lake Michigan
made its way onto the card that listed the right answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game show makes mistakes,'' Davies said. ``It happens on
`Jeopardy' every so often, but they're not in prime time. We have
been doing so well. That's why I think a mistake like this is
getting more attention. Because we're in prime time, we do have a
higher profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?'' is already something
of a phenomenon, having grown substantially in viewers each of the
three nights it has been on. It had 11.5 million viewers Wednesday
night, the biggest audience of any show on television that night.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the audience knew that Honea would be back, Davies
made the unusual request of ABC that he be allowed to add a full
minute to the tape of the show last night to explain what happened.

<P>
   WINOOSKI, Vt. _ Corporate activism did not come easily to Bill
Syverson. But like a lot of his strait-laced colleagues at IBM, the
49-year-old engineer found his cause this year after realizing that
his employer planned to slash his pension by what he estimates to
be 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nothing less than corporate-sanctioned greed,'' Syverson
told 700 employees of IBM Corp., most of them other middle-aged
men, at a meeting here Tuesday night called by the local
congressman. Cheering and applauding wildly, the employees quickly
drafted Syverson, a captain in the Naval Reserves and a natural
leader among those who work at IBM's plant in nearby Essex
Junction, in northwestern Vermont, to form a committee to fight the
pension changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I refuse?'' said Syverson, who figures he will have
to work 10 additional years to make up what IBM has taken away. No
agitator himself _ he emphasizes that he wants no part of
union-organizing efforts under way at Big Blue _ he is eager to
take on this fight. ``I've been hammered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In what critics say is the biggest threat to the pensions of
many Americans since corporate raiders and leveraged-buyout artists
plundered pension plans in the 1980s, IBM and hundreds of other
companies are changing from old-fashioned pension plans to a new
type of pension: the so-called cash-balance plan.
</P>
<P>
   For many middle-aged employees who have spent their careers at
one company, the change means that the value of their pensions will
drop by one-third to one-half, they say, delaying retirements and
in some cases making college tuition payments harder to come by.
``It scares the hell out of me,'' said Michael Mock, 43, an IBM
technician for a decade who attended the meeting on Tuesday.
``People are so afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the backlash has prompted scrutiny from lawmakers and
government agencies. Just last week, the IRS took the position in
filing in a lawsuit that a pension plan at Onan Corp., a subsidiary
of Cummins Engine, should be stripped of its tax-exempt status
because of the way it converted to a type of cash balance plan.
</P>
<P>
   The realization of what is happening has been slow and painful
for many workers. Instead of disclosing plainly that pensions were
being changed in a way that meant benefit reductions for certain
workers, some companies told workers the changes were not that
important, or were even good for them.
</P>
<P>
   But as employees sat down and worked out the numbers, and traded
information at coffee breaks and over the Internet, many found
instead that hopes for a comfortable retirement were dashed. People
walked the halls ``like zombies'' after they began to comprehend
the changes at IBM, said Tim Barritt, who also spoke at the Vermont
meeting. They asked each other, ``Are you as bashed as I am?''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional pensions, which rewarded long tenure, are being
eliminated at many companies. In these plans, retirees were
typically paid using a calculation that factored their length of
service and the amount of their annual paycheck in the few years
before retiring. Thus, most of the value of their pension accrued
late in their career.
</P>
<P>
   But the new pension plans turn that math upside down. Under
these, corporations contribute a percentage of each employee's pay
to a cash-balance account every year, and then guarantee that money
will grow at a certain interest rate, such as the yield on a
Treasury bond. At retirement, that account is their pension.
</P>
<P>
   The switch cuts costs sharply at many companies. IBM, for
instance, estimates it will save $200 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies also say the change is necessary to attract
younger workers who are not as likely to spend their entire careers
at one place, and thus prefer the faster early accruals of
cash-balance plans to old-fashioned pensions. Indeed, even harsh
critics of cash-balance conversions say that younger workers,
particularly job-hoppers, are better served with these plans.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM plan allows the roughly 30,000 employees who have either
25 years at the company, or are 50 years old with a decade of
service, to stick with the old plan.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 45,000 thousand workers with between 15 and 24 years
of service who are not 50 years old, IBM officials acknowledge that
on average the value of their pensions have dropped 20 percent,
assuming they take early retirement when they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests across the country, plus the threat of
various legal challenges, IBM says it has no plans to change the
program, which went into effect July 1. But officials say many
details are misunderstood by workers and that estimates of benefit
reductions are often too high. ``We're finding in general that
calculations they're doing on their own are not correct,'' said
Jana Weatherbee, an IBM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For many middle-aged workers, the switch comes at exactly the
wrong moment: Just as they reach the age when the value of their
old-fashioned pension starts to soar, they discover they have been
transferred into a plan in which they accrue benefits at the same
pace as co-workers two decades younger. Worse, some conversions to
cash-balance plans include a transition, or ``wear-away,'' period
under which older employees effectively stop accruing pension
benefits for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Such plans were rare a decade ago but have boomed recently, as
consultants have touted the conversions as a way to save big money.
According to Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human resources consulting
firm in Bethesda, Md., at least 16 of the nation's 100 largest
companies now have such plans. And a recent survey by Plan Sponsor,
a trade publication, of 109 companies with employee pension assets
of at least $50 million found that 37 percent had switched to
cash-balance plans, or are considering doing so.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is IBM's conversion that has set off the harshest and
most publicized reaction from its employees. Since the company,
based in Armonk, N.Y., disclosed the change this spring, the
backlash has turned into a social movement of sorts, with fuming
employees conspiring via e-mail to protest and pressure their
company to rescind the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   When the chief executive, Louis Gerstner Jr., visited the
company's Austin, Texas, plant last month, a plane circled above
dragging a banner that read, ``Hey Lou, Thou Shalt Not Steal,''
according to The Austin American-Statesman. Employees at plants
around the country have called meetings to discuss efforts to
unionize. And in Vermont this week, Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt.,
organized the meeting in Winooski.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that many hurt by the switch ``came to IBM and
stayed at IBM precisely because of the pension program that the
company offered.'' He continued: ``These are employees who,
throughout their careers, rejected job offers from other companies
because of their loyalty to IBM. And these are the same employees
who woke up one day, not so long ago, to discover that all of the
promises that IBM made to them were not worth the paper that they
had been written on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders elicited hoots and boos at the expense of Gerstner. He
noted that Gerstner had total compensation last year of nearly $14
million and is sitting on stock options worth nearly $500 million.
``I'm sorry to say that he rejected my request to be here
tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weatherbee, the IBM spokeswoman, giving specifics of the
company's side, said many older employees would receive additional
annual contributions to their cash balance accounts of up to 4
percent of their pay. And for employees who choose to convert their
account to an annuity when they retire, the company will increase
the annuity's value by up to 30 percent or so, depending on age and
tenure. She added that the company had plowed money saved by the
conversion into higher salaries and other compensation, and that a
number of IBM's competitors did not even have pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weatherbee said she could not explain why the protests have
been so severe at IBM, but she said she believed part of the reason
was that the company maintained a strong benefits package even as
it suffered huge losses in the early 1990s. ``What we're hearing
is, `Why now? Why are you doing this now when things are good?'''
she said. The reason, she added, is that ``we learned a lesson''
from the company's prior tough times, and IBM officials want to
become more competitive now, while the company is enjoying good
times.
</P>
<P>
   Though the backlash has been especially harsh at IBM, these
conversions have angered workers at many other companies, and
lawmakers have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Both consumer advocates and industry lobbyists say they expect
federal legislation to pass that would require companies to make
better disclosure of how much employees stand to lose from a
cash-balance conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals favored by business groups would require that
employees be given sufficient information to understand how a
conversion affects them. Other plans would require fuller
disclosure, including a proposal backed by the Clinton
administration requiring employers to provide specific examples of
how the change would affect different groups of workers, as well as
whether a conversion includes a ``wear-away'' period during which
older workers stop accruing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have also sought federal investigations to
determine whether the plans comply with age-discrimination, labor
and tax laws. The plans are ``a focus of a lot of attention'' at
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said Reginald Welch,
the agency's communications director. While it is too early to say
whether the agency feels the conversions may violate
age-discrimination laws, the chairwoman, Ida Castro, is ``extremely
interested'' in the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits are also pending that contend that some conversions
violate age-discrimination statutes and federal laws against
reducing pension benefits already accrued.
</P>
<P>
   In the Onan Corp. case, the IRS position came in a lawsuit in
U.S. Tax Court brought by two Onan employees, who complained that
the Onan pension plan was changed to reduce future benefits in a
way that violated federal law. The plan provides employees with the
highest level of benefits from three different formulas, including
a cash-balance plan.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman, Don Roberts, declined to comment Thursday,
citing laws prohibiting disclosure of taxpayer matters. Marya Rose,
a Cummins spokeswoman, said she had not heard of the IRS filing and
could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Much more could ultimately be at stake in this fight, say
advocates for employees. If cash-balance conversions are allowed to
continue, they say, corporate lobbyists will be emboldened to push
for greater pension changes that are detrimental to workers. One
possibility might be eliminating the 50 percent excise tax that
companies must pay if they take money from an overfunded pension.
</P>
<P>
   Pension raids were commonplace in the 1980s, as raiders would
acquire a company and siphon off the pension surplus, or use it to
pay off debt from the takeover. Congress effectively ended this
practice a decade ago by imposing the 50 percent tax on such
withdrawals. But with many large companies enjoying huge pension
surpluses _ a byproduct of the soaring stock and bond markets _
``they will try once again to get at that surplus,'' predicted
Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most recent in a series of practices by large
employers to really cut back on benefits that workers and retirees
have reasonably been led to expect,'' she said.

FAILURE TO FABLED, CUB'S FOLLY HAS SEEN IT ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los ngeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; When Richard Culberson plunked down $1,500 for Cub's Folly at a
Pomona 2-year-olds auction in 1995, the semiretired jockey thought
he was buying a pony, handy for racetrack chores.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he was accepting a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family convinced Culberson the horse deserved a
chance to race. So race he did, at tracks large and small, up and
down the state, the devoted Culberson always in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   What Cub's Folly couldn't do was win. His past-performance chart
listed 32 starts, not a single victory and seven in-the-money
finishes. That was before he arrived at the Humboldt County Fair in
scenic Ferndale last week entered in an $8,000 claiming race for
maidens, a long way up the coast and down the thoroughbred class
ladder from Santa Anita, where his career had begun in the winter
of '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty frustrating,'' said Culberson, a 54-year-old
Tennesseean who has been the gelding's unofficial caretaker while
making a living exercising horses for Southern California trainers.
``It's always been mental problems with him. He didn't want to
break (from the starting gate) for a while. He's kind of an
aggravatin' little horse. A friend told me he likes it when I'm
mad. And I said, `He sure knows how to do it to me.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   People wonder why hapless horses like Cub's Folly continue to
race, why weathered jockeys like Culberson continue to ride and why
penny-ante tracks like Ferndale continue to run. The answer is they
do it for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, on an uncommonly sunny afternoon in the logging
and dairy country a 12-hour trailer ride from home, Cub's Folly
finally found a race he could win. He and Culberson skimmed the
rail of the half-mile oval, surged past a front-runner named Nuther
Monday late in the 6{-furlong sprint and pulled away to a solid
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the winner's circle, Culberson grinned as if he'd won the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of my dream was that I could win one with him at Santa
Anita and get a winner's picture (from that historic track) for
Jason,'' Culberson said, referring to Jason Swanson, the
nephew-by-adoption who is Cub's Folly's owner. ``But I guess you
can't always get what you want. You have to take what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big thrill for personal reasons. How many more races
am I going to win?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Swanson, a 27-year-old commercial real estate broker in
Tempe, Ariz.: ``He (Culberson) definitely has a lot of affection
for the horse. (Cub's Folly) puts out a lot of effort every time he
runs. I was excited for Richard, excited for myself and excited for
the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   In his days as a full-time jockey, after coming west to work for
Rex Ellsworth in 1963, Culberson won his share, riding a winner on
his very first try at Seattle's Longacres Race Course in '67 and
taking the '77 San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita aboard Chance
Dancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Culberson stopped riding regularly following the '89 season
at Turf Paradise in Phoenix. This year he has appeared in just nine
races _ seven of them with Cub's Folly.
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise to him is that he bought Cub's Folly to begin
with. He'd gone to the Barrett's sales pavilion at Fairplex Park
with his eye on four young geldings. Each proved too expensive,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson, glum, stood in the back of the room when a
white-faced colt consigned by Cardiff Stud Farm was led into the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, that's a pretty little horse,' &UR;  &LR; '' Culberson
remembered. ``For some strange reason, I raised my program (to
bid). I don't usually do things like that. They said, `Sold!' Just
like that. I was the only bid.''
</P>
<P>
   In some tellings of the story, Culberson recalls the auctioneer
announcing, ``Sold to the fool in the back!''
</P>
<P>
   Culberson, who hadn't inspected the horse before the sale, was
disappointed to learn his purchase had a knot on his left knee that
had scared away other buyers. But the knot was found to be a
harmless calcification. The horse was sound except for a set of
sensitive white feet.
</P>
<P>
   Once he decided to race him, Culberson had him gelded, figuring
a Washington-bred with a Ballindaggin-Pamlisa's Delight pedigree
would have little value at stud anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's his name?'' the veterinarian asked Culberson, whose
nickname is ``Cub.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cub's Folly, I guess,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   That pessimism was borne out by the 32 consecutive losses _ not
counting a first-place finish worth a paltry $910 last spring at
Huapapai Downs, a bush track in Kingman, Ariz., whose results go
unrecognized by California officials.
</P>
<P>
   But now Cub's Folly has escaped the ranks of the state's
losingest athletes. And Culberson, who believes horses know when
they've won, hopes the 6-year-old's recent success gave him
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Ferndale, Cub's Folly faced non-maidens for the
first time in a $6,250 claiming race. He ran well again, closing
fast to finish second by two lengths behind favored Royal
Fortunada.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson wasn't sure what's next. Cub's Folly might follow the
Northern California fair circuit to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that when the man and his horse do return to
Fairplex Park, they'll come home as winners.

MICROSOFT DISCLOSES MORE FLAWS IN SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three weeks after security holes were found in
its Office 97 software, Microsoft &UR;  &LR; Corp. acknowledged on Thursday
similar vulnerabilities in the recently released successor, Office
2000, and in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had known for several weeks about the Office
2000 flaw, which could allow data, software or hardware to be
damaged via e-mail or commands sent from a malicious Web site. But
it said it had chosen not to disclose the problem until a remedy
was ready.
</P>
<P>
   The Office 2000 flaw is not identical to the one in Office 97
and cannot be exploited in precisely the same way. But as with the
Office 97 flaw, an attack could be started using a software
component called Jet to execute arbitrary commands hidden in an
Office document.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Microsoft acknowledged Thursday that there was a bug
in its new Internet chat software, ``MSN Messenger,'' that would
allow co-workers and others who had access to a person's computer
to see a person's e-mail password for the Microsoft's Web-based
``Hotmail'' service. It promised to fix the flaw by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft security bulletins on the Office 97 flaw had
explicitly said that Office 2000 users were not vulnerable.
Microsoft said it had been concerned about publicizing a security
hole that it could not yet plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is not to arm malicious coders until a solution is
in place,'' said Andrew Dixon, group product manager for Office at
Microsoft. ``We wanted to make sure that the information is there
before we announced the vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Jet component is most commonly associated with Office,
it is also installed in conjunction with hundreds of other programs
written by other companies for Microsoft operating systems, Dixon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The repair, or patch, which Microsoft said would be released by
Friday, is intended to protect users against vulnerabilities in
Office 97, Office 2000 or other programs using the Jet component.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said Microsoft would send a security bulletin disclosing
the details of both problems to 1.5 million Office users as well as
issuing articles with technical details of the problems. The
security bulletin and patch will also be posted on the Web at
http://officeupdate.microsoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Garcia Cuartango, an engineer in Spain, said he
discovered both flaws late last month and immediately informed
Microsoft. While Cuartango decided to post a notice about the
Office 97 flaw to an Internet mailing list, he did not publicly
disclose the Office 2000 flaw until Thursday, and Microsoft then
acknowledged it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to keep this confidential until the patch is
published,'' he said Thursday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws are particularly dangerous because Microsoft's Web
browser ordinarily ``trusts'' documents from Microsoft Office
programs like Word or Excel and opens them without warning the
user. Since the security flaws can be exploited from an Office
document hidden in an e-mail message, a user reading e-mail online
can inadvertently unleash rogue programs or viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Microsoft addressed the problem by making
available a tool that configures the browser to alert the user
before opening such documents.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken the Office team several weeks to come up with a
more fundamental solution because the company was concerned that
non-Microsoft programs that use the Jet component might no longer
work once the patch was installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure it didn't produce incompatibilities,''
Dixon said. ``We wanted to make sure it's rock solid before
introducing it this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jet component is represented by a Windows file named
odbcjt32.dll. Since so many users are vulnerable, experts are
advising Microsoft users to download the patch as soon as it is
available and to exercise caution when opening unknown Word or
Excel documents.

<P>
   DENVER _ The nation's largest Lutheran denomination voted
Thursday to enter a sweeping agreement with the Episcopal Church
under which the two churches, which together represent nearly 8
million American Protestants, would fully recognize each other's
members and sacraments, exchange clergy when needed and join in
missionary and social service projects.
</P>
<P>
   For the 5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, the vote Thursday morning by its top policy-making body,
the Churchwide Assembly, reverses a decision made two years ago in
which the assembly narrowly rejected a similar proposal for ``full
communion'' with the 2.4 million Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   The decision here on a proposal likened more to a marriage than
a merger, since both churches retain their creeds and structures,
is a boost for an ecumenical movement among Protestants that had
been waning in recent years. It also demonstrates a growing
willingness among Christian leaders to establish closer, formal
ties despite the increasing religious pluralism in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote will probably be felt far beyond the United States,
encouraging closer cooperation between Lutherans and Anglicans in
Europe, Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate Thursday morning, the Rev. Ishmael Noko, a
Lutheran from Zimbabwe who is general secretary of the Lutheran
World Federation, an association of 128 churches with about 60
million members in 70 countries, told the voting members that
whatever they decided would also affect ``sister churches'' around
the globe. He predicted that full communion agreements would be
established between the fast-growing Lutheran and Anglican churches
in Africa within five years.
</P>
<P>
   By recognizing each other's members and sacraments, the two
churches would allow joint worship services to be held. But a major
reason cited by Lutheran and Episcopalian supporters of the
proposal was that it would allow the denominations to pool
resources, particularly in rural and inner-city areas where
congregations are often small and financially hard pressed. An
important provision would allow a clergy member in one denomination
to be fully accepted for work in the other _ to fill a vacancy, for
instance, or to take charge of two struggling churches of different
denominations that could not alone afford a pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Called to Common Mission,'' the proposal for full communion
with Episcopalians, passed by a vote of 716-317 _ 69 percent to 31
percent, and 27 votes more than the necessary two-thirds majority
_after three days of often contentious discussion at the Colorado
Convention Center here, where the assembly has been meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is subject to the approval of the Episcopalians, at
their next General Convention in July 2000. The Episcopal Church
passed the previous proposal for full communion by a majority of
about 95 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the pact with Episcopalians was not the only
full-communion agreement that Lutherans approved Thursday. Earlier,
the assembly adopted a proposal for full communion with the
49,000-member Moravian Church in America, a Protestant denomination
that traces its roots to the followers of Jan Hus, a 15th-century
leader and critic of the established church.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement, too, will be felt overseas, as a majority of the
world's Moravians, and millions of Lutherans, live in southern
Africa. The Lutherans' full communion with the Moravians takes
effect immediately, because it has been approved by the Moravian
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we made history in these two remarkable ecumenical
relationships,'' said the Rev. H. George Anderson, the Lutherans'
presiding bishop, the church's top official.
</P>
<P>
   The votes were the second time the Evangelical Lutheran Church
has moved to enter a series of full communion agreements. In 1997,
the church forged pacts with three denominations in Protestantism's
Reformed wing: the Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Church of
Christ and the Reformed Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   By reaching out to Episcopalians on Thursday, the Lutherans were
positioning themselves as the bridge church in Protestantism,
placing themselves at the center of a nexus linking church
traditions that emerged from the 16th century Reformation.
Episcopalians do not have full communion agreements with those
other Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   A strong supporter of the agreement with Episcopalians, Bishop
Stephen Bouman of the Lutheran Church's Metropolitan New York
Synod, said, ``The first thing I'm going to do is call up Bishops
Grein and Walker and tell them we have work to do together.''
Bishop Richard Grein leads the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and
Bishop Orris Walker is in charge of the Episcopal Diocese of Long
Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for full communion with the Episcopal Church has
been deeply controversial among Lutherans. Although the two
churches are close in matters of theology and liturgy, and both
ordain women, they have had significant differences over the role
and authority of bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Many who opposed the full communion proposal said it would
require them to embrace an idea of church hierarchy outside
American Lutheranism, the concept of the ``historic episcopate,'' a
belief among Episcopalians that their bishops represent an unbroken
line of church leadership extending to the earliest days of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The Lutheran denomination does have bishops, but they are
elected for six-year terms and are often regarded primarily as
administrators, returning to being pastors after their terms end.
By contrast, Episcopal bishops are elected for life, sit as a
separate governing body in their church's convention and play a
more visible role in public events of the church, confirming
adolescent members and ordaining priests and deacons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In approving the full communion proposal, Lutherans agreed that
their bishops would become part of the historic episcopate, such
that each time a new bishop is elected, he or she will be installed
in a ceremony at which at least three bishops, already in the
historic episcopate, lay their hands in prayer on the head of the
new bishop, symbolically passing on an ancient authority. In
addition, Lutherans agreed that a bishop would preside at the
ordination of pastors, a condition that has not previously been
required.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour debate that preceded the vote, dozens of
people spoke about the proposal. Those against it generally cited
their opposition to the historic episcopate, while those who
supported it often appealed to the ideal of Christian unity. Bishop
Roy Riley of New Jersey, a supporter of the agreement, said
Lutherans in his state number only 82,000 out of a population of 8
million. Citing growing Muslim and Hindu communities in New Jersey,
he said, ``We need partners.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading opponent of full communion with the Episcopalians, the
Rev. Roger Eigenfeld of Mahtomedi, Minn., said that those who had
fought the proposal would stay in the church and ``wanted to sit
down and talk'' with Anderson about how it would work. The bishop
will travel next month to Minneapolis, a center of much of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of a denomination,'' Eigenfeld said. ``There was
never an intention that we would split.'' Another leading opponent
of the proposal, the Rev. Brad Jensen of Duluth, Minn., said that
the Lutherans who voted in the minority needed to take the decision
in a spirit of ``Christian love.'' But he also said that a word he
had heard used to describe people who opposed the proposal,
``fearful,'' was objectionable and would not promote healing in the
church.

   NEW YORK _ When Adelaide Abankwah fled the threat of genital
cutting in her native Ghana, she thought she would find a better
life in the United States. But instead, that life _ as for many
other illegal immigrants _ unfolded in a detention center.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years and three months, Ms. Abankwah was caught
between a world she didn't want and one that didn't seem to want
her. After arriving at Kennedy International Airport in March 1997
with false identification papers, she was arrested and taken to the
Wackenhut Detention Center in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I thought I would die in there,'' she said Thursday
in her first public appearance since being released from the center
last month. ``Nobody ever got in there, and sometimes I can't eat
and can't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah, 29, flanked by Gloria Steinem and other
supporters, spoke haltingly at a news conference at Marie Claire
magazine on West Broadway. Since her plight was detailed in the
magazine's May 1998 issue, it has attracted the attention of scores
of women's rights organizations, politicians and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Ms. Abankwah received final word that her ordeal
had ended. The Board of Immigration Appeals granted her petition
for political asylum on the grounds that she feared being subjected
to genital cutting if she returned to Ghana. She is one of only a
few women to be granted asylum in the United States for that
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy to be free,'' she said Thursday. ``I don't have
to worry about being deported or dying in jail. Today, I am
surrounded by my friends and supporters, who have all helped me
attain my freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a reporter to describe the genital cutting process
that she might have faced in her homeland, Ms. Abankwah paused and
her eyes filled with tears. Her lawyer, Dennis LaRochelle,
intervened to say she would not answer.
</P>
<P>
   Russell A. Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Washington, said that Ms. Abankwah's
lengthy detention was unusual. He said the average waiting time in
a detention center is 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abankwah, whose initial request for asylum was denied by
an immigration court, pursued her appeal through higher courts, all
the way to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   While many INS detainees are released while awaiting immigration
decisions, Bergeron said Ms. Abankwah was considered a flight risk
because her request for asylum had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah's release followed months of telephone and letter
campaigns to Attorney General Janet Reno, Congress and the White
House by her supporters, including Ms. Steinem and the actresses
Julia Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Abankwah, the long, hard fight to stay in the United
States has brought her many new friends and opportunities where she
once had none. She plans to take classes for a high school
equivalency degree at Marymount Manhattan College and to work part
time. She said she would also be a volunteer for Equality Now, a
group that is campaigning against genital cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the detention center, Ms. Abankwah has lived in
the Bronx with Victoria Otumfuor-Neequaye, a Pentecostal minister
who left Ghana 22 years ago. The two met after Ms. Abankwah called
her in desperation from the detention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw her, we cried together because she was in
that deplorable situation,'' said Ms. Otumfuor-Neequaye, who
accompanied Ms. Abankwah on Thursday. ``God has seen us through.''

NESTLE AND HAAGEN-DAZS TO OPERATE JOINT ICE CREAM VENTURE IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DANA CANEDY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two leading producers of ice cream, Nestle SA and Haagen-Dazs,
are joining forces to better compete in the large but fragmented
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle USA, the American subsidiary of the Swiss foods giant,
and the Pillsbury Co., the unit of Diageo PLC of Britain that
controls Haagen-Dazs, said Thursday that their joint venture would
benefit from shared technology and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement unites Nestle's novelty ice cream products with
Haagen-Dazs' premium desserts. The companies hope to keep pace with
the market leader, Unilever NV, the maker of Breyers ice cream and
Klondike bars.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that short of an outright acquisition by one of
the partners, the agreement was a good strategic fit. ``Both
companies have been trying to grow on their own but not very
easily,'' said Naomi Ghez of Goldman, Sachs. Combining forces
``opens new growth opportunities for both companies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture, which the companies are calling Ice Cream
Partners USA, will unite Haagen-Dazs' powerful brand name with
Nestle's technology skills and broad distribution channel. It will
also expand the Haagen-Dazs line by adding Nestle's chocolate and
other confectioneries to new, premium products.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of cannibalizing either brand is small, however,
because the companies' products appeal to different consumers in
the $11 billion market, analysts said. Haagen-Dazs' premium-priced
pints of ice cream are popular with adults, while many Nestle
products, such as Itzakadoozie flavored ice pops, are primarily
eaten by children.
</P>
<P>
   The two brands will remain separate, but the combined entity
will be overseen by a nine-member board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement brings together two complementary businesses
with strengths in two distinct segments, super-premium packaged ice
cream and novelties,'' said Joe Weller, chairman and chief
executive of Nestle USA.
</P>
<P>
   Paul S. Walsh, chairman and chief executive of the Pillsbury
Co., said the partnership would ``enable Haagen-Dazs to continue to
accelerate incremental growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestle and Haagen-Dazs each have U.S. revenue around $300
million and control about 5 percent of the domestic market. With a
combined market share of nearly 10 percent, the new partners will
still trail Unilever, which has 16 to 20 percent of the market. The
two companies are counting on their venture to advance product
innovation and further close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be based in Northern California at an
undetermined location to take advantage of two manufacturing plants
in Tulare and Bakersfield.

GRAZIANO SAYS DODGERS CAN EAT ALL THEY WANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If the Los Angeles Dodgers need to eat a few
million dollars to trade Eric Young, they can do it.
</P>
<P>
   If they have to do the same for Devon White or Raul Mondesi or
whomever else, they can do so.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to make offseason changes, Dodgers president
and CEO Bob Graziano said neither he nor general manager Kevin
Malone will have to get permission from the Fox Group, the Dodgers'
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Graziano said the Dodgers, if they so choose, will have
no problem eating contracts _ as long as they remain within the
team budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't eat payroll and then blow our payroll budget,''
Graziano said. ``It's not like we have to eat personnel to eat
payroll in a trade. We don't have to go out and get approval on a
particular trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to absorb contracts might be the biggest key to the
Dodgers climbing out of their current underachieving place in the
NL West and building, or rebuilding, a competitive, playoff team
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' familiar targets of trade talk are all overpriced,
and the length of their deals makes it nearly impossible to
maneuver. Eating contracts might be the only way the Dodgers can
create roster flexibility, both financially and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the 32-year-old second baseman, is without question the
top trade priority for the Dodgers. He is guaranteed $9 million
over the next two seasons. White, the 36-year-old center fielder,
has also been mentioned as a possible trade target, but he's in the
first year of a three-year, $12 million contract. Many baseball
personnel believe the Dodgers will have to absorb a few million
dollars if they are to trade either White or Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're going to have to discuss when the
season is over,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Mondesi, the estranged right fielder who a week ago
ripped into Dodgers management and manager Davey Johnson and
demanded a trade. Mondesi is guaranteed $20.5 million over the next
two seasons, and if the Dodgers try to trade him, again, they might
have to take on some of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remain within our budget,'' Graziano said. ``When
we signed Kevin Brown (to a seven-year, $105 million contract), we
knew that signing was going to put us over budget on player payroll
and it was a commitment and a significant contract to the club. I
wouldn't do that type of contract without getting approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what we spend on payroll, it's really Kevin's job to
define where he wants to spend the dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers absorbed nearly $4 million of reliever Mel Rojas'
contract during an early-season trade with the Tigers that also
included Dave Mlicki. When Malone did that, all he needed was the
go-ahead from Graziano. The Fox Group was told about it, but not
until after the deal happened.
</P>
<P>
   That deal was done because the Fox Group wanted the Dodgers to
decrease payroll from $84 million to its current spot at $80
million, which puts it third behind the Yankees and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers moved Bobby Bonilla to the Mets for Rojas last
offseason, they took on $1 million of Bonilla's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Fox Group personnel said they expect to lose money
on the Dodgers this season, team officials said they believe the
payroll will be near $80 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a substantial decrease, if we decrease it,''
Graziano said. ``We're looking at how to better spend our payroll
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last winter, when Brown, Randy Johnson and Mo Vaughn were
available, this year's free-agent group is not star-studded. With
that in mind, Malone said the Dodgers have to be savvy this winter
so they can improve and create more flexibility for next season.

CHICAGO EXCHANGE SETS AN AFTER-HOUR PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago Stock Exchange, the nation's third-largest
stock market, said Thursday that its board had approved a plan to
offer after-hours trading to both institutional and individual
investors starting in October _ the first exchange to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The move creates yet another forum for investors eager to trade
after the 4 p.m. close at the major stock exchanges and holds out
the eventual prospect of around-the-clock trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that investing has become a national pastime, it has
become clear that after-hours trading is here for good,'' said
Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. ``So
everyone's scrambling to be a first mover.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ETrade Group, the big online broker, said it was
joining Instinet, the Reuters Group unit that is one of the largest
electronic trading networks, to offer after-hours trading to
smaller investors between 4 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. And earlier this
month, the Datek Online Holdings Corporation began offering its
online investors after-hours trading via a unit called Island ECN _
for electronic communications network _ between 4 p.m. and 5:15
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say a movement is clearly afoot to create a global
24-hour stock-trading network using the Internet and the kind of
low-cost electronic trading networks that are shaking up Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the leading markets have been moving cautiously. The
New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock market, and the
Nasdaq market, home to many popular technology issues, are also
considering offering after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   While they study the move, which is also being monitored by
regulators, new rivals say they will fill the vacuum to offer
trading in Big Board and Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a subject that has legs, and it's our
responsibility to be responsive to our customers,'' said Robert H.
Forney, the chief executive of the Chicago Stock Exchange. ``We
think this will promote competition and give investors the benefit
of that competition.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange reiterated Thursday
that the Big Board is studying the issue of after-hours trading
under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates
Nasdaq, has considered closing the market at its regular time, 4
p.m., then reopening at 5 p.m. for an evening session. That plan
may have to be rethought if competing electronic networks trade
during that hour. A Nasdaq spokesman declined comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to its plan, the Chicago Stock Exchange _ which
operates a highly automated auction-style forum _ will offer its
more than 150 member brokerage firms after-hours trading in some of
the nation's best-known Big Board and Nasdaq stocks between 4 p.m.
and 6:30 p.m. Eastern standard time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Chicago exchange said that their electronic
trading system would let almost any brokerage firm or online broker
tap into its after-hours market to trade, by limit order only, in
the stocks that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 100-stock index, the
Nasdaq 100-stock index and other very active stocks, including such
big names as McDonald's, AT&AMP;T, Microsoft and Intel. A limit order
is at a specific price, instead of an open order to buy or sell at
the current market price.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago exchange now offers a half-hour of trading after the
closing bell but mainly for institutional investors. The new system
will greatly expand the hours and try to tap the lucrative retail
market that fast-growing online brokerage firms are poised to
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago exchange is going head-to-head with Island and
Instinet as well as trying to get a jump on other exchanges, which
face the same competition. Lisa Cervenka, a spokeswoman for the
Chicago exchange _ which trades about 50 million shares a day _
said it had a low-cost electronic trading system that executes
trades automatically. The system, she added, is expected to be
accessible over the Internet to hundreds of brokerage firms by
October.
</P>
<P>
   What all the after-hours trading systems seek is liquidity _
enough order flow to make profits and create active and efficient
marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Island, for example, depends on Datek clients and other brokers
with access to the Island system for trading in Nasdaq stocks.
Instinet will bring together more than a million ETrade customers
with institutional orders for mostly Nasdaq issues and some Big
Board ones. And Chicago officials say they will have a mix of Big
Board and Nasdaq orders at prices competitive with the electronic
communications networks.

PROSECUTORS WILL TRY FURROW IN FEDERAL COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal and state authorities have agreed to
prosecute Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. in U.S. District Court in the
murder of mail carrier Joseph Ileto an hour after, according to
allegations, he wounded five people at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pursue federal charges first was based on the
belief that they are more likely to bring a quick sentence and have
a chance of invoking the death penalty. Prosecuting Furrow in state
court on charges of shooting three small boys and two staff members
at the day camp facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Granada Hills
would take place later.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti and U.S. Attorney Alejandro
Mayorkas made the decision jointly but refused to discuss it,
saying that would reveal trial strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted the 37-year-old white supremacist
in the killing of Ileto, a Filipino immigrant delivering mail, and
for using a 9mm handgun in a violent crime that resulted in death.
The indictment also charges Furrow as a felon in possession of a
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision in conjunction with the District Attorney's
Office to proceed first in federal court. Everybody brings
something to the table,'' said Thomas Mrozek, the U.S. Attorney's
spokesman. ``You can rest assured we took into account the
efficiency and expediency in achieving justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office might seek other charges against
Furrow for wounding three boys, a teen-age counselor and a
receptionist at the Jewish community center last week, setting off
a rampage that included a carjacking nearby, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The move to seek a murder conviction in federal court first
would prevent the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office
from prosecuting Furrow for the same offense, given a state
constitutional protection against facing trial twice for the same
crime.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors still plan to seek convictions on five
attempted murder charges, carjacking and weapons and other related
charges, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If convicted on those charges alone, he could receive several
life terms,'' said Sandi Gibbons, the District Attorney's
spokeswoman. ``Both sets of prosecutors are interested in _ if not
getting the death penalty _ ensuring he stays in prison for the
rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the move is not surprising and Garcetti took
what he could get.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Attorney has all the cards, since they have him in
(federal) custody and they will probably get to trial faster,''
said David Conn, former head of the District Attorney's Major
Crimes Unit.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial could proceed faster, given procedural rules and
judges known for conducting more speedy trials compared with state
courts, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   By joining forces, the prosecutors combine expertise. Legal
analysts say state prosecutors are far more experienced in death
penalty cases while federal prosecutors have more experience with
weapons violations and civil rights violations, and the FBI lab
provides vast resources for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think another factor is the public perception that the
federal government should get involved in stopping these sorts of
hate crimes,'' said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor
and former federal prosecutor. ``From the president to the attorney
general and down through the ranks, I think the federal government
has decided it wanted to make its mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow surrendered to the FBI in Las Vegas the morning after the
Aug. 10 rampage and subsequently confessed in an FBI interview to
carrying out the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court on Aug. 30
for an arraignment. He is expected to enter a plea and a trial date
should be set.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires the trial to begin no later than 70 days
after the indictment, but the defense could waive that speedy trial
standard to gain more time to prepare its case, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Pretrial hearings are likely on such issues as change of venue,
use of Furrow's confession and whether the death penalty will be
sought.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial is held in Los Angeles, the jury would be drawn
from the nation's largest federal court district, spanning seven
counties with 17million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The confession will be a prime defense target. If it holds, the
prosecution should have a strong case, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   If a mental defense is sought, hearings could significantly
delay the trial. Legal experts said that is a critical issue in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his lawyers will pitch that he is not as culpable as
someone who does not have these mental problems and committed these
same crimes,'' Levenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state prosecutors are accustomed to working together
in U.S. District Court, notably on drug cases. Deputy district
attorneys are designated as Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on seeking the death penalty, however, will be made
following a lengthy review process by the U.S. Attorney's Office
and the U.S. Attorney General's Office in Washington, D.C. That
decision must be made within a reasonable period before trial. &UR;  &QL;

VISA'S LATIN-TINGED MAINSTREAM SPOT MAY ANTICIPATE A TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major American corporations regularly broadcast
Spanish-language advertising to reach the nation's fast-growing
Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   But now a big advertiser, Visa USA, is going mainstream with a
Latin-culture commercial, specifically intending to reach people in
the 18-to-34-year-old range. And the agency that created it, BBDO
New York, a unit of Omnicom Group , is confident the commercial is
on the cusp of a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Latin culture used to be for Latins, but not
anymore,'' said Jimmy Siegel, BBDO New York senior creative
director. ``Latin culture has become hip, and it's sort of on the
edge of becoming more popular in the mainstream. I would expect
more commercials with some sort of Latin influence.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot, which is part of Visa's 14-year-old ``It's everywhere
you want to be'' campaign, opens showing a young Hispanic woman in
jeans and halter-top swaying to a Latin beat. It then quickly cuts
to others dancing to salsa music as a narrator says that you can
get lessons at Salsa Lovers Dance Studio in Miami, but _ as always
in the ``everywhere'' campaign _ bring your Visa card because they
don't take American Express.
</P>
<P>
   The Visa team at BBDO was researching trends in popular culture
for a spot aimed at the so-called Generation X and Generation Y
markets when it decided to zone in on Latin culture, Siegel said.
The team members noticed the crossover appeal of Latin music and
dance, especially in cities like New York where several Latin clubs
draw big multicultural crowds. They also recognized the broad
success of Latin celebrities like Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez,
and decided that _ like hip-hop culture before it _ Latin culture
is on the edge of mainstream popularity.
</P>
<P>
   When an advertiser the size of Visa USA taps into a trend, it
usually does signal that lots of interest and acceptance exist
among the audience it is aiming at, said Jack Trout, a marketing
consultant in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies are usually good at capturing a hot trend that is
slowly moving into the mainstream,'' Trout said, ``This is probably
an early effort, and Visa smells a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   While there has been some recent use of Latin music in
mainstream commercials, they have not had an overall Latin feel.
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. ran a fashion spot earlier this year
advertising its spring skirt collection set to Latin-type music.
And a new ad for Loanworks.com, an online mortgage lending company,
is set to Cuban music.
</P>
<P>
   The Loanworks.com spot _ showing a little boy in snow clothes
who is trying to get to the bathroom _ is aimed at young people,
who are more likely to apply for a mortgage on line, according to
Virginia Morse, group account director at DGWB, an agency based in
Irvine, Calif., that produced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dot-com company that is cutting-edge, and we thought
the music was upbeat, fun and also cutting-edge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Davis, a music producer at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Advertising in
New York, said that Cuban music was popular, citing the strong
crossover sales for ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' a Cuban music CD
with singers from the Fifties and Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis said, rock'n'roll, and most recently electronic
music, seem to dominate music in commercials, which have little
Latin music.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of recognition in mainstream advertising is a
welcome development to Latinos, many of whom have complained that
the general American media virtually ignore Hispanic culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic portion of the population is roughly 13 percent and
they have about $400 billion in spending power, but those facts are
not reflected in the general media, said Marta Garcia, a founder of
the Hispanic Media Coalition. She said that the coalition is asking
Latin viewers to avoid programs on the four big networks on Sept.
12 to express outrage at the lack of Hispanic actors in their fall
television lineup.
</P>
<P>
   While advertising is not part of the so-called brown-out, Ms.
Garcia said, so far mainstream advertising has not really picked up
on the popularity of Latin culture, nor are Hispanic characters
often seen in nonethnic advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some progress, but not enough vis-a-vis our
population growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Spanish-language advertising is booming,
especially in New York where it supports many actors, agencies and
production houses, said Manny Alfaro, executive director of the
Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors in New York. Still, he said,
Latin actors are paid less for those spots because the ads reach a
smaller audience than mainstream ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress is when we become part of the fabric of American life
as seen on TV,'' Alfaro said.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO researched several trends among young people, and Liz
Silver, Visa's vice president of advertising, liked the salsa
dancing spot immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency always has its antenna out for the latest trend and
what's going on in pop culture,'' she said.``And, of course, then
there were all the possibilities for this idea, in terms of the
visuals, the music and the wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation is an important audience for Visa, she
said. ``Generally these are people just starting a serious
financial relationship, and you tend to be loyal to who you start
out with,'' Ms. Silver said. ``Also, these are good, responsible
users who understand and grew up with plastic, and who are at a
point in their lives where they want to buy a lot of things, and
that will only continue as they get married, furnish a house,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on consumer reaction, Ms. Silver said, the spot is a
success. And it may end up serving a dual purpose. Some banks that
serve large Hispanic populations are looking to leverage the salsa
spot with Visa promotions of their own or local media plans.

AGE, DECLINING MEMBERSHIP BRING THE DEMISE OF SEATTLE ENGINEERS'
CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A Seattle club whose members built some of the
region's most lasting public-works projects has gone the way of the
slide rule.
</P>
<P>
   Over roasted chicken and potatoes and afternoon chitchat, the
Seattle Engineers Club met for its final lunch Thursday after 87
years of providing professional support to members, many of whom
helped build and shape this region.
</P>
<P>
   The group is calling it quits, blaming dwindling membership on
changing times and a failure to attract ``young blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of bittersweet,'' said Adrian Arnold, a former club
president who joined in the 1960s and whose father also held the
post. ``We've become outdated as an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the Seattle Engineers Club was the professional
group to join.
</P>
<P>
   Members worked on some of the region's largest public-works
projects _ bridges, tunnels and engineering feats _ which continue
to shape the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Club engineers helped design and construct the Alaskan Way
Viaduct, Seattle's downtown bus tunnel, the West Seattle bridges,
Shilshole's breakwater and the electrification of city bus lines.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``people involved in building this city,'' said Joyce
Lem, club president and a bridge engineer with HDR Engineering in
Bellevue. At 42, she may be one of the club's youngest members.
</P>
<P>
   In ``the good ol' days,'' club lunch programs once drew
heavyweights including chief engineers from the city, county, Port
of Seattle and railroads. At its height, the club buzzed with more
than 300 members who met daily for lunches in the Arctic Building
at Third Avenue and Cherry Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a prominent place to network,'' said Arnold, vice
president of Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs, civil and structural
engineering consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The club was established in 1912 to promote fellowship among
local engineers. From 1925 to 1968, the club was on the ninth floor
of the Arctic Building, where a kitchen, dining room and library
played host to engineers who came to unwind during long lunch
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But little by little, the membership grew older and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The once-thriving institution has since dwindled to about 60
members, half of whom are retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing,'' said Lem, the club's first female
president. ``At the same time, it's difficult to keep something
like this going.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, said 91-year-old John Loux, club treasurer
and one of the club's oldest members. ``Young people aren't too
interested in clubs,'' Loux said. There's no longer an emphasis on
``sitting around and talking about ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   A final farewell bash celebrating the club's history will be
scheduled in late September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found we were swimming up a stream,'' said club manager Dan
Lyons during lunch at Rock Salt Steak House, formerly Latitude 47,
where the club has held luncheons since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He said the club knocked on the doors of the city's engineering
companies to recruit new members. The companies were receptive, but
younger engineers weren't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young engineers tend to be too busy now to come for a lunch,
even when their employers pay,'' said Lyons, 76, a retired
electrical engineer who joined the club in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons proudly rattles off the engineering achievements of his
fellow members.
</P>
<P>
   There's Gordon Snyder, a retired naval architect who was
instrumental in the design of Alaskan and Washington state ferries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's Gerald Van Faasen, a retired district engineer for the
Army Corps of Engineers who helped build the breakwater at
Shilshole Bay and worked on the large Fort Peck Dam in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   There's Roy Morse, a prominent city engineer who oversaw
important developments in Seattle's history. He joined the club in
1950.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, 18 members and guests reminisced and ate lunch during
a 2{-hour program.
</P>
<P>
   The guest speaker was Thom Mullins of Sparling Inc., the
electrical engineers hired to work on the Experience Music Project
at the Seattle Center. His topic was the future of technology.

FREEMAN IS FOCUSED ON BEING THE GREATEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antonio Freeman joined the Green Bay Packers in 1995 as a
third-round draft pick, as a ``project,'' as a kick returner rather
than as a receiver. He was full of impatience and exhibited a
spirited edge that appeared ruffian-like. His contract was for
three years and included a $370,000 signing bonus as part of an
$850,000 deal.
</P>
<P>
   Four seasons later, Antonio Freeman is an All-Pro receiver who
along with Minnesota's Cris Carter has caught more touchdown passes
(36) in the last four years than any other National Football League
receiver. Freeman holds or shares 13 Packers playoff records, owns
a Super Bowl ring, caught the longest touchdown pass (81 yards) in
Super Bowl history and has turned that testy side of him into
unmistakable production, patience, maturity and leadership. This
week, he signed a new contract: seven years and a $10 million
signing bonus as part of a $42 million deal. He is now pro
football's highest-paid receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Freeman is from Baltimore, from Virginia Tech, and he is
only 27. That old football line about planning your work and
working your plan has been around longer than Freeman, but he might
as well have created it. That is because of his focus toward
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy and I'm very blessed,'' Freeman said.
``Everything that has happened to me goes back to my determination
to be one of the best receivers ever in the game. My final goal is
the Hall of Fame. I'm not going to stop until I get there. When I
walk off the field, I want to be known as one of the greatest
players to ever play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be regarded as the greatest receiver ever. The
greatest player ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mighty quest. He did not quite say it, but everything
about him shouts that his ultimate goal is that kind of supreme
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   A traipse through the history of pro football's marquee
receivers includes Don Hutson and Lance Alworth and Lionel Taylor
and Steve Largent. The 49ers' Jerry Rice tops them all in stature
and in achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks (Joe Montana?), running backs (Jim Brown?) and
linebackers (Dick Butkus?) are traditionally the positions to begin
with when attempting to name the greatest player. Can Freeman
change that?
</P>
<P>
   Similar to Rice, if there is a way to start, he has found it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to Green Bay, I was behind five receivers,
including Robert Brooks and Mark Ingram, and Keith Jackson was here
at tight end, too,'' Freeman said. ``My vibe was the franchise
thought of me as a project. I returned kicks my first year and that
allowed me to watch those guys and learn patience, route running
and how to watch film and understand and learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman took his 6-foot-1-inch, 198-pound body and threw it into
the wild world of punt and kickoff returns. In 1995, he returned 37
punts and was the best kickoff returner on the team, returning 24
an average of 23.2 yards. As a returner, he displayed the
attributes that would make him a showcase receiver: soft hands,
fearlessness, tricky speed and the ability to whisk through
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In his second pro season, he returned no punts and only one
kickoff. The Green Bay coaches saw his intensity and impact in
games and said, hey, this kid can start at receiver for us. And so
in 1996, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the numbers. Eight catches in his rookie season. Then
56. Then 81. Last year, 84. The receiving yardage went from 106 to
933 to 1,243 to 1,424. Touchdowns, too _ from one to nine to 12 to
14.
</P>
<P>
   This is very hard to do in pro football. This is when a coach
knows he has a special player, when his production always moves
forward.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeman's move to starter in '96 was not without setback. He
fractured his left forearm a month into the season and missed all
of November. But he came back in December with his breakout, career
month and with his signature game.
</P>
<P>
   That month, he caught 25 passes for 452 yards and four
touchdowns and was named the National Football Conference offensive
player of the month. On Dec. 1 that year at Chicago, he caught a
Hail Mary pass for a touchdown and then grabbed another in the end
zone, twisting and turning his body in a spectacular, diving catch.
For the game: 10 receptions, 156 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming off my first 100-yard game, and that game made it
back-to-back 100-yard games for the first time in my career,''
Freeman said. ``That game was my coming-out party.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued building a relationship with Brett Favre, the Green
Bay quarterback, the kind of communication between receiver and
quarterback that is required for greatness. Entering last season,
Freeman's contract had expired. Green Bay offered $17 million over
five years. Freeman balked and took a one-year deal for $1.153
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that new TV money would be coming into effect this
season and if I had signed that contract last year that I would be
in the middle of the pack of receivers,'' Freeman said. ``I saw a
bigger picture. My family and friends wondered what I was doing and
it is true that I had never been offered or seen that kind of money
in my life. But I saw a lot bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   A $42 million dollar picture.
</P>
<P>
   NFL contracts will continue to escalate as the game grows and
revenues grow. New receiver deals will be made that will pass
Freeman's.
</P>
<P>
   But can he stay a step ahead of other receivers on the field?
Can he continue to match his big-game, big-play production? Will he
continue to draw prime-time attention? Can he become the greatest
receiver of all time? Sure he can.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest player ever? Unlikely. But never say never with
Antonio Freeman. Look how far he has already come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I wasn't signed and though I didn't practice, I
came to our minicamps in the off season, anyway,'' Freeman said.
``Because the team named me franchise player in the off season,
that kept me from shopping myself as a free agent and hitting that
circuit. I might have gotten an even more lucrative deal, but this
is where I wanted to be. We've still got No.4, Brett Favre, and
he's gotten us to two Super Bowls. We've got a power running game
and a passing attack. We've got Desmond Howard back returning
kicks. Our defense is solid. Every team has weaknesses, but the key
is relying on your strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Lord blesses me with health, I have no limits. Winning
championships puts you at center stage. I'm pushing, real hard.''

YALE CLUB GOES CASUAL ON FRIDAYS, BUT THE HARVARD CLUB HOLDS THE
LINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Pa., N.H.)   By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the Yale Club in Manhattan, in the once-exclusive
domain of the jacket and necktie, there are now short-sleeve
tattersalls. There are tieless button-downs. There are yellow polo
shirts. There are Top-Siders, not to mention Nike Airs. Khakis have
been observed in the exclusive Roof Dining Room. There are jeans
and last Friday, egad, there was a purple Izod.
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not enough, one woman actually won admission to
the once-sacrosanct Tap Room in jeans, sandals and a white T-shirt.
``I suppose T-shirts are OK now, as long as they aren't wet,'' said
David Weild III, Yale '52, dressed in a dark blue suit and
observing this spectacle with some amusement.
</P>
<P>
   In case all these pret-a-porter ensembles have not given it
away: the Yale Club has gone casual on Fridays, the first of
Manhattan's exclusive Ivy League bastions to do so. No jacket. No
tie. Its 21-member board unveiled the new dress code last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to engage the interest of more and more younger
members, professional people who are not just lawyers and
accountants but also architects and people who work on the Web,''
said William D. Weber, Yale '60, a business consultant in
Ridgefield, Conn., who is the club's president. ``We lose business
when such people feel inhibited about coming to our club.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber declined to disclose the revenues of the privately held
club, which has occupied the neoclassical limestone and brick
building at 50 Vanderbilt Avenue since 1915.
</P>
<P>
   But do not imagine for one second that such goings-on have been
unnoticed over at the Harvard Club on West 44th Street, where
jacket-and-tie formality is still de rigueur in the main dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the late 1990s there should be a few havens for proper
attire and decorum,'' said John D. Sicher, a member of the Harvard
Club for 32 years. ``I wouldn't expect the rowdies from New Haven
to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midtown Ivy enclave to the west of Grand Central Station,
where the clubs huddle in splendid mutuality, the other Ivy League
clubs are making their last stand for manners. Still holding the
line along with Harvard is the Princeton Club on West 43rd Street,
which requires jacket and tie in its Woodrow Wilson dining room.
United in solidarity are alumni of Columbia University, who are
compelled to be united, sharing the Princeton Club as they do.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting the casual tide are the stalwarts of the
University of Pennsylvania Club on West 44th Street (the library is
off-limits to the tieless and jacketless) and the University Club
on East 54th Street, where formality is required at all times,
according to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Wavering at the balance of modernity is the 6,850-member Cornell
Club-New York on East 44th Street. A jacket _ but not a tie _ is
required on Fridays in the dining room on the second floor.
Acquiescing to this equivocation are some 70 members of the Brown
University Club, who share the Cornell clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But dragged right into the whole dress-down-Friday boola-boola
has been the Dartmouth Club of New York, which has shared the Yale
clubhouse since 1974. ``We take the lead from them,'' said Barry
Weeks, the Dartmouth Club's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The casual-Friday rule at the Yale Club is in effect only from
Memorial Day to Labor Day. ``T-shirts, cutoffs, torn jeans, shorts
and provocative or revealing clothing are not permitted,'' Weber
has informed the membership. Obviously, those rules apply to women
as well.
</P>
<P>
   (As for the woman in the white T-shirt, members speculated that
she had come from the 140-bedroom members' residences upstairs,
where no dress code is enforced and where members pay $105 to $215
a night.)
</P>
<P>
   Weber contended that the club is ``solvent,'' adding that a
booming economy meant that ``these are happy times at the Yale
Club'' for its 9,500 members. They pay a yearly maximum dues of
$1,124 plus tax; members for less than eight years (and those who
are suburbanites or out-of-towners) pay less.
</P>
<P>
   Do members feel, taking their cue from the legendary New Haven
song lyrics, that the gentlemen songsters are off on a spree? Will
they be damned from here to eternity?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reaction ``has been positive,'' Weber said, ``and
there have been no resignations over this as far as I know.''
</P>
<P>
   But some diehard Bulldogs feel strongly that ``the club made an
error,'' said A. Peter Barbaresi, class of '45, a 77-year-old
lawyer in Rye, N.Y. ``There are certain manners that should prevail
in a club. I am sorry to see good taste go out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Dress-down Friday ``doesn't shock me,'' Barbaresi added, ``but
it disappoints me. Americans in general are not at their best when
they are casually dressed. So much is failing us. Even our language
is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Old Blue cynosures for whom the club's dress
code is not an issue. William F. Buckley Jr., class of '50, author
of the 1951 polemic ``God and Man at Yale,'' said he ``never uses
the Yale Club in New York.''

AIMS-TEST _ Arizona's new high school graduation test may be in
jeopardy because of a lawsuit begun seven years ago by parents who
say the state does not do enough to educate Spanish-speaking
children. The case winding its way through U.S. District Court in
Tucson contends that the AIMS is discriminatory against
limited-English students as a graduation requirement. If a judge
agrees, the test could be declared unconstitutional. By PATRICIA

WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH, YOSHII PROVES TOUGHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Time after time, Masato Yoshii has pitched his best
with his job in jeopardy. And not just this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really precisely put my finger on it,'' Yoshii said
Wednesday night through his interpreter, Kota Ishijima. ``But in
the past, there have been numerous times that I've been on the edge
_ of being released, of going to the bullpen, of being sent to the
minor leagues. And when something like that happens, I always come
back strong. Consciously or unconsciously, I don't know why that
is. But it has been a pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pavlovian pattern, if you will, of direct response to a
stimulus, and it continued Wednesday night in Yoshii's start
against the San Diego Padres. At the beginning of this month,
Yoshii was banished to the bullpen after a series of poor outings.
But since he was restored to the Mets' rotation on Aug. 13 in place
of the injured Rick Reed, Yoshii has pitched two of his best games
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday's outing may have been his best in his two years
with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by home runs from Robin Ventura and Mike Piazza, who each
drove in three runs, Yoshii allowed one run and six hits while
pitching a complete game in a 9-1 victory over the Padres. It was
only the Mets' second complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a first-inning run, Yoshii (8-8) retired 16
batters in a row at one point to enable the Mets to head home in
first place in the National League East. The Atlanta Braves beat
the Colorado Rockies, 9-7, Thursday to cut the Mets' lead to a
half-game.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, who would have thought that Yoshii would be
playing an integral part in the Mets' post-season run? Nobody but
Manager Bobby Valentine, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one thing that people have heard me say so many times
that they discount it, and it is that Yoshii is a true
professional,'' Valentine said Wednesday night of the 34-year-old
right-hander. ``There is no doubt in my mind that he understands
competition as well as anyone in that clubhouse. He understands his
job and what he has to do. He had a good forkball his last time out
and a super forkball tonight. We talked about how he needed it, and
he found it. That said, we'll see what happens. But there's no
doubt he's made a major contribution to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii could find himself back in the bullpen after Reed or
Bobby Jones comes off the disabled list, but there is little doubt
that he will start again next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I have nobody else to pitch that game,'' Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Yoshii has been anything this season, it has been
inconsistent. But, Valentine said, that has been the problem with
most of the Mets' starters.
</P>
<P>
   What Yoshii has done better than some of the other starting
pitchers is put together a run of four or five strong starts at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the season 1-3 with a 7.52 earned run average,
Yoshii was on the verge of being demoted to the minors. He
responded by allowing just six runs in 312/3 innings over his next
five starts, a 1.71 ERA, to save his job. Yoshii allowed 13 runs in
just six and two-thirds innings his next two starts before
finishing June on a roll: a 2.30 ERA in 271/3 innings over four
starts.
</P>
<P>
   July was a complete disaster for him, however. Yoshii made five
starts and allowed 25 runs in 22 innings. One week after the Mets
traded for Kenny Rogers, Yoshii allowed seven runs in one and
one-third innings in Chicago. A couple of days later, he learned he
was the odd man out on the starting staff.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii made two relief appearances: one strong, one a mess. But
Reed suffered a strained tendon in his right middle finger, and
Valentine had only Yoshii to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start back, Yoshii allowed three runs and four hits
in six innings of a 3-2 loss in San Francisco. Over his last two
starts, he has given up three earned runs in 15 innings. Valentine
called the starts as good as the team has had back to back.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, whose ERA for the season is 5.39 (the team's is 4.44),
credits his latest resurgence to his forkball. Hideo Nomo taught
him the pitch three years ago and helped him refine it in Milwaukee
early this month when the Mets played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I didn't have any confidence in it, and, of
course, Mike didn't either,'' said Yoshii, referring to Piazza, the
catcher. ``Now, he's calling more forkballs than ever. But I still
don't know why all of a sudden it's doing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything went well for Yoshii on Wednesday night. He
grounded into a double play in each of his last three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``All throughout my career, when I do something great, I always
do something dorky to mess it up,'' Yoshii said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Every complete game has its price.

EDWARD MORGAN, 61, NIXON AIDE CONVICTED IN TAX FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Morgan, a former White House lawyer who in 1974 pleaded
guilty to participating in a plan to create a fraudulent $576,000
tax deduction for President Nixon, died on Aug. 6 in Santa Monica,
Calif. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure after a long illness, The Associated
Press reported, without saying where in Santa Monica he died.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan had been a resident for a time at a convalescent center
in Los Angeles, but had returned to his home in Santa Monica a
couple of years ago, a staff member of the center said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan pleaded guilty to tax fraud in U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia on Nov. 8, 1974, three months after Nixon
resigned as president. Morgan had been charged with one count of
conspiracy to impair, impede, defeat and obstruct the proper and
lawful governmental functions of the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1974, when Morgan was sentenced, Judge Gerald Hart
said Morgan's misdeed had been ``an effort to serve with misplaced
loyalty a superior who held the highest office in the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart sentenced Morgan to 4 months in prison and 20 months'
probation. He served the sentence at a federal detention center at
Lompoc, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan testified in 1975 at the trial of another defendant in
the case that he had never been asked by any White House official
to use the donation of the president's papers to obtain a tax
deduction for Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, a native of Lorain, Ohio, graduated from the University
of Arizona and its law school. He served as a captain in the Army
before becoming a trial lawyer in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign, and then early
in the Nixon administration became the deputy to the presidential
aide John Ehrlichman. Morgan later served as an assistant treasury
secretary until January 1974, when he was forced to resign because
of the furor over his role in creating the fraudulent tax
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations to which he pleaded guilty included knowingly
backdating documents relating to Nixon's gift of papers to the
National Archives and misrepresenting who had legal title to the
documents on crucial dates.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the validity of the deduction for the papers
turned on timing. In 1969 Congress passed a law prohibiting tax
deductions for such gifts after July 25, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The information filed in District Court said Morgan and other
conspirators knew that the papers were not actually given to the
archives until a year later, and that the documents were
fraudulently backdated to make it seem otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty, Morgan acknowledged that he had knowingly
backdated documents involved in the gift of Nixon papers to the
government. He also cooperated with the prosecution of other
associates of Nixon.

ELEANORE SAIDENBERG, ART DEALER, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., France )   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eleanore B. Saidenberg, the owner of an art gallery
that for years was Picasso's primary representative in the United
States, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Born Eleanore Block in Chicago in 1911, Mrs. Saidenberg
graduated from Finch College in New York and started a career as a
modern dancer. She performed at the Goodman Theater in Chicago from
1932 to 1936. In 1934 she married Daniel Saidenberg, then first
cellist of the Chicago Symphony and later also a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Saidenberg danced professionally until she and her husband
moved to New York in 1942. In 1950 she opened the Saidenberg
Gallery in Manhattan. She soon met Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, the
influential art dealer in Paris, who asked her to represent
Picasso. That association lasted from 1955 until Picasso's death in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Her gallery also dealt in the works of Klee, Braque, Leger,
Kandinsky and other 20th-century masters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Saidenberg was a founder of the Art Dealers Association of
America and helped organize several multigallery exhibitions in New
York, including ``Picasso, An American Tribute'' in 1962 and
``Seven Decades: Crosscurrents in Modern Art'' in 1966, to raise
money for the Public Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Mrs. Saidenberg donated works of 20th-century
art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art,
the Art Institute of Chicago, the Israel Museum and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1997. She is survived by two sons, Lawrence
and Robert, both of Manhattan; nine grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Saidenberg continued to operate the Saidenberg Gallery
until June, when she closed it. l

ABDUL-MALIK CONFIDENT ABOUT MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's defense seems a likely candidate for a shaky
start, with so many players either inexperienced or changing
positions.
</P>
<P>
   But Sultan Abdul-Malik is already taking the offensive to any
potential criticism over his move from defensive end to outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik was a second-team All-Pacific-10 Conference
performer last season but requested the move to linebacker because
he didn't feel he was big enough to play defensive end in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has seen me play linebacker since high school. But
they'll find out at Hawaii,'' said Abdul-Malik. ``I've got
linebacker skills. I'm truly a linebacker. I was a fast, undersized
defensive end the past two seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense's changing face could also see true freshman Bernard
Riley as a fixture at tackle. Following Thursday's practice, USC
coach Paul Hackett said Riley had an ``excellent chance'' to be in
the three-man rotation with Ennis Davis and Aaron Williams.
</P>
<P>
   During a 35-play controlled scrimmage that worked on various
game scenarios Thursday, Hackett cited freshmen Troy Polamalu (free
safety), Aaron Graham (middle linebacker) and Omar Nazel (outside
linebacker) as players that stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at our (recruiting) class as a whole, I could
not be happier,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scrimmage notes: During Thursday's scrimmage, the most
noticeable difference probably took place at kicker. Junior David
Bell easily made 40- and 50-yard attempts and appeared well ahead
of sophomore David Newbury, a junior college transfer who missed
his 50-yard attempt and had an extra point blocked by Riley.
</P>
<P>
   __ Soward improves: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward held a meeting
with Hackett on Thursday morning to discuss his perceived slump
during the first five days of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't feel he was performing, but I told him, `Put it
behind you and start over,' '' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The talk apparently worked. Although Soward suffered a sprained
right ankle in the morning practice, he returned and had his best
outing of training camp in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``His energy level was up. He ran good routes. He caught the
ball today,'' Hackett said. ``That's how he makes his living.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Steele arrives: After much delay, linebacker Markus Steele
was scheduled to arrive Thursday night and be eligible to practice
today. The Long Beach City College graduate has been waiting for
USC to receive his transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting the NCAA, USC determined Steele does not need
to practice his first three days in shorts and can practice in
pads. However, Hackett said he will probably have Steele spend at
least two days in shorts for conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coming back slowly: Offensive tackle Matt Welch is recovering
from shoulder surgery in the winter. He might return to practice
today but hasn't progressed as fast as the coaching staff
anticipated at the outset of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disappointment is clearly (the recovery of) Matt Welch; he
should have bounced back but hasn't,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tired legs: USC is beginning to wear down physically as
training camp nears the end of week one. Several players complained
about fatigue between practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our legs are tired,'' Hackett said. ``We're tired, but
we fought through it today.''
</P>
<P>
   USC will probably only hold an afternoon practice today, to
allow players with minor aches and pains some extra rest.

`DANDRIDGE' HAS FEW TRIUMPHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Two moments grip you in Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, HBO's
worthy-but-flawed chronicle of the first Black woman to receive an
Oscar nomination for Best Actress.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first occurs at a Hollywood party, where manager Earl Mills
has been lured to hear a promising singer. He finds three women
laughing under neath the piano: Ava Gardner, Mari lyn Monroe and
Dandridge. And it's Dandridge he's drawn to.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, a medical examiner pauses over Dandridge's nude
body while searching for clues in her still-mysterious death at 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dorothy Dandridge,'' he says to a colleague. ``Wasn't she some
kind of colored singer?''
</P>
<P>
   Those two scenes capture the es sence of Dandridge, at least as
she's presented here. All the talent, fire and beauty in the world
couldn't overcome the obstacles _ both in ternal and external _ she
faced. Gardner and Monroe are legends. Dandridge, the true pioneer,
is merely a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes movies can correct that kind of shortcoming. This one
won't. Although it's obviously a labor of love for Halle Berry, who
is not only mag nificent in the title role but the execu tive
producer of the movie, it falls short in too many places to change
history's perception of Dandridge.
</P>
<P>
   Given network television's current lily-white atmosphere, you
really want to love this movie. It's always watchable and, at
times, quite mov ing. We're left with an interesting look at one of
Hollywood's most in triguing stars. We're also left wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is told through an all-night telephone call Dandridge
makes to a friend. She begins by remembering picking up a
dry-cleaned dress at a hotel where she once stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your lady must have already paid,'' the clerk says,
dismissively checking the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge goes upstairs, puts on the dress and walks down to the
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   `` `My lady' is going out for the evening,'' Dandridge says
icily, toss ing a cover of Life magazine down in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Her picture is on the cover. She's on her way to the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few truly satisfying res olutions of such a
situation in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an actress, Dan dridge performed as part of the
sing ing Dandridge Sisters at the famed Cotton Club in Harlem.
That's where she met her future husband, Harold Nicholas, one of
the tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge gives birth to a mentally retarded daughter, and her
shaky marriage falters. Her mother urges Dandridge to concentrate
on her burgeoning career, which, though promising, is fraught with
problems compounded by racism. She tells Mills, for instance, that
she isn't in terested in being a singer; she's a se rious actress.
</P>
<P>
   The next scene finds her on a movie set, her face darkened by
makeup, tied to a stake while waiting to be rescued by Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   She takes Mills' advice and hits the supper-club circuit. Again,
racism is painted in broad strokes. With a sin gle song, Dandridge
wins over the racist city fathers in Miami Beach who have held up
completion of a club where she's performing. The easy victory seems
artificial, con trived.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dandridge's reputation (and Mills' persistence) win
her a reading with Otto Preminger, who is casting an all-Black
version of Car men, called Carmen Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just realized this is the moment I've always dreamed of,''
Dandridge tells Mills (well-played by Brent Spi ner of Star Trek:
The Next Genera tion).
</P>
<P>
   ``A reading with Preminger?'' he asks. Dandridge shakes her head
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Well. Let's put on a show, kids. Pab lum like that keeps popping
up, and keeps Introducing Dorothy Dan dridge from rising to the
heights it might have reached.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge wins the role, of course, and begins an affair with
Preminger. She is nominated for an Academy Award but doesn't win, a
result chill ingly predicted by her sister, who screams in a
drunken rage, ``You're not going to win an Oscar, Dottie! They
already gave us one!'' (Hattie McDaniel won a Best Supporting Ac
tress Oscar in 1939 for Gone With the Wind, the first Black actress
to win one.)
</P>
<P>
   The nomination doesn't lead to bet ter roles. Dandridge
continues to fight racism (when she defiantly dips her toe into a
Las Vegas swimming pool, the hotel drains the water and scrubs the
pool). But she spirals downward, firing Mills and falling into
another unhappy marriage, bank ruptcy and addiction to prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   She reunites with Mills for a come back, but just before leaving
for New York, he finds her dead of an over dose of a prescription
anti-depres sant. The cause of death _ suicide or accident _ was
never deter mined.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tragically unsatisfying way to end a life. And it's a
fittingly unsatis fying way to end the movie. Again, Berry is
excellent as Dandridge (she's also an accomplished lip-syncher;
Wendy Williams does the actual singing), and Klaus Maria Brandauer
brings brilliant life to Preminger.
</P>
<P>
   But Introducing Dorothy Dandridge does just that _ introduces us
to her. It would have been far more sat isfying to get to know her
even bet ter. &QL;
