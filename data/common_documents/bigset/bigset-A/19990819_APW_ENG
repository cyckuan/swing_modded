<HEADLINE>  Turkish Quake Death Toll Hits 6,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The official death toll from western  
Turkey's worst recorded earthquake surpassed 6,000 today and hope 
waned for saving many of the thousands still missing under the 
mountains of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Turks camped out in yards,  
parks, and even on highway medians for yet another night in fear of 
going home -- or because they had no home to go back to. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anatolia news agency said that in the hard-hit Izmit and  
Golcuk areas, 3,000 people were killed, an increase of 1,000 from 
the earlier official count. The agency later reported that the 
death toll in the town of Yalova rose from 350 to 1,311. The 
increases raise the official death toll to some 6,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's private Channel 6 reported that the death toll reached  
7,000, but did not say the source of its count. The discrepancy 
could be due to the large number of people still missing. The death 
toll was still expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	By today, some 21,000 people were reported injured.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't trust our own homes,'' said 21-year-old Dilek Turkmen  
as she watched rescue workers sifting through the rubble of a 
collapsed apartment building on the outskirts of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	More hard evidence of the destruction: an inferno at the major  
Tupras oil refinery, still raging out of control today and 
threatening severe setbacks to the area that accounts for a third 
of Turkey's economic output. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's business newspaper, Finansal Forum, estimated the quake  
would cost Turkey's struggling economy $25 billion. Other estimates 
put the cost even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh rescue teams arrived from abroad overnight to continue  
searching for the missing. Many wore scarves over their faces as a 
barrier against the growing stench of decaying flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	An Austrian team moved from building to building in Izmit,  
searching for survivors with sniffer dogs. They found no one and 
said they feared that most of those trapped in the wreckage may 
have perished due to a lack of water. 
</P>
<P>
	People pleaded for rescuers to try to find loved ones in towers  
of rubble of what was once apartment buildings, many of them poorly 
constructed structures that served the poor who flocked to cities 
when economic progress created jobs over the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Golcuk mayor Ismail Baris estimated as many as 10,000 were still  
trapped under collapsed rubble in his navy base town alone. 
</P>
<P>
	A 60-member French military rescue team worked in Yalova, 90  
miles southwest of Istanbul, trying to pull 16-year-old Elmas 
Kizilkaya from the rubble of a seven-story building. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has her ankle trapped in the concrete,'' said Capt.  
Jean-Marc Castagnet, head of the French team. ``We may have to 
amputate her foot. We will do everything not to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team from Israel arrived in a village near Yalova, 90 miles  
southwest of Istanbul, after reports of 14 Israelis trapped in the 
rubble of a building. Police said one was pulled out alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women who had been trapped under the rubble of their  
five-story apartment building for 44 hours were rescued alive in 
Bolu, 160 miles east of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurriyet newspaper reported that seven people were saved from  
collapsed buildings after they used their cell phones to call for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	But such rescue stories were expected to dwindle as more time  
passed, swelling the death toll. 
</P>
<P>
	A boggling array of misery emerged from the rubble: grotesquely  
contorted bodies, dead children with faces frozen in terror, 
corpses stacked in refrigerated meat wagons and at an ice-skating 
rink to slow rotting in the heat -- and a woman holding a vigil for 
a newlywed daughter expected to be among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not leaving until they find her,'' proclaimed Ayse Mutlu,  
who has sat in the same chair in front of the toppled apartment in 
Izmit since Tuesday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit found himself increasingly under  
fire for his handling of the catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rescue is a pure fiasco,'' the Radikal newspaper shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	``Helplessness'' the national Sabah newspaper blared on its  
front page. ``The people are helpless, the state is helpless, we 
can't even find a place to put our dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Izmit, one of the hardest hit cities and site of  
the refinery fire, shouted complaints directly at Ecevit as he 
toured the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``When are they going to come and help us? When we are all  
dead?'' cried Zeyfettin Kus in front of a collapsed apartment where 
three neighbors were buried. He could no longer hear cries for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwindling food supplies on top of crippled power and water lines  
in some areas added to the mood of desperation. Crowds mobbed a 
convoy of bread trucks that entered the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in the capital, Ankara, Ecevit announced hotlines had  
been set up from the worst-hit areas directly to his office, while 
defending the efforts so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rescue work is very sensitive,'' he said. ``If not done  
carefully, while saving one life you can lose 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Izmit, authorities tried to evacuate a three-mile zone around  
the oil refinery, about 80 miles southeast of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical foam dropped by firefighting planes failed to quell the  
flames, which churned out enormous plumes of dark smoke that gave 
even sunny skies a twilight pallor. Electricity cuts kept fire 
crews from using pumps to draw water from the nearby Sea of 
Marmara. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst fear was that the blaze could engulf the entire field  
of 30 giant storage tanks, touching off an environmental disaster. 
Nearby, other serious dangers loomed: a fertilizer facility with 
8,000 tons of dangerous ammonia risked catching fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Barriers were set up to stop any oil from spilling into the sea.  
</P>
<P>
	The state-run plant provided more than a third of the retail and  
industrial grade fuel for the domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Sonics Sign Guard Fred Vinson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics plucked 6-foot-4 guard  
Fred Vinson out of their summer league team and signed him Thursday 
to a one-year contract, the team announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinson, 28, averaged 15 points per game and shot 45 percent from  
3-point range for the Sonics' summer league teams in Long Beach and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fred was very impressive in last year's training camp and  
almost made the team,'' coach Paul Westphal said. ``But because of 
the lockout we didn't get a sufficient chance to evaluate him. He 
excelled on our summer league team and was one of the best outside 
shooters we saw this summer. We think he really has a chance to 
help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinson played two years at Georgia Tech after transferring from  
a junior college, then signed as a free agent with the Atlanta 
Hawks in 1994. After playing five games with the Hawks, he spent 
time with the CBA franchise in Mexico City and played in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Debuts at Saratoga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Silverbulletday, owner Mike  
Pegram's summer cooler, will try to stretch her winning streak 
against other 3-year-old fillies to 10 on Saturday in the Alabama 
at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	She was made the 1-2 early favorite Thursday to succeed against  
six rivals in the 1 1/4-mile Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime I watch her race, I get chills,'' Pegram said from  
California. ``It's really a thrill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, the champion 2-year-old filly of 1998 when she  
won six of seven starts, including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies. Her loss was a fourth-place finish in the Del Mar 
Futurity, won by Excellent Meeting, her Bob Baffert-trained 
stablemate. 
</P>
<P>
	Her only loss this year was a seventh-place finish in the  
1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes June 5, her only start against males. 
</P>
<P>
	She was in contention until fading the stretch.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a pretty good performance,'' said Jerry  
Bailey, who didn't use the filly when it became apparent she 
couldn't win. ``The number of lengths she got beat (10 1/2) are 
deceiving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her last race, Silverbulletday won the 1 1-8 Monmouth Oaks on  
July 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``A horse like Silverbulletday is one that you run into once in  
a lifetime,'' Pegram said. ``I really can't express in words the 
kind of trip she's taken me on since she started racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is Silverbulletday who will have to take Pegram to the  
winner's circle on Breeders' Cup Day Nov. 6 because his Real Quiet, 
also trained by Baffert, is out for the year with a cracked leg 
bone. He was to run the Classic. Silverbulletday's goal is the 
Distaff. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday's main rival in $400,000 Alabama appears to be  
3-1 On a Soapbox, winner of two of three starts this year, 
including the 1 1/2-mile Coaching Club American Oaks July 24 at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The field in post-position order is Gandria, Shane Sellers; Back  
In Shape, Jose Espinoza; On a Soapbox, Robby Albarado; Brushed 
Halory, Eddie Martin; Adam's Time, Jorge Chavez; Silverbulletday, 
Bailey, and Strolling Belle, Mike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Each starter will carry 121 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Post time for the 119th Alabama, the oldest filly race in the  
country, is 4:45 p.m. EDT. ESPN will televise from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Track Stars Question Test Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Primo Nebiolo seldom minces words.  
</P>
<P>
	With drug scandals stealing the headlines on the eve of his  
sport's showcase event, the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation chief called doping a ``moral cancer'' that should be 
cured ``through the diffusion of a culture of honesty in sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I particularly want to underline,'' the 76-year-old  
Italian said. ``No one can give us lessons on this matter. Our 
intransigence is total and goes back a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Nebiolo spoke at one end of Seville on Thursday, some of the  
world's top track stars were across town saying they were skeptical 
about drug-testing methods that have produced a series of 
high-profile, positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the IAAF medical commission,  
defended the testing system and warned drug cheats they will be 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the system,'' he said. ``Athletes  
think they can take things and not get caught. They are wrong. We 
know what we are doing,and while we cannot track down every drug 
taken,we are closing the gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest shock came Wednesday when 39-year-old Jamaican  
sprinter Merlene Ottey withdrew from the World Championships after 
testing positive for the steroid Nandrolone. Nebiolo admitted it 
was uncertain ``whether Ottey has committed a doping offense or 
whether there has been some mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford  
Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers 
tarnished by positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past couple of weeks when we've heard so many sudden  
cases of this ... I don't think I'm 100 percent sure that it's the 
correct testing procedure,'' American sprint star Marion Jones 
said. ``To say `yes' I'd be lying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion on the whole matter is that over the last couple of  
weeks our beautiful and lovely sport has been marred by all of 
this,'' added Jones, who will be chasing an unprecedented four gold 
medals in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, the defending world 1,500-meter  
champion and mile world record-holder, is hoping the tests are 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand that in a few days four of the biggest  
stars in athletics were tested positive,'' he said. ``I'm surprised 
and I hope there's something wrong with the analysis or something 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the focus is on a rash of positive tests for Nandrolone,  
a common steroid that has been detectable for years. Among those 
testing positive for the drug were Ottey, Christie and British 
200-meter runner Doug Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	American sprinter Maurice Greene, the world record-holder at 100  
meters, called for blood testing at next year's 2000 Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the best thing to do is ... to take blood,''  
Greene said. ``That's going to be the best thing to do. I can't 
wait until that time comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, who has set 15 world records in  
long-distance events, also supported blood testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see this, all the young kids will think the stars are  
on drugs,'' he said. ``That is very bad because the young always 
follow the old. They should do more blood testing. It's a very bad 
situation at a very bad time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World 200-meter record-holder Michael Johnson was highly  
skeptical when asked whether he had confidence in the testing 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in God and my parents,'' Johnson said.  
``That's about the extent of what I have confidence in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a scary thing,'' said American 400-meter runner Jerome  
Young. ``They need to do more research. I think there was something 
wrong with the machine. There are too many athletes going down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Smith, the high-profile coach of Greene, Ato Boldon and  
other star sprinters, said the sport needs to accentuate the 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to carry on because our sport is down right now,'' he  
said. ``We have to work ... to get from here to the next step -- 
that is to bring light and positiveness to the sport.''

<HEADLINE>  Schools Full in Baby Boom Echo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This fall, 53.2 million children will step  
into public and private school classrooms, setting a new enrollment 
record for the fourth straight year, the Education Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	And 14.9 million older students will set a second record -- for  
college enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	The swell in the nation's schoolhouses, fueled by the baby boom  
``echo'' and increased immigration, seems likely to lead to a 
showdown between President Clinton and the Republican-led Congress 
over education spending, especially on new teacher hires and school 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our lifetime we have never had a better chance to prepare  
American children in American schools for the next century,'' 
President Clinton said at Thursday's release of the annual 
back-to-school tally. ``Unfortunately the congressional majority 
wants to back off the commitment we made to hire new teachers and 
build new schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has pointed to the last few years of  
increased enrollments in promoting its plan to build new schools 
and reduce early-grade class sizes by hiring 100,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to think long-term, we need to get on with the  
business of building schools that can be centers of our 
communities,'' Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans countered that their tax and education  
proposals also would address booming school enrollment, but leave 
the decisions to states and local school boards and not target 
specific school districts for aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that all students in all school districts -- not  
just the ones the president picks -- should have the same 
opportunities for new schools,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall's kindergarten-through-12th grade enrollment will  
surpass last fall's by a half-million, according to the report, 
which surveys schools. Enrollment has been rising since 1985 and 
will continue to climb for seven more before hitting a plateau in 
2006, the department said. Increases will start anew in the early 
grades because of rising birth rates, the officials added. 
</P>
<P>
	The school enrollments over the next decade are projected to  
increase by 2 percent, with the greatest increase occurring in high 
schools -- ninth through 12th grades -- which will see a 9 percent 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states will see more dramatic increases in student  
enrollments than others. For example, . 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada will get 50 percent more high school students over the  
next 10 years; followed by Arizona with a 35.1 percent increase in 
ninth-through-12th grade enrollment and North Carolina with a 21.5 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The student growth is tied to increased immigration and a 1980s  
rise in births much like the baby boom post-World War II population 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the decline after the first baby boom, when births  
dropped to 3.1 million in the early 1970s, births are not expected 
to fall this time around, but rather increase slowly for the next 
decade. The Census Bureau's long range predictions indicate 4.2 
million live births for 2009 to 4.8 million in 2028.

<HEADLINE>  Gatling to Magic, Manning to Bucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks added veteran experience to  
their young, talented nucleus on Thursday by acquiring Danny 
Manning and Dale Ellis from the Orlando Magic in a trade for Chris 
Gatling and Armen Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was the fourth major deal in August for the rebuilding  
Magic, who now look nothing like the team that tied for the 
Atlantic Division title last season. 
</P>
<P>
	For Orlando, the deal removed two older players from the team's  
completely revamped roster and replaced them with two whose 
contracts will be up after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee general manager Ernie Grunfeld, hired only a week ago,  
said he and Orlando GM John Gabriel were able to fill the needs of 
two franchises that appear to be headed in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing came together pretty quickly,'' Grunfeld said.  
``We're excited about adding some proven veterans to our young 
core.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal moves four well-traveled players, each with at least  
eight years of experience and four previous teams on their resumes. 
Ellis and Manning were both acquired by the Magic in offseason 
trades with Seattle and Phoenix, respectively, and hadn't played a 
game in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Manning and Ellis told the Magic they were interested in  
playing for a contender, and Orlando may have accommodated their 
wishes. With a young starting five that includes Ray Allen and 
Glenn Robinson, the Bucks made the playoffs last season for the 
first time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, 33, was traded to Orlando with Pat Garrity and two  
first-round draft picks for Penny Hardaway earlier this month. He 
won the 1998 Sixth Man award with Phoenix, where he had played the 
last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-time All-Star and the first overall pick in the 1988  
draft, Manning averaged a career-low 9.1 points and 4.4 rebounds 
per game last year while playing in all 50 games for the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a terrific attitude, and he's excited to come to a team  
that we think is on the verge of taking the next step,'' Grunfeld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, 39, played for Milwaukee coach George Karl in Seattle  
during the 1997-98 season and said he enjoyed working with the 
controversial coach. Ellis also previously played in Milwaukee from 
1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be expected to supply the outside shooting the Bucks  
lost when Dell Curry, the league's leader in 3-point field goal 
percentage, signed with Toronto as a free agent. Milwaukee also 
lost free agent Michael Curry to the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, who was acquired by the Magic in the deal that brought  
rookie Corey Maggette to Orlando, averaged just 10.3 points per 
game coming off the bench for the Sonics last season, his lowest 
average since 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
	``By acquiring Danny and Dale, we have improved our basketball  
team,'' Karl said in a statement. ``Danny has shown the ability to 
play all three front line positions exceptionally well, and Dale is 
one of the best shooters in the game. This trade makes us a better 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gatling, 31, averaged a career-low 5.7 points per game last year  
with the Bucks and New Jersey Nets, and spoke openly of his desire 
for a trade to a team with fewer players at his position. Gatling 
was an All-Star in 1997, and has also played with Golden State, 
Miami and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando is Gatling's sixth team in five years. He has been  
involved in three multiplayer deals in the last four seasons, 
including the record nine-player trade between Dallas and New 
Jersey in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliam, 35, also averaged a career-low with 8.3 points per game  
last year, his third in Milwaukee. The Magic will be Gilliam's 
sixth team in his 12-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The only players left on Orlando's roster who have been with the  
team for more than two seasons are Darrell Armstrong and Derek 
Strong. Gabriel has traded starters Hardaway, Nick Anderson, Horace 
Grant and Isaac Austin, and also hired Doc Rivers to replace Chuck 
Daly as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel was anxious to move Manning for either a young player or  
a player whose contract expired at the end of next season. Both 
Gatling and Gilliam have contracts that will conclude then.

<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Lance Armstrong is cashing in on his Tour  
de France victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has signed a contract extension with his team, U.S.  
Postal Service, that will pay him $2 million in 2000, four times 
his 1999 base salary. He also has signed a string of new 
endorsement deals worth as much as $6 million through the year 
2004, the Austin American-Statesman reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Postal Service team representatives didn't immediately  
return calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance is somewhat astounded by what's happening now,'' said  
Armstrong's agent, Bill Stapleton. ``The numbers are pretty 
staggering and he's really flattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, has pledged to donate at least $250,000 from his  
2000 salary to his Lance Armstrong Foundation for cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the endorsement deals call for Armstrong to appear in  
television commercials for financial news provider Bridge 
Information Systems, American General Financial Services and the 
Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong already has been the subject of a commercial for Nike  
Inc., one of his apparel and equipment sponsors. He has made 
appearances as a motivational speaker since he was diagnosed with 
advanced testicular cancer in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the Tour de France, Armstrong made $30,000 per speech.  
Stapleton said companies now are offering up to $100,000 per 
speech.

<HEADLINE> Gore Seeks 'New Way' on Trade Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, seeking to ease  
tensions with labor leaders, called Thursday for ``a new way'' on 
contentious trade issues which have divided the two. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot open markets, but close the door on protections for  
America's workers,'' Gore said. ``We're going to move those exports 
out and those job numbers up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, speaking with reporters later, said he wasn't offering new  
trade proposals but was seeking to emphasize the administration's 
commitment to protect against the loss of jobs to overseas 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for a new way on trade,'' Gore said.  
</P>
<P>
	He chose to make his case during a state convention of the Iowa  
Federation of Labor just a day after New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley 
spoke to the same group. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been tensions between labor and the Clinton  
administration for years over trade issues, and Gore has faced 
tough questioning from some as he seeks the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and Gore have pressed for free trade agreements  
that open more markets for American products. Labor leaders argue 
those deals clear the way for shipping jobs overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore acknowledged the differences.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have supported free and fair trade,'' Gore said. ``It has  
brought me disagreements with some people I most respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the disagreement is a question of emphasis.  
Trade bargainers have included provisions aimed at protecting 
environmental standards and labor laws in the nation's trading 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say those protections are inadequate, while Gore said  
he'd see to it they were enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Gore said he would heighten the role of those  
standards in upcoming trade bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor and environmental concerns need to be integrated into  
the negotiating approach to our country,'' Gore said, insisting the 
administration's policy is beginning to have an effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing a new receptiveness in other countries,'' Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is the overwhelming early leader for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, and he clearly sought to minimize 
differences with a key Democratic constituency where he's already 
gotten some backing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state labor federation doesn't endorse candidates but the  
two-day lab meeting gave leaders a chance to look over the two 
Democratic contenders. Bradley called for a series of changes in 
labor laws while Gore sounded more general themes and focused on 
attacking Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking about any other candidates,'' Gore said, when  
asked to spell out his differences with Bradley. ``I'm not going to 
say anything negative about him at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Gore argued his labor record is better than any  
of his rivals -- a particularly notable achievement since he's from 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know that was compiled in a southern state,''  
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his labor ties date back to his father being the first  
labor secretary in Tennessee. He warned labor leaders that 
Democrats can't risk divisions, because split party could lose the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that Clinton has served as ``a back stop to stop this  
bunch from dismantling the labor law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a one-day campaign visit by Gore, who mingled with labor  
leaders and sought to shore up ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, he traveled to a farm south of Waterloo to  
collect the endorsements of more than 120 prominent farmers and to 
repeat his call for more federal assistance for a sagging farm 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore picked up the endorsement of Rep. Leonard Boswell of Iowa  
and state Agricultural Secretary Patty Judge as well as Iowa 
Farmers Union President John Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used the picture-perfect farm setting to launch the group  
``Farmers for Gore,'' which he said will bolster the grass roots 
activism of his campaign.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Plans Anti-Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- With China raising the volume on its  
threats to attack Taiwan, the island's Cabinet accelerated plans 
today for an islandwide network to shoot down Chinese missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan plans to establish an effective early warning system to  
detect airborne Chinese planes and missiles and build a ``total 
missile defense system,'' Premier Vincent Siew told the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabinet will put its plans before the legislature at the  
start of the new session Sept. 1. The Defense Ministry may seek 
funding for it from next year, government spokesman Chen Chien-jen 
quoted Siew as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen said President Lee Teng-hui had pressed the Cabinet to  
pursue an ``in-depth'' plan for moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-missile defense system could allow Taiwan to eventually  
take part in a U.S.-sponsored regional missile defense umbrella, 
the mass-market United Daily News reported, although Taiwan has yet 
to be invited in and China says it would fight to block Taiwan's 
inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Taiwan has so far focused its attention on a limited  
local defense, Defense Minister Tang Fei has said technology to 
intercept missiles at high altitude could be added later. 
</P>
<P>
	China's recent renewal of its threat to attack Taiwan over what  
it considers a radical shift toward independence by Lee has lent 
new urgency to Taiwan's quest for anti-missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing was enraged by Lee's July 9 remark that Taiwan and China  
should manage relations on a ``state-to-state'' basis. China's 
official news media have issued a stream of threats to crush what 
it sees as Lee's plan to formalize the political separation between 
the sides, which have operated independently since a 1949 civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that no country in the world will dare to neglect  
the law and morality and become the enemy of 1.2 billion Chinese 
people just to fulfill Lee Teng-hui's personal ambition. To 
separate a sovereign country is a big risk,'' the Chinese 
military's Liberation Army Daily said in a front page editorial 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	China views Taiwan as a renegade province that it says must  
eventually be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Missiles are considered one of the few effective threats China's  
massive but largely obsolete war machine can muster against Taiwan. 
Strategists say they could take out vital military and civilian 
targets, hamstringing the island's defenses.

<HEADLINE> India Shrugs Off Nuke Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's foreign minister shrugged off  
concerns Thursday that it is inching toward a nuclear conflict with 
neighboring Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaswant Singh rejected the worries the followed its release of a  
new nuclear policy statement, despite expressions of alarm from the 
United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am fully confident that we will be able to assuage the  
concerns that have been expressed in Washington and Beijing,'' 
Jaswant Singh was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India. 
</P>
<P>
	India unveiled a draft nuclear doctrine Tuesday that say it will  
pursue a policy of credible nuclear deterrence and will use nuclear 
weapons only to retaliate against a first strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy can be adopted only after a new government assumes  
office in mid-October following national elections. The ruling 
coalition is ahead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Tuesday that India is ``clearly moving  
in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has written to Indian Prime Minister Atal  
Bihari Vajpayee, a Foreign Office spokesman said Thursday, adding 
that Vajpayee would reply. He did not give details of the letter, 
describing it as ``regular correspondence'' between the two 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the United  
States opposed any Indian move to develop a nuclear deterrent 
because that would only create an ``an action-reaction cycle that 
will increase the risks'' to both India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan also slammed the doctrine. Speaking Thursday at the  
66-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the world's main 
disarmament forum, Pakistani Ambassador Munir Akram pledged that 
his country would respond in kind to any Indian escalation in the 
arms race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposed Indian doctrine also makes it clear that India's  
nuclear escalation will be accompanied by the further buildup of 
India's conventional warfare capabilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since most of India's conventional `assets' are deployed against  
Pakistan, his country will be obliged to respond to the buildup, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Islamabad, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed promised  
to ``never compromise on our vital security matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a growing imbalance in military capabilities ``will  
intensify Pakistan's reliance on nuclear capabilities to deter the 
use or threat of aggression by India.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh will lead India's delegation to New York next month to  
attend the U.N. General Assembly session. He said he would meet 
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they (U.S.) wish to take it up with us, I am ready to  
discuss with them,'' Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear doctrine, announced weeks before India holds its  
general elections, has been slammed by opposition groups. The first 
of the several phases of balloting will be held Sept. 5 and a new 
government is expected to be in place by mid-October.

<HEADLINE>  Schools Full in Baby Boom Echo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This fall, 53.2 million children will step  
into public and private school classrooms, setting a new enrollment 
record for the fourth straight year, the Education Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	And 14.9 million older students will set a second record -- for  
college enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	The swell in the nation's schoolhouses, fueled by the baby boom  
``echo'' and increased immigration, seems likely to lead to a 
showdown between President Clinton and the Republican-led Congress 
over education spending, especially on new teacher hires and school 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our lifetime we have never had a better chance to prepare  
American children in American schools for the next century,'' 
President Clinton said at Thursday's release of the annual 
back-to-school tally. ``Unfortunately the congressional majority 
wants to back off the commitment we made to hire new teachers and 
build new schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has pointed to the last few years of  
increased enrollments in promoting its plan to build new schools 
and reduce early-grade class sizes by hiring 100,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to think long-term, we need to get on with the  
business of building schools that can be centers of our 
communities,'' Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans countered that their tax and education  
proposals also would address booming school enrollment, but leave 
the decisions to states and local school boards and not target 
specific school districts for aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that all students in all school districts -- not  
just the ones the president picks -- should have the same 
opportunities for new schools,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall's kindergarten-through-12th grade enrollment will  
surpass last fall's by a half-million, according to the report, 
which surveys schools. Enrollment has been rising since 1985 and 
will continue to climb for seven more before hitting a plateau in 
2006, the department said. Increases will start anew in the early 
grades because of rising birth rates, the officials added. 
</P>
<P>
	The school enrollments over the next decade are projected to  
increase by 2 percent, with the greatest increase occurring in high 
schools -- ninth through 12th grades -- which will see a 9 percent 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states will see more dramatic increases in student  
enrollments than others. For example, . 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada will get 50 percent more high school students over the  
next 10 years; followed by Arizona with a 35.1 percent increase in 
ninth-through-12th grade enrollment and North Carolina with a 21.5 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The student growth is tied to increased immigration and a 1980s  
rise in births much like the baby boom post-World War II population 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the decline after the first baby boom, when births  
dropped to 3.1 million in the early 1970s, births are not expected 
to fall this time around, but rather increase slowly for the next 
decade. The Census Bureau's long range predictions indicate 4.2 
million live births for 2009 to 4.8 million in 2028.

<HEADLINE> Spain, Gibraltar Make Deal on Runner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Trying to keep politics out of sports,  
Spain and Gibraltar cut a deal Thursday on what do with the British 
colony's one-man team at the IAAF championships -- he can run, but 
not carry a flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain, which claims sovereignty over the Rock at its southern  
tip, objected to that athlete, 1,500 meters runner Liam Byrne, 
taking part in Friday's opening ceremonies with the red and white 
flag of Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a painful case which, fortunately, has been resolved,''  
Jose Maria Odrizola, president of the Spanish Athletics Federation, 
told the news agency Efe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gibraltar government issued a statement indicating it was  
not thrilled with the arrangement, but said that withdrawing Byrne 
in protest would hurt only him. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this way the government believes Gibraltar demonstrates  
that it genuinely puts sport above politics,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Dips to 7-Month Low vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell broadly Thursday, losing ground  
to the euro and touching a seven-month low against the surging yen 
on news of a widening United States trade deficit and a burst of 
confidence in the European and Japanese economies. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0630 up from  
$1.0523 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 111.40 
Japanese yen, down from 112.03. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the half-year trade deficit had risen more than 40  
percent over last year's figure triggered a move by foreign 
exchange traders out of dollars and into other foreign currencies -- 
most notably the yen. Through the first half of this year, the U.S. 
trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $236 billion -- 44 
percent above last year's $164.3 billion record imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This particular report seemed to get everyone nervous,'' said  
Don Hilber, an economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The worse-than-expected numbers and the dollar's slide renewed  
fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to take more strident 
measures to keep inflation in check. A falling dollar makes imports 
more expensive for U.S. consumers, raising inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street has expected a one-quarter of a percentage point  
rate hike following next week's Federal Reserve policy-making 
meeting, but the latest deficit figures could force a larger 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In which case, ``investors will start to consider alternatives  
in overseas markets,'' Hilber said. ``And in this case it's Japan 
because there are concurrent signs that the Japanese economy is 
rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released last week by the Japanese government indicated  
the Japan's economy had grown faster in the first quarter than 
analysts had anticipated, which means the pace of the country's 
economic recovery may be speeding up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing the yen appreciate for all the right reasons,''  
said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar dynamics are at work in Europe, where the euro has  
recovered from lows recorded in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5037 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5203, and 1.4930 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4827. The British 
pound rose to $1.6186 from $1.6015. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8403 German 
marks, down from 1.8584; 6.1708 French francs, down from 6.2336; 
and 1,821.51 Italian lire, down from 1,840.04.

<HEADLINE> Will Clark Misses 5th Straight Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles first baseman Will Clark  
missed his fifth straight game with a sore elbow and could be 
headed for the disabled list for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles manager Ray Miller said Clark can effectively swing the  
bat, but throwing the ball is still painful proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still barking at him,'' Miller said. ``You don't need the  
greatest of arms to play first base, but you still need to throw 
the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is hesitant to use Clark as a pinch hitter because then  
the Orioles won't be able to put him on the disabled list 
retroactive to Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll use him if I think he can win the game in the ninth  
inning,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the Orioles announced they have extended their  
working agreement with Triple-A Rochester through next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles and Red Wings have been working together since 1961,  
the third-longest longest affiliation between a major league team 
and minor league team.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court To Rethink Irish Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Three former Irish fugitives who were freed  
last fall after a federal appeals court overturned their 
extradition face a new hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday set a new  
hearing for Sept. 28 after the federal government asked it to 
reconsider its earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The court had previously set aside a judge's extradition order  
and called for an examination of possible bias in the courts in 
British-governed Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	In requesting reconsideration of the ruling, the Justice  
Department said there was an issue of whether U.S. courts can 
inquire into possible bias in another country's court system. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, Kevin Artt, Pol Brennan and Terence Kirby, remain free  
on bail. They were among 38 opponents of British rule in Northern 
Ireland who escaped from the Maze prison near Belfast in September 
1983. The three were arrested separately in California a decade 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Artt and Kirby were both serving sentences for murder,  
convictions based on confessions that they said were beaten out of 
them. Brennan was convicted of possessing explosives that police 
said were to be used to blow up a Belfast shop.

<HEADLINE> Intel To Make Web Sites Add Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest move to discourage government  
regulation, Intel Corp. said it will require Internet sites that 
carry its advertising to warn consumers what personal details are 
being collected about them online. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which spent $1.3 billion on all advertising last year, is  
among the largest buyers of ads on the Internet, especially with 
its prominent campaign featuring the familiar ``Intel Inside'' 
swirl logo. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's announcement Wednesday follows similar threats earlier  
this year by IBM, Microsoft Corp. and The Walt Disney Co. to 
withhold advertising from Web sites that do not publish adequate 
privacy warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're now joining the ranks,'' said Ann Lewnes, Intel's  
director of worldwide advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech industry wants to convince the federal government  
that it can regulate itself and that new privacy laws are not 
needed to protect consumers on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said it will require by Jan. 1 that all the roughly 200  
``Intel Inside'' sites worldwide comply with privacy guidelines 
developed by the Online Privacy Alliance, a trade group of 
companies on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which recommended to Congress this  
summer that new Internet privacy laws are not needed, praised 
Intel's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC told lawmakers that some Web sites ``still do not  
understand the importance of consumer privacy,'' but decided 
companies voluntarily were creating rules for handling sensitive 
personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Web sites will know they won't get advertising dollars unless  
they protect consumers' privacy,'' said Vicki Streitfeld, a 
spokeswoman for the FTC. ``It's the kind of thing we hope will 
create strong incentives to create their own privacy policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The OPA guidelines require Web sites to tell consumers what  
information is being collected, allow people to ask not to have any 
information gathered about them, keep private details secure and 
allow consumers to review their information for accuracy and 
correct it. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that ``Intel Inside'' campaign, which includes the  
largest share of the company's ad expenditures, Intel pays a 
special premium -- mostly to computer markers -- to include the 
familiar logo in their advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel earlier this summer told other Internet sites where it  
buys traditional ads they must publish privacy policies by Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewnes said Intel estimates that about 70 percent of Web sites  
that carry the company's ads already publish privacy policies, and 
predicted the others will shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate a very large problem,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Intel angered privacy groups earlier this year when it included  
in its latest Pentium III computer processors a unique serial 
number to transmit to Web sites that request it to help verify the 
identity of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the feature will help eliminate online fraud and  
control access to sensitive data. Some privacy groups argued that 
the so-called tracking technology will give companies unprecedented 
ability to trace consumers' moves as they navigate the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those same privacy groups took a dim view of Intel's  
latest announcement. David Banisar of the Washington-based 
Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the OPA guidelines 
themselves are ``virtually worthless'' because they ``set up 
procedural barriers that consumers have to hop over to have some 
kind of marginal control over their information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think in the long run it makes much difference at all,  
given how limited the privacy protections are,'' Banisar said. 
``This doesn't provide any real level of comfort to consumers.''

<HEADLINE> Minnesota's Tax Relief Tops in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota, long a place of high tax  
burdens, is the national leader in new tax cuts, according to an 
analysis of budgets by the National Conference of State 
Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of tax cuts 42 states will implement over the next two  
years shows that Minnesotans will be receiving the highest total of 
cuts and rebates -- $2.7 billion -- as well as the highest per capita 
relief at $575. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legislatures have not yet approved budgets. But the nearest  
competitor so far is Connecticut, which is offering tax relief 
totaling $216 per capita. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Minnesota without question is unchallenged this year  
as to the level and magnitude of tax cuts offered its residents,'' 
said Arturo Perez, senior policy analyst for the NCSL, a 
clearinghouse of information for states and their lobbying arm in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans, Democrats and Reform Party Gov. Jesse Ventura  
fight over who should get credit for the tax relief, some in 
Minnesota's political mix say it is too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little like a 500-pound man bragging about losing 25  
pounds,'' said Darrell McKigney, president of the League of 
Minnesota Taxpayers, a conservative interest group. ``We're still 
grossly over-taxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California, the most populous state, is returning about a  
half-billion dollars in tax cuts -- about the same as Texas, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only seven states raised taxes, according to the analysis. They  
are: Arkansas, Illinois, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, 
South Dakota and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Liverpool Rocker Johnny Byrne Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- Johnny Byrne, a guitarist who was  
briefly teamed with Ringo Starr in a band called Rory Storm and the 
Hurricanes, has died at age 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne, who used the stage name of Johnny Guitar, died Wednesday  
after collapsing at his home, the Liverpool Echo newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Rory Storm and the Hurricanes was one of Liverpool's most  
popular bands in the years before Beatlemania, but unlike a host of 
other Merseyside bands, it never had a record on the British hit 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne and Alan Caldwell, who took the stage name of Rory Storm,  
started playing together in 1957 in a skiffle band called The 
Raving Texans, which combined elements of jazz, blues, country and 
folk. The group became the Hurricanes in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	With Starr on drums, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes played at the  
Kaiserkeller in Hamburg, Germany, in late 1960, getting star 
billing over The Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr joined The Beatles in 1962.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even without the financial rewards of a hit record we seemed  
to have it all at the time,'' Byrne said in 1990. ``While most of 
the other bands were struggling from hand to mouth we had plenty of 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes continued performing until 1967. Caldwell died in  
1972, and Byrne went to work as an ambulance driver the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Information on survivors was not immediately available, and  
funeral arrangements were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Larger A&AMP;M Records Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge cleared the way for A&AMP;M Records  
founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss to boost the amount they are 
seeking in their lawsuit against PolyGram from $5.6 million to $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In their original lawsuit, trumpeter Alpert and his partner  
claimed PolyGram shorted them $3.63 million in 1994 earnings and $2 
million in a mishandled Canadian tax refund claim. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to increasing the damages sought, the pair also  
added Universal Music as a defendant. PolyGram bought A&AMP;M Records 
in 1989, but was acquired by Seagram Co.'s Universal Music last 
year. A&AMP;M has since become a part of Interscope/Geffen/A&AMP;M Records. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised lawsuit claimed Universal executives destroyed A&AMP;M  
Records following Universal Music Group's $10.4 billion acquisition 
of Polygram. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Music spokesman Bob Bernstein had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Beryllium Advocate Dies at 58 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Galen Lemke, a former weapons plant worker  
who became a leading advocate for victims of beryllium disease, 
died Wednesday after a long battle with the illness. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke spent nine years making weapons parts, and a year later  
was diagnosed with the lung illness. He spent the past 15 years on 
an oxygen tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The often fatal disease, which can be treated but has no cure,  
results from exposure to dust from the metal beryllium. The metal 
is a hard, yet lightweight substance used to make nuclear weapons, 
electronics, auto parts and golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,200 workers have contracted the disease since the  
1940s, including 53 current and former Brush Wellman Inc. workers 
at the company's Elmore plant just outside Toledo, where Lemke 
worked. It is the nation's largest beryllium plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke struggled for years to raise awareness about the disease,  
and his letter campaign led to an investigation by The Blade, which 
in March published a series of stories that said government and 
industry officials knew for years about the dangers of beryllium 
but allowed workers to be exposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the federal government for the first time acknowledged  
that workers were made sick from beryllium while making nuclear 
weapons and announced a plan to compensate many of them for medical 
care and lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke is survived by his wife, Betty; a daughter and a son.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Weakened by Weaker Dollar / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks sagged Thursday as a weakening dollar  
pushed bonds lower and gave investors another reason to sell ahead 
of next week's expected interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.54 to 10,963.84 after  
having dropped as much as 118 points in earlier trading, and after 
losing 125.70 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 9.25 to 1,323.59, and the  
Nasdaq composite dropped 36.30 to 2,621.43. 
</P>
<P>
	A government report that the U.S. trade deficit was wider than  
expected in June undercut the slumping dollar, which fell to its 
lowest level against the Japanese yen since January. The $24.6 
billion deficit was 16 percent larger than the shortfall in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker dollar increases the costs of imported goods, adding to  
inflation, and it can hurt stocks because it makes U.S. securities 
less appealing to foreign investors. Amid the worries about next 
Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates, the trade 
report and its effect on the dollar made traders pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 'pick something to worry about' kind of day, and today  
it's the weak dollar,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jeffries &AMP; Co. He said concerns about inflation and interest rates 
will ease after the Fed meeting, when the central bank is widely 
expected to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors then will turn their attention to whether the Fed will  
leave rates alone for the rest of the year. Supporting that notion 
are several recent government reports that show inflation under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's trade news also put pressure on bonds, lifting yields  
of 30-year Treasurys to 6.03 percent from 6 percent late Wednesday, 
and that added to the discontent on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, down 1 11/16 to 65 3/16, helped push the Dow lower after  
the aluminum company reached an agreement to buy rival Reynolds 
Metals for $4.34 billion in stock. Reynolds fell 2 11/16 to 65 
9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were hardest hit Thursday, as they are most  
sensitive to interest rate fluctuations because of their high 
valuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks sent the Nasdaq composite index sharply lower  
after a short-run up earlier this week. Internet search engine 
Yahoo! slipped 5 7/8 to 139 3/16, online bookseller Amazon.com dropped 
7 to 106 1/8, and online auctioneer eBay fell 12 3/16 to 113 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market lacks any conviction,'' said Richard E. Cripps,  
chief market strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore. ``The weaker 
dollar gave people a reason to sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where the volume of all NYSE-listed shares 
totaled 815.36 million shares, compared to 831.19 million shares in 
the previous session. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Soccer Tournament To Celebrate U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- To celebrate the U.N. International Day of  
Peace, several countries have joined voluntary groups and the city 
of New York to organize a mammoth soccer tournament on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, once the home  
of the United Nations, will feature 64 teams from the New York 
metropolitan area representing countries, ethnic groups and soccer 
lovers from around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially this is a festival,'' said Howard Rubenstein of  
the Eastern New York Soccer Association, ``We're not concerned 
about winners and losers. Everyone is a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City sports commissioner Ken Podziba said during a news  
conference Thursday that the tournament was ``one of the greatest 
ways to unify people from different backgrounds and political 
ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes us aware of how similar we all really are. And we're  
very proud that this event will be held in New York City -- the most 
international city in the world, and the home of the United 
Nations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Podziba read a letter from New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani who  
said the tournament underscored ``how peace and unity can be 
achieved through sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer is truly an ethnically diverse sport that is played and  
enjoyed worldwide,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grenada's U.N. Ambassador, Lamuel Stanislaus, echoed the mayor,  
saying sport provides one of the best opportunities ``to attain the 
universal goal of brotherhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations, people says peace is equivalent to  
economic development, Stanislaus said, but he proposed a new saying 
-- ``that peace is equivalent to sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costa Rica's deputy U.N. Ambassador, Emilia Castro de Barish,  
said the tournament would promote the U.N. International Day of 
Peace which was proposed by her country in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	It is observed on the opening day of the General Assembly  
debate, which this year is Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer competition is being called the September Debate  
Friendship Cup in honor of the General Assembly debate, which is 
expected to bring dozens of world leaders to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Dupiton, of the coalition of voluntary groups helping to  
organize the tournament, said the variety of teams will show the 
leaders of the General Assembly that ``people out there in the 
streets are communicating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While organizers say they expect teams from Latin America, the  
Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Africa and the United States to 
participate, they stress that participation is open to everyone -- 
and also hope to have some women's soccer teams on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is free, Rubinstein said. ``We would love to see  
thousands of people coming, watching these games on the various 
fields. It will be a great festive occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said anyone wanting to participate should call  
212-252-4261 for English speakers and 212-726-3155 for Spanish 
speakers.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Ford SUV Wiper Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency said Thursday it is  
investigating complaints of windshield wiper failures on some late 
model sport utility vehicles made by Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	There are nearly 1.5 million of the 1997-99 Ford Explorers and  
Mercury Mountaineers on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Agency, in a monthly report,  
said it was investigating 35 complaints from consumers asserting 
the windshield wipers malfunctioned in inclement weather. Either 
the wipers stopped, worked intermittently, or operated even though 
they were shut off, the consumers complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford is aware of the investigation and we're cooperating fully  
with NHTSA,'' said spokesman Mike Vaughn in Dearborn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the consumers said they crashed because of wiper  
failures. However, the report said: ``Wipers are a critical 
automotive safety system without which a vehicle operator is unable 
to adequately see the road surface and other vehicles during 
precipitation. This inability to see could result in a crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is investigating 31 complaints that the plastic  
fuel tanks are cracking and leaking on some older model Ford 
Windstar minivans. No fires were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The minivans are from model years 1995 through 1997. More than  
700,000 Windstars were manufactured during those years. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is looking at whether the rate of air bag deaths  
in Hyundai Accent cars is too high, the report said. That 
investigation was announced last month, but the report included 
more details. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA has identified five child deaths that may have been caused  
by deployment of front passenger air bags in minor to moderate 
crashes. About 136,000 Accents are under investigation from the 
1995 through 1997 model years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai spokesman Chris Hosford, in Fountain Valley, Calif.,  
said, ``We don't feel the design of the vehicle had any affect on 
the unfortunate deaths of the individuals that NHTSA is 
investigating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said none of the five were using seat belts or child  
restraints. ``Without a seat belt, individuals are often not 
positioned to benefit from an air bag,'' Hosford said. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry  
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork 
including any complaints, as in the Hyundai air bag and Ford 
windshield wiper cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation then could be upgraded to an engineering  
analysis, during which engineers study parts to see if they are 
defective, as in the Ford fuel tank case. An investigation 
eventually can lead to a recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also upgraded an investigation into General Motors  
Blazer, Jimmy and Bravada four-wheel drive SUVs from the 1996 model 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 79 consumer complaints about the front suspension  
collapsing. No crashes were reported. There were nearly 2,700 
warranty claims for ball joint failures on the vehicles, which can 
result in the front suspension collapsing.

<HEADLINE> Japan Bank Giants Might Team Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In what analysts said could be the start of a new  
series of shakeups in Japan's financial industry, three of the 
country's top banks said Thursday they are considering an alliance 
that would create the world's largest banking group. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and  
Fuji Bank Ltd. each confirmed they are considering a three-way 
combination. News reports said the banks are expected to formally 
announce the deal this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's financial industry has seen big changes in recent years  
since the government embarked on its ``Big Bang'' package of 
deregulation measures aimed at making Tokyo a financial center on a 
par with London and New York by opening it up to greater 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition has intensified and what was once unthinkable -- that  
financial institutions could fail if they don't measure up -- is 
more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks refused to say what form their alliance might take,  
but Japan's leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 
reported they had sealed a deal to create a joint holding company 
as early as the fall of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That structure would allow the banks to put their retail  
banking, investment banking and brokerage subsidiaries under common 
management and cut costs by combining overlapping businesses, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets at the three banks exceed $1.2 trillion, which would make  
the new entity the largest banking group in the world. Their assets 
would surpass the $735.3 billion of Germany's Deutsche Bank and the 
$652 billion of Japan's largest bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts welcomed the alliance as a a step toward making Japan's  
bloated banking industry more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``It points the banking industry in the right direction,'' said  
Koyo Ozeki, a bank analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``This is a step 
forward toward a major structural shake-up among Japan's city 
banks, and it will spur others to make similar deals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ozeki and others warned that the success of the deal would  
depend largely on how serious the three banks are about cutting 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``How the banks can raise their efficiency is the key,'' said  
Setsuko Akiba, an analyst at Deutsche Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance would pool the companies' respective strengths --  
investment banking for IBJ and retail banking for Fuji and DKB. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities business at the three banks will be integrated, while  
affiliate second-tier and smaller brokerages may be reorganized, 
the Nihon Keizai article said. 
</P>
<P>
	DKB and Fuji Bank already have a joint-venture trust bank.  
</P>
<P>
	News of the alliance sent the banks' stock prices shooting  
higher before trading in them was suspended shortly before the end 
of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank shares finished up 11 percent at the  
equivalent of $8.12 a share, while IBJ rose 11 percent to $8.79 and 
Fuji Bank rose 12 percent to 89 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Backs Out of Redistricting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The fight over the boundaries and  
racial makeup of eight Florida congressional districts isn't over. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Bob Butterworth said Wednesday that his office  
is withdrawing from a deal intended to settle a federal lawsuit 
challenging the districts as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush mistakenly believed the deal had the support of  
all the parties involved, Butterworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we learn that's not true, and we're not happy,'' said  
Deputy Attorney General Richard Doran. 
</P>
<P>
	The state on Monday said it had reached a deal with Tom Fouts,  
whose lawsuit claims the drawing of the districts along racial and 
ethnic lines was unconstitutional. Fouts, a white man, earlier lost 
a bid for a state Senate seat held by a black incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the settlement, Fouts was to drop his  
challenge and the state was to redraw the districts, subject to 
approval by a panel of federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would have changed the boundaries of seats now held by  
two black Democrats -- Alcee Hastings and Carrie Meek -- and a 
Hispanic Republican, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, along with five 
neighboring districts. 
</P>
<P>
	However, critics said the settlement would have reduced the  
number of black and Hispanic voters in some of the districts. 
Democrats accused Republicans of cutting a ``backroom deal'' to 
make it harder for blacks to get elected; Bush is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	David Paul Horan, who represents Fouts, said no one was misled  
about the settlement plan. He suggested it would be naive to 
believe Meek, Hastings or organizations such as the NAACP would 
accept the settlement without complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings' district was one of three designed to give black  
voters a better opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice 
when it was drawn by a panel of federal judges in 1992. That year, 
Florida elected its first blacks to Congress since Reconstruction: 
Corrine Brown, Meek and Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has since ruled that race cannot be the  
predominant factor in drawing political boundaries, forcing changes 
in congressional and legislative districts across the country.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Redistricting Plan Falls Apart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A plan to redraw South Florida  
congressional districts due to a lawsuit claiming the boundaries 
were designed to safeguard minority seats fell apart when Gov. Jeb 
Bush dropped his support. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including a black Democrat whose district would be  
redrawn and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People, said the plan would have reduced the chances for blacks and 
Hispanics to get elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been told there was a basis of agreement,'' Bush said  
Thursday. ``And if there's not, we'll just have to go back to the 
drawing board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office said it will now concentrate  
on fighting the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday the state said it had reached a deal with Tom Fouts,  
whose lawsuit claims the drawing of the districts along racial and 
ethnic lines was unconstitutional. Fouts, a white man, earlier lost 
a bid for a state Senate seat held by a black incumbent.

<P>
	News of the settlement set off a firestorm, with Democrats  
accusing Republicans of cutting a back room deal to make it harder 
for blacks to get elected. Bush is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	But the governor and the attorney general were told there was an  
agreement among the parties involved, said Deputy Attorney General 
Richard Doran. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our clients were misled,'' wrote Gerald Curington, an  
assistant deputy attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's chief of staff, Sally Bradshaw, said the governor's  
office found out that there was disagreement by reading it in the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer David Paul Horan, who represents Fouts, said no one was  
misled about who agreed to the proposal. He said it would be naive 
to believe Meek, Hastings or organizations such as the NAACP would 
accept the settlement without complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody that's got a lick of sense would never believe that  
people who were running in racially gerrymandered districts would 
be totally happy with not running in illegally racially 
gerrymandered districts,'' Horan said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian man has been charged with  
possessing explosives and soliciting an American citizen to bomb 
energy facilities in Canada and the United States, U.S. officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested and charged  
50-year-old Alfred Heinz Reumayr on Wednesday after an 18-month 
investigation by the Mounties and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, the American agency said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this investigation, no explosive devices were completed  
and the public was never in danger,'' the agency said in the 
release. The FBI and the Customs Service also joined in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms obtained a federal  
arrest warrant for Reumayr from a federal court in New Mexico 
accusing him of unlawful possession of explosives. The 
investigation is still under way.

<HEADLINE> Panel To Study Trade Deficits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blue-ribbon congressional committees don't  
normally have their own songs, but the new U.S. Trade Deficit 
Review Commission would be completely justified in adopting the 
theme music from ``Mission: Impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member panel, split evenly between members appointed by  
Democrats and Republicans, opened its public hearings today with 
the unenviable task of finding common ground on U.S. trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Congress wants the commission to come up with  
answers to three questions: 
</P>
<P>
	What causes America's trade deficits?  
</P>
<P>
	What harm, if any, do they do?  
</P>
<P>
	What policy changes can be made to narrow the deficits?  
</P>
<P>
	The commission began that task with a string of expert witnesses  
describing what has caused the trade deficit to soar over the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Mann, an economist at the Institute for International  
Economics in Washington, said the deficit surge primarily reflected 
the fact that the U.S. economy, led by strong consumer demand, has 
continued to do well while the rest of the world has struggled with 
the impact of the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical spending is robust, the rest of the world is growing  
slowly and this is why the ... deficit has continued to widen,'' 
she told the commission members. ``For the time being, the United 
States is an oasis of prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's first public hearings came on a day when the  
government reported that the trade deficit had surged to a monthly 
record in June. The panel of experts assembled by Congress finds 
itself in the middle of a raging debate. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side, ardent free traders argue that America's prosperous  
times with unemployment at the lowest level in three decades show 
that the trade deficits are not harmful. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side are protectionist forces, led by labor unions,  
who contend that the overall prosperity masks serious pain 
inflicted on thousands of Americans who have seen their jobs go 
overseas while countries such as Japan and China keep their markets 
closed to American goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Reconciling those two positions would appear daunting, but  
commission Chairman Murray Weidenbaum insists it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go in with a united determination that we are not going to  
issue two separate reports. That would be the easiest way out, but 
not very helpful,'' said Weidenbaum, an economist at Washington 
University who served in the Reagan administration as chairman of 
the Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new commission plans at least four hearings in cities around  
the country over the next year before issuing its final report. It 
brings an assortment of views to its task with members ranging from 
George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers union, to Carla 
Hills, chief trade negotiator in the Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Clinton ran for office in 1992 as a centrist new  
Democrat, he has seen his own trade agenda held hostage for more 
than two years now by members of his own party in the House who 
have refused to give him the votes he needs to negotiate new global 
trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Republicans, who traditionally back free trade because of  
its business constituency, have seen a growing divide. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's working men and women are being sacrificed to the  
global economy,'' complains Republican presidential candidate Pat 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States last enjoyed a trade surplus in goods and  
services in 1975, but the deficits recently have been skyrocketing 
as the Asian economic crisis has dried up overseas markets for 
American manufacturers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's deficit hit an all-time high of $164.3 billion. The  
government reported today that the June deficit surged by an 
unexpectedly large 16.3 percent, setting a monthly record of $24.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, the trade deficit is  
running at an annual rate of $236 billion, a whopping 44 percent 
higher than last year's record. This deterioration has made 
politicians take notice even in the midst of the economy's overall 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has become deeply fragmented on trade policy,'' said  
Greg Mastel, an economist at the National Policy Center, a 
Washington think tank. ``The consensus that kept trade policy 
moving in the same direction since World War II has really begun to 
erode.''

<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie quarterback Akili Smith has missed so much of  
Cincinnati's training camp in his contract holdout that he is 
unlikely to be of much use this season, Bengals quarterback Jeff 
Blake says. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, Cincinnati's top draft choice, would be Blake's backup if  
he signs. But he is missing practice time needed to learn the 
Bengals' offense, Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me two years to learn this offense,'' said Blake, a  
Pro Bowl starter after his 1995 season with Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could come in and play, but I don't think he could be  
productive,'' Blake said of Smith. ``He could get by on athletic 
ability, but that will only take you so far ... That's why they 
have training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals have failed in their latest effort to sign Smith,  
the former Oregon star. 
</P>
<P>
	Management and Smith's agent, Leigh Steinberg, are at odds over  
how Smith would earn his money. The Bengals say they have offered a 
six-year deal for nearly $45 million. Under that proposal, Smith 
would average $4.7 million per year for six years if he 
participates in 55 percent of the plays and, as the contract 
progresses, has thrown for 2,500 yards in two of the three prior 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals president Mike Brown said Smith's side doesn't like the  
performance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``They find that absurd, and we find that more absurd that they  
look at it like that,'' Brown said. ``They want us to give 
everything to their guy. We want him to earn some of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said he had sent a series of proposals to the Bengals  
in an attempt to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have reportedly agreed on a $10.8 million signing  
bonus and the total money. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	The two-time defending Super Bowl champion Broncos closed out  
training camp with a golf competition, as coach Mike Shanahan said 
the camp was one of the most competitive he had experienced with 
the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Chris Miller didn't practice and is still  
bothered by tendinitis in his right elbow that forced him out of 
last Saturday's exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson says he's in no hurry for Dimitrius Underwood to  
join the Dolphins. The rookie defensive end, waived by Minnesota 
after saying he preferred a religious calling to football, is 
willing to meet with Johnson but also is not rushing to get back on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th overall pick in April's draft, was claimed  
Monday off waivers by the Dolphins. Johnson talked with him for the 
first time Tuesday and predicted the rookie will eventually join 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Redskins    	
</P>
<P>
	Redskins coach Norv Turner said he plans to play his starters  
well into the third quarter of Washington's exhibition matchup with 
Buffalo on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner played most of his starters for an entire half in last  
week's 20-14 victory at New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said his decision is due to the need to build continuity  
after many offseason lineup changes. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	The window of opportunity is narrowing on Jeff Lewis' bid to  
unseat Steve Beuerlein as the Panthers' starting quarterback for 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest chance yet for Lewis comes Friday night when the  
Panthers meet Pittsburgh in a home exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Beuerlein, 34, was one of the NFL's most accurate passers last  
season and has looked sharp again in training camp, but Lewis, 26, 
has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Steve McNair will not start Friday when the Titans play an  
exhibition game at Arizona, coach Jeff Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has not practiced since Sunday's exhibition loss to  
Kansas City because of back spasms. He is expected back in the 
lineup Aug. 27 when Tennessee plays Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil O'Donnell, a 10-year veteran, will start in McNair's  
place. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	The Colts closed their training camp with veteran Jay  
Leeuwenberg unhappy over a demotion to a backup role on the 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking it very well at all,'' Leeuwenberg said. ``I'm  
going to do everything in my power to change the decision between 
now and the start of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenberg has started 37 consecutive games for the Colts, the  
team's second-longest streak. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	With the retirement of Barry Sanders, Lions coach Bobby Ross  
said fans can expect the team to think pass first and try to 
complement it with the run. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit's 35-31 loss at Atlanta, quarterback Charlie Batch  
was 11-of-16 for 146 yards and a touchdown while backup Gus 
Frerotte was 15-of-21 for 171 yards and a touchdown. The Lions 
rushed for 113 yards. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	With backup quarterback Kerry Collins nursing a sprained foot,  
Giants' third-stringer Mike Cherry may get an unexpected chance to 
put as many points as he can on the scoreboard Saturday night when 
the Giants host Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The game plan has Kent Graham starting and playing the first  
half. Cherry is scheduled to play in the second, if Collins can't 
go. Cherry has been the Giants' No. 3 quarterback for the past two 
seasons.

<HEADLINE> Satellites Measuring Wash. Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Monument stands a bit taller  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of government scientists climbed to the top of the giant  
stone spire Wednesday and used the latest in satellite technology 
to take its measure -- 555-feet-5.9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Thats four-tenths of an inch more than had previously been  
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument was last measured 65 years ago by government  
surveyors. Scaffolding in place for a renovation of the spire gave 
researchers the opportunity to reach the top and take new 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	The team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration's National Geodetic Survey took several measurements 
during their visit to the apex and will report final, detailed 
figures in a week or so, NOAA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Engineers will also use this information to monitor the  
monument's stability, measuring any shifting, settling, or other 
movement of the structure. The same precise positioning 
capabilities used in this project are essential for a wide range of 
survey work, navigation, and the operation of safe, reliable 
transportation and communications systems,'' NOAA Administrator D. 
James Baker said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The geodesists used state-of-the-art Global Positioning System  
receivers and other specialized gear to take hundreds of 
measurements at the top of the monument and at several other nearby 
Washington landmarks. Geodesy is the science of measuring the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The last official geodetic measurements from the top of the  
Washington Monument were made in 1934 by the U.S. Coast and 
Geodetic Survey, the National Geodetic Survey's predecessor agency. 
At that time, manual observations were made with instruments such 
as theodolites, spirit levels and leveling rods. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven manufacturers of GPS receivers provided equipment for the  
new measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	Such precise measurements are part of the Geodetic's Survey's  
National Spatial Reference System, which is the foundation for all 
types of surveys and allows government, industry and researchers to 
measure the position of objects in three-dimensional space.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos National Lab at a Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Los Alamos National Laboratory in brief.  
</P>
<P>
	LOCATION: Covers 43 square miles near Los Alamos, N.M., 35 miles  
northwest of Santa Fe., on the Pajarito Plateau, elevation 7,600 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	HISTORY: Established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project to  
design and build the world's first atomic bomb. Selected by 
physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer because of its remoteness and 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	MANAGEMENT: One of three government nuclear weapons labs under  
the Energy Department. Managed by the University of California 
since 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	BUDGET: $1.26 billion a year with 60 percent going for nuclear  
weapons programs, the rest for multidisciplinary unclassified 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	WORKFORCE: 7,130 regular employees, including about 4,000  
scientists and engineers with advanced degrees. About 450 foreign 
researchers also work in non-classified research, including 93 
researchers from China. 
</P>
<P>
	DEFENSE MISSION: Historically to design, develop and test  
American's nuclear warheads, including the W-88 warhead on missiles 
aboard Trident submarines. No new weapons being developed. Key 
defense mission now is to maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile 
through sophisticated computer modeling instead of actual bomb 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	NONDEFENSE MISSION: Multidisciplinary research into broad range  
of areas including environmental cleanup, alternative energy 
sources, biomedical sciences and basic sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	CHINA-SPYING: The focus of a security and espionage controversy  
stemming from the apparent loss of nuclear warhead secrets to China 
in the 1980s. A Los Alamos scientist was fired in March after being 
suspected since 1996 of having given China nuclear secrets. The 
scientist has not been charged, but the controversy has unleashed 
calls in Congress for security improvements at all weapons labs, 
and disciplinary action against three Los Alamos officials 
including the lab's former director.

	Quotes from Texas Gov. George W. Bush in response to questions  
Wednesday and Thursday about any illegal drug use in his past: 

</P>
<P>
	``Somebody floats a rumor and it causes you to ask a question,  
and that's the game in American politics, and I refuse to play it. 
That is a game. You just fell for the trap. I refuse to play. 
They're ridiculous and they're absurd, and the people of America 
are sick and tired of this kind of politics. And I'm not 
participating.'' -- At a news conference Wednesday morning.

<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I made some mistakes years ago, but I learned from my  
mistakes.'' -- At a news conference Wednesday afternoon in Baton 
Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As I understand it, the current form asks the question, 'Did  
somebody use drugs within the last seven years?' and I will be glad 
to answer that question, and the answer is 'No.''' -- As quoted by 
The Dallas Morning News Thursday when asked about the requirement 
that federal employees answer questions about drug use to get 
high-level security clearances. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	``Yesterday, I was asked what I thought was a relevant comment  
about -- about whether or not I would, should I become the 
president, have background checks for people who work for me and in 
the White House, and, if I did, could I pass the standards of the 
background check. The answer is absolutely. Not only could I pass 
the background check of the standards applied in today's White 
House, I could have passed the background check on the standards 
applied on the most stringent conditions when my dad was president 
of the United States, a 15-year period. -- At a Roanoke, Va., news

<HEADLINE> Utah Man Admits Bombing Fur Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An animal-rights activist has admitted to  
federal charges in the 1997 bombing of a fur farm office that 
caused nearly $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton Ellerman, 22, pleaded guilty Thursday to one count of  
making a firearm and two counts of maliciously damaging property 
with an explosive in the bombing of the Fur Breeders Cooperative in 
Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
	Five pipe bombs -- some laced with nails -- exploded and a fire  
was set in the business offices in the attack. There were no 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellerman told U.S. District Judge Thomas Greene he was recruited  
to build the pipe bombs by his younger brother, Douglas Ellerman, 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Ellerman pleaded guilty last year to helping plant  
the bombs. He was sentenced to seven years and two months in prison 
and ordered to pay $750,000 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim a total of six suspects planted pipe bombs in  
four company trucks and its offices. All of the suspects have links 
to the Animal Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fur Breeders Cooperative is one of the country's largest and  
provides mink to hundreds of farmers in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Ellerman faces a 30-year prison sentence, but could  
receive leniency for his cooperation in the prosecution of others 
allegedly involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was set for Nov. 16. Trial for the other defendants  
is scheduled to begin Aug. 30.

<HEADLINE> One Definition of Desperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Everybody has their own definition of desperation.  
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago, when Bill Walsh was wrapping up his tenure as  
coach of the San Francisco 49ers, it might have been calling three 
running plays in a row. Now that he's back by the Bay as vice 
president-general manager, desperate might be interpreted as 
letting Lawrence Phillips carry the ball even once. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it doesn't work out,'' Walsh said on the eve of Phillips'  
return to the NFL in Thursday night's exhibition against Seattle, 
``we'll just move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why this go-round will be different from the others,  
Phillips had a ready answer: ``I've shed 30 pounds. I'm a lot 
faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only it were that easy to run away from his past.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has a rap sheet long enough to print out and use for a  
first-down marker. He has tripped up every coach he played for, and 
ruined a few reputations in the bargain. But he remains that rare 
blend of problem and potential that persuades even smart men like 
Walsh to make risky decisions over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	The first to do so was coach Tom Osborne at Nebraska, where in  
1995, Phillips wound up being charged with trespassing and assault 
following a brutal attack on an ex-girlfriend. Osborne suspended 
Phillips in the wake of the Cornhuskers' first national 
championship, but brought him back in plenty of time to play for 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
	It cost the coach in ways he never completely grasped. Suddenly  
his reputation went from a coach who couldn't win the big one to 
coach who had to win at all costs. Osborne was only doing what he 
always did -- trying to save every kid he thought he could. But to 
all the people who started paying attention to the little duchy 
Osborne had carved out in Lincoln, Neb., it looked like he was 
interested only in saving kids who could run 40 yards in the blink 
of an eye and bench-press 500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A season after that, looking much older for the wear, Osborne  
walked away from coaching. ``I think it's wise to back off before 
you leave feet first,'' he said, ``or somebody tells you it's time 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who grew up in a group home in West Covina, Calif.,  
had no trouble finding another father figure to take him on. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Rams owner Georgia Frontiere made him the sixth pick  
in the April 1996 draft and the chore eventually fell to coach Dick 
Vermeil. The bulk of Vermeil's work with Phillips would consist of 
bailing him out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after the draft, Phillips was charged with driving  
under the influence. After an uneventful rookie season -- on and off 
the field -- he was charged with property damage and leaving the 
scene of an accident in St. Louis. Then he was arrested for 
disorderly conduct in Omaha. Soon after that, he spent three more 
weeks in jail because the drunken driving charge violated the terms 
of his probation on the original assault charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams brought in veteran running back Craig ``Ironhead''  
Heyward to serve as a kind of big brother. Heyward had fought his 
own battles with alcohol, and he found Phillips almost as daunting. 
But just about the time Heyward thought he was making progress, 
Vermeil was making plans to ship his reclamation project out of 
town. ``He needs a fresh start,'' the coach wearily admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not long in coming. Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson  
welcomed Phillips with open arms two weeks later. He started out 
fumbling the ball, then fumbled away his chances of hanging onto a 
job when a woman accused him of punching her. He pleaded no contest 
and soon after, so did the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you look at the entire picture and how he fit  
here with the Dolphins,'' Johnson said without saying much, 
``that's why we released him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was the feel-good portion of the story. At 23,  
Phillips got himself hired by the Barcelona Dragons of NFL Europe. 
Unbroken, he proved an effective running back one more time -- the 
first runner in the league's outpost to rush for 1,000 yards. 
Unsupervised, Phillips became like a model citizen, or so coach 
Jack Bicknell told anyone who would listen. 
</P>
<P>
	The sympathetic ear this time belonged to Walsh, whose team,  
coincidentally, had lost running back Garrison Heart. Whatever 
concerns he had going in, Walsh found that by turning the pieces 
this way and that, the puzzle seemed to fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people in San Francisco howled when the signing was  
announced. Some people in New York did the same when the Knicks 
signed Latrell Sprewell. They are not howling now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to make a calculated judgment,'' Walsh said.  
</P>
<P>
	And what it comes down to is this: Very nice men very rarely  
make good football players. If anything, the opposite tends to be 
true. If Phillips can't play, he simply gets thrown back on the 
scrap heap. But if he can -- and Walsh is as shrewd a judge of 
talent as anyone -- then all those questions about whether Phillips 
should be playing in the first place will be forgotten soon 
enough, 
</P>

<HEADLINE> COLLEGE FOOTBALL '99: Big 12 Preview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas A&AMP;M may finally give the old Southwest  
Conference braggin' rights in the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Aggies and Texas Longhorns have won two of their  
new league's three championships, they've done it by upsetting 
Nebraska and Kansas State in one December game. From August to 
November and again in January, the former Big Eight schools have 
led the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be changed this year by an A&AMP;M squad with a solid  
offense, a powerful defense and the confidence to take on any 
program in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we come up with a solid passing game,'' quarterback Randy  
McCown said, ``the sky is the limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 Aggies return eight players on each side of the ball  
from a team that went 11-3 and lost to only Florida State, Texas 
(on the day Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams broke Tony 
Dorsett's NCAA rushing record) and Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, folks around College Station believe they can return to the  
Sugar Bowl -- only this time it would be to play for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should be everyone's ultimate goal,'' linebacker  
Cornelius Anthony said. ``But we must take care of the little 
things first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach R.C. Slocum's biggest challenge is replacing Lombardi  
Award-winning linebacker Dat Nguyen, the school's all-time leading 
tackler. 
</P>
<P>
	While several guys will share his duties on the field, McCown  
already has taken over as the team's leader by organizing summer 
practices and running them as Slocum would. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to have an air of confidence knowing he's the guy,''  
Slocum said. ``His spring practice was a notch above. He's making 
plays and looking poised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If A&AMP;M passes major tests on Nov. 6 in Nebraska and the day  
after Thanksgiving at home against Texas, the Aggies could finish 
the season as the highest-ranked Big 12 team. The last South 
division school to do that was A&AMP;M in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for No. 17 Texas is getting quarterback Major  
Applewhite to play as well as a sophomore as he did as a freshman, 
only this time without Williams softening defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Applewhite slip, second-year coach Mack Brown could turn  
to freshman Chris Simms, the son of former New York Giants star 
Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky took so much pressure off everyone else,'' said  
Applewhite, who passed for 2,453 yards and 18 touchdowns with 11 
interceptions and was named Big 12 freshman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of Ricky Williams, don't be surprised if he is once  
again the conference's best offensive player. Only this time, the 
award will have to be mailed to Lubbock instead of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Raiders running back with the same name as the former  
Longhorn had 1,582 yards as a sophomore last season. Although he's 
smaller than the other Williams, he's just as durable and nearly as 
difficult to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admire him for a lot of the things he did,'' the Tech star  
said of the Texas-ex. ``He helped me make a name for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the North, the winner will be the team that best bounces from  
turmoil -- No. 6 Nebraska, No. 20 Kansas State or No. 15 Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornhuskers went 9-4 last year, horrible by their standards.  
Nebraska hadn't had four losses since 1968, giving coach Frank 
Solich one more defeat in his first season than predecessor Tom 
Osborne had in his final five. 
</P>
<P>
	Solich believes his rookie record was a fluke, not the beginning  
of a trend. The health and success of quarterback Bobby Newcombe 
could determine that, as will a Nov. 13 home game against Kansas 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to show everyone in the country that we're still  
the same Nebraska team,'' said senior defensive back Mike Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats ended a 29-year losing streak to the Cornhuskers  
last season and broke Nebraska's two-year grip on the North title. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State was within minutes of playing for the national  
title, but lost to A&AMP;M in double overtime of the Big 12 
championship, got frozen out of the major bowls and lost to 
unranked Purdue in the Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats will be strong again, but things won't be the same  
without Michael Bishop at quarterback. He's one of eight offensive 
starters coach Bill Snyder must replace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have faith in the youngsters we have,'' Snyder said.  
</P>
<P>
	Injuries and a running game that was 88th in the country sunk  
Colorado to 4-4 in league play last year. Then, late in the 
recruiting season, coach Rick Neuheisel bolted for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffaloes answered by luring former assistant Gary Barnett  
back from Northwestern. Hopes are high that Barnett, a master 
motivator, will fulfill the high expectations Neuheisel set but 
seldom met. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be as good and as physical as any team in the  
conference,'' Barnett said. ``I want us to have that confidence. I 
don't think we quite see ourselves that way yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett is among three new coaches in the league, but the only  
one with head coaching experience. However, like Barnett, 
Oklahoma's Bob Stoops and Baylor's Kevin Steele also have strong 
Big 12 ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoops worked for Snyder for six years before spending the last  
three as Florida's defensive coordinator. His associate head coach 
is his younger brother Mike, Kansas State's defensive coordinator 
the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele spent six years at Nebraska under Osborne and was at  
Oklahoma State for three years in the mid-1980s. He was the 
linebackers coach with the NFL's Carolina Panthers the last four 
years; you might remember him as the coach attacked by Kevin Greene 
on the sidelines last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new coaches always get boosters fired up, outsiders  
also see Stoops and Steele as the right guys to end the coaching 
carousels at both schools. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other extreme are Terry Allen at Kansas and Dan McCarney  
at Iowa State, two guys whose honeymoons are over and must start 
producing. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa State has matched Baylor at 1-7 in league play three years  
running. Kansas also was 1-7 last year, although the Jayhawks were 
close to winning four more. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State is counting on seven senior starters on offense  
and seven on defense to help rebound from a six-loss season that 
included four defeats to ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
	At Missouri, coach Larry Smith is trying to keep alive the  
momentum of the Tigers' first consecutive winning seasons since 
1982-83. But it won't be easy without quarterback Corby Jones and 
running back Devin West.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Parole Official Admits Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former parole official has admitted lying to  
investigators who are trying to determine whether the office of 
Gov. George Pataki sought the early release of a convicted armed 
robber in exchange for a campaign contribution from the inmate's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	The admission came this week as part of a probe by the U.S.  
attorney's office into the fund-raising for Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Hotaling told a federal magistrate on Monday that he was  
``instructed to communicate the interest of the governor's office'' 
in the release of inmate John Kim. He said he relayed the message 
to the lead parole commissioner on the case, Sean McSherry, and 
another commissioner, and Kim was paroled. Prosecutors say Kim's 
family and friends gave thousands of dollars to Pataki's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotaling pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the instructions came from the ``head of the agency,''  
but he did not name that person. The Division of Parole is chaired 
by Pataki appointee Brion Travis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it is not an everyday occurrence that the  
governor's office takes an interest in a case,'' said Hotaling, a 
27-year veteran of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had withheld information from investigators because,  
``I was scared to death about what they were saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Grant, a Board of Parole spokesman, denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Hotaling, 52, is the second person to be convicted in an ongoing  
grand jury investigation of possible influence peddling in parole 
cases. Earlier this month, a jury found McSherry guilty of lying to 
the grand jury to protect himself and the Pataki administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, the truth will come out that the individuals  
involved in this case and this administration handled themselves 
with complete propriety,'' Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said 
after Hotaling's plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotaling faces a maximum of four months in jail under federal  
sentencing guidelines; no sentencing date was set.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reviews on NFL Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After attending a three-day NFL seminar, Fox's Bill Maas was  
convinced the league's new instant replay system would be 
successful. After watching his first game, however, he's not so 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Maas worked the Tennessee-Kansas City preseason game Sunday as a  
TV analyst for a local Kansas City station. The first replay 
opportunity came in the second quarter when Titans coach Jeff 
Fisher appealed an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem? The computerized system didn't work, and the replay  
crew had to go to a backup videotape system. The process took about 
four minutes to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in favor of instant replay of some sort, but I'm also a  
believer, after viewing it, there are going to be some hang-ups,'' 
Maas said. ``It's all going to depend on the feeds coming from the 
network trucks. When it comes down to a critical moment, the 
networks are going to be accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay's other problem came during ABC's Hall of Fame  
Game, when officials didn't realize they were able to review a play 
during a commercial. Once they figured it out, the process took 
less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a system without flaws, but it's about as close to  
perfect as you're going to get in this situation,'' said ABC's 
Boomer Esiason. 
</P>
<P>
	That's two mistakes in 18 exhibition games so far. Not a bad  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 19 times play has been halted for replay this preseason,  
just one has been reversed. Thirteen have been coaches' challenges 
and the remaining six came during the final two minutes of the half 
and the game, when replay officials upstairs decide whether to 
review a play. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole reversal came when Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher argued  
that one of his players, Hines Ward, was in possession of the ball 
before it went out of bounds after a blocked punt. The original 
call of a safety was correctly reversed to a touchdown by the 
replay crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been people quick to jump on us for the incident in  
Kansas City, but the preseason is about working out the kinks, and 
we'd rather have problems now than in the regular season,'' said 
Dennis Lewin, head of broadcasting for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STARTING YOUNG:* When Josh Lewin was 13, he'd cram a card  
table, tape recorder and all of his statistics into a briefcase and 
head for the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin would search for the best available seats at the Rochester  
Red Wings Triple-A baseball game, spread everything out and begin 
broadcasting the game. With no audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin, who recently turned 30, now sits next to the likes of Tim  
McCarver and Frank Robinson as a national play-by-play broadcaster 
for Fox's baseball coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew from the time I was five that this is what I wanted to  
do,'' Lewin said. ``I'd turn down the voice on the television and 
grab a spoon, a ladle or whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin's road was well-traveled, however.  
</P>
<P>
	He persuaded a CBA team that had just begun in Rochester to let  
him broadcast a game a week over local cable access television. 
Lewin was still 13. 
</P>
<P>
	That turned into an internship with the Red Wings, which led to  
a series of three-inning-a-game radio stints during college. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Lewin headed to Baltimore's WBAL radio station for a sports  
director position and backup to Jon Miller. He called about 10 
games when Miller was working for ESPN before he got a call from 
Fox, which was looking for young play-by-play guys. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin left his full-time job in Baltimore for WGN in Chicago,  
where he was to be Harry Caray's fill-in. Lewin was told he'd do 
road games and the middle three innings at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	But he never even got to do one inning at Wrigley for WGN.  
</P>
<P>
	``Harry absolutely didn't want any young go-getter filling in  
unless it was (his grandson) Chip,'' Lewin said. ``I understood 
what his problem was. He didn't want me there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Lewin left prior to the 1998 season to broadcast Detroit  
Tigers games for Fox Sports Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I overshot the mark,'' Lewin said. ``I never  
aspired to be a network TV guy. They've got a lot more talented 
guys in the stable here than me -- Joe Buck, Kenny Albert and Thom 
Brennaman. I'm just happy to be in the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> Elliott Says He's Fine After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott is unsure whether he'll return  
to the NBA now that he's had a kidney transplant. At the moment, 
he's simply concentrating on walking around a little. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, appearing for the first time in public since receiving  
a kidney from his brother on Monday, met with reporters in the 
lobby of Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm doing great. I'm a little tired. But other  
than that, I'm just excited,'' he said, sitting in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 10-year NBA veteran at age 31, helped lead the San  
Antonio Spurs to their first NBA championship in June. His standout 
moment came when he hit a game-winning 3-pointer against Portland 
in the Western Conference finals. Elliott made the shot in the 
final seconds while balancing on his tiptoes as he nearly fell out 
of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement of making that shot now has been overshadowed by  
the seriousness of undergoing a kidney transplant, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something else,'' he said. ``I was a little nervous  
when I got out (of surgery). But they started telling me how good I 
was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott needed the transplant because of a condition he has had  
for several years called focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. The 
illness prevents the kidneys from properly filtering waste from the 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's 32-year-old brother, Noel Elliott, underwent surgery  
to donate one of his healthy kidneys. Doctors immediately implanted 
the kidney in Sean Elliott's body. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been hard to move. My brother gave me a giant kidney, so  
I've got this extra lump in here and it's a little different,'' 
Elliott said. ``But it's working really good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without the transplant, Elliott likely would have had to begin  
kidney dialysis in a matter of weeks. He said there is no way he 
can repay his brother for donating the kidney, which Elliott called 
``the greatest gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to be the best brother I can and take care of  
what he's given to me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott urged others to follow his brother's example and become  
organ donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so proud of him,'' Elliott said. ``To be able to give  
a part of your body like that is just an amazing sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Francis Wright, Elliott's transplant surgeon, said both  
brothers are recuperating nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't wish them any better,'' Wright said.  
</P>
<P>
	Elliott has indicated he would like to return to the Spurs. On  
Thursday, he said he hadn't thought much yet about an NBA comeback, 
although he didn't rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I feel as good and keep progressing as I have been, I'm  
sure I'm going to want to have a go at it. But we'll have to wait 
and see,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't return to basketball, Elliott said, he doesn't  
know what he'll do. But he doesn't intend to remain idle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to enjoy life, that's for sure,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said he might spend some of his recovery time in Tucson,  
Ariz., his hometown where several relatives live. But because his 
doctors are in San Antonio, much of his recuperation period will be 
spent in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked well-wishers from around the world.  
</P>
<P>
	Several NBA players have called, visited or sent flowers. Karl  
Malone, Scottie Pippen, Detlef Schrempf and former Spurs player 
Vinny Del Negro have been among those offering support, Elliott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson, Avery Johnson and Steve Kerr of the Spurs have  
visited the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave came by, Avery came by. Avery was scared to death. I  
think I scared him,'' Elliott said with a chuckle. ``I had all 
these tubes and stuff coming out of me, so I don't think he was 
used to that.''

<HEADLINE> US Urged To Stay Out of Taiwan Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's ambassador cautioned against U.S.  
involvement in the standoff with Taiwan on Thursday, saying Beijing 
would not rule out force to stop Taiwanese independence or 
``possible foreign intervention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The envoy, Li Zhaoxing, also suggested China is concerned that  
Taiwan could become an issue in the U.S. presidential campaign and 
other political races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of Taiwan is entirely China's internal matter,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference at the Chinese Embassy, Li voiced  
opposition to any increase in the flow of U.S. arms to Taiwan -- 
particularly deployment of a U.S.-developed missile defense shield 
to protect the island. 
</P>
<P>
	China has called for a cessation of all U.S. arms sales to  
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The present tempest was spawned by Taiwanese President Lee  
Teng-hui's July 9 assertion that Taiwan and China should have a 
``state to state'' relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	China viewed that as an abandonment of the ``one China'' policy  
that has ruled relations between Taiwan and the mainland for the 
past 50 years and a move toward Taiwanese independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Li called the Taiwanese president ``a troublemaker.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Lee Teng-hui must discard his state-to-state doctrine.  
Otherwise he will go down in history only as a national traitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recent cross-strait dispute has generated new calls, both in  
Congress and on the presidential campaign trail, for a renewed 
commitment of support to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said China was concerned that the issue might become  
entangled in upcoming election-year U.S. politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few, not many, American politicians have already  
stated that if China would like to resolve the issue of Taiwan with 
force, then America will protect Taiwan. I believe this is a very 
dangerous statement,'' Li said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who say this have no reason at all to say what they  
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China considers Taiwan a renegade province.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States adheres to a policy that acknowledges that  
Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait hold that there is only 
one China. However, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits the 
United States to defend China against an attack from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	While China hopes the situation can be resolved peacefully, ``We  
cannot rule out the force option,'' Li said. ``We want to prepare 
ourselves to stop any possible Taiwan independence or any possible 
foreign intervention and foreign aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Chinese President Jiang Zemin had written a letter to  
President Clinton listing asking the U.S. to cease arms sales and 
take other steps to back away from support of Taiwan, Li would only 
say that the two leaders exchange views frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Jiang will meet in New Zealand during a meeting of  
Asian and Pacific leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin said Clinton and Jiang  
``have exchanged correspondence on several occasions in recent 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have strongly urged both China and Taiwan to engage in  
dialogue and to resolve differences in a peaceful manner,'' Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As to arms sales, Rubin said the United States would ``continue  
to assist Taiwan in meeting its legitimate self-defense needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no U.S. decisions'' yet on whether to provide  
Taiwan with a missile-defense capability, Rubin said. He said such 
questions are premature because the technology for such a defense -- 
the ability to shoot down incoming missiles -- is still being 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Li was upbeat on the current state of U.S.-Chinese  
relations, which hit their lowest point in years in May with the 
accidental U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Li suggested negotiations over reparations to China and victims  
of the embassy bombing were progressing. And he expressed hopes 
that remaining U.S. obstacles to China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization would soon be resolved.

<HEADLINE> Settlement for Tobacco Growers OKed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- A judge approved a court settlement with  
cigarette companies Thursday that could give the nation's tobacco 
farmers and quota owners more than $5 billion over the next 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Phase II settlement is intended to help farmers  
and allotment holders -- people granted the right by the federal 
government to grow a certain amount of tobacco -- in 14 
tobacco-producing states deal with the fallout from a $206 billion 
national settlement between the cigarette companies and the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of the product is going to rise. The consumption of  
this product is going to go down,'' said Phil Carlton, who 
represented the cigarette companies in negotiating the settlement. 
``That's simple economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina farmers and quota owners could receive about $2  
billion, the largest portion of the settlement among the states. 
The national settlement, which should begin sending payments to 
growers by the end of the year, will be overseen by North Carolina 
state courts under an agreement by all 14 tobacco states. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way to help every single person who is going to be  
affected by this,'' Carlton said. ``But one group the companies 
wanted to be sure to help were the tobacco farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton said the settlement between the companies and  
tobacco-producing states would help farmers offset future losses, 
but would not help with the 35 percent reduction over the past two 
years in the amount of tobacco they can grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Donald Stephens signed the legal documents  
Thursday morning finalizing the delivery of the payments to the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The checks will be good news for farmers, many of whom never  
believed they would get any money from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them still don't believe it's going to happen,'' said  
tobacco farmer Ed Bissette of Spring Hope, who is on a state board 
that will oversee the distribution of the money. ``I can't get out 
of the warehouse. They just smother me when I go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement for farmers and allotment holders in the states  
could total $5.1 billion over 12 years, Attorney General Mike 
Easley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson and Lorillard tobacco companies said they hoped the 
settlement would help farmers adjust. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our strong desire that affected tobacco farmers be well  
prepared for the changes in the marketplace that lie ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other states expected to receive Phase II settlement money are  
Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Ohio, 
Indiana, Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama, Maryland and 
Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Florida Ag Did Well Last Year / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Florida growers and ranchers saw their cash  
receipts rise in 1998 to their largest ever due to solid gains in 
citrus and vegetables, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash receipts for Florida agriculture rose 3.8 percent to a  
record $6.69 billion as citrus and vegetables offset weakness in 
Florida's livestock and foliage industries. The previous record was 
$6.24 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida farm receipts had declined during the mid-1990s because  
of storms, droughts and the result of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, state agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted that our farmers are continuing to increase  
their sales despite our many trade issues and adverse weather 
conditions threatening their survival,'' Florida Agriculture 
Commissioner Bob Crawford said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus led the way with $1.61 billion in revenue, up 7.8 percent  
for the year. Citrus accounted for 23.8 percent of all farm cash 
receipts in the state last year. Oranges alone accounted for $1.2 
billion, or about 20 percent of all farm cash receipts, and offset 
the 27 percent decline in grapefruit to $145 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Vegetables and melons, boosted by tomatoes, potatoes and squash,  
generated $1.54 billion, or 22.9 percent of Florida's farm revenue 
-- up 5.3 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash receipts are the key measure of farm income for Florida,  
the nation's ninth-largest agricultural state. 
</P>

<P>
	BOTTINEAU, N.D. (AP) -- As area farmers head into harvest, a  
coalition is preparing to help them find financial and mental 
health services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Team for Interfaith Rural Support was formed to serve  
Bottineau, McHenry, Renville and Rolette counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really want to be working together because they know  
they have to,'' said Desiree Uhrich of Bottineau, who works with 
the Lutheran Rural Response unit of Lutheran Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition includes representatives of agriculture mediation,  
churches and social service, health care and emergency relief 
agencies as well as community leaders. By forming the coalition, 
Uhrich said, the different groups have learned what others have to 
offer and are able to make referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Parsley, a social worker with Catholic Family Services in  
Minot, said the team expects the brunt of the disaster will be felt 
this fall, when farmers normally collect an income from their 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor-to-neighbor support is needed as well as agency help,  
said Kenneth Rogers of Maxbass, a mediator with the state 
agriculture mediation program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have television and newspapers and computers and cell  
phones -- all these modern communication devices -- but we 
communicate less people-to-people, farmer-to-farmer, than we ever 
have,'' he said. ``Somehow, we need to break that isolation down a 
little bit.''

	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- No one would have blamed Sam Beam if he had  
kicked a tire or slammed a hood in frustration when fortune turned 
sour with his miniature 1937 Ford Coupe. Instead, the former 
national go-kart champion only smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	With sweat beading on his forehead, the 18-year-old Beam and his  
crew leaned over his car, trying to figure out why his brakes gave 
out one recent night in two preliminary races on a quarter-mile 
track at Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you just have to sit down and pray,'' Beam said  
after finishing 15th in a 20-car race. ``It doesn't matter whether 
your brakes fail. With God you're always a winner ... .''

Motorsports Evangelism'' on it, is the only one in the Legends 
series that is sponsored by a religious group. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist Motorsports Evangelism is a program of the Western  
North Carolina Conference of the United Methodist Church. It uses 
the car as a way to promote the Christian faith, just as NASCAR 
sponsors put logos on cars to promote cigarettes, alcohol or other 
consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the name, Beam's car displays the familiar  
cross-and-flame logo of the Methodist denomination and the 
toll-free phone number for a 24-hour prayer line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a tool, and the car is a tool that helps us to  
identify with these people,'' said the Rev. Buddy Compton, a 
Mooresville pastor and program chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton knows of no other church-sponsored teams in motor  
sports. Neither does Billy Mauldin with Motor Racing Outreach, a 
Christian ministry to drivers at NASCAR's highest levels, though it 
wouldn't surprise him if somewhere a church were sponsoring a 
driver at a local track. Mauldin appreciates the Methodist church's 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings (Christianity) to drivers and crew members. Just  
seeing that sponsorship makes them think about issues of faith,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist Motorsports raised about $5,000 last year from  
congregations and individuals for the upkeep and marketing of 
Beam's car. In return, it got primary publicity rights on the 
scaled-down coupe equipped with a 1200-cc, 125-horsepower 
motorcycle engine reaching 115 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A serious hobby for most drivers, Legends racing is several  
steps below NASCAR's premier Winston Cup division, where 
700-horsepower engines produce speeds exceeding 200 mph. Beam views 
the series as a stepping stone to a professional racing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Beam,who attends a Presbyterian church, says other drivers  
sometimes kid him about being the ``preacher man,'' but he's proud 
of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people take you the wrong way sometimes,'' Beam said.  
``But I think this is the way that all people should live their 
lives, and that's what we're trying to do with this car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Methodists get a lot of mileage for their donations. The  
low-priced races attract thousands of spectators weekly to Lowe's. 
They also are televised by Fox SportSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist Motorsports prints a weekly fan guide. Methodist  
ministers and church youth groups pass out the programs in the 
stands and talk to fans about the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton recalled a recent conversation with a crew member from  
another team who was going through a difficult divorce. 
``Sometimes, when some of the action stops, they'll sit down and 
share with us some of their troubles,'' he said. ``And we can have 
prayer together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran drivers in the Legends series say the cross-and-flame  
zooming around the track is getting notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you think a little bit about what you do out there,''  
said driver Darrell Jackson of Concord. ``It adjusts your thinking 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some worry about the church's image on the oval, should tempers  
flare, but Compton has confidence in Beam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think it's an issue, because if you've every  
been to a church-league softball game, they get pretty rough,'' 
Compton said, laughing. ``You know that tensions run high there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beam and Compton both have high hopes for the future.  
</P>
<P>
	Compton dreams of the Methodist logo on a Winston Cup car,  
though he knows it's unlikely in these days of selling space to the 
highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Compton said he hopes the partnership will show that  
evangelism isn't just people handing out tracts door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to be ordained ministers to share the faith,''  
he said. ``It happens in the workplace. It happens in the schools. 
And it happens at the race track.''

<HEADLINE> Virgin Sues Chocolate Distributor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Virgin Enterprises Ltd., owned by British  
billionaire Richard Branson, has filed a trademark-infringement 
lawsuit against a tiny distributor of exotic chocolates in a Denver 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against Virgin Chocolates Inc., was filed on Aug. 13  
in the U.S. District Court in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Enterprises alleges the chocolate company ``committed and  
threatens to commit trademark infringement, trade name 
infringement, unfair competition, dilution and misappropriation,'' 
and other torts. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Edwards, owner of Virgin Chocolates, said Wednesday  
he was not aware of the trademark lawsuit. But he said he received 
a letter April 9 from a New York attorney for Virgin Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pretty much told us to shut everything down,'' said  
Edwards, 40. ``I just don't think Virgin can own everything with 
the 'Virgin' name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Chocolates, based in the north Denver suburb of Thornton,  
sells a variety of candies at $2.95 to $12.95 a piece over an 
adult-only Internet site. Edwards also sells vitamins and 
supplements online. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he makes only about $30 a month from the chocolates.  
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Enterprises is a privately held international  
conglomerate, with $5 billion in annual revenues and 10,000 
employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Its businesses range from Virgin Atlantic Airlines, to Virgin  
Soda, to the Virgin Megastores, one of which is located at the 
Denver Pavilions on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Under Fire For WWF Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A watchdog group and an environmentalist  
both took on Gov. Jesse Ventura, saying he will violate conflict of 
interest laws by refereeing a wrestling event this weekend. Ventura 
took the first round today when a judge threw one complaint out. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation match is scheduled for Sunday at  
the Target Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In a complaint filed Wednesday with a state agency, Common Cause  
Minnesota President David Schultz said the governor -- a former 
professional wrestler -- has used his ``official position to secure 
benefits for himself which are distinct from benefits available to 
the general public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Employee Relations didn't immediately  
issue any response, but a second, similar complaint from Leslie 
Davis, president of the environmental group Earth Protector, was 
heard in court today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventeen years of work that we've done is being dismantled  
because of a governor who is not doing his work,'' Davis told 
Ramsey County District Judge Kathleen Gearin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ventura's attorney, Alan Eidsness, said Davis wouldn't be  
harmed by Ventura's participation in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sided with Ventura, saying ultimately it is the role  
of the voters to judge their elected officials. She also said an 
elected official does not automatically ``become someone who does 
not have personal, social, economic and private interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Ventura's spokesman John Wodele called the criticism  
``irritating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor obviously is not one out of the conventional  
mold,'' Wodele said. ``Common Cause, other politicians and elected 
officials obviously have some trouble with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The colorful Ventura, who won election last year under the  
Reform Party banner, has said he will donate to charity the 
$100,000 fee he is getting from the WWF.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Slips Slightly in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful George W.  
Bush retained a big lead among New Hampshire voters, according to a 
new poll, but that lead has slipped slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain has an edge for the second spot in New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire survey of 450 registered Republicans by the  
independent American Research Group indicates 40 percent would vote 
for the Texas governor -- a drop from the 47 percent he had a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll showed McCain at 16 percent, compared with 13 percent  
in the same poll in July. Pat Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, 
Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch were all in 
single digits. Fifteen percent said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was at 61 percent in a national CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll  
of 434 respondents who are Republican or who lean toward 
Republicans. Dole was in second place at 13 percent and the other 
candidates were grouped in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had close to the same lead he had in a June CNN/USA  
Today/Gallup poll. This poll was taken from Monday through 
Wednesday, before the latest controversy over Bush's refusal to 
talk about whether he ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both surveys had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls are the first measure of voter sentiment in New  
Hampshire since the Iowa straw poll. In the straw poll -- an 
unscientific popularity contest held by the Iowa Republican Party -- 
Bush won, followed by Forbes, Dole and Bauer. McCain did not 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Bennett, president of the American Research Group, noted  
that none of the top finishers in the straw poll got a bounce in 
their New Hampshire poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa leads off the selection process with its caucuses in early  
February, followed by New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first 
presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore has maintained  
his lead among New Hampshire voters over former New Jersey Sen. 
Bill Bradley, the survey said. In July, Gore held a 48-32 lead in 
New Hampshire; this month, he had 46 percent to 29 percent for 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five percent of the 415 Democrats polled said they were  
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore led Bradley 58 percent to 31 percent in the national poll  
of 493 respondents who were Democratic or lean Democratic, while 10 
percent were undecided. Gore's national lead is largely unchanged 
from June. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire telephone poll was conducted Sunday through  
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Gets More Specific About Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush said today that he could have  
passed stringent background checks for illegal drug use when his 
father was president, from 1989-1993. But he refused to say if that 
would have been true when he was in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	In his most specific comments to date about an issue he insists  
he doesn't want to discuss, Bush told reporters today, ``Not only 
could I have passed in today's White House, I could have passed the 
standards applied under the most stringent conditions when my dad 
was president, a 15-year period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the Republican presidential  
front-runner was saying that he has not used illegal drugs at any 
time since 1974, when the 53-year-old Bush was 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over 20 years ago, I did some things ... I made some mistakes  
and I learned from those,'' Bush said today. ``That's all I intend 
to talk about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Bush could have met the standard when his father was  
vice president, from 1981-1989, Tucker said, ``My understanding is 
he was answering questions regarding when his dad was president, 
not vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Bush would not go into any more detail about his  
earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyden Gray, White House counsel for President Bush, said the  
younger Bush never was asked to undergo a background check while 
his father was president. The Bush White House asked staff members 
if they had used any illegal drugs in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was peppered for the second straight day with questions  
about whether he had ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to tell people that we need to clean up the process.  
I'm going to tell people that the politics of personal destruction 
have got to end,'' he said. ``I'm going to tell people that I made 
mistakes and that I've learned from those mistakes. And if they 
like it, I hope they give me a chance, and if they don't like it, 
they can find somebody else to vote for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has avoided talking about the drug issue, said he  
thought it was relevant to ask whether he could pass a federal 
background check that he would subject his own employees to. ``The 
answer is absolutely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug questions came as the Texas governor visited the West  
End Center for Youth. ``You can be governor too, but you've got to 
make the right choices,'' he told one child. ``When someone says 
drugs are cool, you've got to say drugs are not cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Bush toured the city market area downtown. A man,  
carrying a big green sign with the word ``snort,'' yelled, ``Just 
answer the question. Did you do it? Don't feed the frenzy, just 
answer the question. Al Gore answered the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush testily refused to answer questions Wednesday about whether  
he had ever used illegal drugs, insisting that such personal issues 
have no place in the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	But later in the day, The Dallas Morning News asked him about  
the requirement that federal employees answer questions about drug 
use to get high-level security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I understand it, the current form asks the question, 'Did  
somebody use drugs within the last seven years?' and I will be glad 
to answer that question, and the answer is 'No,''' he told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wednesday's news conference, Bush said rumors about his  
personal life were ``ridiculous and absurd,'' possibly planted by 
political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what happens? Somebody floats a rumor and that causes  
you to ask a question,'' Bush told reporters. ``And that's the game 
in American politics, and I refuse to play it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his first campaign for Texas governor in 1994, Bush has  
declined to answer some questions about his past. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he quit drinking alcohol 13 years ago, when he  
turned 40. And in the wake of the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, Bush said he's been faithful to his wife of more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's campaign says Bush believes there is a line to be  
drawn between legitimate questions about his record and other 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Important facts that people deserve to know about are how he's  
fulfilled his duties as governor, father, husband and employer. 
Those are relevant questions,'' said Bush spokesman Scott 
McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to take this on and say, `Enough is enough.' If  
that leads to mistaken assumptions about his past, that's fine with 
him. He's not going to itemize for the children of America and his 
daughters, who are watching, everything he did or did not do in the 
past,'' McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedians have capitalized on Bush's refusal to answer the drug  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	An Aug. 11 monologue by Jay Leno on ``The Tonight Show'': ``Bush  
has come under fire lately for not answering questions about 
possible cocaine use. Well, today, he came out for mandatory drug 
testing. He says he is for it. In fact, he said, 'Look, whatever 
drugs you've got, bring them by. I will test them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, while seeking the White House in 1992, also faced  
questions about drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in England I experimented with marijuana a time or  
two and didn't like it,'' Clinton said. ``I didn't inhale and I 
didn't try it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An opinion poll taken earlier this year indicated Americans are  
about evenly divided on the question of whether the public needs to 
know about a candidate's past drug use. Just over half said ``yes'' 
in the February CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	An AP survey of 11 presidential hopefuls on Wednesday found that  
both the Democrats -- Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley -- have acknowledged trying marijuana. Eight Republicans 
said they hadn't used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaigns offered differing opinions on whether the question  
should be asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said, ``I think Governor Bush is making a  
big mistake in not settling that issue and getting it behind him. 
... Why not just say you didn't, if you didn't? And if he did, say 
why -- and how he's overcome it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every candidate has a responsibility to decide what questions  
are appropriate and how they are going to respond,'' said Gore 
spokesman Roger Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, former Gov. Ann Richards, whom Bush ousted in 1994,  
faced drug use questions from a Democratic primary election rival 
when she first sought the party's nomination in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A recovering alcoholic, Richards openly discussed her drinking  
and her recovery, but she refused to answer the drug question. She 
won the primary, and GOP candidate Clayton Williams didn't raise 
the drug issue. Neither did Bush four years later.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Has Online Shopping Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENAI, Alaska (AP) -- Kenai Mayor John Williams said he is  
opposed to a state sales tax because it could boost online 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican State Sen. John Torgerson has said he would bring up  
the idea of a state sales tax with lawmakers this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams told the Kenai Chamber of Commerce Wednesday he is  
worried that the Internet already is taking a bite out of Kenai's 
economy, and any state sales tax would make cyber commerce more 
inviting. 
</P>
<P>
	It is difficult to impose a tax on goods sold over the Internet  
and that makes many goods less expensive online, even after paying 
for shipping, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said some businesses in the area already were feeling  
the brunt of online retailing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the auto industry, for example, huge dealerships in the Lower  
48 list their prices online. Williams said it can be cheaper to fly 
down to these dealers and buy a car there than to buy a car on the 
Kenai Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Intel To Make Web Sites Add Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest move to discourage government  
regulation, Intel Corp. said it will require Internet sites that 
carry its advertising to warn consumers what personal details are 
being collected about them online. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which spent $1.3 billion on all advertising last year, is  
among the largest buyers of ads on the Internet, especially with 
its prominent campaign featuring the familiar ``Intel Inside'' 
swirl logo. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's announcement Wednesday follows similar threats earlier  
this year by IBM, Microsoft Corp. and The Walt Disney Co. to 
withhold advertising from Web sites that do not publish adequate 
privacy warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're now joining the ranks,'' said Ann Lewnes, Intel's  
director of worldwide advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech industry wants to convince the federal government  
that it can regulate itself and that new privacy laws are not 
needed to protect consumers on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said it will require by Jan. 1 that all the roughly 200  
``Intel Inside'' sites worldwide comply with privacy guidelines 
developed by the Online Privacy Alliance, a trade group of 
companies on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which recommended to Congress this  
summer that new Internet privacy laws are not needed, praised 
Intel's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC told lawmakers that some Web sites ``still do not  
understand the importance of consumer privacy,'' but decided 
companies voluntarily were creating rules for handling sensitive 
personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Web sites will know they won't get advertising dollars unless  
they protect consumers' privacy,'' said Vicki Streitfeld, a 
spokeswoman for the FTC. ``It's the kind of thing we hope will 
create strong incentives to create their own privacy policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The OPA guidelines require Web sites to tell consumers what  
information is being collected, allow people to ask not to have any 
information gathered about them, keep private details secure and 
allow consumers to review their information for accuracy and 
correct it. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that ``Intel Inside'' campaign, which includes the  
largest share of the company's ad expenditures, Intel pays a 
special premium -- mostly to computer markers -- to include the 
familiar logo in their advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel earlier this summer told other Internet sites where it  
buys traditional ads they must publish privacy policies by Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewnes said Intel estimates that about 70 percent of Web sites  
that carry the company's ads already publish privacy policies, and 
predicted the others will shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate a very large problem,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Intel angered privacy groups earlier this year when it included  
in its latest Pentium III computer processors a unique serial 
number to transmit to Web sites that request it to help verify the 
identity of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the feature will help eliminate online fraud and  
control access to sensitive data. Some privacy groups argued that 
the so-called tracking technology will give companies unprecedented 
ability to trace consumers' moves as they navigate the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those same privacy groups took a dim view of Intel's  
latest announcement. David Banisar of the Washington-based 
Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the OPA guidelines 
themselves are ``virtually worthless'' because they ``set up 
procedural barriers that consumers have to hop over to have some 
kind of marginal control over their information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think in the long run it makes much difference at all,  
given how limited the privacy protections are,'' Banisar said. 
``This doesn't provide any real level of comfort to consumers.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vacates for 53rd Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, among the nation's oldest  
baby-boomers, is celebrating his 53rd birthday today by going on 
vacation. The White House was tightlipped about Clinton's birthday 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it's a surprise, so maybe we should leave it at  
that,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a safe bet that Clinton will celebrate his birthday  
during his stay on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. His friend 
Vernon Jordan threw parties for him each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his family are dividing their vacation this year  
between two places: Martha's Vineyard, a family favorite, and New 
York state, a nod to Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fifth Martha's Vineyard vacation for the Clintons.  
They will spend nine days on the 20-acre Oyster Pond estate of 
developer Richard Friedman, their host for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to be far more visible this year than last,  
when they remained indoors because Clinton's admission that he had 
an affair with Monica Lewinsky was still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	Now though, with the Lewinsky matter ended and Mrs. Clinton's  
bid for a Senate seat from New York all but official, the president 
and first lady are making lots of plans. Already, they have 
penciled in a jaunt to Nantucket on Friday for an event with the 
American-Ireland Fund, a non-profit group that finances educational 
ventures in Northern Ireland and Ireland. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study Says Soil Conservation Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An intense study of a Wisconsin watershed is  
providing good news for farmers: Soil conservation efforts work. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA geography professor Stanley W. Trimble found that erosion  
has declined sharply in the Coon Creek Basin in western Wisconsin. 
His findings appear in Friday's edition of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	While his work focused on one area, Trimble said in a telephone  
interview that the same ``processes are representative of many 
agriculturally disturbed basins in the Eastern U.S., but magnitudes 
and timing would differ. Erosion is certainly a less serious 
problem than it was in the 1930s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Moffitt of the Agriculture Department's Natural Resources  
Conservation Service said that while Trimble's study ``certainly 
points to the benefits of conservation,'' the Coon Creek watershed 
is unique in that it became a demonstration area for conservation 
efforts starting in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's National Resources Inventory has indicated a  
general decline in soil erosion in recent years, Moffitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble studied sediment washed off the land in the basin and  
found an average of 405,000 metric tons per year between 1853 and 
1938, peaking in the 1930s. That declined to 209,000 metric tons 
per year from 1938 to 1975, and since 1975 has averaged about 
80,000 metric tons per year. A metric ton is 2,205 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sediment is the other end of erosion,'' he explained. ``the  
amount of sediment should equal the amount of erosion that has 
occurred.''

<HEADLINE> Castro Describes Signing Baseballs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Joking with an audience of students Thursday,  
Cuban President Fidel Castro described the minor annoyances of his 
life: cell phones, flash bulbs and signing baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why in the United States they really think that I  
am involved in baseball,'' he said to a burst of laughter from 
about 2,000 people at a congress of leftist youth groups at 
Havana's National Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, a noted baseball fan who was a promising pitcher as a  
university student, said U.S. visitors continually bring him books 
on baseball ``and a mountain of baseballs to sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that is hardest for me is signing baseballs,'' he  
said, comparing the task to trying to write on a drinking glass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban leader, dressed in his usual olive-green fatigues,  
also grumbled that the sound of cellular telephones ``is 
unbearable'' and added: ``Some believe they are very important 
because they carry one of those little telephones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had been photographed with flashes so often that ``it  
is a miracle I am not blind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro also referred to his nocturnal lifestyle, saying he often  
worked and read until near dawn. The students learned this first 
hand. Castro began to speak Wednesday shortly before 9 p.m. -- but 
didn't finish until after 1 a.m. Thursday 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday I finished working at about 6 or 7 (in the  
morning).... I got up at 8:20,'' he said, apologizing for not 
having read all of the conference's resolutions condemning 
free-market political systems and ``U.S. imperialism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old president, who had been in power since 1959,  
also referred to his place in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am of this century which is ending,'' he said, saying that  
the students in the audience would face the problems of the future.

<HEADLINE> New Stadium Brings Browns Home Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Standing on the same lakefront plot as its  
predecessor, the new Cleveland Browns Stadium is more than a $282 
million Sunday playground for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	To Cleveland, it's a symbol of the city's fight to right a  
wrong, to bring back its beloved Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Built with more than $200 million in taxpayer money, the new  
stadium is an arresting glass-and-steel structure that will hold 
72,000 fans and now only needs some memories to make it feel like 
home to the Browns and their fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look around here,'' former Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar  
said earlier this week as the Browns went through a dress rehearsal 
in their new home. ``Could this place be any nicer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly.  
</P>
<P>
	The new stadium, designed by HOK Sports of Kansas City, has it  
all. Among the amenities: 148 luxury suites, the NFL's largest 
state-of-the-art scoreboard, a 450,000-watt audio system, an 
11,000-square foot home locker room, landscaped grounds, and some 
of the closest seats to the field in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	And of course, a Dawg Pound. Cleveland's notorious bleacher  
section of barking fans, who are known to hoist a few beers and 
hurl dog bones onto the field, have a remodeled home. 
</P>
<P>
	If fans like what they see, they have themselves to thank.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after former Browns owner Art Modell announced he was  
moving the old franchise to Baltimore in 1995, local voters 
approved a tax on alcohol and tobacco products that paid for a 
large chunk of the new stadium and showed the NFL that Cleveland 
wanted its team back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stadium engulfs you,'' quarterback Ty Detmer said after  
the team went through its dry run to prepare for Saturday's opener 
against the Minnesota Vikings. ``The stands are right on the field. 
It's like Lambeau Field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's nothing like the old Cleveland Municipal Stadium, or as  
it came to be known: ``The Mistake on the Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That cavernous ballpark -- built in 1932, closed in 1995 and torn  
down a year later -- was, depending on whom you talk to, either a 
sports shrine or the worst stadium ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns' locker room was so small that players had to dress  
in two different rooms on two different floors, veterans 
downstairs, rookies up. Players had to use nails in the walls to 
hang their coats, and taking a shower was a test of endurance since 
there usually wasn't any hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, oh, it had a bad smell,'' said offensive tackle Orlando  
Brown, one of the new Browns who also played for the previous team. 
``You couldn't wait to get out of there. I'll never forget that 
odor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressing on the visitors' side was worse. The locker room was  
even smaller and usually flooded with water. Players were often 
forced to take the field with wet socks, not exactly the way to 
start a 30-degree day in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing when you walked in the locker room you saw  
that it was so small,'' said Browns coach Chris Palmer, a five-time 
visitor to the old stadium as an assistant with the Oilers and 
Patriots. ``Then you tried to get out of the locker room as fast as 
you could so people would have room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the inconveniences, players and coached loved games  
in Cleveland. There was nothing quite like it. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was always full or close to it, and loud. Once  
dressed, they would walk down a low-ceilinged tunnel, their cleats 
clickety-clacking on the concrete before emerging onto the field 
through the baseball dugouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out of the tunnel, and coming out of the locker room.  
You went down the stairs and came up through the dugout. It was an 
amazing sight as you came out of there,'' said Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshly painted white lines on green grass (some freshly painted  
grass, too) and brown and orange under a typically gray sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing the crowd roar, modern players got a sense of what it  
was like in the 1950s when Otto Graham led the Browns to so many 
titles or in the '60s when Jim Brown shattered rushing records. 
</P>
<P>
	``You kind of felt like you were taking a trip through time,''  
said linebacker Chris Spielman, who grew up rooting for the Browns 
and played his first pro game in the old stadium. ``It was a very 
special place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on seat location, fans in the old stadium sometimes  
had to crane their necks around giant poles in order to see the 
action. That won't be a problem in the new place, which boasts a 
great view from the first row to the far reaches of the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at this view, you can see everything,'' said Susan Daley,  
who with her husband, Danny Douglass, came along with 25,000 fans 
for a sneak preview as the Browns practiced in their new home 
earlier this week. ``Not a pole in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the new stadium officially opens Saturday night, Browns  
fans will finally be able to put three years without pro football 
behind them. They'll be able to look around at a place they helped 
build, a team they brought back and decide if it was all worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember how sad I was when they tore the old stadium  
down,'' Daley said, looking down from her upper deck seat on the 
40-yard line. ``I don't care now.''

<HEADLINE> Univision Reports Record Ad Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Univision, the nation's dominant  
Spanish-language television network, said that advance advertising 
sales for the new TV season have reached a record $425 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42 percent increase for the 1999-2000 season includes  
advertisers new to Univision and reflects the growing interest by 
companies in reaching the Hispanic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Cisneros, president of parent company Univision  
Communications Inc., issued a statement crediting the advertising 
community for recognizing that targeting Hispanics through TV makes 
``both cultural and financial sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Univision showed its strongest revenue growth in key airline,  
movie and entertainment, automotive, retail and telecommunications 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy helped boost ad sales for English-language  
networks by 13 percent during the ``upfront'' market, the period 
beginning in late May when TV networks sell about 80 percent of 
their commercial spots for the coming fall season. 
</P>
<P>
	Univision is the country's fifth-largest TV network with about 4  
million primetime viewers.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Control Board Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The control board created to put the District  
of Columbia's chaotic financial house in order has it's own 
problems managing money, congressional auditors say. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the General Accounting Office criticized the  
presidentially appointed D.C. Financial Responsibility and 
Management Assistance Authority for the way it awarded and 
administered contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terrible,'' Bernard Ungar, who conducted the GAO  
investigation, said Wednesday of the control board's 
record-keeping. ``We saw no evidence of how the control board 
monitored or certified satisfactory contract performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing nine contracts awarded by the financial control  
board, the GAO found the panel did not always comply with its own 
procurement regulations and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	It sought competition for seven of the nine contracts but failed  
to document how three of the contractors were selected, as is 
required. The panel also did not provide written justification for 
two sole source contract awards, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the control board, including Chairwoman Alice Rivlin  
and Executive Director Francis Smith, declined to comment 
Wednesday. But in an appendix to the report, they stated that the 
contracts mentioned in the report were ``highly selective rather 
than a random sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The control board, established by Congress in 1995, is to go out  
of existence once the city has balanced four consecutive budgets. 
So far, it has balanced three.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Swells in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit mushroomed to an  
all-time monthly high in June as a flood of foreign cars, computers 
and clothing sent imports to a record level, overwhelming a small 
rise in exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the trade deficit  
ballooned to $24.6 billion in June -- a 16.3 percent increase from 
the $21.2 billion deficit in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of goods and services rose a hefty 3.9 percent in June  
to a record $103 billion. At the same time, U.S. exports managed a 
0.5 percent gain to $78.3 billion, only the second increase this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, the U.S. trade deficit was  
running at an annual rate of $236 billion -- 44 percent above last 
year's $164.3 billion, which had been a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported today that the number  
of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose for a 
third consecutive week, climbing to 287,000, an increase of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had been expecting an even bigger rise. They view any  
number below 300,000 as an indication that the labor market is 
extremely tight. The government reported last week that the 
unemployment rate in June was 4.3 percent, near a three-decade low. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit set records in five of the last six months.  
American manufacturers and farmers are struggling to cope with the 
loss of markets caused by the Asian financial crisis while U.S. 
consumers, bolstered by the lowest unemployment levels in three 
decades, have been snapping up foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge jump in the deficit in June caught analysts by  
surprise. Many had been forecasting a slight narrowing on the 
belief that American exporters were finally seeing some improvement 
as Asian economies began to recover from steep recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The slight gain in exports only pushed overseas sales back to  
their November levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring trade deficit has created major political headaches  
for the Clinton administration, which has had to deal with rising 
cries in Congress for protectionist legislation to help U.S. 
industries, including steel. The administration contends that 
raising U.S. barriers to foreign products would send the wrong 
signal at a time when the U.S. economy is outperforming the rest of 
the world in spite of the huge trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress, dissatisfied with the administration's response,  
has created a 12-member commission of prominent trade experts to 
look at the causes of the deficit and recommend solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	America's politically sensitive deficit with Japan ballooned by  
19.3 percent in June to $6.3 billion for the month. And, the 
monthly deficit with China also rose by 7.9 percent to $5.7 
billion, the worst showing since September even though American 
exports to China posted their best gain of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit with Mexico, one of the America's partners in the  
North American Free Trade Agreement, swelled 9.4 percent in June to 
$2.5 billion as imports from that country climbed to an all-time 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge deterioration in June's trade deficit reflected  
widening trade gaps with most of the world. America's deficit with 
West Europe jumped 39 percent to $4.9 billion as imports from that 
region also set a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.9 billion increase in imports was led by a jump of $874  
million in shipments of foreign cars and parts. Other big gains 
were registered by clothing, which climbed by $282 million; 
computers up $422 million; and telecommunications equipment, up 
$254 million. 
</P>
<P>
	America's foreign oil bill rose 3.7 percent in June to $5.5  
billion as crude oil imports climbed to the highest level since 
November 1997. The average price per barrel dipped slightly to 
$14.52 in June, but even with a two-cent drop remained 58 percent 
higher than the price at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in exports was led by a $424 million jump in sales of  
American autos and parts, which climbed to $6.5 billion, their 
highest level since July 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of American farm products, led by gains in corn and beef  
sales, were up $135 million to $3.9 billion but for the year were 
still 7 percent behind 1998. Farmers, suffering through the worst 
economic times in more than a decade, have also been hit by severe 
drought in many parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> AHP Stock Surges on Merger Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products Corp.'s stock jumped more  
than 6 percent Wednesday amid rumors the drug maker may merge with 
British pharmaceutical firm Glaxo Wellcome PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies refused to comment on the rumors and analysts  
largely discounted the prospects for Glaxo to buy American Home, 
which makes the world's most prescribed drug, the estrogen therapy 
Premarin. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of American Home rose $2.62 1/2 to $44.50 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Glaxo's American depositary receipts rose 37 1/2 cents 
to $52, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo, which sells leading asthma and AIDS medications, is the  
world's second largest pharmaceutical firm behind Merck &AMP; Co. But 
Glaxo has seen profit growth slow this year amid weak sales of its 
top migraine drug, Imitrex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything is possible,'' said Anthony Butler, an analyst with  
Lehman Brothers. '' But this one doesn't make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo is unlikely to want American Home because of agricultural  
and consumer products businesses, Butler said. American Home makes 
most of its money from Premarin, but consumers know the company for 
making Robitussin cough syrup, Advil pain reliever and Chap Stick 
lip balm. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home has had weak earnings in recent quarters compared  
to top rivals including Merck and Pfizer Inc. The Madison 
N.J.-based company's problems stem from weak sales in its 
agricultural business, and thousands of lawsuits related to its 
Norplant contraception and diet pills. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home had plans last year to merge with life sciences  
company Monsanto Co., but it was called off in October when the 
companies' top managers could not get along. American Home has also 
had talks with British drug maker SmithKline Beecham PLC.

<HEADLINE> Glitch Exposes E-Mail Passwords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is promising to fix by this  
week's end a bug in its new Internet chat software that permits 
co-workers and others to see a person's e-mail password. 
</P>
<P>
	The glitch in the company's new MSN Messenger software means  
that others who have access to a person's computer could 
impersonate that person to read and even send e-mail using his 
Hotmail account without anyone's knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said that even if customers delete their saved  
password and enter it manually, it still becomes visible if another 
person types a specific sequence of keystrokes on that computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, whose software runs most of the world's personal  
computers, said it was made aware of the bug earlier this week but 
promised to fix it by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Sanford, the product manager for MSN, said the bug's ill  
effects were mitigated because a person must have physical access 
to the victim's computer, meaning the problem will be worse in 
offices where co-workers share machines than for home users. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a shared office environment, if you trust the people you  
work with, this will probably never be an issue,'' Sanford said. 
But she said Microsoft recommends protecting each computer with a 
password. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was the latest embarrassment for Microsoft over its  
attempt to capture part of the burgeoning market for Internet chat 
software, currently dominated by America Online Inc.'s Instant 
Messenger software. 
</P>
<P>
	When Microsoft unveiled its chat software earlier this month,  
AOL complained that Microsoft engineers had hacked into its 
proprietary network to let MSN customers communicate with AOL's 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL successfully blocked Microsoft's software several times, but  
with each attempt Microsoft redesigned its chat software to bypass 
AOL's blocking attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	MSN Messenger customers currently can chat with people using  
AOL's software, and Microsoft -- in a bid for the moral high ground 
-- announced earlier this week it will release its software 
protocols so that other companies can design software that 
interpolates with MSN. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Microsoft bug occurs when customers use the software  
to check their e-mail using Microsoft's popular Web-based Hotmail 
service. If a person stops the resulting Internet page from loading 
and looks at the underlying software code -- which requires merely 
three clicks with the mouse -- the user's e-mail name and password 
are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said Microsoft will scramble the information in the  
upcoming patched version using encryption technology.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Iraqi deputy prime minister, appearing  
healthy in a televised interview today, denied opposition claims 
that he had been wounded in an assassination attempt this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Qatar's Al-Jazeera Television, the Arab world's most popular  
station, showed Mohammed Hamza al-Zubeidi walking somewhat stiffly 
but without difficulty onto the set. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are seeing me in front of you. No assassination attempt  
has taken place,'' al-Zubeidi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, an Iran-based opposition group called the  
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said al-Zubeidi, 
58, was shot and wounded just outside Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	The group claimed its military wing, the Islamic Resistance,  
carried out the attack on Tuesday. It did not offer any specifics 
on what injuries al-Zubeidi might have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi officials quickly responded to the group's claim  
Wednesday, saying al-Zubeidi had not been attacked. The quick 
response appeared to reflect an unusual level of concern by the 
government, which typically ignores opposition reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``They try to spread rumors in order to create instability  
inside Iraq and warp its reputation around the world,'' said 
al-Zubeidi, who was wearing an olive green military uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Zubeidi, a trusted aide of President Saddam Hussein, was  
Iraq's prime minister from 1991-93. He serves on the Revolutionary 
Command Council, Iraq's top decision-making body, and is the 
military governor of a region covering the predominantly Shiite 
areas of Babylon, Karbala, Najaf, Qadissiya and Muthana.

<HEADLINE> Mom Acquitted of Shooting Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- An elderly woman has been acquitted of  
attempted murder in a shooting that paralyzed her daughter and 
eventually led the younger woman to request to be taken off life 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Egan, 68, squeezed her attorney's hand and smiled  
Wednesday night after a jury decided she didn't try to kill her 
daughter or her daughter's live-in boyfriend in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan said she knew her daughter, Georgette Smith, 42, didn't  
want her to go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's up there with God, I pray to her in God's hands,'' Ms.  
Egan said. ``She was my best friend. We were together our whole 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith was paralyzed from the neck down, left barely able to  
speak and incapable of swallowing or controlling her bladder. In 
May, she won the right to be taken off life support, saying she did 
not blame her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before she died, Ms. Smith gave a 20-minute videotaped  
deposition in which she said her mother didn't mean to shoot her 
when she opened fire. Jurors were riveted as they watched the tape 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was an accident. I know it was. She can't see that  
good,'' Ms. Smith said, struggling to pronounce each word from her 
hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Egan, who is blind in one eye, weighs 85  
pounds and suffers from emphysema, opened fire March 8 after 
overhearing Ms. Smith and her boyfriend, Larry Videlock, talk about 
putting her in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict, Ms. Egan said she was tired of the influence  
Videlock was having over her daughter. ``I think I was losing it,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Bob Wesley, told the jury that Ms. Egan was  
involuntarily intoxicated from prescription drugs and didn't intend 
to shoot the couple, only scare them. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is not to be blamed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's no accident when you pull this firearm and you aim it at  
two victims and you use your finger to pull this back,'' prosecutor 
Pam Smith told jurors in closing arguments, holding up the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan was charged with two counts of attempted murder, which  
carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ms. Smith died, prosecutors considered charging Ms. Egan  
with murder, but decided against it, citing her poor health and 
closeness with her daughter.

<HEADLINE> Seniors Want Curbside Mail Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Army veteran Donald Gross has been  
through two open-heart surgeries but he thinks his daily trips to 
the mailbox might kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what this is? This is nitro,'' the 64-year-old  
veteran said, his voice rising as he held the heart medicine in his 
fist. ``I take four of these to get to the mailbox. And I take four 
of these to get back home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gross and his neighbors at the senior community of Floral Lakes  
are in what they call the battle of their lives: to get the Postal 
Service to deliver mail to curbside boxes at their 225 homes 
instead of a central kiosk that's up to a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	The developer has agreed to pay for curbside mailboxes and  
reimburse the Postal Service for the $6,484 cost of the kiosk it 
built, but the Postal Service has not budged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's stupidity. I can't understand the post office,'' said  
Palm Beach County Commissioner Burt Aaronson, who visited the 
neighborhood this week. ``We're fighting them on something that 
should not be a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight has reached all the way to the nation's Capitol.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., has held meetings in Washington and  
conference calls with postal officials and community leaders. 
Florida's attorney general has assigned a deputy to look into the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	When the developer first started building homes about three  
years ago in this community 50 miles north of Miami, he signed an 
agreement with the Postal Service for central delivery, a common 
method used to save government money and provide more secure mail 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as the senior citizens -- many of them veterans and  
retirees on Social Security -- began moving in, complaints began to 
mount about the long, hot trips to the kiosk. 
</P>
<P>
	Developer Ben Martz, chairman of Regency Homes, first wrote to  
the postmaster requesting curbside delivery in June 1998. After 
months of discussion, the Postal Service said he could have 
curbside delivery to the more than 300 new homes in the next three 
phases of the development. But as for the current homes, the Postal 
Service said no. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Pancake, a spokeswoman for the central Florida division  
of the Postal Service, said the agency is meeting with community 
leaders to try to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's proper to weigh all the options, and that's what  
we're doing,'' she said Thursday. ``There are service questions as 
well as cost considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As well as a possible precedent the Postal Service does not want  
to set, she acknowledged. ``Obviously there are many, many 
neighborhoods that have neighborhood collection boxes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, residents must make the sweaty trek to the kiosk or  
drive to get their mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays  
these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed 
rounds,'' Aaronson said, quoting the Postal Service's unofficial 
motto. ``It didn't mean these people would be the couriers.''

<HEADLINE> Lutherans OK Pact With Episcopals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After years of debate, the nation's largest  
Lutheran organization has agreed to form an alliance with the 
Episcopal Church under which they will exchange clergy, recognize 
each other's sacraments and cooperate in missionary projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America approved the pact  
Thursday at its national convention. The Episcopalians are expected 
to approve the pact during a convention next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two churches have a combined 7.5 million members in 18,000  
congregations, and supporters said the ``full communion'' agreement 
will help in urban and rural areas where church resources are 
scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact, which needed the approval of two-thirds of the  
delegates at a Lutheran convention here, passed 716-317, or with 69 
percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents objected to the agreement's requirement that Lutherans  
follow an ordination practice known as the historic episcopate, in 
which a bishop is installed by a laying-on of hands by three 
predecessor bishops from a line believed to extend back to Christ's 
apostles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutheran teachings don't require such historic succession, and  
many of the world's Lutheran bodies do not practice it. This is the 
first time that any U.S. Protestant body has approved such a 
relationship with an American denomination that follows the 
historic episcopate. Catholic and Orthodox churches also follow the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the pact said the Episcopal Church should be  
willing to take Lutherans as they are. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Episcopal Church overwhelmingly approved a  
similar alliance, but it fell just short of passage by the 
Lutherans. The pact has been slightly reworked since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray that our response can be positive,'' said Episcopal  
Presiding Bishop Frank T. Griswold. ``The promise of our deepening 
life together offers real hope for the broken world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lutherans have previously approved similar pacts with the  
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Reformed Church in America and United 
Church of Christ. But those didn't require changes in Lutheran 
tradition regarding bishops.

<HEADLINE> Euro Inflation Rate at 1.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The annual inflation rate in the 11  
countries that use the euro currency rose slightly in July, the 
European Union reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation rose from 0.9 percent in June to 1.1 percent in July.  
A year ago, the rate was 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries, members of the European Monetary Union, are  
Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, 
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate for the 15-nation EU as a whole - including Britain,  
Sweden, Denmark and Greece - was also at 1.1 percent, up from 1.0 
percent in June. The figure for July 1998 was 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the European Central Bank is unlikely to be  
concerned about the gradual rise in euro zone inflation and won't 
tighten rates until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation has been down in the euro zone because of low  
commodity prices, deregulation and price competition.

<HEADLINE> Track Coach Sues Under Title IX </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vanderbilt women's track and cross  
country coach Paul Arceneaux has filed a lawsuit claiming the 
school does not properly fund the program and does not pay him as 
much as coaches of male athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, claims Vanderbilt  
discriminated against Arceneaux ``on the basis of the 
student-athletes he coaches, in violation of Title IX,'' which 
guarantees equality in men's and women's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt officials declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux has been at Vanderbilt since 1993 and coaches the  
men's and women's cross country teams, and the women's indoor and 
outdoor track teams. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit, filed Friday, Arceneaux requested  
additional financial support for the women's track team and was 
denied. As a result, those athletes have suffered and continue to 
suffer, the lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt has ``consistently and systematically failed to  
provide the program with adequate resources to be competitive and 
has instead diverted financial support from the women's programs to 
comparable men's programs,'' according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux said his salary, which was not disclosed, is ``well  
below the fair market value of that of other women's coaches of 
comparable programs at other schools'' and below that of Vanderbilt 
coaches responsible for male athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks an increase in salary and compensatory and  
punitive damages to be determined at trial.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Officials Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A Seoul court on Friday absolved two  
former top economic officials of charges they neglected their 
duties during a regional financial crisis that forced South Korea 
to seek help from the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel cleared former Finance Minister Kang  
Kyong-shik and former chief presidential secretary Kim In-ho of 
charges that they failed to keep then-President Kim Young-sam 
properly informed about the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Seoul District Criminal Court found them guilty of  
separate charges that they pressured state-controlled banks to 
extend millions of dollars in preferential loans to three 
financially shaky companies. They were given suspended sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they would appeal to a higher court. They had  
earlier sought four years in prison for Kang and three years for 
Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials were fired two days before South Korea was forced  
to accept a $58 billion bailout from the IMF in late 1997. 
Thousands of companies collapsed, stripping millions of people of 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of reformist President Kim Dae-jung, who was  
inaugurated in February 1998, accused the two former officials of 
mishandling the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officials called themselves scapegoats for political  
persecution, saying the crisis was caused by the economy's 
structural problem and a policy failure cannot be subject to 
criminal punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's family-controlled conglomerates, known as chaebol,  
have thrived on cozy relations with past military-backed 
governments, over-expanding and over-diversifying during the 
country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, debt-ridden Daewoo group, the second largest  
conglomerate, bowed to pressure from its creditors and agreed to 
sell most of its 40 subsidiaries and keep only its core businesses 
in return for billions of dollars of fresh loans to save it from a 
possible bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Searches for Sailors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After searching up and down the East Coast and  
phoning marinas from New York to the Canadian border, the Coast 
Guard on Thursday appealed for the public's help in locating a 
sailing family. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have basically vanished,'' said Cmdr. Jim McPherson,  
spokesman for Coast Guard headquarters in Washington. ``We have no 
reports of finding life jackets or life rings or (signals from) 
emergency beacons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard and Debbie Stewart and their children Chad, 16, and  
Mischa, 12, of Ludlow Falls, Ohio, had been sailing from Florida to 
the Midwest. They last spoke to relatives around July 25 from 
Newport, R.I., McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's credit cards were last used July 26 in Newport. The  
last time a call was attempted on their cellular phone was Aug. 3 
near Piscataway, N.J., about 20 miles inland from the entrance to 
the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	In the more than two weeks since, there has been no contact with  
the Stewarts. The Coast Guard has been unable to locate them 
despite an aerial search along the East Coast and calls to marinas 
along the New England coast, the Hudson River Valley and the St. 
Lawrence Seaway, which parallels the U.S.-Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had situations where we've had single-hand sailors  
change their itinerary and not tell anybody, but it's seldom that 
you have an entire family disappear,'' McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was traveling on the ``Jolly Joyce,'' a 65-foot,  
cream-colored ketch with two white sails and a gray, 10-foot 
dinghy. The Dayton (Ohio) Daily News reported that the family had 
been living on the boat in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., since buying it 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad and Mischa are home-schooled, according to their older  
sister, Beth Stewart. She told the Daily News she stayed behind in 
Ludlow Falls, near Dayton, to run the family's two video rental 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Beth Stewart and Coast Guard officials described Richard  
Stewart as an inexperienced sailor. They said he intended to head 
north along the East Coast to the St. Lawrence Seaway, before 
turning inland to the Great Lakes. The ultimate destination was the 
Michigan home of Debbie Stewart's parents, Beth Stewart told the 
Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	En route, one of the boat's two engines died near Newport and  
the other started faltering, so the family docked there and sought 
repairs, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Al Bennett, based at 
Atlantic Area Headquarters in Portsmouth, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	They had problems finding parts, however, because the boat was  
nearly 30 years old. Bennett said a family friend located some 
parts in Louisiana and intended to install them in Ft. Lauderdale, 
but the Stewarts never returned, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know which way they went and our search area is  
literally the Atlantic Ocean and the Hudson River,'' said 
McPherson. ``What we're hoping is somebody gives us a better search 
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked anyone with information about the Jolly Joyce or the  
Stewart family to call the local Coast Guard station.

<HEADLINE> Mortage Rates Edge Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages edged down to 7.93 percent this week from its 
highest level in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 8.15 percent last week -- the highest  
rate since early April 1997 -- according to a weekly survey released 
Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb. So far this year,  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low for the year of 
6.74 percent set at the end of January before reaching 8.15 percent 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.53 percent this week, down from the average of 7.70 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.18 percent this week, also down from 6.24 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Mac's chief economist Robert Van Order said that  
interest rates began to fall back following government reports that 
inflation at both the wholesale and retail levels was tame. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Van Order along with many other economists believe  
that the Federal Reserve will nudge up interest rates next week for 
the second time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday  
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending Aug. 13 were

<HEADLINE> Jewish Center 911 Call Shows Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The head of the Los Angeles Police Department  
called for ``total gun control'' as he released 911 tapes that 
captured the terror unleashed by a gunman's rampage at a Jewish 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we want to see another incident or do we want to bite the  
bullet and get these guns off the street,'' Bernard Parks said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief wants a ban on assault weapons and ``Saturday Night  
Special'' handguns. He also has called for a ban on gun shows and 
strict regulation of gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The 911 tapes revealed the fear and panic as well as fast action  
by employees of North Valley Jewish Community Center, where three 
boys, a teen-age counselor and a receptionist were wounded Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers provided dispatchers with vital information about the  
location and what was happening, but there also was some confusion 
over the gunman's description and weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please hurry. He's got a huge machine gun,'' cried the first  
woman to call 911. ``I don't know how many people are dead, but 
there's hundreds of children. There's a summer camp here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a dispatcher sought information about the shooter, the woman  
said she had seen a white, heavyset man wearing black. 
</P>
<P>
	In another call a woman shouted, ``There's been a shooting here.  
He shot the whole damn place! ... Oh my God!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an officer tried to question her, she shouted, ``Somebody  
just came in and shot up our whole school. ... He came in with a 
shotgun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispatcher tried to calm her, telling her: ``You're my only  
link.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She then gave him details including the address of the center  
and who was there. ``There's 200 people in camp and there's 60 or 
70 in nursery school and staff,'' she said, telling the emergency 
operator she was under her desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived within four minutes of the first call.  
</P>
<P>
	One caller reported that children said an Asian man had opened  
fire. Another call described the gunman as Hispanic. Still another 
said it was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	The very first description phoned in matched that of Buford  
Furrow Jr., 37, the white supremacist who eventually surrendered 
and faces charges of attempted murder at the center and the murder 
of a postal worker shot to death a short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapon turned out to be a 9 mm semiautomatic assault weapon,  
not a machine gun or shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks said he believes the public is ready for a wide-ranging  
ban on guns, but lawmakers and the National Rifle Association have 
deterred such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resolve of the citizens has been high for a long time,''  
Parks said. ``The resolve of public officials is not as high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA's lobbying arm has said that Furrow was in violation of  
gun control laws already in place in California and has questioned 
whether new gun control proposals would have prevented the 
shootings.

<HEADLINE> Teammates Remember Pee Wee Reese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- When Jackie Robinson's widow remembers  
Pee Wee Reese, she thinks of the spot at the Dodgertown training 
facility in Vero Beach, Fla., where Pee Wee Reese Street meets 
Jackie Robinson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	To Mrs. Rachel Robinson, the crossing perfectly symbolizes the  
fortuitous intersection of Reese and Robinson's baseball careers in 
1947, the year Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and broke major 
league baseball's color barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of them grew from that experience,'' Mrs. Robinson said  
Wednesday at the funeral for Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop and 
captain of the Dodgers' ``Boys of Summer'' teams of the 1940s and 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese died Saturday in Louisville at 81 after a two-year fight  
with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, though a native of Jim Crow-era Kentucky, Reese refused  
to sign a petition that threatened a boycott if Robinson joined the 
team. Then, as Robinson was being heckled by fans in Cincinnati 
during the Dodgers' first road trip, Reese went over to talk to the 
second baseman, putting his arm around Robinson's shoulder in a 
gesture of inclusion and support. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Robinson, who was home in New York, recalled hearing what  
Reese had done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a very supportive gesture, and very  
instinctive on Pee Wee's part,'' she said. ``You shouldn't forget 
that Pee Wee was the captain, and he led the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Carl Erskine will never forget Reese's bravery.  
</P>
<P>
	``Think of the guts that took,'' he said. ``Pee Wee had to go  
home (to segregated Louisville) and answer to his friends. ... I 
told Jackie later that (Reese's gesture) helped my race more than 
his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 people attended the service at Southeast Christian  
Church for Reese, including nearly all the surviving Boys of 
Summer: Erskine; Duke Snider; Don Zimmer (who took a temporary 
leave from his post as bench coach of the New York Yankees); Joe 
Black; Don Newcombe; Ralph Branca; Clyde King -- even the deeply 
private Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a teammate for four years, a friend for 40,'' Koufax  
said. ``What is there to say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southeast minister Bob Russell eulogized Reese, an eight-time  
All-Star who played on seven pennant winners and one World Series 
winner, and who followed his playing career with one in 
broadcasting. The 45-minute service included video clips and a 
rendition of ``Amazing Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a lot of great baseball players, a lot of  
well-known announcers,'' Russell said. ``Pee Wee Reese is more 
remembered for being a good man, a gentleman, a leader, a 
competitor, a courageous person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell noted that ``Teammates,'' a book about Reese and  
Robinson and the friendship that grew between them, is now used to 
teach racial tolerance in some elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, whose father Walter moved  
the team from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, was impressed as a teen-ager 
by the esteem in which Reese's Boys of Summer teammates held their 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pee Wee had something, today you'd call it people skills,''  
O'Malley said. ``He knew how to communicate. I think he would have 
been an extraordinary manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung, a fellow  
Louisvillian, remembered playing golf with Reese and traveling with 
him to sign autographs at sports shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really something special when we went to New York,'' he  
said. ``His lines were as long as Joe DiMaggio's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the tradition, he was the greatest Dodger of them  
all,'' Snider said, remembering a trip to Hawaii with Reese and 
Zimmer to attend the baseball winter meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a big chair there that was called the `Kahuna  
chair,''' Snider said. ``Zimmer said to him, `Captain, that's your 
chair.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not all that analytical to be able to put into words what  
it was,'' Snider added. ``Whenever anyone needed any help, you went 
to Pee Wee, or he went to them. He was very concerned about each 
individual on the ball club and their happiness. Whenever anyone 
was having family problems, or in a slump, he'd help them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the way he handled himself.''

<HEADLINE> Ethics Questioned in Kans. Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A wealthy family's funding of college  
classes for lawmakers and judges has raised questions about whether 
it is improperly influencing the workings of government. 
</P>
<P>
	A state ethics commission was expected to review the legality of  
lawmakers accepting tuition, lodging and other expenses for a 
five-day economics course funded by the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation is run by Koch family members and executives for  
Koch Industries, the nation's second-largest privately held 
company. Its assets include agricultural, refining, pipeline and 
petrochemical businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty legislators have signed up for the first class at the  
University of Kansas. The issue before the ethics commission today 
is a state law that forbids a legislator from receiving more than 
$40 a year from an interest that has business before the 
Legislature, said Burdett Loomis, interim director of the Dole 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related matter, a district judge last week removed himself  
from hearing a Koch case in Wichita after news reports of his 
participation in a Koch-funded University of Kansas Economic 
Institutes for State Judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The judicial program curriculum advocated pro-business economic  
theories, according to The Wichita Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the hundreds of judges attending the classes was District  
Judge C. Robert Bell, who had been overseeing a Koch Industries 
lawsuit in Wichita against a chemical company until he withdrew 
from the case last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges' classes have been held since 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	The economic classes for lawmakers, which begin in November, are  
funded by a $250,000 grant from the Koch foundation to the 
university's endowment fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koch foundation, funded in 1953, has donated millions of  
dollars over the years for everything from swimming pools to 
university classes, said Mary Beth Jarvis, spokeswoman for Koch 
Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kochs have a lot of things they believe in and for years  
and years and years they have supported community organizations and 
educational institutions they think add value to our community,'' 
she said. ``The idea we would do that for control seems very 
farfetched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler Lockett, one of three Kansas supreme court justices who  
attended a Koch seminar, said the funding was no ``big deal'' 
because it is not that unusual for private industry to fund classes 
for judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockett, a political science major in college, credited the  
course for giving him a better understanding of economics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps me understand some economic theories -- but you aren't  
going to change anybody's basic background and how you decide 
cases,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Guards Win $300 Each From Denny's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Six black and three white prison guards were  
awarded $300 each in damages Thursday from a Denny's restaurant 
whose manager told them they didn't ``look right together'' and 
ordered them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge awarded compensatory damages in the non-jury  
trial but said punitive damages were unwarranted for the ``less 
than 10-minute encounter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guards sued the restaurant chain for discrimination,  
claiming an employee told them the restaurant was out of food when 
they arrived on Jan. 2, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When they protested, manager Carlos Ibarra told them to call a  
company complaint line and said the 24-hour restaurant was closed. 
Seven guards testified that Ibarra commented they didn't ``look 
right together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Denny's Inc. claimed the guards were aggressive and  
rude. Ibarra was fired for violating company policy by closing the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the judge's decision in this case,'' Denny's said  
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been operating under a consent decree not to  
discriminate since reaching a $46 million agreement with the 
federal government five years ago.

<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- Self Possessed, who set a world record in  
winning the Hambletonian, is bypassing the Yonkers Trot, the second 
leg of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old colt ran a 1:51 3/5 at the Hambletonian, but will  
compete in the American National at Balmoral in Crete, Ill., on 
Aug. 28, the day of the Yonkers Trot. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean I won't have a top contender in the Yonkers  
Trot,'' trainer Ron Gurfein said. ``I have entered Raffaello 
Ambrosio and I'm on record now that he can win the Yonkers Trot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raffaello Ambrosio, driven by Jack Moiseyev, finished fourth in  
the Hambletonian in a career-best 1:53 4/5 on Aug. 7. The bay colt

<HEADLINE> Global Temp Co. Adecco Buys Olsten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The largest global temporary staffing company is  
now also the dominant player in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide industry leader Adecco SA on Wednesday announced it  
had purchased the general and information technology staffing 
operations of Olsten Corp., one of the top firms in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Adecco, based in Switzerland, said it will pay about $710  
million, or about $8.75 a share, for the business and assume $750 
million worth of Olsten's debts. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, the Melville, N.Y.-based Olsten will spin  
off its health care services business into a new publicly traded 
company. The new firm will be headed by current Olsten president 
and chief executive Ed Blechschmidt and continue to provide home 
nursing services. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Marcon, senior equity analyst at First Union Capital  
Markets in Richmond, Va., said consolidation among the top global 
temporary staffing companies is likely to continue over the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 4,000 temporary staffing companies in the U.S.  
alone, which makes the $63 billion industry ripe for acquisitions 
by the bigger players, said Marcon. ``The deals just keep getting 
larger and larger and more strategic in nature. This is an early 
part of that overall trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olsten operates more than 1,000 offices in 14 countries. Prior  
to the purchase, Adecco operated 3,200 offices in 52 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Olsten shareholders will receive shares in the new  
health services company, as well as cash and Adecco shares traded 
in the United States, known as American depositary receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by Adecco's shareholders, who will  
meet Sept. 10 to vote on the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsten's health care business, which had been under  
investigation by the Justice Department over allegations of 
Medicare fraud, agreed last month to pay $61 million to settle the 
charges. Olsten will pay nearly $51 million in a civil settlement, 
and its subsidiary, Kimberly Home Health Care, Inc., agreed to pay 
$10 million in criminal fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Olsten rose 25 cents to $9.75 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Trading in Adecco was suspended on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market.

<HEADLINE> Christmas Computer Virus Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A computer virus timed to strike Windows PCs on  
Christmas Day has yet to pose a significant threat because of its 
low prevalence, but anti-virus software makers are gearing up to 
help computer users combat it. 
</P>
<P>
	The new virus, named W32/Kriz.3862, is designed to damage  
Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT machines. The virus 
overwrites data on hard drives and destroys the memory that stores 
a computer's setup, sometimes making a computer unbootable. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two cases of the virus have been detected ``in the wild''  
so far, said Sal Viveros, group marketing manager in the virus 
defense division of Santa-Clara, Calif.-based Network Associates, 
maker of the McAfee virus protection software. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Associates ranks the virus as a ``medium risk'' because  
of its low prevalence. Viveros said Network Associates would 
upgrade the assessment if more cases of the virus are reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus contains a profane, anti-religious message, Viveros  
said Thursday. ``That could be why it may hit on Christmas,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another maker of virus protection software, Central Command  
Inc., said the W32/Kriz virus is more destructive than the 
Chernobyl virus that recently attacked 300,000 computers in Asia 
and the Middle East. That virus did not affect Windows NT machines, 
used by businesses, as the W32/Kriz virus does. 
</P>
<P>
	``This virus contains lethal instructions,'' said Keith Peer,  
president of Medina, Ohio-based Central Command. ``Unlike the 
Chernobyl virus, it can infiltrate a business environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have developed software that detects and disables  
the virus.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Putin Agree on New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin and his new prime  
minister, Vladimir Putin, have agreed on the makeup of the new 
Cabinet, which will be little changed from the old one, Putin said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair met in the Kremlin this morning, and Putin said  
afterward that the president had approved a list of ministers he 
had submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin made his remarks at a session of the acting Cabinet  
members, and did not divulge names of the new ministers, but few 
changes were expected. Putin has proposed a new justice minister, 
but has not announced any other planned changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister, who was appointed just last week in the  
latest government shake-up, said his priorities included 
preparations for parliamentary elections in December and a draft 
budget that will be submitted to lawmakers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of work will be needed to finalize the budget,'' Putin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's economy remains in recession and the government is  
chronically short of cash. However, the economy has shown some 
signs of stabilizing this year following a financial meltdown in 
August of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin, who has spent most of his career in the country's  
security services, has not said what his economic policies will be 
beyond offering a general endorsement of market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	He did say that the government was spending almost all its money  
on current needs, and should set aside more for investment in 
science, education and social development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Current spending is too large and estimates of our development  
needs are too low,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we lose our positions here, we will be relegated to the  
position of a third-rate country and we would never climb back 
again,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Putin is not expected to launch any major initiatives  
due to the government's lack of money and the looming parliamentary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin is hoping its allies can make a strong showing and  
reduce the clout of the Communist Party and other hardline factions 
that currently dominate parliament's lower house. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Yeltsin's inability to solve the country's economic,  
political and social problems gives his allies little on which to 
base their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, considered the country's  
most popular politician at the moment, joined an alliance this week 
that includes Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and several regional 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is seen as a direct challenge to Yeltsin and his  
allies, but Primakov claimed the coalition was not an 
``anti-presidential force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov, who was fired by Yeltsin in May despite his  
popularity, said he was not seeking ``revenge'' against the 
president.

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports on Drug-Resistant Staph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal health officials have confirmed the  
deaths of four Midwestern children linked to drug-resistant staph 
infections they acquired outside a hospital setting. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug-resistant staph was once largely confined to hospitals and  
nursing homes, but the children's deaths in Minnesota and North 
Dakota show it may be spreading to communities, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the first deaths we're aware of that have appeared  
in the United States and in medical literature,'' said Dr. J. Todd 
Weber of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. ``How 
rare or how common it is, we don't know yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children, ages 1 to 13, acquired methicillin-resistant  
staphylococcus aureus infections between 1997 and 1999. None of the 
children had been recently hospitalized before their deaths, the 
CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Staph bacteria are the No. 1 cause of hospital-acquired  
infections in the United States, blamed for 13 percent of the 2 
million hospital infections annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of staph bacteria infections contracted by hospital  
patients in 1997 were resistant to a large class of antibiotics, up 
from 1974, when only 2 percent were drug-resistant, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors recently have seen an increase in drug-resistant  
infections acquired outside of hospitals although CDC researchers 
said they don't know yet to what extent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resistant bacteria have been around 30 years but these  
four cases suggest it may be getting into the general population,'' 
said Dr. Timothy Naimi, a medical epidemiologists with the CDC.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Rise in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's money market mutual funds moved  
closer to $1.5 trillion in total assets this week, two years after 
first crossing above $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of the nation's retail money market mutual funds rose by  
$1.60 billion in the latest week to $889.44 billion, the Investment 
Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $1.50 billion to $738.06 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets rose by $102.0 million to $151.38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $8.26 billion  
to $609.05 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $7.95 billion to $560.30 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $306.2 million to 
$48.74 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.498 trillion for the week.  
The first time total assets surpassed $1 trillion was in the weekly 
reporting period ended Aug. 6, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.489 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.53 percent from 4.48 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.49 percent from 4.48 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.63 percent from 4.58  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.59 percent from 4.58 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
56 days, down from 57 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.05 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held steady at 0.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.29 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.27 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.65 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.62 
percent; 4.92 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.90 percent; and 
5.14 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fryar Returns To Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Irving Fryar was perfectly content spending  
his football retirement covering football. Then the Washington 
Redskins changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really had gotten to a point where I really though it was  
over,'' Fryar said Thursday as he signed a three-year contract with 
the Redskins. ``I was out with Channel 6 covering Eagles training 
camp and everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any desires to come back, but now I'm here and  
everything points to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Pro Bowl receiver said he didn't want to retire at  
the end of the season, but wasn't in the Philadelphia Eagles' plans 
and didn't want to move his family again. He was lured back because 
the Redskins are close enough that he won't have to uproot, and 
give him a chance to end his career on a positive note after a 
dismal season with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, personally, last year was the worst year of my life,''  
said Fryar, who caught 46 passes for 556 yards. ``My goal this year 
is to have fun again. I didn't have any fun last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, 37 next month, instantly becomes the only proven 16-game  
receiver in the Redskins lineup. Initially, he'll compete with 
James Thrash and Chris Thomas for the No. 3 spot behind Michael 
Westbrook and Albert Connell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming here to start now,'' Fryar said. ``I'm coming  
here to help. I'm not coming here to create waves or cause any 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the contract runs for three years to ease the Redskins'  
burden under the salary cap, Fryar is committed to playing only the 
first year and maybe the second. The Washington Post said in its 
Friday editions that the contract provides a $600,000 signing bonus 
and a $400,000 salary, plus performance incentives, for the first 
year. Compensation for a second season totals $2 million, and $3 
million for a third season, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings so much to the table in terms of skill and veteran  
leadership,'' coach Norv Turner said. ``He is a welcome addition to 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar last made the Pro Bowl in 1997, when he had 86 receptions  
for Philadelphia. He is 17 yards short of becoming the eighth 
player to reach 12,000 receiving yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working out a little bit,'' Fryar said. ``It won't  
take me long to get into game shape and contribute to the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Redskins are still pursuing another retired  
player, Chris Doleman, 37, who quit after a 15-sack season last 
year with San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> McNair To Miss Game With Back Spasms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve McNair, troubled with back spasms,  
will not start Friday when the Tennessee Titans play an exhibition 
game at Arizona, coach Jeff Fisher said on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has not practiced since Sunday's loss to the Kansas City  
Chiefs, because of his back. He is expected back in the lineup Aug. 
27 when Tennessee plays the Atlanta Falcons in the first game at 
Adelphia Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sounding the alarm with Steve, we're not  
concerned,'' Fisher said. ``We're being smart. Steve's getting 
better, but we want to make sure he's healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neil O'Donnell will start in McNair's place. The 10th-year  
veteran was signed by the Titans on July 23 as insurance against an 
injury to McNair, who has started the last 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell was 10-for-17 for 73 yards against the Chiefs in  
relief of McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said he expects O'Donnell to play into the second  
quarter. Rookie Kevin Daft will replace him, and Steve Matthews 
will finish.

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped sharply against the yen today as  
investors rushed to buy Japan's currency on growing optimism about 
the economy. Tokyo stocks edged lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 111.63 in afternoon trading, down 1.45  
yen from its level late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late level 
of 112.03 yen overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar hasn't traded that low late in Tokyo since Jan. 13  
when it was quoted at 111.55 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 12.52 points, or 0.07  
percent, to close at 17,879.74. On Wednesday, the average rose 
32.17 points, or 0.18 percent, to finish at 17,892.26. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar sank against the yen as investors sold the greenback  
following its plunge overnight, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was alos sharply lower, falling to  
116.98 yen from 119.30 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were buying yen as they moved funds into Japanese  
assets, betting that Japan's long-suffering economy may finally be 
on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are real money flows moving into Japan from Europe. It  
appears that until that subsides, the yen is going to keep getting 
stronger,'' Suzuki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to as low as 111.20 yen in Asian trading and  
moved as high as 112.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's fall was fueled by rumors that Eisuke  
Sakakibara, a former influential finance ministery official, had 
suggeted Japanese companies could withstand a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen can hurt Japan's exporters by forcing them to raise  
prices abroad or accept less in terms of yen from their overseas 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock exchange, share prices fell slightly amid  
worries that the stronger currency would do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip shares sank, though the decline was offset somewhat by  
investor interest in domestic shares, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many companies can't make money with the yen above 113 yen''  
against the dollar, said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative 
strategy group at Jardine Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section dropped 3.08 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,475.35. 
The TOPIX added 4.29 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,478.43 the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 493  
million shares, down from 502 million shares Wednesday. Declines 
outnumbered advances 709 to 458, while 135 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8700 percent from Wednesday's close of 1.9350 
percent, boosting its price to 99.40 yen from 98.86 yen.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Says Station Wagons Are Hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saturn Corp. President Cynthia Trudell said  
Wednesday that station wagons appear to be staging a comeback, and 
the automaker hopes to exploit it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe firmly there will be a resurgence in the wagon,''  
Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn, the small-car unit of General Motors Corp., last month  
launched its first midsize sedan and wagon. The L-series is the 
first new model line for Saturn since it began selling its S-series 
subcompact cars in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The L-series offers a lower-cost alternative to the new luxury  
wagons that have recently arrived here from Europe, where wagons 
are far more popular. Saab, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW and 
Volkswagen have wagon versions of popular sedans in the U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Offerings in the midsize segment are fewer. Japan's Subaru has  
done well with the Legacy and Outback wagons and Ford Motor Co. 
offers a wagon version of its popular Taurus and the Mercury Sable. 
But in recent years, Toyota Motor Corp. eliminated its Camry wagon 
and Honda Motor Co. did the same with the Accord wagon. 
</P>
<P>
	With fewer automakers competing in the lower end of the market,  
Saturn is betting its reputation for friendly, no-haggle service 
will help drive up L-series sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong influence now coming in from Europe on the  
Audi, the Volvo wagon and the like. And people are seeing this as 
an alternative,'' Trudell told reporters during a briefing. ``We 
feel that's a really nice niche we can carve out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Saturn dealers are expecting the wagon to represent 20  
percent to 30 percent of their sales with the L-series' arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn's L-series wagons include the LW1 with a four-cylinder  
engine for $19,275 and the LW2, with a V6, for $21,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 2 percent of light vehicle sales nationally are  
wagons, said Christopher Cedergren, an industry consultant with 
Nextrend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market for wagons overall is small,'' he said. ``That  
doesn't mean there isn't demand there. Subaru is creating new 
fortunes based on a reincarnation of the wagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A key to the growth of wagon sales is whether they can project a  
``cool image'' rather than conjuring up the big, family-hauling 
station wagons of decades ago, Cedergren said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a luncheon speech at the National Press Club, Trudell  
endorsed the company's unique labor-management contract, which 
gives workers a say in how the company is run and rewards increased 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, before Trudell became president and chief  
executive, workers at the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., upset 
with dwindling bonuses and their role in management decisions, gave 
their union leaders authority to call a strike. None was ever 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like democracy, the partnership process is not always smooth.  
It can be downright messy,'' Trudell said. ``We can't reach 
creative solutions without conflict. Any successful relationship 
must have room for tension and disagreement.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators Doubt Mercy Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- David Coughlin's family wants to believe his death  
was a mercy killing at the hands of a sympathetic and honorable 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Raffi Kodikian says Coughlin -- dehydrated, suffering and panicky  
-- had begged to be put out of his misery after they became lost 
while camping in the New Mexico desert. Kodikian stabbed him twice 
in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to believe Raffi did this out of love, and not out  
of vengeance,'' Sandy Hobson, a co-worker of Coughlin's, said of 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators won't say exactly what they think happened in  
Carlsbad Caverns National Park on Aug. 7, but one thing is clear: 
They don't buy Kodikian's story. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, who met Coughlin while attending school in Boston, is  
charged with murder. He returned to his family's home Sunday in 
Doylestown, Pa., after posting $50,000 bail but must return to New 
Mexico for trial. His attorney did not return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary McCandless, chief of detectives for the Eddy County  
Sheriff's Department, said this is as unusual and puzzling as any 
case he's seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, 25, and Coughlin, 26, arrived at the park Aug. 4 and  
got a two-day camping permit. Four days later, rescuers found a 
dehydrated Kodikian in a lean-to. When a ranger asked where his 
companion was, Kodikian said he had killed him to end his suffering 
and buried him in a shallow grave nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	McCandless questions whether Kodikian and Coughlin were  
hopelessly lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Their campsite was only 250 feet from the trail and a mile away  
from Coughlin's Mazda. Had they climbed to the top of the canyon 
they would have seen the park's visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
	``People actually have gotten lost there, but it didn't take  
them long to find their way out,'' McCandless said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also question Kodikian's claim that Coughlin  
suffered so much he begged to die. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed that Coughlin was moderately to severely  
dehydrated, which could have impaired his judgment, but Kodikian 
felt fine an hour after he was found and given food and water, 
McCandless said. Also, Kodikian was coherent when park rangers 
found him, and had enough strength to bury Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real, real thirsty and they hurt, but they weren't  
close to death,'' McCandless said. 
</P>
<P>
	The detective also said he considers the fact that Coughlin was  
stabbed twice as evidence that there was a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery has sent local, state and federal investigators in  
search of whether something happened on the young men's 
cross-country road trip to cause its tragic ending. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trek, Coughlin kept a journal in a spiral-bound  
notebook given to him by his girlfriend. With that journal in hand, 
the FBI is retracing the young men's steps -- questioning people 
they may have met, analyzing handwriting and fingerprints, even 
working with the behavioral science unit to figure out what made 
them tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin initiated the journey. He had quit his job as a  
management analyst with the town of Wellesley, Mass., and was 
heading to the University of California at Santa Barbara. He 
planned to get a master's degree in environmental science. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, who had traveled cross-country alone after graduating  
from Northeastern University two years ago, agreed to accompany 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men were described as bright, articulate and engaging, and  
each had a streak of the romantic outdoorsman in him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-part freelance series in The Boston Globe, Kodikian  
portrayed his earlier trip -- a sometimes dangerous, sometimes 
ecstatic series of encounters -- as an attempt to emulate Beat 
writer Jack Kerouac. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin, too, loved the outdoors, although his chosen medium of  
expression was photography. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men met in the 1990s when a friend introduced them while  
Kodikian attended Northeastern and Coughlin went to the University 
of Massachusetts at Amherst, 75 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	They became so close they talked to each other on the phone  
every day, according to Hobson. Kodikian lived in Boston and 
Coughlin lived 20 miles away in Millis, but they spent a lot of 
time together, at movies, bars, skiing, biking and snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin's girlfriend of six months, Sonnet Frost, recalled  
recently for the Milford Daily News how, before he left for the 
West Coast, she gave him the notebook with the inscription: ``While 
you're away from me, you'll be in God's hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a memorial service last week in Wellesley for Coughlin, his  
brother Michael asked mourners to pray for Kodikian.

	Time Running Out for Quake Victims  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Hope is fading today for thousands of  
people buried alive by an earthquake that has killed almost 7,000 
people in Turkey. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit admitted today what 
many Turks feared -- even the hundreds of professional rescue 
workers sent in from around the world will not be able to save all 
those under the rubble. Many earthquake victims will die of thirst 
and exposure. ``Thousands of buildings are in ruins,'' Ecevit said. 
``It is not possible to reach all of them.'' Some 35,000 people 
could be still buried under debris.

	KLA Says It Has Disarmed  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Albanian rebels rejected  
accusations they have orchestrated ongoing violence in Kosovo and 
insisted today that they have complied with a deadline to turn over 
weapons to NATO peacekeepers. The Kosovo Liberation Army's 
statements came a day after attackers hurled grenades and firebombs 
at the main Serbian Orthodox Church. Ethnic violence persists in 
Kosovo despite the presence of more than 40,000 NATO-led 
peacekeepers. Most of the unrest has been revenge attacks on a 
dwindling Serb minority, prompting NATO and U.N. officials 
overseeing Kosovo to hint of a KLA role.

	Navy Predicts Widespread Y2K Failure  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Navy report predicts ``probable'' or  
``likely'' failures in electrical and water systems for many cities 
because of the Year 2000 technology problem -- an assessment more 
dire than any other made by the government. President Clinton's top 
Y2K adviser called the Navy's conclusions overly cautious, saying 
they assumed that major utilities would fail unless proved 
otherwise. The most recent version of the study, updated less than 
two weeks ago, predicted ``probable'' or ``likely'' partial 
failures in electric utilities that serve nearly 60 of roughly 400 
Navy and Marine Corps facilities.

	China Cautions U.S. on Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a news conference today, China's ambassador  
voiced opposition to any increase in the flow of U.S. arms to 
Taiwan -- particularly deployment of a U.S.-developed missile 
defense shield to protect the island. Li Zhaoxing said Beijing 
would not rule out force to stop Taiwanese independence or 
``possible foreign intervention.'' He also suggested China is 
concerned that Taiwan could become an issue in the U.S. 
presidential campaign and other political races. ``The issue of 
Taiwan is entirely China's internal matter,'' he said. 

</P>
<P>
	Army Won't Test Missile Again  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two successful tests of an Army missile  
designed to shoot down enemy missiles at the edge of space, the 
Pentagon announced today it will skip a planned third test. The 
Pentagon last year said it would require the missile contractor, 
Lockheed Martin Corp., to validate its design by scoring three 
successful intercepts. The missile had failed in its first six 
attempts to shoot down a mock warhead. Army Maj. Gen. Peter 
Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have ``proven'' 
that the missile works. 

</P>
<P>
	Ken Starr May Quit Early  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's imprint would be on a final  
report focusing on President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, even 
though a successor may finish the independent counsel's work, legal 
experts say. Starr informed a three-judge panel earlier this month 
that he plans to leave before his office's work is finished, a 
legal source said today. ``He indicated there were allegations to 
be prosecuted or declined,'' said the source. 

</P>
<P>
	School Enrollment Swells to Record  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's school enrollment swelled to a  
record for the fourth consecutive year, riding the crest of a 
second baby boom and increased immigration, the Education 
Department said today. Public and private school pupils in 
kindergarten through 12th grade will step into their classrooms 
this fall 53.2 million strong, surpassing last fall's enrollment by 
a half-million, according to an annual report that surveys schools 
on their fall enrollments.

	Dow Ends Down 27.54  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 27.54 at 10,963.84. Declining issues on 
the New York Stock Exchange led advancers 1,616-1,375. The Nasdaq 
was down 36.30 at 2,621.43.

	WNBA's Kim Perrot Dies at 32  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Kim Perrot, the Houston Comets point guard often  
described as the heart and soul of the two-time WNBA champions, 
died today of lung cancer. She was 32. Perrot was signed three 
years ago as a developmental player for the fledgling Women's 
National Basketball Association franchise here. Despite her 
5-foot-5 frame, Perrot quickly became a starter and crowd favorite 
noted for ferocious play that helped the Comets win consecutive 
championships in 1997 and 1998, the league's inaugural seasons.

<HEADLINE> Five Americans Killed in Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Georgia man and four of his young  
grandchildren were among the thousands killed in the earthquake 
that shook western Turkey. Two other family members were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the only American casualties known so far from the  
Turkish tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead were identified by family members as Nizam Kilic of  
Marietta and his four grandchildren: Jeffrey Michael, 6; Jennifer 
Kayla, 5; David Tansan, 2; and Katherine ``Katie'' Michelle, 9 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, Babur Kilic, a Marietta anesthesiologist, had  
planned to join his wife, their five children and his parents this 
weekend in Turkey for a vacation. Instead, he left for Istanbul 
Wednesday to make funeral arrangements, other family members told 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilic's wife, Jan, and 6-year-old daughter, Natalie, survived  
the quake. Kilic's mother is in critical condition and Jan Kilic is 
in an Istanbul hospital, although the family has not yet learned 
her condition. Natalie was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, a White House spokesman said U.S. rescue teams were  
working today to free three people pinned amid rubble from the 
earthquake. The three -- a 5-year-old girl, a 24-year-old woman and 
a man of undetermined age -- were found alive amid rubble in the 
hard-hit city of Izmit, National Security Council spokesman David 
Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 search and rescue experts from Fairfax, Va., and  
Miami are stationed in the southeast quadrant of Izmit, Leavy said. 
The search teams began round-the-clock shifts early today, Leavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Air National Guard C-130 transport planes were to leave  
U.S. bases today and Friday, carrying medical supplies and 
emergency equipment, White House and Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes will fly to Istanbul from Channel Islands, Calif.,  
Charlotte, N.C. and Cheyenne, Wyo., a Pentagon spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth U.S. plane, a C-17, will carry 2,200 pounds of  
firefighting equipment, chiefly for use against an oil refinery 
fire ignited by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also plans to bring in a water purification  
unit that can handle emergency water needs for about 10,000 people, 
along with a 20-member U.S. medical team based in Europe, Leavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, three Navy ships with 2,100 Marines were ordered Wednesday  
to head for the Aegean Sea to provide humanitarian assistance to 
earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit are due to  
arrive near Istanbul on Sunday, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three ships, the USS Kearsarge, the USS Ponce and the USS  
Gunston Hall, have about 630 beds, six operating rooms and five 
X-ray rooms, eight doctors, three dental officers and 88 medical 
corpsmen. Their 22 helicopters can provide medical evacuations from 
the damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit recently completed  
peacekeeping duties in Kosovo, where they were the first American 
forces to enter the Serb province after the war ended in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy said there is no estimate yet of the cost of U.S. relief  
efforts in Turkey.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Won't Work Too Hard on Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton celebrated his 53rd  
birthday Thursday by sharing a few inside jokes with White House 
staff, and then leaving Washington for more than two weeks of 
vacation and politicking. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised reporters traveling with him to Martha's Vineyard:  
``I'll try not to work you too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, presidential friend Vernon Jordan met Clinton's plane at  
the island off the Massachusetts coast. As in past years, Jordan 
planned a small birthday celebration for Clinton at Jordan's 
vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the estimated 40 guests were Maurice Tempelsman, former  
companion to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; former Clinton budget 
director Franklin Raines; NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol and his 
wife, actress Susan Saint James; CNN correspondent Charlayne 
Hunter-Gault and her husband, Ronald Gault; investment banker 
Steven Ratner and author William Styron. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 members of the White House staff and volunteers threw  
Clinton a much larger birthday party earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton sat under an  
umbrella on the White House South Lawn while listening to a country 
western band from Arkansas called The Greasy Greens. 
</P>
<P>
	National Economic Council head Gene Sperling led a mock game of  
``Jeopardy'' based on little-known administration trivia: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What are James Carville and Dick Morris?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No, not political handlers who helped Clinton win in 1992 and  
1996. They're the reason Kansas educators rejected the theory of 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has been officially mum on the subject of the  
Kansas state school board's recent decision to de-emphasize the 
teaching of the biological concept of evolution. Critics in Kansas 
and educators elsewhere have called the move a capitulation to 
religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	After the music and jokes, Clinton, the first lady, daughter  
Chelsea and first dog Buddy walked to the presidential helicopter 
for the first leg of their trip to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving a short time later at Andrews Air Force Base, where the  
Air Force One jet is housed, Clinton let Buddy off the leash. The 
chocolate lab bounded up the steps of the plane ahead of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the plane took off, Clinton popped his head into the  
press compartment in the back of the plane and offered assurances 
the vacation would be, well, mostly a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his family are dividing their vacation this year  
between the island and New York state, a nod to Mrs. Clinton's 
senatorial aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fifth Martha's Vineyard vacation for the Clintons.  
They will spend nine days on the 20-acre Oyster Pond estate of 
developer Richard Friedman, their host for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Mrs. Clinton planned to visit a church on the  
neighboring island of Nantucket as part of a program that 
highlights historic sites to encourage preservation of the nation's 
culture and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 28, the Clintons leave the island for equally tony East  
Hampton, N.Y., and a Democratic National Committee fund-raising 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they head to Skaneateles, a quiet resort town of 7,500  
people on Skaneateles Lake just southwest of Syracuse, for five 
days. The Clintons will stay at the lakeside home of real estate 
developer Thomas McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert has acknowledged plans for  
the Clintons to make appearances during their stay in New York. 
Mrs. Clinton is considering a 2000 run for the seat of retiring 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Quake Magnitude Set at 7.4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists are reassessing the Turkish earthquake's  
characteristics, with the quake's magnitude now downgraded by 
nearly half a magnitude point below initial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports pegged the quake at magnitude 7.8. But the head  
of Istanbul's Kandilli Observatory, Ahmet Mete Isikara, set the 
magnitude Wednesday at 7.4. 
</P>
<P>
	American geologists concur with the latest figure. That would  
make the quake along the North Anatolian fault a significant event, 
but not among the most powerful of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like we're reaching a consensus,'' said geophysicist  
Jim Dewey of the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, 
Colo. ``I wouldn't be surprised if it continued to change by a 
tenth or two-tenths of a magnitude point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The higher magnitude reported in the hours immediately following  
Tuesday's quake reflected measurements from a small number of 
monitoring stations around the world that were recording a single 
type of seismic wave from the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised magnitude is the product of a computer analysis of  
the entire seismic spectrum, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reflects the energy radiated by all the different waves,''  
Dewey said. ``It's stronger and weaker in different directions, 
depending on the orientation of the fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Further analysis also shows the underground factors that  
contributed to the earthquake might have been more complicated than 
initially believed. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Anatolian fault runs east-west across Turkey and is  
near the junction of two continental plates that grind against each 
other within the Earth's crust -- the Eurasian plate and the African 
plate. The Eurasian plate sits to the north and moves westward. The 
African plate sits to the south and moves to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	When earthquakes occur, the fault slips horizontally -- in this  
case, to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, geologists added a third plate to the mix. The  
smaller Arabian plate -- which also influences earthquakes in Iraq 
and Iran -- sits on an angle to its larger neighbors. It is moving 
in a north-northwest direction relative to the Eurasian plate at a 
rate of 25 millimeters per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of the third plate squeezing into the same area  
adds more pressure to the North Anatolian fault from a different 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from U.S. agencies and universities are expected  
to arrive in Turkey by Friday. Their assessments of earthquake 
damage to buildings, roads and other features are expected to take 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also will analyze the effectiveness of disaster  
relief services, including search and rescue, medical care, food 
and temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never enough people or equipment, and rescues always  
wind up being carried out by neighbors,'' said Susan Tubbesing, 
director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute in 
Oakland, Ca. ``By the time dogs arrive on the scene, they're 
retrieving bodies.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Work Toward Noise Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All but 14 percent of airplanes flown by major  
U.S. carriers last year met noise standards designed to bring more 
peace to communities near airports, and carriers are on track to 
comply fully with a Dec. 31 deadline for quieter jets, a government 
report finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on those results, transportation officials said Thursday  
the U.S. fleet is quieter than ever and will get even better by 
year's end when the final standards, known as Stage 3, take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	They require airlines to stop using noisier Stage 2 planes, such  
as older triple-engine Boeing 727s, unless they have been fitted 
with noise-damping devices, and rely instead on Stage 3 planes like 
the twin-engine Boeing 757. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes roughly five Stage 3 aircraft to create the noise of  
just one Stage 2 airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA and the entire aviation community are committed to a  
cleaner, less noisy airspace system, and this report shows we are 
living up to that commitment,'' said Federal Aviation 
Administration head Jane Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Congress voted to require the phased elimination of  
noisy jet airplanes by the end of this year. Airlines could comply 
by buying new planes or installing mufflers on existing aircraft by 
a set schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Dec. 31, 1998, operators had to reach an interim step  
toward Stage 3 compliance: either phase out 75 percent of their 
Stage 2 aircraft or operate a fleet of 75 percent Stage 3 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, issued jointly by the Transportation  
Department and the FAA, the nation's major airlines were 78.7 
percent complaint with the Stage 3 standards as of Dec. 31, 1997. 
By the end of last year, that figure had risen to 86 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A major airline is defined as one that has annual operating  
revenues of $1 billion or greater. For 1998, the airlines and their 
compliance percentages were: 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines (100), Southwest Airlines (91.8), America West  
(88.3), American Airlines (88.2), US Airways (87.9), Delta Air 
Lines (86.2), Continental (84.9), Northwest (84), United Airlines 
(83.4) and TWA (75). 
</P>
<P>
	The carriers were pleased with the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that the airlines have been working on  
actively for over 10 years,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman for the 
Air Transport Association. The trade group represents the major 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuscus said the airlines have spent over $100 billion in the  
process.

	``I've got a basement full of computer stuff that my wife says I  
need to get rid of,'' said John Shepard, who paid $1,300 for the 
MITS computer kit in late 1976 and kept modifying it over the 
years. ``Maybe this is the new home for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To mark the 25th anniversary of the personal computer,  
Texas-based Dell Computer held the contest. Shepard got a $15,000 
new system as a replacement for his museum donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Old clunkers like the MITS Altair, one of the earliest  
commercially available personal computers, and IBM card punch 
machines are the foundation of the museum, one of just a few in the 
country dedicated to preserving the history of computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim and Marie Petroff, founders of the San Diego Chapter of  
Independent Computer Consultants Association, started the museum in 
1983 because they were worried about companies junking their old 
machines when upgrading to new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just really hated to see it go into the trash heap, when we  
would say 20 years from now, 'Geez, we wish we had saved that,'' 
Petroff said in literature provided by the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Using their connections with other consultants and scores of  
computer companies, the couple, who now live north of Los Angeles, 
built their collection but didn't find a permanent home for it 
until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman College, the second-oldest computer college in the  
country, gave the couple some space at its suburban San Diego 
campus -- in what was once a bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize pieces are the Hollerith Manual Card Punch, based on a  
Herman Hollerith invention for taking the 1890 U.S. Census, and the 
Royal Precision Vacuum Tube Computer. Built in 1963, the Royal 
Precision cost $50,000 new. It contains 113 vacuum tubes, a drum 
memory disk and a paper tape reader and punch. 
</P>
<P>
	A display case shows the progression of storage disks, starting  
with one from 1965 that's the size of a tractor-trailer tire. It 
held 2.5 megabytes of data and had to be sandblasted to be erased. 
</P>
<P>
	Curator David Weil said he has had many offers to donate old  
Tandy TRS-80s or Apple IIe computers, but his stock room is full of 
those popular mid-80s computers. 
</P>
<P>
	He's looking for more MITA Atairs or the even rarer Apple I,  
single-board computer built by Stephen Wozniak. Only about 220 were 
sold by Wozniak and Steve Jobs for $666.66 before they upgraded the 
system and started Apple Computer Inc. in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's older than 1983, we're interested in it,'' said Weil,  
one of just two full-time staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who visit the museum usually see a computer that jogs  
their memory and ``it's like seeing an old friend again,'' said 
Rush Glick, education coordinator for the museum. ``And, 
everybody's got a war story to tell.''

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped sharply against the yen today as  
investors rushed to buy Japan's currency on growing optimism about 
the economy. Tokyo stocks edged lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 111.63 in afternoon trading, down 1.45  
yen from its level late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late level 
of 112.03 yen overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar hasn't traded that low late in Tokyo since Jan. 13  
when it was quoted at 111.55 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 12.52 points, or 0.07  
percent, to close at 17,879.74. On Wednesday, the average rose 
32.17 points, or 0.18 percent, to finish at 17,892.26. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar sank against the yen as investors sold the greenback  
following its plunge overnight, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was alos sharply lower, falling to  
116.98 yen from 119.30 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were buying yen as they moved funds into Japanese  
assets, betting that Japan's long-suffering economy may finally be 
on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are real money flows moving into Japan from Europe. It  
appears that until that subsides, the yen is going to keep getting 
stronger,'' Suzuki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to as low as 111.20 yen in Asian trading and  
moved as high as 112.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's fall was fueled by rumors that Eisuke  
Sakakibara, a former influential finance ministery official, had 
suggeted Japanese companies could withstand a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen can hurt Japan's exporters by forcing them to raise  
prices abroad or accept less in terms of yen from their overseas 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock exchange, share prices fell slightly amid  
worries that the stronger currency would do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip shares sank, though the decline was offset somewhat by  
investor interest in domestic shares, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many companies can't make money with the yen above 113 yen''  
against the dollar, said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative 
strategy group at Jardine Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section dropped 3.08 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,475.35. 
The TOPIX added 4.29 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,478.43 the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 493  
million shares, down from 502 million shares Wednesday. Declines 
outnumbered advances 709 to 458, while 135 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8700 percent from Wednesday's close of 1.9350 
percent, boosting its price to 99.40 yen from 98.86 yen.

<HEADLINE> Lutherans OK Pact With Episcopalians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Evangelical Lutheran Church in America delegates  
today approved a controversial unity pact with the Episcopal Church 
that has been under discussion for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 716 to 317, or 69.3 percent approval, slightly  
exceeding the two-thirds (67 percent) margin needed for passage. 
After the announcement, the Lutherans' national assembly members 
applauded and sang the hymn ``If You But Trust in God To Guide 
You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Lutherans have decided, Episcopalians will vote on the  
pact during their convention next year. Two years ago, the 
Episcopal Church gave overwhelming approval but the Lutheran 
assembly's vote fell just short of two-thirds. The pact has been 
slightly reworked since. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ``full communion'' pact, the churches will recognize  
and share each other's sacraments and clergy and cooperate in 
missionary projects, something supporters say will strengthen the 
ministry and prove helpful in urban and rural areas where church 
resources are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the churches have about 7.5 million members in 18,000  
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement requires Lutherans to follow an ordination  
practice known as the historic episcopate: Each bishop is installed 
by a laying on of hands by three predecessor bishops from a line 
believed to extend back to Christ's apostles. 
</P>
<P>
	That raised opposition within the Lutheran ranks. While Catholic  
and Orthodox churches, as well as Episcopalians, follow the 
practice, Lutheran teachings don't require such historic 
succession. Many of the world's Lutheran bodies do not practice it. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, at the same time the Lutheran delegates narrowly  
rejected the pact with the Episcopal Church, they approved pacts 
with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Reformed Church in America 
and United Church of Christ. Those were different in that none of 
them required changes in Lutheran tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, opponents said the Episcopal Church should be  
willing to take Lutherans as they are without requiring them to 
adopt the historic episcopate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jaynan Clark-Egland of Bonners Ferry, Idaho, said her  
opposition was ``based on scripture and the freedom of the 
Gospel.'' Bishops are no more sanctified than clergy, she said, and 
clergy no more than the laity. 
</P>
<P>
	Others considered the pact old-fashioned. The Rev. Thomas Lyberg  
of Convoy, Ohio, labeled it a ``political, ecclesiastical 
document'' that envisions ``maintenance to marginal congregations'' 
in both churches, rather than new evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James Hanson of Winters, Texas, called the proposal ``a  
move in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have so obviously not yet gained wide consensus among  
ourselves,'' declared the Rev. Stephanie Frey of Redwood Falls, 
Minn., who said Lutherans should forget the pact and tend to their 
own internal ``division and woundedness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the time had come for a change.  
</P>
<P>
	``We write the final chapter for this century in this  
assembly,'' said President Timothy Lull of Pacific Lutheran 
Theological Seminary in Berkeley, Calif. ``How does it end? With 
whimpering and squabbling that are, woefully, part of the dark side 
of Lutheranism past?''

<HEADLINE> Tax Cut Debate Rages During Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Girding for a fall clash over the budget and  
tax cuts, Republicans and Democrats are spending the lazy days of 
August trying to sell voters on their view of how to use projected 
federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanning the flames of political rhetoric, anti-tax activists are  
showering voters with letters and lawmakers with petitions during 
the summer congressional recess. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans have scheduled more than 600 events  
nationwide to extol the $792 billion, 10-year tax cut passed by 
Congress earlier this month. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
was in the Seattle suburbs Wednesday to tout the bill's gradual 
elimination of inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker, who plans appearances in seven states over the next  
10 days, said he was ``perplexed'' by President Clinton's pledge to 
veto the bill and said the president ``sees the surplus as a great 
opportunity to make government bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president's judgment is impaired by his desire to  
expand the size and scope of government,'' Hastert said. ``We see 
the surplus as the best opportunity to bring some fairness to the 
tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade, the bill also would reduce all income tax rates  
by one percentage point, cut capital gains taxes, improve 
retirement savings, ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by many 
two-income couples, gradually eliminate the alternative minimum 
tax, provide new breaks for education and health care and benefit 
large and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	At many GOP events, people affiliated with tax opposition groups  
are making a show of support for the GOP bill. In Texas, for 
example, about 150 members of Citizens for a Sound Economy -- 
including one dressed as the Grim Reaper for the inheritance tax -- 
planned to attend a town hall meeting with House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Tobias, the group's tax and budget director, said activists  
also are writing letters to newspaper editors and calling lawmakers 
``to deliver this clear message: Strike out new spending and 
deliver my tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another major tax cut supporter, the National Federation of  
Independent Business, is urging its 600,000 members to call, write 
or e-mail the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be sure the White House hears small business' voice  
on this critical issue,'' said Jack Faris, president of the 
business organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans believe their public relations blitz, focusing on  
careful explanation of the huge bill's many specific provisions for 
individuals, will overcome public indifference to tax cuts. That 
would put pressure on Clinton and Democrats to back a bigger cut 
than they currently favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to try to make it meaningful for the average  
person,'' said Laura Cox, spokeswoman for Sen. Paul Coverdell, 
R-Ga., who helps shape the Senate GOP agenda. ``Sometimes, people's 
reaction is different when they've had the plan explained to 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, have not mounted a coordinated anti-tax  
message for their members to use during the congressional break. So 
they are doing their own thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the more conservative Democrats, such as Rep. Allen Boyd  
of Florida, are holding town hall meetings to discuss their 
opposition. But many are stressing a positive agenda centered on 
Medicare drug benefits, Social Security and a patient's bill of 
rights. Others have written newspaper opinion articles explaining 
their votes against the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term health of the economy could be jeopardized by  
the enactment of such a massive tax cut,'' said Rep. William Coyne, 
D-Pa., writing in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats believe the tax bill's main purpose is to appeal  
to GOP constituencies such as Christian conservatives, business 
people and tax opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what the Republicans want to do is shore up their  
base,'' said Dan Maffei, spokesman for Democrats on the tax-writing 
Ways and Means Committee. ``They are going around and preaching to 
the converted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., sent  
Clinton a letter this week arguing that the estimated $2.9 trillion 
budget surplus is more than enough to cut taxes, save Social 
Security and Medicare and ensure adequate levels of government 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, there is no honest reason to veto this  
commonsense tax legislation,'' Hastert and Lott wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, however, believes that most people agree with  
them that the tax bill's benefits are skewed mainly toward 
wealthier people, would do little to protect the two big retirement 
programs and could trigger deep cuts in critical spending programs 
over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the GOP bill is vetoed after Congress returns in September,  
Clinton is willing to discuss a 10-year tax cut of roughly $300 
billion if these other priorities are met, spokesman Jake Siewert 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously open to discussing with them exactly how we  
would shape a tax cut within that parameter,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos: Not Exactly Ordinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- It's Friday night and there's music  
blaring from the downtown parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	People have come with their children and their dogs, folding  
chairs and pickup trucks to enjoy the weekly summer concert and to 
dance on the asphalt pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby a firecracker goes off and a dozen kids scatter in  
excitement. It's ordinary fun on a hot summer night. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is no ordinary town.  
</P>
<P>
	``The conversations can get pretty strange,'' says Russ Gordon,  
51, the pony-tailed owner of Gordon's Music Store, who's organized 
the summer concerts for years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the folding chairs, or leaning against a car fender, you're  
as likely to meet a nuclear physicist or experts on condensed 
matter or computerized fluid dynamics, as you are a waitress or a 
local cowpoke. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Los Alamos, a product of the nuclear age. A few blocks  
from Gordon's shop the municipal building rests on a site where 54 
years ago physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and other scientists made 
the world's first atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	A town of 18,000 people, perched nearly a mile and a half above  
sea level on a mesa known as the Pajarito (Little Bird) Plateau, 
the town was until 1957 closed to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Alamos National Laboratory, which encompasses some 43  
square miles, is across a canyon bridge from downtown. But 
community and lab could not be more intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12,400 people work at the lab and at its associated  
contracting companies, including more than 4,600 with advanced 
degrees -- a third of them Ph.Ds. High lab salaries make Los Alamos 
among the wealthiest communities in the country with an average 
household income of more than $64,000 a year, triple the statewide 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	Local historian Marjorie Bell Chambers remembers that security  
here once was so tight that when a baby was born at Los Alamos, the 
certificate listed the place of birth simply, P.O. Box 1663. 
</P>
<P>
	The paranoia about secrecy is long passed. But people here,  
almost all of them with some connection to the nuclear weapons lab, 
still cherish their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent dustup over Taiwan-born Wen Ho Lee and allegations of  
Chinese spying at the lab, still makes for weekend coffee shop 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people that know him don't think he's a spy. He's a guy  
that slipped with the rules at the wrong time,'' says David Gurd, a 
physicist who works on a linear accelerator project at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone here has some connection with the lab. They  
either work there, retired from there, have relatives working 
there, or work for companies dependent on the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a one-employer town and that's been a problem,''  
says Mildred Hoak, who should know. She and her husband were forced 
to take early retirement when more than 900 lab employes were 
phased out in the early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she says, it's ``a wonderful town to raise a family.''

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Futures Race Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures raced higher Wednesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, reaching their highest levels nearly two 
years, amid concern about storms developing in key producing 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products also rose sharply. On other markets,  
soybeans also rose sharply. Wheat gained, while corn retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices jumped more than 4 percent as tropical storms  
developed in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Atlantic, situations 
that could threaten production platforms at a time when inventories 
are lower than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas supplies in storage have fallen to 5.6 percent below  
levels of a year ago after blistering heat forced utilities to 
power up plants to meet consumer demand from air conditioners and 
fans running at overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas in storage now must be replaced ahead of the busy  
winter heating season, and the threat of production outages for 
offshore platforms is causing concern that a colder-than-normal 
fall would bring shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil futures helped boost crude and unleaded gasoline  
amid positioning from investors who are betting that supplies this 
winter will be tight because of production cutbacks from major oil 
producers. Heating oil is a byproduct of crude production, and 
analysts are predicting supplies could become critically tight in 
some areas later this year if the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries and other producers succeed in keeping supplies 
of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for September delivery rose 10.6 cent to $2.898 for  
each 1,000 cubic feet; September crude rose 25 cents to $21.77 
cents a barrel; September heating oil rose 1.05 cents to 57.50 
cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline rose 1.2 cents to 66.20 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures rocketed higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade after overnight rains missed bone-dry Midwest growing 
regions. Wheat also gained, while corn retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the gains after rainfall of up to an inch fell in  
Minnesota, Iowa and parts of Illinois, but missed fields that have 
languished for weeks under hot, dry conditions. Forecasters says 
those same fields likely will remain dry over the next week, which 
will increase the potential for lower yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm tours are finding that average yields for corn and soybeans  
are slipping as the dry weather prevents maturing crops from 
filling properly. Corn futures, after initially gaining on the 
strength of soybeans, later retreated amid perceptions the rainfall 
helped most major growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also were supported by strong weekly export sales.  
The U.S. Agriculture Department reported that net export sales 
totaled 566,800 metric tons, which was slightly higher than market 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	November soybeans rose 8 1/4 cents to $4.77 3/4 a bushel; December  
wheat for rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.89 1/2 a bushel; December corn fell 1 3/4 
cents to $2.26 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> 'Average Joe' Robber Stymies Feds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- At least a dozen banks in Kentucky and  
Ohio have been robbed by a bespectacled man with a leather 
portfolio and such an unassuming demeanor that the FBI calls him 
``Average Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nickname belies his skill at evading police since knocking  
over his first bank nearly 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just your average-sized white male,'' Patrick Bashore, an  
FBI spokesman in Louisville, said Thursday. ``He could be anybody's 
next-door neighbor. It appears he could fit in just about 
anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Average Joe'' poses as a customer before calmly stepping  
forward in line to demand money from a teller. Warning of a weapon 
that never appears, he takes the cash and exits quickly, although 
not in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Average Joe is suspected of one robbery each month this year  
except for March. The FBI believes his most recent holdup was 
Tuesday in Lexington, where he is now suspected of robbing three 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the robberies have been in Kentucky and six in Ohio. The  
robberies have occurred along Interstate 75, extending from 
Lexington to Huber Heights, Ohio, just north of Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI won't say exactly how much was taken in the robberies,  
but Bashore said the total is less than $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The man is clean-shaven and about 35 years old. He dresses  
casually, wears large black-framed glasses and baseball caps with 
varying emblems, and several times has carried a large, 
dark-leather portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's such an Average Joe, he's not drawing attention to  
himself,'' said Linny Cloyd, a detective in Florence, Ky., where 
Average Joe is suspected in two bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has posted a bank photo of Average Joe on its Web site  
in the hope that someone can pick him out of a crowd. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Greek Orthodox Church Head Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The embattled leader of the nation's 1.9 million Greek Orthodox  
Christians resigned Thursday, ending two years of efforts to oust 
him by critics who said he stifled dissent and was behind the 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop Spyridon, the first American-born leader of the U.S.  
church, had appeared to have the support of the world leader of 
Eastern Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of 
Istanbul, Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement from his New York office, Spyridon indicated  
he had been forced out, saying he resigned ``for reasons totally 
independent of and unrelated to my personal intentions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world's 300 million  
Orthodox Christians, had come under strong pressure from Orthodox 
leaders in the United States to replace Spyridon. Some had 
threatened to break away from the patriarchate and declare an 
independent church. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew announced that Spyridon will be replaced by  
Metropolitan Demetrios of Greece, who has studied and taught in the 
United States and is considered to have a base of popularity to 
build on. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyridon, 54, was born in Warren, Ohio, but has spent most of  
his life in Europe. Critics claimed he could not relate to 
parishioners who are third- and fourth-generation Americans and 
feel less and less tied to Byzantine and Greek traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyridon claimed he was only trying to protect the church's  
values and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	A lay group, Greek Orthodox American Leaders of Cambridge,  
Mass., began working for Spyridon's ouster in 1997, a year after 
Bartholomew appointed him to lead the U.S. church. Last January all 
five U.S. regional bishops, called metropolitans, told Bartholomew 
that Spyridon must go. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman for GOAL, businessman Dean Popps of McLean, Va.,  
said ``the long ordeal and period of disorderliness in the affairs 
of our archdiocese appears to be over.'' However, Popps said 
Demetrios, 71, ``will have a monumental task ahead of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spyridon said he will serve until Aug. 30, then take a post with  
the tiny Greek Orthodox church in Turkey and await reassignment. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Spyridon referred obliquely to the church  
tensions. ``My heart is clean of any malice, ill will, or judgment 
of others,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he enjoyed the loyalty of ``the vast majority of  
the faithful.''

<HEADLINE> Hilton Settles Union Bias Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Three waitresses who alleged they were barred from  
working at a new pub because they didn't speak with an Irish brogue 
will work there now as part of a settlement of their discrimination 
claim against Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria DiMartino, Dorothy ``Dottie'' Webb and Jo Murray had each  
worked at the Logan airport Ramada's bar for more than three 
decades until it closed last weekend. In June they filed a 
complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, 
alleging that Hilton -- which has taken over the old hotel and is 
renovating it -- intended to open Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish theme 
bar, and give first preference for jobs in the new bar to those 
with Irish accents. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Hilton Hotels Corp. officials had  
denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	With the settlement, the women will be allowed to work in the  
new Irish pub at the $100 million hotel, slated to open Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eveyone is going to have a job,'' said Coleman Nee, a  
spokesman for the Logan Airport Hilton Hotel and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 26 union President Janice Loux said the hotel workers  
accepted a new contract with hotel management and agreed to drop 
the bias complaint. The new hotel will employ 500 workers, compared 
with the 250 to 300 at the old Ramada. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton General Manager Bert James said he was pleased the issue  
was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	When they filed their complaint, the three waitresses said their  
heavy ``Bahstahn'' accent was good enough while to calm anxious 
travelers -- and they were happy to entertain a common request from 
tourists. Said Murray: 
</P>
<P>
	``They all want to hear us say 'Pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd'  
and `chowdah.'''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Drug Co. Exec To Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Swiss pharmaceutical company  
executive agreed Thursday to plead guilty and serve six months in 
jail for his role in a worldwide case of vitamin price-fixing, the 
Justice Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 10th prosecution in the case in which the company,  
F. Hoffmann-La Roche, already has been sentenced to pay a record 
$500 million criminal fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann-La Roche and some of its competitors have admitted that  
from January 1990 until this May, they raised and fixed prices and 
allocated market shares for vitamins used in virtually every 
American home and added to bread, milk and breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a one-count criminal charge filed in U.S. District Court in  
Dallas, the government alleged that Dr. Roland Bronnimann, a Swiss 
citizen and resident and former president of Hoffmann-La Roche's 
vitamins and fine chemicals division, conspired in violation of the 
Sherman Act to fix prices in the United States and elsewhere for 
vitamins A, B2, B5, C, E, and beta carotene. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the jail time, Bronnimann agreed to pay a  
$150,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also charged that the conspirators rigged bids  
and allocated customer contracts between themselves for vitamin 
premixes throughout this country. Vitamin premixes are used to 
enrich breakfast cereals and numerous other processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bronnimann knew of, approved and participated in key aspects  
of Hoffmann-La Roche's operation in the vitamins cartel,'' said 
Gary R. Spratling, deputy assistant attorney general in charge of 
antitrust criminal enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a member of Hoffmann-La Roche's executive committee at the  
time of his involvement, Bronnimann put the full weight of 
legitimacy behind the company's involvement in the most pervasive 
international cartel ever uncovered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Bronnimann conspired with counterparts at  
BASF, Rhone-Poulenc and other unnamed competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronnimann is the second former senior Hoffmann-La Roche  
executive to be charged in the continuing investigation. On May 20, 
Dr. Kuno Sommer, former director of worldwide marketing for 
Hoffmann-La Roche's vitamins and fine chemicals division, was 
charged with participating in the vitamin cartel and with lying to 
Justice Department investigators in 1997 to cover up the 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer, also a Swiss citizen and resident, pleaded guilty and  
was sentenced July 23 to four months in prison and fined $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 2, a third foreign national, Antonio Felix, a Mexican  
citizen and vice president for basic and international products at 
DuCoa L.P., agreed to plead guilty to plotting to fix the prices of 
vitamin B4. He has not been sentenced.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am 103 Families To Get Briefings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Families of victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan  
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, will be briefed here next 
week by Scottish prosecutors about the upcoming trial in the 
Netherlands of two Libyans accused of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime arranged  
the two-day, closed meeting with Scottish prosecutors, constables 
and Justice officials ``to try to address all the questions that 
arise before a trial is to begin to indeed make sure that survivors 
are informed,'' Attorney General Janet Reno told her weekly news 
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very important for survivors, for victims, to  
understand what the processes are,'' said Reno, who will address 
the families Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Libyan intelligence officers, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi  
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are being tried under Scottish law in The 
Hague on charges of planting a suitcase bomb that blew up the jumbo 
jet, killing 270 people, including 189 Americans. The trial is to 
begin in early February. 
</P>
<P>
	Some victims' families are critical of the deal brokered by the  
State Department and the United Nations with Libya to hold the 
trial in the Netherlands rather than in Scotland or the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have held fast for a trial here or in Scotland even  
if it meant Libya would not turn over these two guys, because then 
there would be less risk that this trial would be used as an excuse 
to drop economic sanctions against Libya,'' Dan Cohen said Thursday 
in a telephone interview from his home in Cape May Court House, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, whose daughter Theodora died in the bombing, fears the  
trial of the two operatives could become ``a judicial fig leaf for 
the rehabilitation of (Libyan leader) Moammar Gadhafi,'' who he 
believes ordered the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Great Britain cited the upcoming trial in dropping  
its sanctions against Libya, Cohen said he fears that even if the 
pair are convicted, British officials later may grant them early 
release from prison, rather than keep them locked up for years 
trying to pressure them to identify the masterminds of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has not dropped its economic sanctions,  
including a ban on American travel to Libya or doing business 
there. The United Nations suspended its sanctions, but has not 
decided whether to lift them permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Security Council resolutions require Libya to cooperate  
with the prosecution and to pay compensation to the families of the 
victims of the bombing if the two men are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be watching very carefully whether Libya complies with  
the requirement in the Security Council that they cooperate fully 
as the trial unfolds and that they pay compensation to the victims 
of the Pan Am 103 terrorist bombing,'' State Department spokesman 
James Rubin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if U.S. officials believe Gadhafi or other senior Libyan  
officials ordered the bombing, Rubin replied, ``Under legal advice, 
it is our considered judgment that it would be best to allow the 
trial to unfold without expressing our opinions publicly prior to 
that trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using funds derived from fines paid by U.S. criminals, the  
Justice Office for Victims of Crime is helping pay to fly some 
relatives to the Netherlands to watch the trial, arranging a 
satellite telecast of the trial or its highlights for families 
here, and providing a daily report of trial activity on a toll-free 
telephone line for families. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is establishing a secure Internet Web site with trial  
reports and an electronic bulletin board through which families can 
communicate with each other.

<HEADLINE>  Ayala Returns To Ring After Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tony Ayala Jr. was signed to fight for  
$750,000 and a world championship when, fueled by a mixture of 
heroin, cocaine and alcohol, he broke into a home New Year's Day 
1983 and raped a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	He returns to the ring Friday night in a comeback improbable  
even by boxing standards, one not even Ayala could have imagined 
while serving 16 years in a New Jersey state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout my prison sentence I wondered what might have  
happened against the fighters of the time,'' Ayala said. ``But did 
I see myself making a comeback at the age of 36? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of hometown fans who remember the ferocious teen-ager  
dubbed ``El Torito'' who once spit on an opponent after knocking 
him out are expected to turn out as Ayala fights Manuel Esparza in 
what he hopes is the first step toward the title fight he never 
got. 
</P>
<P>
	What Ayala will show in the ring is anyone's guess, including  
his own. He's 36 and balding with suspect reflexes, and no longer 
has the anger which seemed to carry him in fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala will get $200,000 to find out, in a scheduled 10-round  
fight at the 162-pound weight limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't say I'm where I was at when I was 19. But I never want  
to be the kind of person again that I was at 19,'' Ayala said. 
``I've made a lot of progress in four months since I got out of 
prison. And I certainly have enough to win this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the ring, Ayala has more confidence in himself. There,  
he hopes to prove himself as a man who finally takes responsibility 
for his actions, and is truly remorseful for a crime that sent him 
to prison for half of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems society is willing to put the past aside and let me  
prove myself. That's all I asked for,'' Ayala said. ``I expected a 
lot worse from people for what I did than what has actually 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's return to boxing has generated grumblings from those who  
think he should have served his entire 35-year sentence. But it has 
also sparked excitement and memories of a teen-ager who once seemed 
destined to rule the junior middleweight ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	In just a few short years after turning pro, Ayala was 22-0 with  
19 knockouts and had signed for a fight with WBA 154-pound champion 
Davey Moore. He was the top-ranked contender and was coming off 
consecutive knockouts of Robbie Epps and Carlos Herrera in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala was already being mentioned against the likes of Sugar Ray  
Leonard, Roberto Duran and Marvelous Marvin Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the most exciting fighter in boxing,'' said Lester  
Bedford, who helped promote some Ayala fights at the time and is 
promoting Friday's bout. ``He was Mike Tyson before Mike Tyson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much like Tyson, though, Ayala couldn't control himself outside  
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early morning hours of Jan. 1, 1983, he broke into a  
neighbor's apartment, tied her up and raped her. Police reports at 
the time indicated Ayala not only assaulted the woman, but also 
cruelly taunted her. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few short hours, Ayala was on his way from ring riches to  
prisoner No. 69765 at the state prison in Rahway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain I put the victim through will never be forgotten.  
It's something I want to keep speaking out on,'' said Ayala, who 
had already been on probation before for assaulting a woman at a 
San Antonio drive-in theater. ``It was a terrible thing for me to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala, who credits prison counseling for helping him come to  
terms with his behavior, blames some of his conduct on being 
molested as a child and an adolescence spent getting drunk and 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	He started drinking as a child and was using heroin by the time  
he was 12. His habits made his success in the ring even more 
remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would clean up from two weeks to 10 days before a fight,''  
he said. ``It was a constant level of misery. I equated getting 
high with something good and positive, never realizing the torment 
was within myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala said he never seriously considered a boxing comeback until  
a fellow prisoner brought it up during a workout about a year 
before he became eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	He weighed about 190 pounds when he walked out of prison in  
April, but weighed in Thursday at 160 pounds, only six pounds 
heavier than he was when he was terrorizing opponents in the junior 
middleweight division. Esparaza weighed 161 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The desire is there, but I don't know if the ferocity is  
there,'' Ayala said. ``I don't recognize any difference. It's just 
that I don't get as excited or as wound up as I used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ayala is successful against Esparza, he figures it will take  
a handful of fights before he is able to fight a top contender. 
After that, he can see himself fighting the likes of Oscar De La 
Hoya or Felix Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, though, life will go on. He remarried his former wife,  
Lisa, just after getting out of prison and wants mainly to lead a 
normal and sober life. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always hope I will fight for a world title and make  
tens of millions of dollars,'' Ayala said. ``But every single day 
is a new beginning for me. I much prefer who I am today, even if 
that means not being successful in the ring.''

that I don't get as excited or as wound up as I used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ayala is successful against Esparza, he figures it will take  
a handful of fights before he is able to fight a top contender. 
After that, he can see himself fighting the likes of Oscar De La 
Hoya or Felix Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, though, life will go on. He remarried his former wife,  
Lisa, just after getting out of prison and wants mainly to lead a 
normal and sober life. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always hope I will fight for a world title and make  
tens of millions of dollars,'' Ayala said. ``But every single day 
is a new beginning for me. I much prefer who I am today, even if 
that means not being successful in the ring.''

<HEADLINE> K-State Looks To Keep Winning Touch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Jonathan Beasley says he's not bothered  
at the prospect of replacing the only Kansas State quarterback to 
beat Nebraska in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	David Allen shrugs his shoulders when asked about replacing  
K-State's career rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
	And Aaron Lockett, when reminded that he's one of only two  
returning Wildcats who caught a pass last season, just grins. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite two heartbreaking losses to end last season, the  
Wildcats seems genuinely upbeat heading into a season without 
Michael Bishop, Eric Hickson and Darnell McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have faith in the youngsters we have,'' said Bill Snyder,  
who will also be without kicker Martin Gramatica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats are coming off an 11-2 season in which they had the  
national championship game squarely in their sights but squandered 
it in a double-overtime loss to Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 title game. 
Still depressed three weeks later, they lost to unranked Purdue in 
the Alamo Bowl and saw what had been the finest season in 103 years 
of Kansas State football turn into one of the most bitterly 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, as they take their first steps toward regaining all  
that momentum, their biggest void is at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	In two years as a starter, Bishop walked off the field a loser  
only three times. His powerful arm and legs led K-State to its 
finest two years, getting the Wildcats close to a national title 
game in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Beasley, a backup in 1996 and '97 and redshirted last season,  
can throw about as well as Bishop but is not as quick on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be competing with junior Adam Helm.  
</P>
<P>
	``They both have some experience in our system. They've had the  
opportunity to play and compete for several years,'' said Snyder. 
``This will be Adam's fifth year and Jon's fourth year. Jonathan's 
being a backup quarterback for two of those three years, and 
redshirting the other has given him an opportunity to get a lot of 
reps on the practice field. What they don't have is an ample amount 
of playing time under stressful conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomer Eli Roberson could also have an impact.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever a great quarterback leaves this program, it seems  
like we've had somebody step in and do the job,'' said Beasley. 
``No matter who gets to be No. 1, they're always going to have 
comparisons with Mike. We'll just have to deal with it and go from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats took a big blow when running back Frank Murphy  
broke a bone in his foot during conditioning exercises on July 28. 
He could be out as long as eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the No. 1 running back spot was probably going to go to  
Allen, among the nation's most dazzling punt returners of 1998. 
Allen returned punts for touchdowns in three consecutive games and 
tied an NCAA record with four TD returns. He broke his own Big 12 
record with 730 yards in punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about this year, because now at tailback I  
get more of an opportunity to play and see what I can do there,'' 
said Allen, who had only 31 carries last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald is a big loss. But Lockett was No. 2 on the team with  
44 catches for 928 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just working hard and staying focused,'' said Lockett, a  
sophomore. ``We have enough people here from last year to know what 
it takes to get there.''

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush Keeping Big Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush  
has kept a big lead in a new national poll, but has slipped 
slightly in a survey of New Hampshire voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor was at 61 percent in a national CNN/USA  
Today/Gallup poll of 434 respondents who are Republican or who lean 
toward Republicans. Elizabeth Dole was in second place at 13 
percent and the other candidates were in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had close to the same lead he had in a June CNN/USA  
Today/Gallup poll. The new survey was taken from Monday through 
Wednesday before the latest controversy over questions about Bush's 
past use of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New Hampshire poll, Bush was at 40 percent, down from the  
47 percent he had a month ago. The New Hampshire survey of 450 
registered Republicans by the independent American Research Group 
showed that Arizona Sen. John McCain had an edge for the second 
spot in New Hampshire. Dole, Pat Buchanan, Dan Quayle, Alan Keyes, 
Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch were all in single digits. 
Fifteen percent said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	The state poll was taken Sunday through Tuesday and both surveys  
had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls are the first measure of voter sentiment in New  
Hampshire since the Iowa straw poll. In the straw poll -- an 
unscientific popularity contest held by the Iowa Republican Party -- 
Bush won, followed by Forbes, Dole and Bauer. McCain did not 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa leads off the selection process with its caucuses in early  
February, followed by New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first 
presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore led former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  
58 percent to 31 percent in the national poll of 493 respondents 
who were Democrats or lean Democratic, while 10 percent were 
undecided. That national lead is largely unchanged from June. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, Gore has maintained his lead among New  
Hampshire voters over Bradley, the survey said. In July, Gore held 
a 48-32 lead in New Hampshire; this month, he had 46 percent to 29 
percent for Bradley. Twenty-five percent of the 415 Democrats 
polled said they were undecided.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Forms off Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A sprawling cloud bank in the Gulf of Mexico grew  
in strength and became Tropical Storm Bret on Thursday, and was 
expected to hit the Mexican coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The system became the second named storm of the Atlantic  
hurricane season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a threat to Mexico well south of the (U.S.) border,''  
said National Hurricane Center hurricane specialist Richard Pasch. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, carrying top winds of 40 mph that are expected to  
grow, was in the Gulf between the Mexican mainland and the Yucatan 
peninsula, about 110 miles northeast of Veracruz, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen Mexican ports along the Gulf were closed to small craft  
because of winds, and the Mexican government issued a warning from 
Tampico, Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sticks With Veto Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers and the White House may  
seem far apart on a fiscal 2000 budget, but President Clinton on 
Thursday offered an optimistic assessment of the situation. ``We'll 
get this worked out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at an education event, Clinton again vowed to veto the  
GOP's tax cut plan. But he made it clear that he didn't consider 
that a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'll veto the tax plan,'' he said. ``But let's not stop  
with the negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after the event whether a deal was possible, he seemed  
even more upbeat: ``We'll get this worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about making something good happen,'' Clinton said.  
``I think after the August recess, we'll come back here ... we'll 
all try and get an A in arithmetic and do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP has passed only two of 13 appropriations bills it must  
send to Clinton before fiscal 1999 ends in September. White House 
officials have declined to say whether Clinton would sign a 
continuing resolution while negotiators work out details, fueling 
speculation that the country could face another federal government 
shutdown. GOP officials are eager to avoid a repeat of the 
politically punishing 1995 shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech at the education event highlighted a  
report that found schools will continue to handle an increasing 
number of students in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Again drawing a distinction between his budget proposals and GOP  
plans, Clinton said the report was all the more reason to invest 
the budget surplus in Social Security, Medicare and education, and 
not embrace the GOP's $792 billion tax cut.

<HEADLINE> Underwood Still Wavering on Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson says he's no in hurry for Dimitrius  
Underwood to join the Miami Dolphins. The rookie defensive end, 
waived by Minnesota after he saying he preferred a religious 
calling to football, is willing to meet with Johnson but in no 
hurry to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any of the 31 teams need an evangelist, we can start  
negotiating now,'' Underwood told the Lansing (Mich.) State 
Journal, adding that he was willing to go to Miami to talk to 
Johnson ``out of respect to him.''. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th overall pick in last April's NFL draft, was  
claimed Monday off waivers by the Dolphins. Johnson talked with him 
for the first time Tuesday and predicted the rookie will eventually 
join the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to play, but he wants to take some time to get in  
shape and get mentally ready,'' Johnson said in San Diego, where 
the Dolphins are preparing for an exhibition game. ``To be honest, 
we'd prefer he just sit out this year and come in fresh and hungry 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was the Vikings' second first-round draft pick, but  
left training camp after just one practice to pursue his faith, and 
the team released him. He walked out on a five-year, $5.3 million 
contract, sacrificing nearly all of his $1.75 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood plays for the Dolphins this year, they'll owe him  
no signing bonus and a base salary of just $395,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an all-or-nothing guy,'' Underwood said Wednesday.  
``People can read into it. If I didn't take $5 million, why would I 
take $395,000? ... 
</P>
<P>
	``God says you can take all the money in the world to hell.  
You're sitting in hell counting your money, what good is that going 
to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins say they plan to retain rights to Underwood for the  
length of his five-year contract. Johnson can afford to be patient 
with the rookie because the Dolphins have five veterans at 
defensive end.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Caspian Gas Plan Sped Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) -- A border dispute between  
Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan must not hinder construction of a gas 
pipeline across the Caspian Sea, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson said here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute over how to divide the Caspian's territory has stalled  
work on the four-country project to bring Turkmen gas to Western 
markets, and Washington is trying to broker a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also raised the gas pipeline project in visits this  
week to Azerbaijan and Turkey, other stops on his tour to press 
U.S. aims of bringing Caspian energy resources to international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson told Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov that the  
countries participating in the gas pipeline project -- Turkmenistan, 
Azerbaijan, Turkey and Georgia -- could speed up the project by 
offering their full support, which would help ensure financing. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's talks, Niyazov and Joseph Grandmeison, the  
director of the U.S. Agency for Trade and Development, signed an 
agreement providing Turkmenistan with a $150,000 grant for 
consulting services to draft legal documents for the project.

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.'s second-quarter earnings  
rose from a year ago, boosted by strong results at its giant 
bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company reported Thursday that its operating  
earnings were $9 million, or 8 cents a share, in the quarter ended 
July 31, compared with a loss of $9.68 million, or 8 cents a share, 
a year earlier. Results beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the quarter were $727.17 million, up from $662.5  
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates  
of 7 cents a share. After rising initially, shares fell 62 1/2 cents 
to $24.12 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 results exclude a $36 million gain in the quarter that  
came from the May initial public stock offering of 
barnesandnoble.com, in which Barnes &AMP; Noble holds a 40 percent 
share, and the partial sale of Chapters Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures also exclude a $5 million loss to cover costs  
associated with Barnes &AMP; Noble's termination of its planned merger 
with Ingram Book Group, the nation's No. 1 book wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble said that sales at its superstores open at least  
a year, which is considered an industry gauge of performance, rose 
6.6 percent, while same-store sales at B. Dalton shops, which are 
smaller and usually found in malls, declined 0.5 percent for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended July 31, the company's operating  
earnings were $6.5 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with a 
loss of $15.34 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the first six months of the year were $1.45 billion,  
up from $1.32 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, barnesandnoble.com announced plans to open a  
distribution center in Memphis, Tenn., that will employ more than 
600 workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo veterans Bruce Smith, Andre  
Reed and Thurman Thomas won't play forever. Or will they? 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's last links to its Super Bowl teams of the early 1990s  
will see their first action of the season Friday night in 
Washington. After being held out of last week's exhibition opener, 
they're ready to go. Again. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed and Smith are starting their 15th seasons and Thomas is  
starting his 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's superstars don't know how to quit. Perhaps they don't  
know when to quit either. 
</P>
<P>
	Their teammates -- veterans and rookies -- say that's OK.  
</P>
<P>
	``To see Bruce Smith in practice getting down and dirty, it  
makes you work hard,'' veteran safety Kurt Schulz said. ``You see 
Thurman Thomas on the Stairmaster; Andre Reed always comes to camp 
in great shape. That really lifts the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect to see much of them in preseason, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play very much,'' Smith said Thursday. ``In  
fact, very little. But it's going to give me a chance to get some 
work in a lot earlier than in past years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who turned 36 in June, was named to the Pro Bowl squad  
for the 11th time after recording 74 tackles and 10 sacks last 
season. He's been plagued in other preseasons by ailments ranging 
from aching joints to contractual woes. Last year he came to camp 
following elbow and knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Not this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a very positive camp, mentally and physically,''  
Smith said. ``I'm looking forward to going out and getting my 
timing down and being able to do some things with my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 33, had eight straight seasons of 1,000 yards or more  
rushing, beginning with his second year in the league in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninth in rushing in NFL history with 11,786 yards, Thomas trails  
only Emmitt Smith among active backs now that Thomas' old college 
teammate, Barry Sanders, has retired.

	After rushing for 643 yards in 1997, Thomas accepted a reduced  
role last year, reluctantly at first. But the lighter load is 
likely to prolong his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like my role,'' Thomas said. ``I'm feeling good after ball  
games and not all beat up to where I'm not practicing well until 
Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas says he's not pondering retirement, despite Sanders'  
recent surprise exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been on winning football teams; he's always been  
on losing football teams,'' Thomas said. ``It's easier for me to 
stay here and not think about retirement.''

	``He was at a team meeting before he came to his first practice,  
and he spotted something I was doing and already he was teaching 
me,'' said Peerless Price, the Bills' second-round draft choice 
from national champion Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a guy who's been around 15 or 16 years, probably a  
future Hall of Famer, just to learn from a guy like that, a guy you 
heard so much about growing up, it's just overwhelming for a little 
guy like me.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Bragg Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Darren Bragg  
will miss the rest of the season after surgery Thursday to repair a 
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bragg, 29, injured the knee while attempting to avoid a  
collision with J.D. Drew in an Aug. 2 game against the San Diego 
Padres. Bragg, who joined the Cardinals this year, hit .260 with 
six home runs and 26 RBIs in 93 games.

	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Lycos Inc., a major internet search  
engine, is not renewing an advertising contract with Jews for 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos, of Waltham, said the ad appeared on the computer screen  
when the word ``Jewish'' was typed during Web searches. It read: 
``The end of the world is no time to finally realize Jesus is the 
Messiah. (It's all in the book.) Click here for a free copy!'' At 
the click, a Jews for Jesus Web page appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, founded in the 1970s, claims 70,000 followers  
nationwide. It practices Judaism but regards Jesus as the Messiah. 
The $1,700 ad had been running since July 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Snider, general counsel for Lycos, said the contract was  
not renewed because of complaints and because ``controversial 
advertising is bad for business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among its opponents were the Anti-Defamation League's Boston  
office. Diane Kolb, associate director, said she believed the 
message was misleading and blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jews can't be for Jesus,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Susan Perlman, spokeswoman for Jews for Jesus, said the group  
was disappointed that the message was restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Web is supposed to be a marketplace for all kinds of  
ideas,'' she said, ``and people can click on them or pass them 
by.''

 *Readin', religion and 'rithmetic    	
</P>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A group of conservative Roman Catholics  
seeking more religion in their children's education are opening an 
independent school. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Blessed Sacrament Academy expect 50 children in  
kindergarten through eighth grade when school opens Monday. The 
school will not be connected to the Roman Catholic diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a private school run by dedicated individuals,'' Bishop  
William Curlin said. ``But it's not part of the Catholic diocese or 
its school system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diocese's 17 schools have prayer services and religion  
classes but follow a curriculum, approved by the state, that does 
not stress religion. In contrast, Blessed Sacrament teachers will 
bring their faith into classes, said John Deer, the school's board 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they study history, for example, they'll learn about  
prominent Catholics throughout history,'' he said. ``Our whole 
curriculum will be very Catholic-oriented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school, though, will leave sex education completely to  
parents. The diocesan schools teach a program endorsed by the U.S. 
Catholic Conference.

 *A pulpit in the classroom    	
</P>
<P>
	CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) -- A small church congregation barred from  
worshipping in the public schools has been allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The 115 members of the Northwest Community Church had been  
meeting in city parks and other rented spaces since they were 
turned out of the schools a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the church and other organizations can rent classrooms and  
gymnasiums in the Crown Point School District for $35 an hour -- so 
long they don't interfere with school activities. 
</P>
<P>
	District board members voted unanimously to reverse a 9-year-old  
policy against religious groups meeting on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you have a church, or any type of organization, the  
facilities belong to the community,'' Superintendent Steve 
Sprunger, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The church met for about a month at the Solon Robinson School  
last August with permission from officials unfamiliar with school 
policy. Paul McFann, who was then superintendent, said the 
congregation would have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Steve Buchelt, pastor, said the church sued Crown Point  
schools in June, accusing them of violating the congregation's 
First Amendment rights. Other area school districts allow religious 
use of school property, he said.

 *Jesus at the millennium    	
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A national Catholic weekly is offering a  
$2,000 prize for the work of art that ``best represents Jesus'' at 
the start of the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly, the National Catholic Reporter, said Jesus is the  
most popular subject in art history, but he ``has been eclipsed in 
our secular, consumer culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entries in the form of slides are due by Oct. 18. In addition to  
the top prize, 30 to 50 of the best works will be featured in the 
publication's Christmas issue.

<HEADLINE> Philly Exchange Ready for Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Stock Exchange was  
preparing for a possible price war in the lucrative stock-options 
business after two of its biggest rivals said they planned to 
muscle in on the exchange's turf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Board Options Exchange said it will begin listing  
the Philadelphia exchange's top product -- Dell Computer Corp. stock 
options -- on Monday. The Nasdaq-American Stock Exchange also said 
it planned to cross-list Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	PhilEx traders and executives came close to selling the  
exchange's trading floor last year after a group of customers 
threatened to move their Dell business to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to go to the races,'' said PhilEx chairman Meyer  
``Sandy'' Frucher. The Chicago board ``tried to steal Dell a year 
ago. But now we've got our technology in place and created a more 
level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia exchange said it plans to fight back by listing  
three popular Chicago options -- Coca-Cola Co., IBM and Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson, members of the PhilEx options committee said. It also 
intends to list Apple Computer, whose options had been an Amex 
exclusive, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new listings, all of which are to take effect Monday,  
threaten the long-standing division of hundreds of popular stock 
options between markets in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and San 
Francisco. PhilEx is considering other cross-listings -- including 
some of the nation's most valuable stocks, Frucher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in equity options nationwide has set records in the last  
six years. Last year, nearly 330 million contracts, representing 33 
billion shares of stock, were traded, according to the Options 
Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Frucher said the planned listings could be the first in a series  
of moves that would allow customers to soon electronically choose 
the best prices offered by traders on all four U.S. options 
markets, as well as new online markets. The increased competition 
is also expected to prod options firms to cut their fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Howard, a CBOE spokeswoman, said the Chicago market's move  
on Dell came at the request of customers who wanted to trade Dell 
in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Tips for the Drought-Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Northeasterners, is the drought taking a toll  
on your lawn? Your flower beds? 
</P>
<P>
	How about your psyche?  
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, the government is ready to help.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are there activities or things people can do to reduce  
drought-related stress?'' asks a news release from the Center for 
Mental Health Services. The answer, an unqualified ``Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, when brushing your teeth, cut off the faucet and  
focus on the ``actual brushing,'' instead of the sound of 
``continually flowing water in the background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, when you realize the running faucet is wasting water: ``Put  
a glass ... under it, and put it in the refrigerator for later. By 
day's end, you will likely be surprised how much water you might 
have wasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, another solution is to simply shut off the faucet.  
But the center suggests you might use the glass to ``make a game of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still another suggestion for late-night trips to the bathroom:  
</P>
<P>
	``Resist the reflexive action of automatically flushing the  
toilet if you awaken at night and there is only liquid waste. 
Simply wait and flush in the morning. Believe it or not, flushing 
itself can add to the stress of awakening in the middle of the 
night because of the noise element.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this raises a central question: Are these serious  
stress-reduction suggestions? Yes, they are, assures Curtis R. 
Austin, spokesman for the center, a branch of the Department of 
Health and Human Services. It is all part of his effort to get 
people to think about mental health issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking major breakthroughs. We're not finding a  
cure for AIDS,'' he said. ``We're trying to turn a negative 
situation into a positive, and what's so bad about that?''

<HEADLINE> Pew Trust To Spend $50M on Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A philanthropic foundation wants to reassert  
the value of the arts and culture in the United States by spending 
$50 million over the next five years to arts causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of Pew Charitable Trust is to give money to support  
arts financing, zoning in historic areas and arts curriculum for 
public schools, said Stephen K. Urice, who will direct the Pew 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is about is the long-term health of American  
creativity and the sustainability of American arts and culture,'' 
he said. ``The long-term goal is to strengthen both political and 
economic support for nonprofit culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.7 billion Pew foundation, started by the family owners of  
the Sun Oil Co., says it plans to establish a centralized 
information center for reliable data on all aspects of cultural 
life. It intends to push greater media coverage, in hopes of 
promoting discussions among policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pew will collaborate with museums and other arts institutions to  
build their cultural programs.

<HEADLINE> California GOP Mired in Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The California GOP is in debt,  
spending money faster than it comes in as the organization prepares 
for next year's crucial elections in the face of lackluster 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to rebound from 1998, when they were swept from  
every statewide office but two and lost control of the governor's 
mansion for the first time in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are even higher in next year's federal races:  
Republicans want to hold on to their slim majority in the U.S. 
House of Representatives, and California has 52 seats up for grabs, 
more than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash will be vital in the rebuilding of GOP voter rolls.  
Republican registration has dropped more than 10 percent this 
decade, to about one in three voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The party listed $414,818 in debts as of June 30, according to  
an Associated Press review of reports the parties must file with 
the secretary of state and the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	That was far more than the $262,137 they had in the bank. The  
party also borrowed $300,000 to pay bills left over from the 1998 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	While it has raised about the same amount of money this year as  
California Democrats, the GOP has spent nearly twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
	So while Republicans sink further into debt in the first half of  
the year, Democrats are sitting on nearly $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	John McGraw, the chairman of the state Republican Party, said  
fund raising this year has been disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's state and federal committees raised $1.84 million in  
the first half of the year, slightly less than the $1.91 million 
California Democrats took in. 
</P>
<P>
	The California GOP's bottom line was pumped up by transfusions  
from the national party, which accounted for one-sixth of the state 
party's total take. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw said several factors help explain the lackluster  
fund-raising, including his relatively young tenure as party chief. 
McGraw took over the GOP in early March. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a new chairman, I have to establish credibility with the  
donor community, which means saying what you're going to do and 
doing what you say. I'm in that phase,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many would-be donors are not paying attention to  
politics in this non-election year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Speedway Gets First Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- The biggest surprise on the one-mile oval of  
the Chicago Motor Speedway was the braking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, you have to really jump on the brakes hard in the  
turns,'' Gil de Ferran said Thursday after the opening practice 
session at the new racing facility in this western suburb of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The turns are wide, but you really have to slow down to get  
through them,'' de Ferran said. ``The straightaways are long and 
you're really flying and then you have to go through the turns 
about 120 miles an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART drivers will get another full day of practice on Friday  
before qualifying on Saturday for the inaugural Target Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's two practices were closed to the public; Friday's  
will be opened. Sunday's 225-mile race was within about 2,000 
tickets of a sellout in the 65,000-seat stadium-style grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the track, which had gone untested until Thursday, most  
of the drivers raved about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's smooth and very fast,'' Max Papis said. ``The surface  
actually has some grip for being brand new. Driving it is like 
driving a road course with left turns. I think we can put on a very 
good race here at Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team Rahal teammmate Bryan Herta also liked what he saw and  
felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the long straights, you can get a run on somebody by  
getting on the throttle as early as you can. Getting off the 
corners well and getting on the power as quickly as possible will 
be the keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the drivers simply trying to get a handle on the  
new track, Patrick Carpentier, returning after missing one race 
with a small compression fracture of a vertebra, led the way at 
156.734 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Moore, Carpentier's Player's Forsythe teammate, was next at  
156.054, followed by Roberto Moreno, substituting for injured 
Christian Fittipaldi, at 155.771. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's race could go a long way toward determining the series  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	With six of 20 races remaining, Dario Franchitti holds a  
one-point lead over rookie sensation Juan Montoya, with former 
series champion Michael Andretti 28 points behind and Paul Tracy, 
Franchitti's teammate, 30 back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys are all very strong and I think this race Michael  
is going to be very good,'' Montoya, the 23-year-old Colombian, 
said. ``He's great on the ovals, particularly the short ovals like 
this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, Moreno's teammate, likes his chances this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything can happen, but if he (Montoya) drops out and we win  
this weekend, I'll only be a few points behind,'' said Andretti, 
who moved up to ninth late in the session with a lap of 154.873. 
``It could make things very interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who leads the series with five victories -- including  
last Sunday's race at Lexington, Ohio -- didn't show much speed on 
Thursday. Montoya was 17th at 153.461. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we can get some more time on the track, we'll get the  
set-up where we need it to be,'' Montoya said. ``We'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti also struggled. He was 25th at 151.441.

<HEADLINE> Lobbying Follows Clinton on Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton may be taking a vacation,  
but lobbyists never rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Biotechnology Industry Organization, an association of  
specialty drug companies, is chasing Clinton to his retreat on 
Martha's Vineyard with radio ads critical of the president's plan 
to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads will air only on the resort island's WMVY radio this  
week and next, but will be repeated at least seven times a day 
while Clinton and his family are there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a portable mobile White House just like people carry  
mobile phones these days and this week and part of next it's 
operating out of Martha's Vineyard,'' said BIO president Carl B. 
Feldbaum, who interrupted his own family vacation in Idaho to talk 
about the ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Another good reason to target Clinton while he's away from  
Washington: 60 second radio spots on Martha's Vineyard cost just 
$65 apiece. When BIO ran similar ads in the nation's capital 
earlier this summer, aimed at members of Congress, they cost more 
than ten times that much. 
</P>
<P>
	In BIO's ads, senior citizens supportive of the idea of Medicare  
drug coverage nevertheless raise concerns about the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want a big government agency to set drug policy,''  
says a retired school teacher in one. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies developing scores of new medicines for the  
elderly are walking a fine political line by opposing Clinton's 
plan. But also, Feldbaum said of the ads, ``We toned them down a 
little bit because while we wanted to get our message across, 
everybody is entitled to a vacation.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bans Loral Satellite Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The State Department has refused Loral Space  
&AMP; Communication's request to lift a suspension that has delayed the 
launch of a satellite the company sold to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's technical-assistance agreement to deliver  
satellites to China was suspended in December amid an investigation 
that Loral's dealings may have passed on technology to China that 
could compromise U.S. security. Hughes Electronics also is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Loral was notified this month that the State Department has  
extended the ban, which has left the $124 million satellite sitting 
idle. If the suspension remains in place, China could cancel the 
contract and the company could face up to $12 million in penalties 
plus $38 million in expenses to refurbish the satellite for another 
buyer, Loral said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain hopeful the suspension will be lifted,'' Tom Ross,  
Loral vice president for government relations, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it has not transferred sensitive information to  
China, but State Department spokesman James Rubin said the 
government's ``concerns have not been alleviated, so the suspension 
continues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loral's agreement would allow export of missile-control  
technical data for which certification from the president is now 
required, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has approved other launches of satellites  
in China built by U.S. contractors, including Motorola's Iridium 
launch in June, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Nabbed for Snatching Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAGINAW, Texas (AP) -- A convicted sex offender arrested during a  
traffic stop was charged with snatching a 6-year-old girl from her 
grandparents' front yard nearly five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Lee Franks, 30, was arraigned Wednesday on charges of  
kidnapping and child molestation, and formal charges were pending. 
Franks is being held on $1.5 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, Opal Jo Jennings, remains missing.  
</P>
<P>
	She was playing with friends March 26 when she was kidnapped.  
Her friends said a man with a ponytail threw Opal into his car and 
drove away. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks was arrested Tuesday night on an unrelated traffic  
warrant, Saginaw police spokesman Karl Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police told me ... he confessed to kidnapping Opal, and he  
said he turned her loose after he bought her a Coke,'' said the 
girl's grandmother and legal guardian, Audrey Sanderford. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she has her doubts about his claim he released her  
unharmed within a mile of where he grabbed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure where Opal is. I know chances are she's probably  
dead,'' Ms. Sanderford said. ``She's got to be somewhere. She 
didn't just disappear off the face of the earth.''

neither confirm nor deny that Franks had confessed to anything but 
said it was reasonable to conclude that the information used to 
obtain the kidnapping warrant came after Franks' arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities from neighboring Wise County suggested Franks as a  
possible suspect in Jennings' kidnapping April 1, just days after 
the child disappeared, Sheriff Phil Ryan said today. Officials 
checked their log of sex offenders, and recognized similarities 
between Franks' record and the Jennings disappearance, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a backlog of thousands of leads kept police from  
investigating Franks until a few weeks ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arlington, east of Fort Worth, officials said Franks' arrest  
caused them to review evidence in another girl's abduction and 
slaying three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 searchers, mostly from the FBI, spread out through a  
brushy area near Saginaw Airfield north of Fort Worth on Wednesday. 
FBI special agent Bob Garrity said they searched the area on a tip, 
but he didn't specify the source of the tip. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and federal investigators have received more than 2,300  
tips in the investigation. Mrs. Sanderford said she understood 
Franks had a relative who used to live on her street. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks had been on probation until April 13 in connection with a  
guilty plea stemming from a 1991 count of indecency with a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of Franks made tearful apologies Wednesday to the  
missing girl's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my brother done this, I wanted to come and be with this  
family,'' a sobbing Rodney Franks said during a visit to Mrs. 
Sanderford's home.

<HEADLINE> Sprinter at Center of Drug Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- More than 10 years after Ben Johnson was  
stripped of his gold medal and world record in the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics, drug scandals are tarnishing track and field like never 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last month alone, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's  
Linford Christie and American Dennis Mitchell all landed in trouble 
for positive drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jamaican sprint star Merlene Ottey has joined the list,  
pulling out of the World Championships on Wednesday after testing 
positive for the banned steroid Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey, 39, who has won more World Championship medals (14) than  
any other male or female athlete, said she was the victim of a 
``terrible mistake'' and would fight to prove her innocence. She 
offered to undergo another test. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of Ottey's positive test couldn't have come at a worse  
time. Istvan Gyulai, general secretary of the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation, acknowledged it was the ``last thing'' the 
sport needed before Saturday's opening of the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Gyulai said traces of Nandrolone were found in Ottey's ``A''  
sample following a urine test at a meet in Lucerne, Switzerland, on 
July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``B'' sample will be analyzed in the next few days. If it  
also is positive, Ottey faces a possible two-year ban that would 
effectively end her career and erase her hopes of competing in her 
sixth Olympics next year in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said today he hoped Ottey's  
positive result was faulty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we are still not aware whether Ottey has committed a  
doping offense or whether there has been some mistake,'' he said at 
a news conference. ``Personally, I hope that this will prove to be 
just a nightmare for Ottey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Nebiolo said the IAAF would do all it can to  
wipe out the ``moral cancer'' of doping, adding that 250-300 tests 
will be carried out at the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure of one thing,'' he said. ``Even from this sad event  
athletics can emerge stronger because we will show that we have the 
courage of our convictions in the anti-doping war, whoever is the 
subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey said the positive finding had put her through ``the most  
difficult and emotionally draining experience of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived my personal and athletic life with the utmost  
honesty and integrity,'' she said in a statement issued by her 
management company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have applied only the highest ethical standards to myself  
and expect the same from others. I have always proclaimed fairness 
in sports and adamantly oppose the use of banned substances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's withdrawal came on the same day she was scheduled to  
arrive in Seville to prepare for the 100 meters. She has competed 
in every World Championships since their inception in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey has won 34 medals in major championships, including three  
golds at the worlds. She has won seven Olympic medals, five bronzes 
and two silvers, but no golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for her glamor and grace as well as her speed, Ottey has  
been a dominant figure in the sport for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	She has dabbled in modeling and fashion design and has been a  
roving ambassador for Jamaica, where she is a top celebrity. She 
was Jamaican sportswoman of the year 15 times between 1979 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb McKenley, a member of Jamaica's gold medal 400-meter relay  
team in the 1952 Olympics, expressed ``shock and horror'' at the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Paul Wright, who has acted as team physician for several  
Jamaican track teams, said the report was devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always held Merlene as an icon, a drug-free track  
queen,'' Wright said. ``Now that's all crumbled to dust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's agent, Daniel Zimmerman, said the sprinter would fight  
to clear her name. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a strong personality that has given the sport something  
for the last 20 years, and she does not want that taken away,'' he 
said. ``She will fight this; she will get the best help possible 
from all sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, Ottey has been tested approximately 100 times, and  
all results were negative, her management company, FKG, said. The 
most recent tests in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on May 12, and in 
Stockholm, Sweden, on July 30, also have shown negative results, 
the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's positive test is the latest drug case threatening to  
overshadow the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world champion and world record-holder in the  
high jump, tested positive for cocaine at the Pan American Games 
and was stripped of his gold medal; Christie, the 1992 Olympic and 
world 100-meter champion, was suspended for a positive Nandrolone 
test; and U.S. 100-meter champion Mitchell received a two-year ban 
for testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey and Christie are among several athletes who have tested  
positive recently for Nandrolone, a performance-enhancer that goes 
back to the 1970s and has been detectable in conventional drug 
controls for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Nandrolone cases involve Britain's Doug Walker, the 1998  
European 200 champion, and the Dominican Republic's Juana Rosario 
Arrendel, the Pan American Games women's high jump gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, the IAAF's top antidoping official, said the  
rash of positive cases could be the result of more effective 
testing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it's also possible that Nandrolone is contained in  
over-the-counter drugs or food supplements. Under IAAF rules, 
athletes are responsible for any drug found in their system, 
whether or not they took it knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that the athletes have to be careful,''  
Ljungqvist said. ``If they are not sure about a product, don't take 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that a number of athletes who have tested positive  
for Nandrolone are at or near the end of their careers, suggesting 
``they are more inclined to use food supplements or other types of 
assistance to keep going.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Bank Will Not Use IMF Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In an show of confidence with  
Brazil's currency weakening, the central bank said Thursday that it 
will not draw on the third part of a $41.5 billion aid package put 
together by the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank said it will waive the right to the $4.35  
billion tranche, despite the the real sliding to its weakest point 
in over five months. The currency closed at 1.94 to the dollar on 
Thursday, compared to 1.91 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's international affairs director Daniel Gleizer said he  
was confident the real would soon regain strength after a shaky 
period this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any moment now, (the market) will realize the economy is  
growing more than expected, inflation is low, and we are meeting 
all our fiscal targets,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank will give priority to repaying the $19.2 billion  
already loaned to Brazil by the IMF and other lenders before 
drawing more, Gleizer said. The latest tranche wasn't needed as the 
capital flow into Brazil remains positive. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan was put together last year to support Brazil's economy  
as it was rocked by financial instability. Markets have recovered 
significantly in recent months, triggered by positive economic 
signs, but they have been knocked by uncertainty this week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the central bank acted to combat a slide in the  
real by suspending a 0.5 percent tax on some forms of foreign 
capital coming into Brazil. It also intervened on the currency 
market for the first time since May, selling dollars to strengthen 
the real. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks after after the government devalued the real in  
mid-January, the real plunged to a low of 2.20 to the dollar. Prior 
to that, it was worth around 1.20 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> CDC Warns of Rare Fungal Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        ATLANTA (AP) -- Three people in Arizona have contracted a fungal  
infection this year that is rare in humans and can cause noncancerous 
growths, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
        The fungus -- gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis -- is commonly  
found in decaying vegetation and soil and in the gastrointestinal tract 
of reptiles and amphibians. It is rarely found in people, the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
        Only 12 cases have ever been reported -- three in Brazil, one  
in Kuwait, one in Florida and the rest in Arizona, where the three 
most recent cases occurred between January and March, the CDC said. 
The other three Arizona cases occurred from 1994 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
        The disease is often misdiagnosed as cancer or inflammatory  
bowel disease, the CDC said. Such was the case with those infected 
in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
        The fungus is passed through ingestion or an open wound.

<HEADLINE> KB Toys Gets Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- After a net loss of over $8 million so far  
this year, Columbus-based Consolidated Stores Corp. is counting on 
online sales with its new KB Toys Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated joined with Denver-based BrainPlay.com on July 21  
to create KBkids.com. Consolidated holds 80 percent and BrainPlay 
20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The site offers over 10,000 toys, games, videos and books --  
about five times more choices than in a traditional KB Toys store. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated Stores Corp. operates 2,504 stores in all 50 states  
and Puerto Rico. Of those stores, 1,327 are toy and close-out toy 
stores operating as KB Toy Works, KB Toy Outlet and with the online 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	The KB Toys chain is the No. 2 toy retailer in the United  
States, behind Toys ``R'' Us Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated chief financial officer Michael Potter said  
Thursday that with its $1.9 billion in yearly retail toy sales, KB 
has better toy-buying power that can translate into better 
selection and lower prices for customers than cyberspace-only 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	KB will compete with the Internet's most successful vendor,  
Amazon.com, which has more than 10 million established customers 
and added a toys and games site last month. Two-year-old eToys.com, 
another competitor, is selling 100,000 items each year online. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys ``R'' Us is the No. 3 online toy retailer in terms of  
number of visitors, according to market research firm PC Data, of 
Reston, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the company plans  
to spend $50 million to revamp its Web site Toysrus.com, which 
trails SmarterKids.com, a closely held concern in Needham, Mass., 
and eToys, of Santa Monica, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Srikant Srinivasan, founder and CEO of KBkids.com, said  
Consolidated put $80 million into the Internet business and will 
spend $50 million promoting the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``By Christmas we expect to be the leader in toy sales,''  
Srinivasan said. 
</P>
<P>
	BrainPlay.com has been around for two years and was the No. 2  
online toy retailer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Srinivasan said a child who doesn't like a gift bought over the  
Internet can take it back to a store and get something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something the others can't do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Whitfield, an analyst for the brokerage firm Tucker  
Cleary, said KB is unique because up to 30 percent of its products 
are close-outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They buy it cheap and mark it up and sell it at a nice  
profit,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitfield said Internet sales will help make up for  
Consolidated's early losses this year from revenue problems with 
Odd Lots, the close-out business, and the seasonality of the toy 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated this week reported a net loss of $8.1 million, or  
seven cents per share, for the six months ending July 31, compared 
with earnings of $7.3 million, or six cents per share, in the same 
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitfield believes that by the end of the Christmas season 15  
percent of the toy industry sales will have been done on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got the child's wish list, now you don't have to fight the  
malls,'' she said. ``Plus, it's easier to keep presents a 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., did a study last  
November that predicted Internet sales ballooning to $108 billion 
in 2003 from $8 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everybody wants to join that trend.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Prosek, 64, of Warsaw in eastern Ohio, said he has a  
computer but prefers the experience of shopping in a store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy bringing the grandchildren to get a better idea of  
what they like,'' Prosek said as he shopped at a KB Toy Store in 
Columbus on Wednesday with his grandson, Austin, 7. ``Sometimes 
they have one thing in mind and then see something else they like 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his grandson, who was busy inspecting the latest Star  
Wars action figures, wouldn't have as much fun browsing an Internet 
site for toys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin is more of a hands-on type of guy,'' Prosek said.

<HEADLINE> Study of Pig Virus Eases One Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most rigorous study ever on the safety of  
transplanting animal parts into humans found no evidence that 
people caught a worrisome pig virus. The reassuring finding could 
spur experiments using pigs and other animals as organ donors. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is ``xenotransplantation,'' transplanting organs or  
cells from one species into another. Doctors hope this still highly 
experimental field could one day save thousands of lives by easing 
a worldwide shortage of donated organs. 
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists fear animal-to-human transplants also could  
cause new epidemics. The AIDS virus is thought to have jumped from 
monkeys to people long ago, and just last year pigs in Malaysia 
were sickened by a deadly new virus that they spread to people. 
</P>
<P>
	So scientists are breeding pigs -- the most likely species for  
xenotransplants -- specially tested against infections. But concern 
rose when researchers recently discovered the genes of all pigs 
harbor a previously unknown virus that test-tube experiments showed 
could infect human cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus did not harm the pigs, but nobody knew if it would  
hurt humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, published in Friday's edition of the journal  
Science, suggests this so-called ``porcine endogenous retrovirus,'' 
also known as PERV, is not a big threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at the British biotechnology company Imutran Ltd.  
tracked down 160 patients from eight countries who were treated 
experimentally with living pig tissue. Using the most rigorous 
viral testing available -- and supported by testing at the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- Imutran scientists 
found no evidence PERV had infected the 160 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the virus-free patients were 36 people deemed at high risk  
because they had very weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really good news for all those people waiting for this  
potentially lifesaving technology,'' said lead researcher Dr. 
Khazal Paradis of Imutran, which is developing ways to transplant 
entire animal organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is not proof that xenotransplantation is safe,  
cautioned CDC's Dr. Louisa Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a substantial advance that ... gives us more confidence''  
about allowing certain experiments to proceed, she said. But all 
xenotransplants must continue to be closely watched for viruses, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients studied included diabetics who had received  
transplants of pig pancreas cells, burn victims who had temporary 
pigskin grafts, or liver- or kidney-failure patients who had their 
blood filtered through pig livers or kidneys outside the body while 
awaiting a human organ transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's biggest surprise: Pig cells remained alive, with no  
detectable ill effects, inside a small group of Russian patients 
eight years after they had an unusual treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not expect the pig cells to survive for that long,''  
Paradis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians had undergone therapy apparently used nowhere else.  
The blood of 100 child burn victims was filtered through a fresh 
pig spleen for one hour to help them fight severe infection. Blood 
normally runs through the spleen, part of the immune system, and 
Russian scientists have contended this therapy works. Regardless, 
Paradis found living pig cells in 23 of the 100 Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	In most other experiments, the human immune system quickly has  
killed animal cells -- another roadblock to attempting transplants 
of entire animal organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside when animal cells survive is that ``any virus may  
not be seen by the immune system either,'' said Dr. Jonathan Allan, 
a virus expert at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research 
in San Antonio, who has been outspoken about the potential risk of 
xenotransplantation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is not a green light'' to rush ahead, warned Allan,  
who wants xenotransplant experiments limited to small numbers of 
closely monitored patients. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, that is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's  
approach. It is allowing a few small pig-to-people experiments, 
including implants of fetal pig cells into Parkinson's disease 
patients' brains, while scientists hunt potential infections. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts at transplanting animal organs into people date to  
1905, but they have failed to keep patients alive for more than a 
few days. The most famous was the 1984 transplant of a baboon heart 
into tiny Baby Fae, who died 20 days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is people's immune systems quickly recognize the  
animal organs as foreign and launch a vicious attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are working on ways to prevent such attacks and make  
animal organ transplants feasible. Research ranges from better 
immuno-suppressing drugs to work by Imutran Ltd., which is 
genetically engineering pigs to harbor a human gene that scientists 
hope will make people's bodies more tolerant of the pigs' organs. 
</P>
<P>
	But while they can't yet transplant entire organs, scientists  
are experimenting with transplants of living animal cells. A U.S. 
corporation, for instance, is implanting fetal pig cells into the 
brains of Parkinson's disease patients, and reports some early 
signals that the treatment is promising. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, scientists are trying to keep some liver transplant  
patients alive by filtering their blood through pig livers outside 
the body, a temporary ``bridge'' until they got a donated human 
liver for transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Pigs are the most likely species for animal-to-human transplants  
because their major organs are similar in size and structure to 
people's.

<HEADLINE> Fumes Kill Steel Worker in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- A steel plant maintenance worker died  
after being overcome by noxious fumes during a routine maintenance 
job this morning and three other workers were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been doing normal maintenance work in a blast furnace  
building at Rouge Steel and were found about 5 a.m. EDT, the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A 45-year-old man suffered cardiac arrest after being overcome  
by the fumes, a spokeswoman for Oakwood Hospital and Medical Center 
said. She said two other workers, ages 53 and 44, were in stable 
condition, alert and able to walk around. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit television station WXYZ-TV reported the workers had high  
levels of carbon monoxide in their blood. The hospital would not 
confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Another worker was expected to be released from Henry Ford  
Hospital later today, and a fifth was treated at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	All are employees of Metro Industrial Contracting Inc., Rouge  
Steel said. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of the fumes had not been determined, Dearborn Fire  
Chief Jack McArthur said this morning. He said the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration would investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel plant is in the same industrial complex as the Ford  
Motor Co. Rouge plant, where an explosion killed six workers last 
winter. A small explosion at the steel plant in July injured one 
worker.

<HEADLINE> Flammable Children's Robes Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bentley Lingerie is recalling more than 30,000  
children's robes because they fail to meet federal flammability 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The robes present a risk of serious burn injuries to children,  
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal standards require that children's sleepwear be flame  
resistant or self-extinguish if they ignite. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Esleep Junior'' robes in sizes four to 14 were sold for  
about $25 in JC Penney stores nationwide from July 1998 through 
April 1999. They are made of green or blue polyester, with long 
sleeves and patch pockets showing either a pair of bear cubs or a 
sleeping puppy. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are advised to stop using the robes immediately and  
return them to the store where they were purchased for a refund.

<HEADLINE> NC Family Helping Russian Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A family that adopted an ailing Russian  
boy and watched him blossom into an active 7-year-old has sold 
nearly all its possessions and is headed to Moscow to help other 
orphans. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by their adoption of Andrei and their strong religious  
faith, Tom Sullivan, a hotel manager, and his wife, Roslyn, sold 
their Charlotte home and plan to spend the next nine months 
volunteering at a Moscow orphanage, beginning this week. They will 
be joined by their children, John-David, 15, Sarah, 11, and Andrei. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are willing to sacrifice that which so many people felt  
was the real goal of life and put that aside and seek something 
that was far more valuable,'' said Rodger Loving, a family friend 
from Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sullivans will live and work at Moscow Training Center, an  
orphanage and school run by the Institute in Basic Life Principles, 
a nonprofit group based in Oak Brook, Ill., whose home school 
curriculum the Sullivans use. 
</P>
<P>
	George Mattix, the institute's international director, said most  
institute missionaries store their belongings and rent out their 
home -- but not the Sullivans. They saved only a few possessions for 
themselves -- baseball cards for John-David, heirloom china for Mrs. 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Andrei, who suffers from mild cerebral palsy,  
lived in a big playpen in Baby House No. 10, a Moscow orphanage, 
scarcely able to crawl or talk. His diet was bread, porridge and 
buttermilk, and his caretakers thought him hopelessly mentally 
retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sullivans were thinking of adopting, but had in mind a  
healthy American girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sullivan had told just two people of the family's decision.  
By coincidence, one had a friend who worked with Russian orphans 
and learned that Andrei was about to be transferred from Baby House 
No. 10 to a place where he would receive less attention and might 
not survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei was not a girl, not healthy and not American. But after  
some soul-searching, the Sullivans faxed the orphanage, pledging to 
adopt him. Ten months later, they were in Moscow, holding 
5-year-old Andrei in their arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not stimulated mentally, physically, spiritually,''  
Mrs. Sullivan said. ``You look in these faces and you see the need 
and the lack of joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Andrei gets around on one crutch and performs schoolwork at  
grade level. He speaks clearly, answering questions with a quiet, 
``Yes, ma'am.'' When his mother remarks that ``he didn't understand 
concepts like family, brother, sister, dog,'' he chimes in: ``Or 
furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God knew how hard we had been praying (for a girl), but at the  
same time, he knew what would be best,'' Mrs. Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during the trip to get Andrei that the Sullivans got  
their first look at the Moscow Training Center. The Sullivans liked 
what they saw so much that this past June they decided to move 
there. After nine months, they will return to Charlotte for three 
months, then decide what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei is excited to be visiting his old home, but doesn't  
intend to overstay his welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will go to Baby House No. 10 and after that, we will go  
back to the apartment,'' he says firmly.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gene Swap Makes Better Mouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Scientists may have built a better mouse.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers reported today that they transformed aloof  
laboratory mice into much more social creatures -- even loving ones 
-- by transplanting a single gene, raising the possibility that such 
switches from one species to another can alter behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The research could lead to new treatments for psychological  
disorders such as autism and schizophrenia that are marked by 
isolation, the Emory University researchers suggested today in the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The work involved mice and prairie voles, a small rodent known  
for its monogamous, social lifestyle and strong bond with mates. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists bred mice with a prairie vole gene that caused  
the development of receptors that respond to vasopressin, a hormone 
in the brain that affects social behavior, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Unaltered male mice put in a cage with a female would sniff her  
briefly and then scamper off to explore. Altered mice would spend 
significantly more time with the female -- and researchers said it 
was quality time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spent more time with her, smelling her, grooming her and  
generally being nice to her,'' said Larry Young, a psychology 
professor at Emory and leader of the research team. 
</P>
<P>
	The location of the receptors within the brain -- which differs  
greatly in every species examined so far -- is believed to affect 
how most animals interact. The team used mice because their genes 
are easy to manipulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there's something about the distribution of receptors  
that gives a species its typical social behavior,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists began their study observing behavioral  
differences between prairie voles and montane voles, which have 99 
percent identical DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	But while prairie voles are monogamous and spend most of their  
time with their mates and children, montane voles are promiscuous 
and typically abandon their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	Oberlin College psychology professor Norman Henderson, editor of  
the journal Behavior Genetics, said the study was interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain behaviors that are going on in psychotic  
diseases that could possibly be related to this receptor,'' he told 
the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said it was unlikely that vasopressin works alone to  
mold complex behavior such as human social interaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We humans inhibit our behaviors a lot,'' Henderson said. ``Our  
brain tells us not to behave in certain ways, even if there is some 
instinct to.''

<HEADLINE> Bengals Can't Sign Top Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals have failed in  
their latest effort to sign quarterback Akili Smith, their 
first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The club and Smith's agent, Leigh Steinberg, are at odds over  
how Smith would earn his money. The Bengals say they have offered a 
six-year deal for nearly $45 million. Under that proposal, Smith 
would average $4.7 million per year for six years if he 
participates in 55 percent of the plays and, as the contract 
progresses, has thrown for 2,500 yards in two of the three prior 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals president Mike Brown said Smith's people don't like the  
performance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``They find that absurd, and we find that more absurd that they  
look at it like that,'' Brown said. ``They want us to give 
everything to their guy. We want him to earn some of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides reportedly agree on a $10.8 million signing bonus and  
the total money. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said he had sent a series of proposals to the Bengals  
in an attempt to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals negotiator Katie Blackburn said Steinberg is looking for  
a deal that would give Smith $6 million a year if he plays in 55 
percent of the plays and throws for 2,500 yards in just one season. 
</P>
<P>
	The holdout by Smith, the former Oregon star, reaches 21 days on  
Friday. That would be the halfway point of quarterback David 
Klingler's holdout in 1992. Klingler, also a Bengals' first-round 
selection, was also a Steinberg client. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I've learned from that experience. I don't know if  
he has,'' Steinberg said, referring to Brown.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Sued Over School Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Lindsay Earls is a member of Tecumseh  
High's choir, band and -- like classmate Daniel James -- the school 
academic team. Neither feels they should have to pass a drug test 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they're trying to protect us from something we're  
not involved in,'' Miss Earls said. ``Most of us in extracurricular 
activities do not do drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two 16-year-old juniors are plaintiffs in a landmark federal  
lawsuit that challenges the Tecumseh School District's policy 
requiring students to submit to random drug tests as a condition of 
participating in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union said the lawsuit is the first  
to challenge mandatory testing of students who participate in 
activities tied to their regular school courses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, the ACLU says refusal to take a drug test would  
bar students from some classes for which they earn credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``For instance, a student can take the choir class only if she  
also participates in the extracurricular choir activities. Thus the 
drug testing policy effectively applies to parts of a public 
school's core legally required function -- the education of its 
students,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit does not challenge the testing of athletes or  
students suspected of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued today, the district's attorney, Linda  
Meoli, disputed that academic sanctions are involved and said the 
district, a small town about 45 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, 
will fight the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The district's policy is similar to policies adopted by dozens  
of schools in Oklahoma and probably hundreds of schools around the 
country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU attorney Graham Boyd said the district suspended  
enforcement of the drug policy Tuesday night, after he contacted 
the district about the planned lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's drug-testing policy applies to any student who  
wishes to participate in extracurricular activities, athletic or 
academic -- from the Future Farmers of America to student 
government. The students' family must pay $5 for the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Earls had to take a urine test to join the choir, marching  
band and academic team, which participates in statewide quiz 
competitions. The ACLU said that if she refused, her only other way 
of fulfilling the school's arts requirement would be to take 
ceramics or music appreciation, which are not as challenging and 
would not look as good on her college applications. 
</P>
<P>
	James said he had already pledged to remain drug-free as a  
member of a peer counseling group and objected to having to take a 
drug test to join the quiz bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court last year refused to hear a challenge to  
an Indiana high school's policy of drug-testing all students in 
extracurricular activities. However, ACLU officials said the 
Tecumseh policy is different because it can force students to drop 
out of academic classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Testing anybody beyond the athletes is a wide-open question,''  
Boyd said. ``What we're looking for here is a ruling, and it may 
come from the Supreme Court, saying you may not have random drug 
testing for students other than athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other school districts around the country also have been  
involved in drug testing lawsuits. A federal appeals court upheld a 
drug-testing program in the Cave City, Ark., district that requires 
students who wish to participate in extracurricular activities to 
submit to urinalysis. The Colorado Supreme Court last year struck 
down the drug-testing program of the Trinidad district, which was 
challenged by a member of the marching band.

<HEADLINE> Talk Show Slaying Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The man who killed a gay acquaintance  
after the victim revealed a crush on him during a TV taping should 
be convicted of manslaughter and nothing more, his own attorney 
told jurors today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't ask you to set him free. I want you to convict him of  
what he did,'' attorney Jerome Sabbota told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the comment in his opening statement in the retrial of  
Jonathan Schmitz, accused of second-degree murder for the 1995 
shotgun slaying of Scott Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, Oakland County assistant prosecutor Donna  
Pendergast called the crime ``the epitome of senseless violence and 
destruction, the cold-blooded and unwarranted obliteration of human 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called Schmitz ``a man with a gun, a man with a grudge.''  
She played the 911 call from Amedure's roommate and said Schmitz 
clearly had set out to kill Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, then 24, and Amedure, 32, flew to Chicago for the  
taping of an episode of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' on March 6, 1995. 
Amedure, who was gay, revealed his crush on Schmitz to the studio 
audience during the taped segment, which never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	In Schmitz's confession after the shooting three days later, the  
self-described heterosexual told police he had been humiliated on 
national television. 
</P>
<P>
	In the defense's opening argument, Sabbota contended that  
Amedure provoked Schmitz. He argued that a manslaughter conviction 
would be the just outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	After the taping, the defense contends, Amedure's affection  
turned into an obsession that frightened Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens is that Scott Amedure lights a fuse and every  
time that fuse starts to flicker out, Scott Amedure relights it,'' 
he told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder at his first trial  
in 1996, but the verdict was thrown out because of errors made by 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first trial, Schmitz's lawyers argued that mental illness  
and ambush tactics of the Jones show pushed him into a rage that 
led to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in the new trial has ruled that the defense won't be  
allowed to present evidence of Schmitz's extensive history of 
mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Michigan law, diminished mental capacity cannot be used as  
a defense against a charge of second-degree murder. Such a defense 
was allowed in the first trial because the original charge then was 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate civil case, a jury in May found the show and its  
corporate owner, Warner Bros., negligent and ordered them to pay 
$25 million in damages to Amedure's relatives.	   Ms. Jones, who testified during Schmitz's first criminal trial 
and the civil trial, is not being called as a witness for the 
retrial.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Amedure Provoked Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man went on trial Thursday for the  
second time on charges he killed a gay acquaintance after the 
victim revealed a crush on him during a TV taping of a talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense lawyer for Jonathan Schmitz said the gay man, Scott  
Amedure, was to blame because he pursued his client to the point 
that Schmitz ``lost it'' three days after the taping of ``The Jenny 
Jones Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens is that Scott Amedure lights a fuse and every  
time that fuse starts to flicker out, Scott Amedure re-lights it,'' 
Jerome Sabbota said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder in 1996 and  
sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. But an appeals court 
overturned the verdict, saying the judge was wrong to bar defense 
lawyers from removing a juror before the trial began. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first trial, Schmitz was charged with first-degree  
murder, allowing him to claim he was mentally ill at the time of 
the shooting. But in this trial he is charged with second-degree 
murder and under Michigan law not permitted to use a mental illness 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Schmitz calmly bought ammunition and a  
shotgun before shooting the defenseless Amedure twice in his home 
in March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime was ``the epitome of senseless violence and  
destruction, the cold-blooded and unwarranted obliteration of human 
life,'' Oakland County Assistant Prosecutor Donna Pendergast told 
jurors Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz and Amedure flew to Chicago for the taping of a Jenny  
Jones segment about secret same-sex crushes on March 6, 1995. 
Amedure revealed his crush on Schmitz to the studio audience during 
the show, which was taped but never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabbota claims Schmitz was humiliated, and that Amedure later  
pushed him over the edge by leaving a suggestive note in Schmitz's 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate civil case, an Oakland County jury in May found  
the show and Warner Bros. negligent and ordered them to pay $25 
million in damages to Amedure's relatives. Warner Bros. is 
appealing that decision.

	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Paul Reyna, a 19-year-old freshman defensive  
tackle for Boise State, was in critical condition today after 
surgery for a head injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hurt in Boise State's first scrimmage Wednesday evening,  
apparently when his head hit the artificial turf during a play. The 
270-pound lineman from La Puente, Calif., walked off the field on

<HEADLINE> Kim Perrot Was a Feisty Competitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kim Perrot and Teresa Weatherspoon battled each  
other from college all the way to the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon recalls playing feisty games against Perrot and Sun  
Belt Conference rival Southwestern Louisiana in the late 1980s. The 
two point guards were adversaries during the game, but always 
shared a hug and a smile afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot, the popular Houston Comets point guard, died Thursday of  
lung cancer. She was 32. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been hard,'' said Weatherspoon, who learned of Perrot's  
death before taking the floor Thursday night with the New York 
Liberty. ``She had been keeping in touch with me, and I had been 
keeping in touch with her. But I just learned of her passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot went on to lead the nation in scoring (30.1 ppg) during  
her senior year and set 26 school records for the Ragin' Cajuns. 
Her most memorable basketball moment came when she scored 58 points 
against Southeastern Louisiana in a double-overtime game. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon, who played at Louisiana Tech, and Perrot renewed  
their friendly rivalry in the professional ranks. Perrot was second 
in voting behind Weatherspoon for the 1998 WNBA defensive player of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a 5-foot-5, 130-pound dynamo from Lafayette, La.,  
called ``Kim-Bim'' by her family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty had a moment of silence after a recent practice to  
pray for Perrot and most players were informed of Perrot's death 
before their game against the Cleveland Rockers. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Kym Hampton sang the national anthem Thursday night  
as the rest of the Liberty embraced at center court, wiping away 
tears.

</P>
<P>
	-- 1920 Comptometer, ``The Machine Gun of the Office,'' one of  
the first machines that could calculate faster than accountants, 
many of whom could add four columns of figures at a time.

competition, began experimenting with mechanical tabulation 
methods. In 1884, he patented the first ``Census Machine,'' which 
was used to tabulate the 1890 U.S. Census. He improved the 
machines, incorporating the tabulator and punched cards, and built 
an international clientele which included railway offices, the 
Czarist government of Russia, department stores and insurance

primitive forerunner to today's hard disk drives. The 3 1/2-foot-tall 
drum rotated 3,600 times per minute and once it reached its 
operational temperature, it had to cool down for three hours before 
the cover could be opened. The device has 1,024 individual read and

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Wins Bid for Reynolds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa Inc., the world's largest maker of  
aluminum, reached agreement to acquire No. 3 Reynolds Metals Inc. 
for more than $4 billion Thursday. But the deal disappointed Wall 
Street because it was only slightly better than Alcoa's initial 
hostile bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both companies tumbled, reducing the value of the  
all-stock transaction to $4.34 billion from $4.45 billion. Alcoa's 
initial bid, made Aug. 11, was $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds accepted Alcoa's unsolicited advances over those of  
Michigan Avenue Partners, a little-known Chicago investment group, 
after Alcoa threatened to take its bid directly to Reynolds 
shareholders. But Reynolds also won a concession from Alcoa that 
gives it 30 days to solicit a better offer and Michigan Avenue 
Partners refused to step aside from the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds agreed to be acquired for 1.06 shares of Alcoa stock  
for each of its shares, which was valued at $70.88 3/4 when the deal 
was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	That was at the bottom end of analysts' estimates that Reynolds  
was worth $70 to $80 a share. By end of trading Thursday, Alcoa 
stock had dropped 2.5 percent, reducing the value of the offer to 
$69.09 7/8 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the confusion, Reynolds has a month to seek a better  
deal, but would have to pay Alcoa $100 million if it walks away 
from Alcoa, said Alain J. P. Belda, Alcoa's president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Avenue Partners said it would continue to pursue  
Reynolds, according to Dow Jones Newswires. Michael Lynch, the 
chairman of the real estate investment group, did not immediately 
return repeated telephone calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The real estate investment group entered the metals industry  
last year with the purchase of a Reynolds plant in McCook, Ill., 
and has purchased about $1 billion in aluminum assets in the past 
18 months. It has yet to disclose the terms of its offer but has 
questioned whether an Alcoa-Reynolds merger will survive an 
antitrust review. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal that would create a company with annual sales of $20.5  
billion, about 120,000 employees and operations in 36 countries. It 
would control more than one-sixth of the world's aluminum 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would unite two storied companies.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, the world's oldest aluminum manufacturer, made engine  
parts for the Wright Brothers' plane. Reynolds was instrumental in 
marketing the first aluminum soda cans and later created flip tops 
that stay with cans after opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Belda said Alcoa would preserve Reynolds' brand name. ``Reynolds  
Wrap is the Coca-Cola of the foil business,'' said David Moison, an 
analyst with Metals Research Inc. of suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators likely will be concerned whether the merger will mean  
higher prices for consumers or for Alcoa's and Reynolds' customers, 
said Steve Newborn, a former mergers attorney for the Federal Trade 
Commission who now heads of the antitrust division at the Rogers &AMP; 
Wells law firm in Washington. And the manufacturers' customers -- 
makers of everything from cola cans to automobiles and jet planes -- 
may balk if prices go up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcoa is likely to encounter headwinds with the  
trustbusters,'' said Moison, the Metals Research analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the merged company will own three-fifths of the  
equipment that turns bauxite into alumina in the United States and 
Canada. Alumina, when charged with electricity during smelting, 
becomes aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Alcoa and Richmond, Va.-based Reynolds said  
they hope the takeover will be completed by year's end. Reynolds' 
shareholders also must approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The aluminum industry is consolidating following a decade of  
troubles. Companies in the former Soviet Union flooded the market 
with aluminum as they sought foreign currency, pushing prices down. 
The financial crisis in Asia, Russia and Latin America depressed 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, the capacity to make aluminum far exceeds the demand,  
said Robert Dammon, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswomen for both companies had no comment on the prospect of  
job cuts or plant closings, but there were expectations that 
payrolls would be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason that they're merging is to consolidate operations,  
and you are going to have plant closings and layoffs. It is going 
to happen,'' said Dammon. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa went public with its unsolicited bid for Reynolds on Aug.  
11, shortly after No. 2 aluminum maker Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of 
Canada reached an agreement to merge with two European rivals to 
create a company with about $21 billion in annual sales, about the 
same size as a combined Alcoa and Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa fell $1.68 3/4 to $65.18 3/4 a share Thursday on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where Reynolds fell 3.9 percent, or $2.68 3/4, at 
$65.56 1/4.

<HEADLINE> An Energetic `Kat and the Kings' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They are a hardworking ensemble, but the  
entertainment never quite equals the energy level at ``Kat and the 
Kings,'' a lively little South African musical that looks a bit 
undersized on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a slight, mild show, one that has trouble keeping the  
audience's attention despite the exhortations and talent of its six 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical, on view at the Cort Theater, celebrates a fictional  
black doo-wop group that came of age in the late 1950s in Cape 
Town. It's framed in flashback, told in the present by the onetime 
leader of the group, played by two actors as an older and younger 
Kat Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	The six -- five men and one woman -- sometimes speak directly to  
the audience, talking between authentic-sounding songs written by 
lyricist David Kramer and composer Taliep Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	Their stories are obvious and the humor broad, delivered against  
the uneasy backdrop of apartheid, which every so often gets a 
mention and then disappears. They live in District Six, an area of 
Cape Town for nonwhites that was later rezoned and redone for 
whites only in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The men thrive on American rock 'n' roll, more specifically  
doo-wop, as a means of breaking out of lives that define them 
strictly by race. The quartet starts singing in black clubs before 
graduating to a posh white hotel, where they have to work as 
bellhops when they are not performing. 
</P>
<P>
	The leads are ingratiating. Terry Hector plays the older Kat,  
who in the present shines shoes for a living. Hector has a genial 
manner that dovetails nicely with a show that seems determined to 
please at all costs. Jody J. Abrahams, the younger Kat, is a 
genuine find. He has style and flair, two qualities needed to pull 
off the songs when the material starts to get repetitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The bespectacled Alistair Izobell, playing a lad with the  
appropriate name of Magoo, appears to be jet-propelled. He shoots 
across the stage with astonishing speed, nimbly executing the 
flashy footwork devised by Abrahams and Loukmaan Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams is also in the cast, getting to do a vague impersonation  
of Elvis, while Junaid Booysen, a lanky fellow, pines to a typical 
'50s song about the girl of his dreams, here called Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Louis, the cast's sole female, gets a few generic love  
songs. She also has a romance with the group's unseen white 
manager, which eventually forces them to leave South Africa for 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The most poignant scene occurs near the end of the show when the  
audience learns what happens to these five people -- how their 
dreams did or did not turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	And musically, the production's best moments are its last, when  
the high-spirited cast members, already in overdrive, mix doo-wop 
with more native South African music. It's exhilarating and makes 
one realize what has been missing from the rest of this peculiar 
evening of song.

him. If you're going to arrest him, you're going to have to arrest 
me, too.''

<HEADLINE> Bank Insiders Can Beat the System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was an official document called a  
suspicious activity report, which banks and other financial 
institutions are required to file with federal authorities when 
employees detect unusually large deposits or transfers or other 
aberrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of New York Co. is believed to have filed the report  
sometime after federal authorities began investigating accusations 
that Russian mobsters holding accounts at the bank may have used it 
to launder billions of dollars. British authorities reportedly 
alerted the FBI to suspected money laundering at the bank more than 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's report was one of more than 150,000 suspicious  
activity reports filed by U.S. banks, thrifts and credit unions 
since the federal requirement went into effect about two years ago. 
The reports are submitted to the Treasury Department's Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCen, and shared with law 
enforcement authorities and the federal bank regulatory agencies, 
such as the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency, which oversees nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet despite the new national system, and vigilance by financial  
institutions, bank insiders bent on money laundering or other 
criminal pursuits still can beat the system, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really gets tough is when people on the inside compromise  
the system,'' Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant based in 
Alexandria, Va., said Thursday. ``Any time people get inside help, 
it's tougher for the bank to detect activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said questions likely will be raised about Bank of New York's  
procedures for screening customers following a New York Times story 
that as much as $10 billion was laundered through the nation's 
15th-largest bank in what investigators say is an operation run by 
Russian organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $4.2 billion passed through a single account in more than  
10,000 transactions between October and March, the Times reported 
Thursday, citing unidentified investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank has suspended two senior officers in its Eastern  
European division pending the outcome of the investigation, but 
said the case appeared to be an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank of New York has been cooperating with the office of the  
U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in the 
confidential investigation of the use of bank facilities to 
transfer funds from Russia to other countries,'' the bank said in a 
statement, adding that no funds were lost and there were no 
allegations of wrongdoing by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	It declined to provide further details.  
</P>
<P>
	Big U.S. banks and foreign nationals have been involved in other  
recent cases: 
</P>
<P>
	--Officials at Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, violated  
their own money-laundering controls in helping the brother of 
former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari move as much as 
$100 million in alleged drug money out of the country, 
congressional investigators concluded in December. 
</P>
<P>
	--BankBoston Corp. disciplined 20 employees last summer for  
negligence in connection with the case of fugitive former bank 
executive Ricardo Carrasco, a Uruguayan citizen accused of 
embezzling $73 million by making fraudulent loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have insider complicity ... you can go a long way if  
you want to abuse a financial institution,'' said Charles Intriago, 
publisher of Money Laundering Alert, a monthly publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The system of requiring banks to file suspicious activity  
reports with the government isn't ``infallible,'' Intriago 
maintained, though it has improved efforts to suppress money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials view money laundering as the Achilles' heel  
of organized crime -- the need to convert illegal and unusable 
proceeds into usable funds. An estimated $57 billion in illicit 
proceeds is laundered through banks each year by drug traffickers 
and other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury officials say the system of suspicious activity reports  
has made a strong start, and has banking industry support. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the American Bankers Association weren't available  
for comment on the matter Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Derby-Preakness Winner Cracks Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Winning the Breeders' Cup Classic  
is a tough assignment. This year, just getting to the race seems to 
be even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest star to fall is Real Quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner who also captured  
the Pimlico Special and Hollywood Gold Cup is out for the year with 
a cracked bone in his right front leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, injury ended the careers of Charismatic, this year's  
Derby-Preakness winner; Victory Gallop, winner of 1998 Belmont 
Stakes and of the Whitney Handicap on Aug. 1 at Saratoga, and Free 
House, winner of the 1998 Pacific Classic and this year's Santa 
Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, Real Quiet's Bob Baffert-trained stablemate,  
winner of the Derby and Preakness in 1997 and the Dubai World Cup 
in 1998, was retired in June after a fourth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the 4-year-old Real Quiet will join them in retirement  
is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little crack in the splint bone in the right front  
leg,'' Baffert said Thursday from Del Mar in California. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's been told the injury should heal fine, but ``we'll  
wait 90 days and see how it looks. He's finished for this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said the injury was discovered after Real Quiet worked  
seven furlongs Sunday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a little filling, and X-rays showed a little crack  
at the top of the splint bone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet, who won the Hollywood Gold Cup in his last start  
June 27, was scheduled to start next in the Pacific Classic on Aug. 
29 at Del Mar, then run in the $4 million Breeders Cup Classic 
</P>
<P>
	When Real Quiet, owned by Mike Pegram, is retired, he will stand  
at stud at The Vinery in Kentucky. Purchased for $17,000, Real 
Quiet has won six of 20 starts and has earned $3,271,803. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram also owns the Baffert-trained Silverbulletday. The two  
men are to arrive in Saratoga Springs tonight to watch the prized 
3-year-old filly run in the Alabama on Saturday.

	Alcoa Wins Bid for Reynolds  
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa Inc., the world's largest maker of  
aluminum, reached agreement to acquire No. 3 Reynolds Metals Inc. 
for more than $4 billion, but disappointed Wall Street with a deal 
today that is only slightly better than its initial hostile bid. 
Shares of both companies tumbled after the agreement was announced, 
reducing the value of the all-stock transaction to $4.34 billion 
from $4.45 billion. The deal is pegged to Alcoa stock initially 
valued at $70.88 3/4 a share, which was at the bottom end of analysts' 
estimates of Reynolds' worth. By the end of trading today, Alcoa 
stock had dropped 2.5 percent, reducing the value of the offer to 
$69.09 7/8 a share.

half-year trade deficit more than 40 percent ahead of the pace for 
1998 when the imbalance reached an all-time high. The unexpectedly 
large $24.6 billion June deficit, 16.3 percent above the May level, 
provided a sobering backdrop today to the opening of hearings by a 
congressionally appointed panel searching for solutions to 
America's trade woes. Economists told the U.S. Trade Deficit Review 
Commission that the current trends are unsustainable and if not 
reversed, could represent a serious threat to the U.S. economy.

Japan Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd. each

nation's third-largest bank tries to streamline its operations. 
Chase, which has divided its $39 billion U.S. equity management 
business between offices in New York and Houston, will shift all of 
the operations to Houston. The development fueled more rumors about 
an eventual merger between Chase and Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch, 
the nation's largest stock brokerage firm, has a $309 billion U.S.

were $9 million, or 8 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 31, 
compared with a loss of $9.68 million, or 8 cents a share, a year 
earlier. The 1999 results exclude a $36 million gain in the quarter 
that came from the May initial public stock offering of

<HEADLINE> A Delightful Dasher Wins Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- Texan Gwendolyn Eaves is going to get  
another chance to win the richest event in quarter horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaves' 2-year-old gelding A Delightful Dasher romped to a  
two-length victory Thursday in the trials for the $2 million All 
American Futurity and posted the top qualifying time of 21.533 
seconds for the 440-yard sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen trial races were run at Ruidoso Downs, with the  
fastest 10 horses advancing to the futurity on Labor Day. The 
winner earns $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaves, from Midland, Texas, has had horses in the All American  
twice before in recent years, but has yet to get to the winner's 
circle. In last year's futurity, Eaves' Hes My Dasher finished 
fourth and in 1994, her filly Delightful Lark, finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher, trained by John Bassett and ridden by Joe  
Badilla, won the ninth trial Thursday for his third victory in five 
starts this season. Last month, he won the $528,587 Rainbow 
Futurity over the same Ruidoso Downs track. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher was bumped slightly coming out of the  
starting gate, but quickly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicks Call Me, an unbeaten gelding, had the second-fastest  
qualifying time at 21.607 seconds. Owned by C.E. Tuggle and W.R. 
Anglin of Catoosa, Okla., the grey speedster never was challenged 
and won by two lengths in scoring his sixth straight victory this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicks Called Me was ridden by Jacky Martin, who has won the All  
American six times. Martin won six races in the trials and two of 
his other winners, the fillies Significant Speed and Familiar 
Faces, also qualified for the All American. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle and Anglin got their horse into the trials by putting up  
a late supplemental fee of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other horses whose owners also paid the late $50,000 failed  
to make the futurity field. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-fastest qualifying time was run by He Rocks, a gelding  
owned by Harvey Farr of Decatur, Texas. He Rocks' time was 21.623 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Snappy Dragon, a gelding owned by M. Elizabeth De Young of  
Decatur, Texas, won his trial with the fourth-fastest time, 21.706 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the qualifiers were Tell Her More, a filly; Tiny  
First Dash, a filly; Southern Cash Man, a gelding; and Moolah 
Memories, a filly. 
</P>
<P>
	Tell Her More is trained by Jack Brooks, who has won seven All  
Americans, including last year's race with Falling In Loveagain.

<HEADLINE>  First Anti-Milosevic Rally Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Organizers of a major rally against  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accused police today of 
trying to intimidate their supporters by warning people to stay 
away because of possible trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The first anti-Milosevic rally in the capital in years is due to  
start in front of the Yugoslav Parliament building in downtown 
Belgrade later today. Protesters had started gathering by early 
afternoon, with many being transported in buses from other Serbian 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent attempt to keep people away, Belgrade police said  
Wednesday they arrested a man with a ``highly explosive device'' 
and warned of possible bombing attacks at ``massive public 
gatherings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The police statement was prominently read several times during  
main state-run TV news, with an additional warning to parents to 
keep their children inside during the planned rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The regime is trying to frighten the citizens and to transfer  
its own fear of the opposition to the people,'' said Liljana Lucic, 
Democratic Party deputy president. She expressed hoped the police 
statement won't prevent the crowd from attending because ``the 
people have developed immunity from fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several opposition parties organizing the rally, the first since  
the 78-day NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that ended in June, said they 
had not been issued a police permit to hold the rally by noon 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Zika Andjelkovic, one of the organizers, told independent B2-92  
radio he expected the authorities to cut electricity off during the 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities have launched a massive campaign against the  
rally, claiming it is intended as a celebration of President 
Clinton's birthday today and in support of NATO ``occupation'' of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivica Dacic, the spokesman for Milosevic's ruling Socialist  
Party, said today he expects ``nothing'' to come out of the rally 
because the opposition has no popular support. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think of those who will speak at the rally the same way  
as they think of those who have bombarded Yugoslavia,'' Dacic told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some key opposition figures have announced they will not attend.  
The Alliance of Democratic Parties, a coalition of several small 
parties including ethnic Hungarians from northern Serbia, backed 
out of the rally today, citing unspecified ``organizational 
differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, the most charismatic  
speaker in the opposition, said he would not attend but would send 
a representative to spell out demands for Milosevic's resignation 
and immediate elections under international supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview today with CNN, Draskovic said the ``real moment  
for strong public pressure'' for Milosevic to resign had passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We demand: the resignation of Slobodan Milosevic, (Serbian  
President) Milan Milutinovic, both (Yugoslav and Serbian) 
governments, the creation of a transitional government and 
immediate elections'' under supervision of the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-Milosevic protests began in Serbia after the NATO air  
campaign left the country badly damaged, impoverished, isolated and 
without control over the southern province of Kosovo. The campaign 
was launched to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for the 
separatist Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent attempt to defuse tensions that have threatened  
Milosevic's autocratic rule, his Socialist Party on Wednesday 
offered to hold early elections. Regular elections are scheduled 
for 2001.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Continues To Swell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans snapped up foreign-made cars,  
computers and clothing at a record rate in June, catapulting the 
half-year trade deficit more than 40 percent ahead of the pace for 
1998 when the imbalance reached an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpectedly large $24.6 billion June deficit, 16.3 percent  
above the May level, provided a sobering backdrop Thursday to the 
opening of hearings by a congressionally appointed panel searching 
for solutions to America's trade woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent economists told the U.S. Trade Deficit Review  
Commission that the current trends are unsustainable and if not 
reversed, could represent a serious threat to the U.S. economy down 
the road. This scenario could lead to a sharp drop in the dollar's 
value, driving down stock and bond prices in the United States as 
foreign investors dump their dollar-denominated holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Those worries also invaded Wall Street, where the  
worse-than-expected trade numbers reported by the Commerce 
Department sent the dollar down against both the Japanese yen and 
the new joint European currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices fell as well as investors wondered whether a weaker  
dollar, by pushing up the price of imports, would make the Federal 
Reserve even more agitated about inflation prospects. The market 
has been especially jittery in advance of Tuesday's Fed meeting. It 
is widely expected that interest rates will rise for a second time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 27.54 points at  
10,963.89, after having dropped as much as 118 points in earlier 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, the U.S. trade deficit is  
running at an annual rate of $236 billion -- 44 percent above last 
year's $164.3 billion record imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of goods and services posted a 3.9 percent advance in  
June to an all-time high of $103 billion. U.S. exports, which have 
suffered from the effects of the Asian currency crisis, did manage 
a small 0.5 percent gain to $78.3 billion, only the second advance 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists explained to the commission what is behind the  
deficit: a surging U.S. economy over the past two years against the 
backdrop of a worldwide slump triggered by the Asian crisis. 
Foreigners have been happy to sell their products into the U.S. 
market and take U.S. dollars in payment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Catherine Mann, a researcher at the Institute for  
International Economics, told commission members that current 
trends cannot last. Eventually, foreigners will find other places 
to invest their money, making it more costly to finance U.S. trade 
deficits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on a trajectory that is unsustainable and at some point  
of time, the rest of the world is going to decide they don't want 
to lend to us anymore,'' Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent economist Lester Thurow, a professor at the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the 
commission, argued that the United States could see a situation of 
``capital flight'' similar to what hit South Korea and other 
troubled Asian countries in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring trade deficit has created political headaches for  
the Clinton administration and Congress. Pressure is growing for 
Washington to erect new trade barriers to help domestic industries 
such as steel combat a flood of cheaper-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, president of the United Steel Workers union and  
another member of the deficit commission, said the U.S. economy has 
continued to post healthy growth rates despite the bigger deficits. 
Over the long run, though, he said those deficits were likely to 
``become a liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Weidenbaum, a top economist in the Reagan administration  
who is the chairman of the 12-member deficit commission, said the 
panel expected to produce a consensus report on the causes, effects 
and solutions to the trade deficit by next August. 
</P>
<P>
	For June, a $415 million rise in exports, led by stronger sales  
of U.S.-made cars and auto parts, was swamped by the surge in 
imports, which increased by $3.9 billion. The import gain was led 
by big increases in shipments of foreign cars and parts, clothing, 
computers and telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	America's foreign oil bill rose 3.7 percent in June to $5.5  
billion as crude oil imports climbed to the highest level since 
November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the United States' deficit with Japan ballooned by 19.3  
percent in June to $6.3 billion for the month. The monthly deficit 
with China also rose by 7.9 percent to $5.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Family Flees to Keep Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- To social workers, Wally and Debby Hines are  
abusive parents who beat their infant son until his bones broke and 
then skipped town one step ahead of police. 
</P>
<P>
	But family members and some doctors say the Hineses are victims  
of a misunderstanding -- parents whose 1-year-old son, Wyatt, has a 
rare brittle-bone disease that explains his multiple and repeated 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The county made a stand and they couldn't figure out how to  
back out of it gracefully,'' said the child's grandfather, Wally 
Hines Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Hines III, 30, and Debby Hines, 32, have been in hiding  
since April 27, when they learned police were coming for their son. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started to panic and cry,'' according an e-mail from the  
couple that was printed Wednesday in the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. 
They communicated via e-mail instead of by phone because they fear 
capture. ``We felt so helpless against this all-powerful, cruel and 
unjust system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their attorney's efforts to negotiate a deal with Dakota County  
officials for their return have failed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems began last year, when X-rays showed that Wyatt,  
then-6 weeks old, had broken a femur, or thigh bone, in two places. 
Child protection workers ordered more X-rays, and doctors found six 
broken ribs. The parents were accused of child abuse, and Wyatt was 
put in temporary foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, two doctors diagnosed Wyatt with the brittle-bone  
disease osteogenesis imperfecta, or OI. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Justis stood by his diagnosis Wednesday. He said there  
were no bruises around Wyatt's fractures, and that the boy broke 
more ribs while in the hospital and in foster care -- typical of 
children with OI. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do nothing and they get fractures,'' he said. ``They  
sneeze and ribs break. They hit their legs on doors as they go 
through them and break their ankles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities remain skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	County Attorney James Backstrom, in a memo, said several doctors  
dispute the diagnosis and attribute the boy's injuries to 
roughhousing by his father. The memo quoted police and medical 
workers as saying ``the father laughed when he discussed the 
child's injuries, and he seemed totally unconcerned about them'' 
when the injuries first turned up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Relatives of the child's mother who were consulted about the  
situation stated that they didn't think the mother could protect 
the baby from the father, that the mother was `covering' for her 
husband, and that the father can `lose control,''' the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the injuries that happened in the hospital, Backstrom  
said the parents had unsupervised access to Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Beth Huber, a spokeswoman for the Ostoegenesis Imperfecta  
Foundation in Gaithersburg, Md., said it is easy to confuse OI with 
abuse. The genetic disease affects an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests for it are only about 85 percent accurate, and most  
emergency room physicians -- who often report suspected abuse to 
authorities -- have little or no experience with it, Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there are no figures on how widespread mix-ups are, but  
her organization received inquiries on potential cases from every 
state last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyatt was returned to his mother in November after three months  
in foster care. His father was required to live elsewhere for four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A final custody hearing was scheduled for May, but Wyatt broke  
his femur again in April and required another cast. When the 
Hineses missed a follow-up doctor's appointment April 27, 
authorities sent police to their home for Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hineses said they didn't know the appointment was scheduled  
until a doctor inadvertently told them about the police. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the clock ticking loudly, knowing that at any minute  
they might whisk our precious son away from us,'' they told the 
newspaper. ``We both looked at each other and immediately knew that 
we had to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They fled the state, but not before grabbing whatever  
possessions they could, including letters from doctors and medical 
records that they believe exonerate them. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge has since awarded custody of Wyatt to the county and  
criminal flight charges have been filed against the parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents told the newspaper Wyatt is healthy, happy and  
getting medical care from doctors who have never questioned the OI 
diagnosis. Hines, who worked for Sun Country Airline, said he has 
found work as a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple would not disclose where they were living or whether  
they're using fake identification, saying: ``We struggle daily with 
the fear of being discovered.''

<HEADLINE> Official Resigns After Booze Cruise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Citing his ``errors in judgment,'' the head of the  
state Port Authority has resigned following his trip on a ``booze 
cruise'' paid for by his agency during which a woman bared her 
breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Photographs of the four-hour party boat cruise were published in  
Wednesday's Boston Herald, which said its reporters saw agency 
chief Peter Blute and lobbyist Sandy Tennant, who once headed the 
state Republican Party, drinking beer and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the harbor tour, a female passenger lifted her  
shirt, eliciting whoops and hollers from other passengers, the 
newspaper said. The Herald published a photo of the woman with her 
shirt raised, blacking out the section of the photo showing her 
breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Massport, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
told The Associated Press that Blute, a former congressman, was not 
on deck when the woman bared her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter of resignation to Gov. Paul Cellucci, Blute wrote,  
``Recent errors in judgment by myself have called into question my 
ability to remain as executive director of this authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cellucci said he supported Blute's departure, saying he  
``exercised bad judgment and acted inappropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The authority, commonly known as Massport, oversees Logan  
International Airport and the Port of Boston and has annual revenue 
of $330 million. Blute, who was appointed in 1997 by former Gov. 
William Weld, made $120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennant said he was on the cruise to help Maureen Stemberg,  
ex-wife of Staples office-supply founder and Republican fund-raiser 
Thomas Stemberg, plan a fund-raiser for a cancer charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Massport spokesman Jeremy Crockford said Massport reserved the  
boat, and paid $834 for the charter, with the understanding that 
Ms. Stemberg would repay the agency. In the meantime, Blute wrote a 
personal check Wednesday to reimburse Massport, Crockford said. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed up for the cruise bringing three young women in his  
white Mercedes. Tennant, whose license was revoked for 120 days 
after a May 20 drunken driving arrest, said he wasn't driving. The 
arrest was particularly embarrassing for Tennant since it happened 
shortly after he had challenged Texas Gov. George W. Bush at a 
fund-raiser about his past drinking.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Schourek To Miss One Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Pete Schourek will miss his next scheduled  
start for the Pittsburgh Pirates because of an inflamed left 
shoulder and may go on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek had a magnetic resonance imaging test on his left  
shoulder Wednesday that found nothing more severe than 
inflammation. Jimmy Anderson will start in his place Saturday 
against Arizona's Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a while, so the DL is definitely a possibility,''  
manager Gene Lamont said before a game against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek complained of a sore shoulder following his start  
Monday night, a 9-2 loss to the Reds. Schourek lasted a season-low 
2 2-3 innings, giving up five runs, four hits and four walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek returned to Pittsburgh on Tuesday night and had the MRI  
as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek, 30, has been bothered by elbow problems since he led  
the Reds to the NL championship series in 1995. He had surgery to 
tighten ligaments in the elbow and clean out scar tissue in July 
1996, followed by arthroscopic surgery to remove bone spurs in 
October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 starts and eight relief appearances, he's gone 3-7 with a  
5.68 ERA.

	``There is an unlimited number of original designs that  
eMachines could have created for their computers, but instead they 
chose to copy Apple's designs,'' said Steve Jobs, Apple's interim 
CEO.

	Last month, Compaq Computer Corp. sued eMachines and its parent  
companies for allegedly infringing on 13 patents protecting 
Compaq's PC technology.

<HEADLINE> Chase Cuts 32 Jobs in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Bank has closed its U.S. equity  
management department in New York, eliminating 32 jobs, as the 
nation's third-largest bank tries to streamline its operations, 
according to company executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase, which has divided its $39 billion U.S. equity management  
business between offices in New York and Houston, will shift all of 
the operations to Houston. Henry Lartigue, executive vice president 
and chief investment officer for Chase Bank of Texas, will oversee 
the combined asset management business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal for the  
bank,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. She 
added, however: ``There are some people reading into it that it 
would speed the concept of an acquisition of Merrill Lynch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A merger between Chase and the Merrill Lynch ``has been rumored  
a thousand times,'' she said. A deal between the two companies 
``makes strategic sense, but it all depends on the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest stock brokerage firm, has a  
$309 billion U.S. asset management business based in Princeton, 
N.J. Both companies invest money for wealthy individuals, pension 
funds and mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	David Klassen, head of U.S. equities for Chase in New York, was  
the most senior executive to lose his job in the shakeout. A call 
to his office was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Chase fell $2.56 1/4 to $82.43 3/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Mickey Blue Eyes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stammering, eyelid-fluttering Hugh Grant as an innocent who  
marries into the Mob? 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds like an idea offered by a junior executive at a studio  
meeting, but it works -- beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a witty, offbeat script by Adam Scheinman and Robert  
Kuhn and feather-light direction by Kelly Makin, ``Mickey Blue 
Eyes'' takes off from the opening scenes and the laughs keep 
building. Grant contributes his best screen work, proving that he 
is the best light comedian in films today. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant plays a successful auctioneer in a British-owned gallery  
in New York. He is enamored of a black-haired beauty, Jeanne 
Tripplehorn, and he proposes marriage in a Chinese restaurant. She 
admits she loves him, but says they can never marry. 
</P>
<P>
	She dashes out, leaving Grant dismayed. He discovers that her  
father runs a restaurant nearby, and he goes there to seek an 
explanation. He is greeted warmly by the father, James Caan, and is 
introduced to a gallery of tight-lipped, battle-scarred relatives 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant gets an inkling of the family's occupation when he goes  
looking for the men's room. He mistakenly opens the walk-in 
freezer. Shivering inside is a man unhappily in arrears of his debt 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Tripplehorn's fears are realized when her father insists on  
a marriage and Grant is inexorably drawn into the family business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mickey Blue Eyes'' (the name Grant is given when he is forced  
to masquerade as a Midwest mobster) contains a series of convulsive 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the best has the members of two New York mobs holding a  
peace meeting in an abandoned warehouse. The leader of one side 
delivers his edicts in a high-pitched rasp that sounds like an 
incoherent Don Corleone. His henchman acts as interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	To pose as Mickey Blue Eyes, Grant must convert his English  
accent into mob talk. Caan's attempts to teach him the dialect are 
hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
	If ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' seems a perfect fit for Grant, it may be  
because he reportedly worked with the screenwriters over a two-year 
period. The movie was produced by the whimsically titled Simian 
Films, which consists of Grant and his personal partner, Elizabeth 
Hurley. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Tripplehorn gives a winning portrait of a woman caught  
between two worlds. Caan, in a funny, subdued version of his Sonny 
Corleone, makes a prime contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Also notable: James Fox as the blithely oblivious owner of the  
auction house, and Burt Young, peering viciously through 
Coke-bottle-bottom glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warner Bros. release of a Castle Rock Entertainment film was  
produced by Hurley and Charles Mulvehill. Rated PG-13 for language 
and gangland brutality. Running time: 94 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Bob Dole Quietly Helps Wife's Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's tapping at the door, but Elizabeth Dole's  
campaign is not quite ready to let Bob Dole in. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 GOP presidential nominee has been quietly working the  
telephone to drum up money and political organizers for his wife, 
Elizabeth, and her 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to make sure everybody knows this is HER campaign  
... not a co-presidency thing,'' the former senator, now a 
lobbyist, said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Being purposefully kept out of her spotlight, he flew solo at  
small-fund raisers in far-flung Iowa outposts leading up to last 
weekend's Iowa straw poll. There, he stood by his wife's side and -- 
for the most part -- courted voters with just a smile, a handshake 
and a quip. 
</P>
<P>
	The former GOP presidential nominee spoke most admiringly of how  
his wife pulled off a strong third-place showing in the straw poll, 
despite being outspent four or five times over by Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush and millionaire businessman Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear they're giving her the Scrooge award for spending the  
least,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke almost longingly for the campaign trail, for a piece of  
the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever somebody blows a whistle, I'll be there,'' he said,  
pointing out that his wife has some 25 fund-raising appearances 
scheduled over the next 45 days. ``Hopefully, I'll be able to do 
some of these for her just as she did some for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One campaign official responded with a firm ``not likely.''  
While Sen. Dole remains enormously popular among many Republicans, 
contributors come to fund-raisers to see the candidate, this 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the former senator is offering his wife comfort  
after a long day on the stump. ``She came home Monday and we 
watched a movie,'' he recalled with a genial chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I've seen 'em all, sitting in hotel rooms all day.  
Maybe pretty soon I can start showing up (at her events) more.''

<HEADLINE> IAAF Tightens Nationality Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Concerned that richer nations are luring  
away athletes from poorer countries, track and field's governing 
body voted Thursday to tighten rules concerning nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	While previously needing only to live in a country in order to  
be eligible to compete under its flag, athletes must now acquire 
full citizenship of their adoptive nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, athletes will only be able to represent their  
adoptive land if they have not competed for their former country 
for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be three years since the date you last represented  
the first country at World Championships, Olympic Games and a 
number of other events, including World Cup, before you can 
represent your new country at the same level,'' IAAF general 
secretary Istvan Gyulai said. ``This can be, if both federations 
concerned agree, reduced to one year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gyulai said certain exceptional situations, as in the case of  
refugees, would be reviewed by the IAAF council on an individual 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a popular way to switch countries, marriage will no longer  
provide a loophole. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are cases of marriages of convenience,'' Gyulai said.  
``In one year we suddenly saw 10 athletes all marry and move to the 
same country ... I won't say which country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no special rule for marriage. If you acquire  
citizenship through marriage, it is the same as if you acquire 
citizenship through any other means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gyulai said country-swapping had become a worrisome trend, with  
more and more athletes deserting the countries which had fostered 
and developed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pole-vaulter Victor Chistiakov, who recently traded his Russian  
passport for an Australian one and had not represented Russia for 
the last three years, has opted to compete under Australia's colors 
at the upcoming World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson Kipketer, the 800-meter world record-holder, left Kenya  
after being recruited by a club director looking for runners for 
his Danish team. Kipketer obtained full Danish citizenship last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Moroccan Khalid Khannouchi, a two-time champion of the Chicago  
marathon, and Mebrahtom Keflezighi of Eritrea, who finished fourth 
in the 10,000-meters at the U.S. Championships in June, are both 
campaigning to compete for the United States at the Olympic Games 
in Sydney next year.

<HEADLINE> China Doesn't Rule Out Taiwan Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China hopes the current tensions with Taiwan  
will be resolved peacefully but ``we cannot rule out the force 
option,'' China's ambassador to the United States said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Zhaoxing cautioned the United States against interfering in  
what China views as an internal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent comments by members of Congress suggesting that the  
United States increase its defense ties with the island are ``very 
dangerous statements,'' Li told a news conference at the Chinese 
Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	While reiterating Beijing's hard line on Taiwan, Li was  
generally positive on U.S.-Chinese relations in advance of 
President Clinton's meeting next month with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Li suggested that negotiations over reparations for the U.S.  
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May were progressing. 
And he expressed hopes that remaining U.S. obstacles to China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization would soon be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chinese official showed little flexibility on the issue  
of Taiwan and had harsh words for Taiwanese President Lee Teng-Hui. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's comments on July 9 that Taiwan and the mainland should  
have ``state-to-state'' relations set off the current tempest. 
</P>
<P>
	China views Taiwan as a renegade province.  
</P>
<P>
	Li called the Taiwanese president a ``troublemaker'' and  
suggested Lee had made his ``state-to-state'' comments in a 
deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between China and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should stop his state-to-state (statements) otherwise he  
will go down in history as a national traitor,'' Li said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious and dangerous matter,'' Li said.  
</P>
<P>
	He would not directly answer questions on whether China was, in  
fact, planning a military show of force across the Taiwan Strait. 
But, he said without elaboration, ``The government of China knows 
very well what it should do. 
</P>
<P>
	``China does love peace. We do long for peace. However, we never  
will be cowed by military steps or blackmail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any escalation of tension between China and Taiwan could involve  
the United States, since the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits the 
United States to defend China against an attack from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot rule out the force option,'' Li said. ``We want to  
prepare ourselves to stop any Taiwan independence or foreign 
intervention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also voiced opposition to any move by the United States to  
provide Taiwan with any type of missile-defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is firmly opposed to the U.S. selling such an advanced  
weaponry system'' to Taiwan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Li also had sharp words for Japan, expressing alarm at recent  
indications that Japan was considering a missile-defense system in 
conjunction with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe all people in Asia ... would request Japan to pursue  
the policy of peace. History should be remembered,'' he said. 
``Japan should never forget the catastrophe it imposed on the 
people of Asia and the people of the world.''

<HEADLINE> New Assaults Launched in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Anti-independence fighters in East Timor  
launched new assaults on U.N. and pro-independence targets Thursday 
as others handed in weapons in advance of a referendum to determine 
the future of the troubled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. vehicle was damaged when one group threw rocks into a  
churchyard in Suai, 60 miles south of the capital Dili, where more 
than 2,300 displaced villagers were taking shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manatutu, about 40 miles east of Dili, a militia gang  
ransacked the office of the pro-independence organization and fired 
shots into the air. Police said there were no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents were the latest in a series of disturbances before  
the Aug. 30 ballot, in which East Timor's people will decide 
between full independence or staying part of Indonesia as an 
autonomous region. 
</P>
<P>
	Security has become a prime concern. Anti-independence militias  
have been blamed for a wave of violence in recent months that has 
killed dozens of civilians and displaced tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, about 600 militiamen in Dili -- many wearing  
Indonesia's red and white national colors -- surrendered an array of 
guns, explosives and dozens of homemade weapons. Pro- and 
anti-independence fighters have begun surrendering weapons in 
recent days under the eye of the U.N. Assistance Mission in East 
Timor, which is supervising the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Militia leader Eurico Gutteres said his men, accused of past  
violence, would take part in the ballot peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to the festival of democracy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia occupied East Timor in 1975 and the former Portuguese  
colony has been wracked by guerrilla warfare and human rights 
abuses since.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Undergoes Surgery for Hernia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek had  
surgery in Munich, Germany, to repair a slight hernia the team said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek will resume his offseason conditioning program within a  
week and should be ready for training camp, said Dr. Ulrike 
Muschaweck, who performed the 40-minute procedure Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was sidelined for several games during the season by a  
groin injury but returned to lead the Sabres to the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are that this procedure will help his  
lingering injury,'' Sabres general manager Darcy Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hasek announced he will retire at the end of the  
coming season and return with his family to his native Czech 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time league MVP has won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's  
best goalie five times and led the Czech Republic to Olympic gold 
in Nagano last year.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Leaf Forced From Heckler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf had to  
be forced away from a verbal confrontation with a heckling fan on 
Thursday, the latest episode in his short but troubled NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after the tense situation, Leaf said he gets the  
feeling that no one in the organization wants him around after his 
contract becomes voidable following the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's in the team's best interests to let me go, but I  
don't want that to be the case,'' said Leaf, the second pick 
overall in the 1998 draft who was benched midway through his 
disastrous rookie season. ``It doesn't seem like there's anything 
positive around here at all right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fan, 32-year-old Sean Peck, had been heckling Leaf during  
the Chargers' combined workout with the Miami Dolphins, including 
singing lyrics from the song ``Lonesome Loser'' by the Little River 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf underwent surgery on his right shoulder early in training  
camp, which could force him to miss the season, and has been 
reduced to just watching practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Several minutes after the morning practice ended, Leaf was  
walking across the practice field at UC San Diego with his arm 
around his 14-year-old brother, Brady, whom he was going to 
introduce to Dan Marino, when Peck let loose with a verbal barrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, Ryan, you're the worst draft choice in NFL history. You  
make Heath Shuler look like an All-Star. You're a loser. Go talk to 
Jimmy (Johnson) and try to get a job next year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf said Peck also ragged him about him putting his arm around  
his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf calmly walked back across the field, asking offensive  
coordinator Geep Chryst and security guards to come with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf motioned at Peck, saying, ``What's wrong, man, have I hurt  
you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck, wearing a Chargers cap and shirt, jumped up, hustled down  
the bleachers and came within a few feet of Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hurt me, you hurt all of us,'' Peck said. ``You have no  
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it had been most any other player, the incident might have  
been quickly forgotten. But Leaf made plenty of news with his 
off-field behavior last year, including a profanity-laced locker 
room tirade against a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers weren't about to let this one get out of hand.  
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who is 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds, was forced back by Chryst  
and defensive backs coach Rod Perry. Chargers spokesman Scott Yoffe 
repeatedly said, ``No, don't do it, Ryan. Don't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf walked off the field and declined comment as he got into a  
Mercedes convertible and drove away. He did speak following the 
afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought I was like going to go try to beat his (rear end)  
or something,'' Leaf said. ``I've been through that, getting that 
mad at somebody and have it be a big thing. So what I wanted to do 
was say, `Hey, look, I've grown up, I'm calm about it, I would like 
to understand why you would say that about me.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf realized he should have ignored Peck, but added:  
``Sometimes it's just too much. Your pride is just ... you're not 
playing right now and you're kind of kicked right in the heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he just wanted to have a heated conversation,'' said  
Peck, who added that he's a lifelong Chargers fan as well as a 
singer for a heavy metal band. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm `Joe fan' speaking out for the people and we feel  
betrayed,'' Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several witnesses said they heard Peck commenting about  
``wanting a lawsuit'' as Leaf approached. Peck later said he was 
joking. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf was quoted in Thursday's USA Today as saying he doesn't  
think he'll be with the Chargers after his contract becomes 
voidable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully it's wrong, but that was just my opinion,'' Leaf  
told San Diego reporters. ``I wasn't saying that I want to leave 
here. I love San Diego and everything that it's brought me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't feel like anybody wants me here, and if that's  
the case, they can get the guys they want in here. I'll work real 
hard on my shoulder and wherever I end up playing, whether it's 
here or it's somewhere else, hopefully I'll be what I was'' early 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Beathard said the Chargers want Leaf to be  
here the duration of the five-year, $31.25 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certain there's a high degree of frustration with Ryan''  
because of his shoulder injury, Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been said 100 times, everybody knows he's dug a  
pretty deep hole, but we have confidence he'll get out of it and 
play football. We want him to play football in San Diego. We don't 
want it to be someplace else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite throwing 15 interceptions and just two touchdown passes,  
Leaf met the criteria to have his contract voided after the third 
year. He was in for at least 35 percent of the offensive plays and 
the Chargers (5-11) won one more game than they did the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he won't be totally free to leave. The Chargers will  
have some options to keep him, including paying him a $4 million 
bonus to activate the fourth and fifth years.

<HEADLINE> Candidates' Answers to Drug Question </HEADLINE>

<P>
	The presidential campaigns were asked Wednesday if the  
candidates had ever used illegal drugs and whether they believed 
that the question is appropriate. Their responses:

	 *DEMOCRATS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bradley:  
</P>
<P>
	In his book, ``Time Present, Time Past'', Bradley acknowledged  
using marijuana. ``Several times in the early 1970s I had taken a

<P>
	``He has said for a long time that he thinks in general the  
media ought to focus much more on substantive issues than it does. 
Substantive issues like policy, like what a candidate stands for,'' 
said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. ``Beyond that, it is up to the 
media how they want to decides its role.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Al Gore:  
</P>
<P>
	Gore has admitted to smoking marijuana in the early '70s.  
Spokesman Roger Salazar says Gore has never used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every candidate has a responsibility to decide what questions  
are appropriate and how they are going to respond,'' Salazar said. 
``The vice president thinks that this election will be decided by 
the voters on issues that affect their everyday lives and that is 
what he is focusing on.'' 

</P>
<P>
	 *REPUBLICANS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer:  
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Jessica Morris said Bauer has not used any illegal  
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to be able to say with no hesitation that 'no, we  
have not broken the drug laws of the United States,' and 'no we 
have not used cocaine.''' -- Gary Bauer on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' 
Aug. 15. 

</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan:  
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has not used any illegal drugs, according to spokesman  
Bob Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a journalist he would not ask,'' Adams said. ``As a  
candidate, he will not ask.'' 

</P>
<P>
	George Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	Bush had refused to answer questions about whether he had used  
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, when asked by The Dallas Morning News whether,  
as president, he would insist that his appointees answer drug-use 
questions contained in the standard FBI background check, Bush 
responded: ``As I understand it, the current form asks the 
question, `Did somebody use drugs within the last seven years?' and 
I will be glad to answer that question, and the answer is `No.''' 

</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole:  
</P>
<P>
	Dole has not used any illegal drugs, spokesman Mike Paranzino  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dole has noted ``that some honorable people have been  
driven away from public life because of some of the intrusiveness 
of being in public life today, and she thinks that is 
unfortunate.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes:  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' political director Bill Dal Col said the candidate has  
not used any illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	As to whether candidates should be asked the question, Dal Col  
said, ``That's up to the media.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Orrin Hatch:  
</P>
<P>
	``I have never used illegal drugs,'' Hatch said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the question was appropriate. ``I think Governor Bush is  
making a big mistake in not settling that issue and getting it 
behind him. ... Why not just say you didn't, if you didn't. And if 
he did, say why -- and how he's overcome it.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes:  
</P>
<P>
	Keyes spokeswoman Becky Finger said the candidate has not used  
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't control what questions are asked of Governor Bush,  
but personally he does not think it is an appropriate question when 
there are so many important issues facing the nation,'' she said. 

</P>
<P>
	John McCain:  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' spokesman Howard Opinsky said when asked about past drug  
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have anything to say about what others have to say.  
And the question about what is appropriate or not is going to be 
made by the media and the voters. He realizes it is part of running 
for office,'' said Opinsky. 

</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle:  
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's spokesman Jonathan Baron said the former vice president  
has not used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other candidates will have to decide the manner in which they  
will answer these matters,'' Baron said. ``He has said in the past 
that he wished the media wouldn't ask about things wholly unrelated 
to public service.''

<HEADLINE> Ken Starr May Quit Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's imprint would be on a final  
report focusing on President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, even 
though a successor may finish the independent counsel's work, legal 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr informed a three-judge panel earlier this month that he  
plans to leave before his office's work is finished, a legal source 
said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He indicated there were allegations to be prosecuted or  
declined,'' said the source, who is familiar with a conversation 
between Starr and the presiding judge of the special court, David 
Sentelle. ``He brought up this business about retiring. Certainly 
the impression was sooner rather than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of judges could name a successor to take over Starr's  
office, even though the independent counsel law has expired, 
according to congressional staffers who worked on efforts to renew 
or replace the statute. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News first reported that Starr was considering leaving in  
the next few months, quoting sources on its Web site Tuesday as 
saying Starr had submitted the resumes of three deputies as 
possible successors. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left his McLean, Va., home Thursday morning, Starr said,  
``I have no comment at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers who worked on previous independent counsel  
investigations said that if Starr left, his successor likely would 
be a current or former deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will either be Ken Starr's report because he stays or Ken  
Starr's report with an asterisk -- 'as told to Ken Starr,''' said 
John Douglass, a law professor at the University of Richmond who 
worked on the Iran-Contra investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglass said it ``would be inconceivable to me'' that anyone  
not previously in Starr's office ``would accept the job at this 
time. Why would anybody want it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno declined Thursday to discuss who  
might take over any unfinished investigations if Starr were to 
resign. ``I'd prefer the Department of Justice to address the 
issues as they arise,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A department official, requesting anonymity, said that despite  
some ambiguity in the now-expired independent counsel law, it would 
be logical for Starr to ask the three-judge panel that selected him 
to name a successor, as those judges would have done if the law had 
not expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional staffers familiar with the law said it was meant  
to provide for a successor to be named even after the expiration. 
Language in the law says even after its expiration, the law ``shall 
continue in effect with respect to then pending matters'' if an 
independent counsel believes the work should be completed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, congressional researchers said there never has been an  
instance when a successor was named at a time the law had lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	A split on the judicial panel that would make the decision was  
revealed Wednesday when, in a routine, periodic check of the 
probe's status, the judges voted 2-1 to allow Starr's investigation 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Monica Lewinsky investigation ended with Clinton's  
impeachment and acquittal in the Senate, Starr issued a statement 
saying his probe was continuing on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a matter related to his investigation of the Clintons'  
Whitewater land dealings in Arkansas remains under appeal, and 
noted that the office also is responsible for investigating the 
firing of White House Travel Office employees and whether the White 
House misused FBI background files. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said Wednesday he was working with the Justice Department  
to determine whether some matters could be referred there. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the topics of Starr's investigations still pose the  
same conflicts for Justice investigators that they did when Reno 
referred them to Starr in the first place, so the cases could not 
come back to Justice, said a department official who would not be 
quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph diGenova, the independent counsel who investigated  
allegations that the Bush administration misused State Department 
files, said the report should remain associated with Starr, even if 
he leaves before it's finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person responsible for the majority of the investigation  
should be responsible for publication of the report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Yannett, also a former Iran-Contra prosecutor, said,  
``Whatever the office does, it will be viewed forever as the Starr 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's just one of his deputies filling out the role for  
purposes of the report, it will properly be viewed as the Starr 
report.''

<HEADLINE> Lutherans Mull Pact With Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Leaders of the nation's largest Lutheran  
denomination faced a key decision on whether to form a sweeping 
alliance with the Episcopal Church, a move that could affect 
thousands of congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was scheduled for today at the national convention of  
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in Denver. If the 
alliance is approved, Episcopalians will vote on it during their 
convention next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ``full communion'' pact, the churches would recognize  
and share each other's sacraments and clergy and cooperate in 
missionary projects, something supporters say would strengthen the 
ministry and prove helpful in urban and rural areas where church 
resources are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the churches have about 7.5 million members in 18,000  
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike similar pacts the Lutheran group has with three other  
denominations, the agreement -- already supported by the Episcopal 
Church -- requires Lutherans to follow an ordination practice known 
as the historic episcopate: Each bishop is installed by a laying on 
of hands by three predecessor bishops from a line believed to 
extend back to Christ's apostles. 
</P>
<P>
	That has raised opposition within the Lutheran ranks. While  
Catholic and Orthodox churches, as well as Episcopalians, follow 
the practice, Lutheran teachings don't require such historic 
succession. Many of the world's Lutheran bodies do not practice it. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Lutheran delegates narrowly rejected a similar  
pact with the Episcopal Church. During the same convention, the 
delegates approved pacts with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), 
Reformed Church in America and United Church of Christ -- none of 
which required changes in Lutheran tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, opponents said the Episcopal Church should be  
willing to take Lutherans as they are without requiring them to 
adopt the historic episcopate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jaynan Clark-Egland of Bonners Ferry, Idaho, said her  
opposition was ``based on scripture and the freedom of the 
Gospel.'' Bishops are no more sanctified than clergy, she said, and 
clergy no more than the laity. 
</P>
<P>
	Others considered the pact old-fashioned. The Rev. Thomas Lyberg  
of Convoy, Ohio, labeled it a ``political, ecclesiastical 
document'' that envisions ``maintenance to marginal congregations'' 
in both churches, rather than new evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James Hanson of Winters, Texas, called the proposal ``a  
move in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have so obviously not yet gained wide consensus among  
ourselves,'' declared the Rev. Stephanie Frey of Redwood Falls, 
Minn., who said Lutherans should forget the pact and tend to their 
own internal ``division and woundedness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the time had come for a change.  
</P>
<P>
	``We write the final chapter for this century in this  
assembly,'' said President Timothy Lull of Pacific Lutheran 
Theological Seminary in Berkeley, Calif. ``How does it end? With 
whimpering and squabbling that are, woefully, part of the dark side 
of Lutheranism past?''

<HEADLINE> Martin Happy To Be Back in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Mark Martin is in second place in the  
Winston Cup standings, but a whopping 300 points behind the leader. 
Little wonder that he's happy to be back at Michigan Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has won four times at Michigan. Three of those victories  
were in the August race. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett has 3,359 points to lead the NASCAR circuit with 13  
races remaining, including Sunday's running of the Pepsi 400 at the 
2-mile super speedway in Michigan's lush Irish Hills region. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's caution-free run to the finish of the Kmart 400 at  
Michigan on June 13 set a race record with an average speed of 
173.997 mph. Jarrett's speed in that race also set a record for a 
400-mile NASCAR race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could still reel him in, but it's going to take a little  
luck,'' Martin said Thursday during a rain delay in practice for 
the Busch Series NAPA 200, a support race scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Martin's luck so far this season has been bad.  
</P>
<P>
	He still has some pain from the mending fractures he picked up  
July 2 in a stock car crash in Daytona Beach, Fla. And two weeks 
ago, he came one point short of what would have been a fourth 
straight International Race of Champions title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just drive as fast as I can,'' Martin said. ``That's really  
all I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And hope for a little luck.  
</P>
<P>
	``I need to have some better luck than I've had, that's for  
sure,'' Martin said. ``But we'd need for Dale Jarrett to have some 
different luck, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a tough thing for a proud driver like Martin to swallow.  
He drives for Jack Roush, one of the most competitive owners in the 
business. Teams this strong generally make their own luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just deal with it,'' said Martin, who admits to getting  
frustrated. ``You just keep your eye on the target. I learned how 
to do that pretty early in my racing career. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to worry, you get mentally exhausted.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, that doesn't mean Martin cares any less.  
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely have a temper,'' he said. ``I just don't lose it  
as much as I used to. That's the value of the years of experience. 
I have a one-track mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and Jarrett won't be the only drivers in Sunday's race,  
of course. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, fresh off last week's road-course victory at  
Watkins Glen, N.Y., also has run well on this track. His pole speed 
of 186.945 mph for this year's June race broke his 1995 record by 
.334 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole bunch of people you'd want to keep an eye  
on,'' Martin said. ``I would also include the No. 99 car (Jeff 
Burton) and the 18 (Bobby Labonte).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is third in the Winston Cup standings with 2,997 points.  
Burton, who also drives for Roush, is fourth with 2,943 and Gordon 
-- the defending champion -- is fifth at 2,877. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won the August race at Michigan last year on the way to  
his second straight Winston Cup title and third overall.

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Stop Ventura Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- There's no law that says Jesse Ventura  
can't be both The Body and The Gov. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Kathleen Gearin refused on Thursday to stop  
the pro wrestler-turned-governor from refereeing some bouts this 
weekend when Ventura's old buddies from the World Wrestling 
Federation come to town. 
</P>
<P>
	A former write-in candidate for governor had sued, alleging the  
referee gig was a conflict of interest for Ventura. The judge gave 
the lawsuit a 10-minute read and dismissed it. 
</P>
<P>
	``An elected official does not by their election become someone  
who does not have personal, social, economic and private 
interests,'' Gearin said. If Minnesotans disapprove, they can oust 
Ventura at the polls, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he planned to give his $100,000 fee for refereeing  
to charity. He also is likely to receive at least $1 million in 
video royalties and for the use of his trademarked name. But 
Ventura, known as ``The Body'' when he wrestled, has not said what 
he will do with that money. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Davis, the former candidate who sued, said the governor's  
being paid by the WWF might influence decisions he might have to 
make about the organization or the Target Center, where Sunday's 
matches are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the governor is covered by Minnesota laws  
prohibiting civil service employees from getting special benefits 
because of their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's attorney said the Legislature never designated the  
governor a civil service employee. As for the WWF or the Target 
Center, there are no pending issues involving them and the 
governor, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The watchdog group Common Cause Minnesota also filed a complaint  
alleging conflict of interest Wednesday with the Department of 
Employee Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're hoping it will do is impress upon the governor that  
the laws apply to him,'' said Common Cause President David Schultz. 
``It's more directed towards future behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's spokesman John Wodele called the complaint  
``irritating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor obviously is not one out of the conventional  
mold,'' Wodele said. ``Common Cause, other politicians and elected 
officials obviously have some trouble with that.''

<HEADLINE> Nestle, Haagen-Dazs in Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The makers of Haagen-Dazs frozen desserts and  
Drumstick ice cream bars are combining their U.S. ice cream 
operations in a new joint venture designed to increase sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillsbury Co. and Nestle USA will retain ownership of the brands  
and production technology and license them to the joint venture, 
which has been temporarily named Ice Cream Partners USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will continue to use the popular brand names of  
Haagen-Dazs for its premium ice cream and frozen yogurt, and the 
Drumstick, Nestle Crunch and Butterfinger brands for its ice cream 
bars, said Pillsbury spokeswoman Elizabeth Hanlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the future we might see some migration but you won't see  
two logos on one product,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recipes will remain the same.  
</P>
<P>
	Nestle's Drumstick is the No. 3 brand in the novelty ice cream  
category, while Nestle Crunch vanilla ranked fifth among individual 
novelty items, said Rochelle Brown, director of corporate and brand 
affairs for Nestle USA. Nestle IceScreamers is the No. 2 brand 
among children's frozen novelties. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 50-50 joint venture, which requires government  
approval, the new company will have its own management team and a 
separate board with four directors each from Nestle USA and 
Pillsbury, but its performance will be reflected in the stocks of 
Nestle S.A., a Swiss company, and Diageo PLC, the British parent of 
Pillsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture includes only the companies' U.S. operations and  
does not include the Haagen-Dazs frozen dessert shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be located in northern California. Although  
a specific location has not been chosen, the location would take 
advantage of the Haagen-Dazs facility in Tulare and the Nestle 
plant in Bakersfield, the companies said.

<HEADLINE> Witness Says he Reimbursed Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A defense witness told jurors Thursday he  
reimbursed Miami Dolphins receiver Tony Martin out of his own funds 
for $100,000 in fees paid to a longtime friend's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Damain Toledo's testimony in the drug and money  
laundering case was met with sharp questioning from prosecutors who 
noted his statements often contradicted what he told a grand jury 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Opa-locka convenience store owner has been jailed  
since Dec. 4, charged with civil contempt after he refused to 
answer any more questions before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going through what we went through back on Dec. 4,''  
Toledo told assistant U.S. attorney Ron DeWaard at one point. ``I 
felt I was being trapped or having my words twisted. That's why I 
decided to stand on my Fifth Amendment right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is being tried alongside Rickey Brownlee, who spent seven  
years in prison for two 1980s drug convictions, in a case centering 
on Brownlee's alleged drug activities from 1994 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael K. Moore recessed proceedings for  
the week, allowing Martin to join teammates in San Diego for 
workouts and an exhibition game against the Chargers. The receiver 
made arrangements to fly out Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be nice to get away from here and get out on the  
field,'' Martin said as he left the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo's cross-examination will finish Monday, ending Brownlee's  
defense. Three members of the Dolphins, possibly including coach 
Jimmy Johnson, are expected to open Martin's defense as character 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is accused of leasing three cars in his name on  
behalf of Brownlee, who paid him back with cash. He also is accused 
of writing a $100,000 check to Brownlee's first lawyer in exchange 
for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knowingly accepted drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo, whose store was in a building owned by Brownlee, denied  
allegations that Brownlee arranged to repay Martin for the lawyer's 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Toledo testified, most of the money came from store  
profits -- in cash -- he had saved up over two years. He said he also 
sold his jewelry and borrowed about $12,000 from another Brownlee 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get every dime I could,'' Toledo testified.  
``I know I needed to use it for Mr. Brownlee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he hadn't just obtained a cashier's check himself,  
Toledo said he thought it risky. ``A young minority male walking to 
the bank with $100,000 cash and asking for a check -- that wouldn't 
go over with nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin wrote a $100,000 check to lawyer Milton Hirsch in March  
1998, then stopped payment after federal investigators subpoenaed 
his financial records. He repaid the sum to Toledo shortly 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, DeWaard pulled out a transcript of  
Toledo's brief grand jury appearance and pointed to where Toledo 
had testified the money was Martin's.

	``As far as I'm concerned, once I gave the money to Tony, it was  
Tony's,'' Toledo replied. 
</P>
<P>
	The two also clashed over whether Toledo had told the grand jury  
that there was no side agreement for anybody to reimburse Martin or 
merely that Brownlee had nothing to do with repayment. It was at 
about that point that Toledo had ended his grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to answer the questions truthfully and honestly. I  
went in to do that,'' Toledo told DeWaard. ``But the questions got 
more hostile and I felt my integrity was in question. I didn't want 
to be part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's lawyer, Howard Srebnick, later asked Moore to order a  
mistrial or separate the trials. He argued that the heated exchange 
over Toledo's testimony regarding Martin, raised as part of 
Brownlee's defense, could taint jurors' views when it came time to 
judge Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I don't even know how to go about questioning this  
witness,'' Srebnick told the judge. Moore denied the motion.

	Death Toll Keeps Rising in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- With the death toll from Tuesday's  
earthquake now beyond 4,000, and with some 10,000 people still 
missing, citizens of Turkey demanded that rescue efforts be 
increased and better organized. The 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck 
the highly populated region before dawn. So far, 3,839 people have 
died and nearly 18,500 were injured, according to a special Turkish 
crisis unit. How many people are still alive under the debris isn't 
known, but the death toll appeared destined to swell as Turkish and 
foreign rescue teams slowly picked their way through the rubble -- a 
task likely to last days.

	Feds Crack Down on Suburban Guns  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have launched what they  
called the nation's first concerted attack on suburban gun dealers 
who arm city gangs, announcing charges yesterday against 13 buyers 
and sellers. Owners and employees of five suburban gun shops and 
two of the shops themselves were accused of supplying guns to 
``straw purchasers'' with clean police records who were standing in 
for the actual buyers. Authorities say gang members with long rap 
sheets use the method to get around state laws barring convicted 
criminals from buying guns. While handgun sales are illegal within 
Chicago's city limits, officials say the gangs can get them easily 
in nearby suburbs.

	Satellites Measuring Wash. Monument  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Monument stands a bit taller  
today. A team of government scientists climbed to the top of the 
giant stone spire Wednesday and used the latest in satellite 
technology to take its measure -- 555-feet-5.9 inches. Thats 
four-tenths of an inch more than had previously been recorded. The 
monument was last measured 65 years ago by government surveyors. 
Scaffolding in place for a renovation of the spire gave researchers 
the opportunity to reach the top and take new measurements.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S. and South Korean forces continued  
a joint military exercise today in the world's largest 
computer-simulated war games, intended to train senior officers for 
battle on the Korean peninsula. The 12-day exercise went on for a 
fourth day, after reclusive, Stalinist North Korea made a 
conciliatory gesture, saying it was ready for negotiations to 
resolve international concern over its reported plan to test-launch 
a long-range ballistic missile. Late last night, North Korea said 
it was compelled to develop missiles because the United States 
plans to invade the North, but it was ready for negotiation ``if 
the hostile nations honestly ask for it out of an intention to 
alleviate our concern.''

	Bush Won't Answer Drug Questions  
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush says he hasn't used illegal  
drugs within the past seven years, while insisting that such 
personal issues have no place in the 2000 presidential race. He 
snapped at reporters asking about possible illegal drug use 
yesterday, saying he would ``refuse to play'' that game. But he 
answered a hypothetical question The Dallas Morning News put to him 
later in the day. The newspaper questioned him about the 
requirement that federal employees answer questions about drug use 
in the past seven years to get high-level security clearances. Bush 
said that he could answer that question with a ``no.''

	Employers Use Transcripts for Hires  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Youngsters seeking work at more than 10,000  
businesses, from McDonald's to IBM, are finding they cannot hide 
from a spotty academic career: Their high school records are being 
requested by companies worried that poor grades and lax attendance 
may suggest an employment risk. Prospective employers hope they're 
sending a message to high school students and recent graduates that 
school performance and their commitment to learning matter -- even 
in today's job market, where employers are crying for help. ``We 
let standards go down over the years; it's time to get them back to 
where they used to be,'' said John Wentling, the general manager of 
a McDonald's restaurant in Dover, Del.

	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A brother of Spurs forward Sean Elliott said  
yesterday he had no hesitation about donating a kidney for 
Elliott's transplant and urged others to become organ donors. Noel 
Elliott's kidney was removed in surgery Monday then immediately 
used in his brother's transplant. Sean Elliott, 31, a 10-year NBA 
veteran who helped lead San Antonio to its first NBA championship 
in June, continues to recuperate at Methodist Specialty and 
Transplant Hospital.

<HEADLINE>  Red Sox Ace Berates GM Before Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After pitching a fit in the clubhouse before  
Thursday night's game against Oakland, Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez 
insisted he has no animosity toward his manager or GM and said he 
was merely ``joking around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Martinez admitted he was upset there were television  
cameras waiting for him when he arrived the ballpark. Martinez was 
scratched from his scheduled start on Saturday after he broke a 
team rule by failing to arrive the ballpark at least two hours 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys need to let it go,'' he told reporters after  
Thursday's 6-2 loss to the Athletics. ``The clubhouse is my house. 
If you sneak into my house and I don't know who you are, I'll shoot 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who was eating at a nearby table,  
said: ``Tell Pedro I'll give him the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Martinez arrived at the ballpark late on Saturday, manager  
Jimy Williams scratched him as the starting pitcher. Martinez, who 
says he was at home getting treatment for the shoulder problem that 
caused him to go on the disabled list on July 19, came on in relief 
and earned his 17th victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez yelled at Boston general manager Dan Duquette in front  
of several reporters before Thursday's game, but was smiling and 
cracking jokes after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at 4 p.m. for the 6:05 p.m. start, Martinez found  
cameras waiting for him outside the ballpark. When Duquette walked 
into the clubhouse, Martinez yelled, ``Are you here to see if I'm 
here two hours before the game? Well I am, OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Martinez claimed ``we were just talking. I'm just a  
loud talker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez (17-4) struck out 11 in seven innings, with fans  
posting pictures of clocks on the walls where they used to hang 
``K's'' to denote his strikeouts. Martinez said he didn't see them, 
but he found it funny. 
</P>
<P>
	While yelling at Duquette before the game, Martinez demanded an  
apology from Williams. But after the game, the pitcher said he 
understood he was wrong and there was no need for an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a man about it, I made a mistake,'' Martinez said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Talked To Company Under Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The former head of the Texas Funeral  
Service Commission has asked that Gov. George W. Bush be held in 
contempt of court for denying that he had talked with the head of a 
company while it was being investigated by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledged Wednesday that he had a brief conversation  
with Robert Waltrip, chairman of Service Corp. International, a 
Houston-based funeral home company. But he said there was no 
discussion of the commission's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 20-second conversation,'' said Bush, a GOP presidential  
hopeful. ``That's hardly enough time to even say hello, much less 
sit down and have a substantive discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Bush spoke with Waltrip while his company's embalming  
practices were being investigated has become an issue because of a 
whistleblower lawsuit filed by Eliza May, the former head of the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May was fired in February, and she says she lost her job  
because of her agency's investigation of Waltrip's company, which 
has donated money to Bush. The governor is not a defendant, but she 
subpoenaed him to answer questions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush tried to have the subpoena dismissed. He filed an affidavit  
on July 20 stating: ``I have had no conversations with SCI 
officials, agents or representatives concerning the investigation 
or any dispute arising from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokeswoman, Linda Edwards, called Wednesday's contempt  
motion ``nothing more than a publicity stunt.'' Bush called the 
case frivolous and said it was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May is a former treasurer of the state Democratic Party.  
</P>
<P>
	The Funeral Commission inquiry resulted in a recommended fine of  
$445,000. SCI is fighting the fine and says the agency 
misinterpreted state embalming law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May's contempt motion accuses Bush of making ``false,  
misleading and deceptive'' statements in the affidavit. Her lawyers 
cite a Newsweek magazine article that recounted a conversation 
between Bush and Waltrip on April 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip and SCI lobbyist Johnnie Rogers had come to the  
governor's office to give Joe Allbaugh, Bush's executive assistant, 
a copy of a letter addressed to the head of the Funeral Commission. 
It complained of tactics being used in the investigation, SCI 
spokesman Bill Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Waltrip and Rogers were waiting to give a copy to  
Allbaugh when Bush walked out, on his way elsewhere. Allbaugh now 
manages Bush's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek reported that, according to Rogers, Bush said to  
Waltrip, ``Hey Bobby, are those people still messing with you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Waltrip responded yes, the magazine reported, Rogers said  
the governor turned to him and said: ``Hey, Johnnie B. Are you 
taking care of him?'' Rogers said he replied, ``I'm doing my best, 
governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers hasn't returned calls from The Associated Press. Bush  
said he doesn't remember what was said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is it lasted no time. And that hardly constitutes a  
serious discussion,'' Bush said. ``I did not have any knowledge at 
all of Waltrip's problem with this case.''

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Sign William Avery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- William Avery, the Minnesota Timberwolves'  
first-round pick, signed a three-year contract with the team 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves selected Avery, a 6-2 guard from Duke, with the 14th  
pick in the June draft. Avery is expected to provide depth to a 
team that ranked near the bottom of the NBA in three-point 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very excited to draft William and now look for him to  
be a solid contributor for us,'' said Kevin McHale, Timberwolves 
vice president of basketball operations. ``We feel William will 
help us upgrade our outside shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, who left Duke after two seasons, was an honorable mention  
to the All-America team last season, averaging 14.9 points and 5.0 
assists per game. He hit a school-record eight three-pointers Dec. 
9 vs. Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Augusta, Ga., Avery helped Duke to the NCAA  
championship game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves other first-round pick, Miami of Ohio's Wally  
Szczerbiak, signed a three-year deal worth $6.5 million earlier 
this month.

<HEADLINE> Elections Head Indicted in La. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The state's elections commissioner has  
been indicted on charges he made millions of dollars through 
kickbacks and a money laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Among that accusations against Jerry Fowler is he funneled  
$900,000 to a New Jersey investment company partly owned by him, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment came in the wake of a legislative audit that said  
Fowler paid more than twice what he should have for voting 
machines, voting machine parts and installation of the machines, 
ignoring the public bid law. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler could not be reached for comment Thursday. His lawyer  
said the allegations are untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a rather bare-bones indictment,'' Mike Small said.  
``It came as no surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury indicted Fowler on eight counts: four of  
malfeasance in office, three of conspiracy to commit money 
laundering and one of filing false public records. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Sandra Ribes said Fowler avoided the  
state's public bid law and gave contracts to two companies in 
return for kickbacks and personal profits worth millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, a New Jersey investment firm in which Fowler  
had a financial interest, Independent Voting Machine Service Co., 
was sent $900,000 by Election Services Inc. of Alabama, one of the 
firms awarded a contract by Fowler, Ribes said. 
</P>
<P>
	A legislative audit issued earlier this month found that  
Independent Voting Machine Service Co. and Election Services Inc., 
got a total of $15.4 million from the elections department from 
1991 through 1998 for equipment and services that could have been 
made for less than half the price paid. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the companies also made cash payments of $20,000 a month  
to Fowler, said Ribes, who did not identify the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury in Baton Rouge earlier indicted 11 people who  
worked for or had done business with the agency in the hauling of 
voting machines. Ten pleaded innocent. One pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit said Fowler bought 3,200 reconditioned mechanical  
machines without seeking competitive bids required by law.

<HEADLINE> Eastwind Airlines Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Troubled low-fare Eastwind Airlines has  
lost $29 million in four years, and owners UM Holdings Inc. now say 
they are willing to sell the company for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind boss Chris Dimitriyadi said months of complaints  
prompted the decision, announced Thursday, to sell or seek a 
merger. Dimitriyadi took the leadership reins of the company 
temporarily after President Terry Hallcom, three vice presidents 
and 10 other executives were fired in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has spent months talking to potential buyers,  
Dimitriyadi said. Four companies are interested, including two 
international carriers who want to add Eastwind's routes to their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greensboro-based company has been the subject of scores of  
written complaints to regulators in recent months. Customers have 
been angry over delayed or canceled flights and incorrect billings. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Attorney General's Office looked into the problems and  
had told Eastwind to shape up its operations. The company cut back 
its flights last month in an attempt to regroup and improve 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimitriyadi said that Eastwind will not change its daily  
schedules until a buyer is found and the sale is final. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind flies out of Piedmont Triad International Airport and  
airports in Philadelphia, Orlando, Fla. and Trenton, N.J. The 
airline employs 145 workers and has two leased Boeing 737-700 
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Rejects German Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Track and field's world governing body on  
Thursday rejected a German proposal to scrap some existing world 
records and start a new list in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no changes,'' said Primo Nebiolo, president of  
the International Amateur Athletic Federation. ``The idea was 
seriously discussed and seemed interesting, but we are not 
following this idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal to throw out records and start afresh in 2000 was  
rejected by ``an overwhelming majority'' of delegates at the IAAF 
Congress, the IAAF said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The German Athletics Federation had launched the proposal in an  
effort to dispel concerns that existing records were tainted by 
drug use. But most IAAF officials felt such a move would only cast 
suspicion on all records, throwing in doubt their own credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most believed that such a sweeping change would send out the  
message that the IAAF felt that all its records were doubtful, 
which was unjust to innocent athletes,'' the IAAF said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans suggested throwing out records only in certain  
events such as shot-put, discus, javelin and women's sprints, and 
creating a new list starting in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Some records date back to the 1980s when organized doping  
programs were rampant in East Germany and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	With court cases in Germany continually exposing evidence of  
systematic doping, pressure is growing for the world of sport to 
restore justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the national Olympic committees of the United States  
and Britain filed petitions asking the IOC to award gold medals to 
their swimmers who finished second behind East Germans. The IOC 
rejected the petitions.

<HEADLINE> Yankees and City Agree on Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Disabled sports fans will have an easier time  
securing good seats at reasonable prices after the federal 
government struck an interim deal with the New York Yankees and the 
city of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday requires the Yankees to  
substantially change ticketing and pricing policies for the rest of 
the season, according to U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had joined a private lawsuit that alleged the  
Yankees and the city had discriminated against the disabled by 
failing to make the ballpark accessible to those who need special 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the club had offered six price levels for the general  
public, including $8 seats, it had required those who needed 
wheelchair seats to pay $26 or $50. The $50 seats were the only 
ones with unobstructed views. 
</P>
<P>
	With the changes, the unobstructed view seats will cost $29 and  
the rest of the wheelchair and companion seating will be sold for 
either $8 or $14, depending on their location. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, those buying wheelchair seats will be able to purchase  
tickets over the Internet, through Ticketmaster or at stadium 
ticket windows. Previously, those needing the seats were required 
to call the Yankees' main office to order tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This interim agreement addresses some of the New York Yankees'  
ticketing and pricing policies for fans who use wheelchairs for the 
remainder of the 1999 season, while preserving the government's 
right to seek more comprehensive relief,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left with a Yankees spokeswoman was not  
immediately returned. A trial has been set for Dec. 6.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAPER, Utah (AP) -- The numbers alone stun those in Catholic  
education: The school complex opening this fall is a 57-acre campus 
with 75 classrooms, three gymnasiums, a 1,350-seat auditorium, two 
libraries, five baseball fields, football and soccer stadiums, a 
television studio, a 1.5-mile cross-country trail and 14 miles of 
fiber optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever heard of anything of that size  
before,'' said Brother Ed Brink of the Center for Catholic 
Education at the University of Dayton. ``It would be a lot of 
educators' dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Skaggs Catholic Center -- named for converts Aline and  
Leonard Samuel Skaggs Jr., who are donating about $42 million for 
the project -- will offer cradle-to-college services in the Guardian 
Angel Day Care, St. John the Baptist Elementary and Juan Diego High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we go to meetings of the Catholic educators association  
and talk about this, they just shake their heads. It may very well 
be the largest gift ever to Catholic primary and secondary 
schools,'' Utah Bishop George Niederauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	As surprising as its size is the center's location, just 20  
miles south of the Mormon church headquarters in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miraculous,'' Galey Colosimo calls it. He has been director of  
the project for the Utah diocese for nearly four years and will be 
principal of Juan Diego High. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholicism is Utah's second largest religion, but it is a  
distant second to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
which settled the state 152 years ago. Utah's 100,000 Catholics 
comprise 5 percent of the population, while Mormons make up about 
70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the modest numbers, Catholic schools were bursting in  
the southern Salt Lake Valley, due to a combination of growth and a 
vogue in parochial schooling. Elementary schools and Judge 
Memorial, one of three Catholic high schools in Utah, all have had 
waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
	When Niederauer became Utah's bishop in early 1995, he bid on a  
former high school in Sandy to help ease the space problem. Though 
the diocese lost the bid, it gained a benefactor, the Skaggs Family 
Foundation for Roman Catholic and Community Charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The immensely wealthy Skaggs, who had not yet converted to  
Catholicism, read in the newspaper of the diocese's need and called 
to offer help. Skaggs had retired that summer as chairman of 
American Stores Co., a national drug and grocery chain built by his 
father and his Baptist minister grandfather. He declined to be 
interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
	His generosity was ``heaven sent,'' says Monsignor J. Terrence  
Fitzgerald, vicar general of the diocese. ``We would never be able 
to raise that kind of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Skaggs' backing, Fitzgerald and Colosimo spent a year  
traveling to 100 public, private and Catholic schools, learning the 
best and worst of modern school construction. And they grounded 
themselves in Catholic school tradition dating to the medieval 
monasteries of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	From that, they drew up a position paper for a school modeled on  
the monastic cloister tradition, with a center courtyard containing 
a 99-foot cross tower, grotto and reflecting pool. Radiating from 
that outdoor oasis are the libraries of the two schools, the chapel 
and the great hall of the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, Colosimo said, was to have a building that proclaims  
the main functions of the school: faith development, commitment to 
the liberal arts and learning, and a sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic schools usually are built in bits and pieces over  
decades as money is raised. Not this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only will there be the latest computer technology and a  
25,000-volume high school library, the schools will have 
commissioned art, including stained glass in the chapel honoring 
the high school namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Diego was an Aztec Indian credited with persuading a bishop  
to build a temple after an apparition of the Virgin Mary appeared 
to him in 1531. Eight million Aztecs were soon converted to 
Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the schools, bronze sculptures will remind students  
of role-model saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the religious demographics of Utah, the bishop, Colosimo  
and elementary principal Sister Karla McKinnie figured they'd be 
lucky to enroll 700 students from preschool through the eighth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
	They were astounded to receive 1,500 applications by the January  
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Skaggs Catholic Center will open with 920 pupils in the  
elementary and middle school and 300 students in freshman and 
sophomore classes at Juan Diego. Junior and senior classes are to 
be added within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 80 percent to 85 percent of the enrollees are Catholic, and  
most are new to Catholic schools. Among the remainder, some are 
Mormons, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuition is $2,650 per year for St. John the Baptist and $5,700  
per year for Juan Diego High, although children from active 
Catholic families get discounts and low-income families pay even 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, parishioners of St. John the Baptist Church will  
raise the money to build a church on the campus. In the meantime, 
they'll meet at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Niederauer envisions the Skaggs Catholic Center as the host for  
large diocese meetings and social events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us the largest facility we've ever had for large  
indoor and outdoor Catholic gatherings,'' the bishop said. ``It 
gives us a resource we haven't had.''

<HEADLINE> Pig Study Eases Transplant Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest study yet on the safety of  
transplanting body parts from pigs into humans proved reassuring: 
None of the 160 patients studied caught a worrisome pig virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Friday's edition of the journal Science could spur  
more experiments using animals as potential organ donors. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists stressed this highly experimental field called  
``xenotransplantation'' -- transplanting organs or cells from one 
species to another -- still requires caution because the new study 
doesn't prove it's safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors hope xenotransplantation will one day save thousands of  
lives by easing a worldwide shortage of donated organs. But some 
scientists fear it also could cause new epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern was heightened when researchers recently discovered the  
genes of all pigs -- the species most likely used in attempted 
xenotransplants -- harbor a previously unknown virus that test-tube 
experiments showed could infect human cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus didn't harm the pigs, but nobody knew if it would hurt  
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	So scientists at the British biotechnology company Imutran Ltd.  
tracked down 160 patients from eight countries who were 
experimentally treated with living pig tissue, such as pancreatic 
cell transplants for diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the most rigorous viral testing available -- and backed  
with confirmatory testing by the U.S. government -- Imutran 
scientists found no evidence these patients were infected by the 
pig virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, scientists stress all xenotransplantation experiments --  
like those currently implanting pig cells into Parkinson's disease 
patients' brains -- must be closely monitored.

<HEADLINE> LeClair To Return to Philadelphia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Flyers forward John LeClair is close to  
returning to Philadelphia and should not miss any regular season 
games because of his ailing back, his agent said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	LeClair, being treated by a back specialist in Los Angeles,  
probably will return to Philadelphia on Friday night or Saturday, 
agent Lewis Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor gave him a good report,'' Gross said. ``He's doing  
some physical therapy. He hurt it back in March and never really 
did the exercises to get it strong again. When it started bothering 
him a little bit, we thought it was best to go see somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeClair, who described it as a ``minor injury,'' was examined by  
Dr. Robert G. Watkins, the same specialist who treated NBA star 
Scottie Pippen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a reoccurrence of what happened last spring and I  
didn't want it to be a problem for the upcoming season,'' LeClair 
said. ``I felt it was best to have it looked at now. I'm feeling 
much better. I don't anticipate this being a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would be ready to participate in the team's upcoming  
training camp, LeClair said, ``I'm assuming that and I'm planning 
on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers announced Wednesday that LeClair suffered nerve  
damage doing ``off-ice exercises,'' but did not give specifics. 
Gross said he believes the back pain is not a new injury, but is 
related to back spasms that forced LeClair to miss several games 
late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could have re-aggravated it,'' Gross said. ``But with the  
back, it could be anything. Based on what Dr. Watkins said, he 
should be fine for the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers doctors have not examined LeClair since late last season,  
Gross said. He was limited to 76 games last year, scoring 43 goals, 
after playing all 82 games in three straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development Thursday, the agent for first-round draft  
pick Simon Gagne said he was close to agreeing to a three-year 
contract. The deal is expected to be worth $975,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still talking, and we're getting closer and closer,''  
agent Bob Sauve said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year contract signed Wednesday by defenseman Karl  
Dykhuis is worth $3 million. He will make $800,000 this season, $1 
million in 2000-2001 and $1.2 million in 2001-2002.

<HEADLINE> Drug Statistics From Annual Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Findings from the 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse:  
</P>
<P>
	--Teens: The portion of teens, ages 12 to 17, saying they ever  
had used drugs fell from 18.8 percent in 1997 to 16.4 percent last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Marijuana: Usage has fluctuated over the past few years. Last  
year it fell to 8.3 percent among teens, back to its 1995 level but 
significantly higher than the 3.4 percent recorded in 1992. The 
number of new teen-age users dropped in 1997, the latest statistics 
available for new users. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall use of marijuana was steady in 1998, with about 11  
million Americans smoking it in the month preceding the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heroin: A total of 130,000 people currently were using heroin,  
double the number in 1993. The age of users was dropping. In 1997, 
the typical heroin user was 17.6 years old the first time they 
tried it, down from 18.3 years old in 1996, though not 
significantly different statistically. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cocaine: The number of users was stable in 1998, with about  
1.75 million, though there were increases among teens and young 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cigarettes: Some 60 million Americans age 12 and older said  
they were current smokers, down from 29.6 percent in 1997. Among 
young adults, the percentage has steadily increased from 34.6 
percent in 1994 to 41.6 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cigars: Use increased to 6.9 percent last year, compared with  
5.9 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Alcohol: About half of Americans age 12 and older were  
drinkers. Nearly 30 percent of them were binge drinkers, meaning 
they had five or more drinks on the same occasion at least once. 
These statistics have remained steady since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tobacco: The rate of young adult smoking increased from 34.6  
percent in 1994 to 40.6 percent in 1997 and 41.6 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Teen-age smoking: Teens who smoked were 11.4 times more likely  
to use illegal drugs and 16 times more likely to be heavy drinkers 
than their non-smoking peers. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual survey is conducted through in-person interviews.  
Interviews are conducted in private, away from other family 
members. People responding to the questions mark their answers on a 
sheet that they seal when the interview is over. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey includes only people who live in households, meaning  
it does not reach the homeless or people living in prisons or 
college dormitories.

<HEADLINE> Army To Skip Final Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is preparing to move to the next  
phase of development of its experimental anti-missile missile, even 
though the weapon has succeeded in only two of eight flight tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Thursday that it has dropped its  
self-imposed requirement that the Theater High Altitude Area 
Defense, or THAAD, system score three successful intercepts in 
flight. Instead of conducting another test of the prototype missile 
later this year, the Army's contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp., will 
begin engineering a more advanced version to be fielded by the Army 
in 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last year, when the THAAD program was reeling from six  
straight test failures, the Pentagon said it would not give the 
go-ahead for Lockheed to move into the next phase of development 
until the prototype scored three successful intercepts of mock 
warheads. It recorded its first success in June, followed by 
another Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD is the centerpiece of the Defense Department's effort to  
provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied troops and 
their staging areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, the Army called off a flight test of  
its Patriot 3 missile interceptor after the missile that was 
supposed to launch as the Patriot's target over White Sands Missile 
Range, N.M., shut itself down just 30 seconds before launch. The 
Army said it didn't know what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriot 3 is a new version of the missile interceptor used  
in the 1991 Persian Gulf War; it is intended as a complement to the 
THAAD missile defense system but does not have as great range as 
THAAD. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Maj. Gen. Peter Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic  
Missile Defense Organization, said the main reason for moving ahead 
with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force 
Lockheed to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be 
fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the two successful tests this summer have ``proven''  
that the missile works. Critics, however, said after the second 
successful test in August that the THAAD system should be tested 
against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in 
testing at White Sands Missile Range. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than spending months and millions of dollars on another  
THAAD prototype launch only to prove a point, we have decided to 
get on with the business of engineering development of the real 
thing,'' Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's top acquisition official, 
wrote in a letter Wednesday to Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., the 
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a supporter of 
THAAD. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin said a final decision will be made next year on  
beginning the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin 
will translate the design work done thus far into a missile that 
will enter initial low-rate production. The Pentagon is scheduled 
to begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007; Franklin would not say 
whether skipping the final flight test will enable it to be fielded 
earlier than that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has spent about $4 billion on THAAD so far.

<HEADLINE> Duke &AMP; Co. Chairman Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The former chairman of Duke &AMP; Co., a now-defunct  
securities firm, pulled off his blue prison shirt as soon as he 
emerged from a courtroom after admitting he cheated investors out 
of tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor M. Wang, 34, of Sarasota Fla., was freed on bail Thursday  
after entering pleas in state Supreme Court in Manhattan and U.S. 
District Court in Brooklyn. The firm had operated out of Manhattan 
and Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	In state court, he calmly answered a prosecutor's questions  
about how his company colluded with sales people at other firms to 
raise and keep artificially high the initial public offering prices 
of certain stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted that he falsely represented and deliberately omitted  
information given to investors to encourage them to buy securities 
at the inflated prices. Wang pleaded guilty to charges of 
enterprise corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the afternoon, he pleaded guilty in Brooklyn to  
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit 
money laundering, charges which could bring up to 25 years in 
prison and millions in fines and restitution. Sentencing was set 
for Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang was released on $500,000 bond secured by a Long Island  
home. He also must submit to electronic monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging that Duke was ``a  
criminal enterprise'' that ran a scheme to manipulate the stock 
prices of six companies from January 1995 through March 1998, when 
the company went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	The six companies whose IPOs were used to defraud investors were  
Renaissance Entertainment Corp., Sel-Leb Marketing Inc., Paravant 
Computer Systems, Bristol Technologies, IFS International, and 
Aviation Group Inc.

from amid the ruins. 
</P>

<P>
	But the militants, many of them taking periodic shelter in  
caves, have put up fierce resistance in Tando and other nearby 
villages. The Russian forces suffered their worst single-day losses 
with 18 soldiers killed and at least 20 wounded on Wednesday, the 
Defense Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the rebels still control at least five villages, including  
Tando, the ministry told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have lost 40 troops and 160 have been wounded in  
the 13-day conflict, Deputy Interior Minister Lt. Gen. Igor Zubov 
said today. He claimed that up to 500 rebels had been killed, 
though the rebels say the figure is hugely exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russian casualties on Wednesday were paratroopers who were  
hit as they landed in a failed attempt to storm Tando, the 
Kommersant newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	After an overnight lull, government forces resumed bombing raids  
and artillery strikes on Tando early today. The assault was 
witnessed by an Associated Press reporter from the nearby town of 
Botlikh. 
</P>
<P>
	Tando's strategic importance is based on its mountaintop  
location just a few miles from the border with Chechnya, the 
breakaway territory from which the rebels emerged on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya is also the source of reinforcements and supplies for  
the rebels, who are fighting for an independent Islamic state in 
southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians want to sever the supply line, but most of their  
forces have been restricted to a valley down the mountain from 
Tando, making it difficult to get close to the village, let alone 
storm it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians believed their daily airstrikes had sufficiently  
weakened the rebels to permit a ground assault, but the militants 
emerged from basements and caves to beat back the government 
troops, Kommersant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have repeatedly promised the rebels' imminent  
defeat, but militants still control at least four villages near the 
border with Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been pouring troops and weaponry into the region, and  
is believed to now have several thousand troops in Dagestan, an 
impoverished republic along the west coast of the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel forces are estimated at around 1,200, and include  
fighters from Chechnya and Dagestan as well as Muslims from 
elsewhere in southern Russian. 
</P>
<P>
	The ground fighting around Tando suggests Russia is stepping up  
its campaign against the rebels. Reluctant to take heavy losses, 
Moscow had relied previously on its dominant air power. 
</P>
<P>
	Zubov, the Interior Ministry official, said the sustained  
Russian attacks had forced the rebels to divide up into small 
groups and they were no longer massing in a single location. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been scattered into smaller groups and are fighting  
federal troops with the use of guerrilla tactics,'' Zubov said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not explain why the Russian forces had been unable to  
capture Tando or other villages if so few rebels were left to 
defend them. He also claimed that more than 90 percent of the 
population in Dagestan were opposed to the militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces pulled out of neighboring Chechnya in 1996 after  
a two-year war in which they suffered repeated humiliations at the 
hands of the Chechens. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has had de facto independence since then, but many of  
the former rebels now belong to armed gangs that have made the 
territory ungovernable. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal groups from Chechnya often cross into neighboring  
regions on kidnapping missions, and the rebel incursion on Aug. 7 
sparked Russia's most serious internal conflict since the end of 
the Chechen war.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOTLIKH, Russia (AP) -- Russian war planes and artillery today  
pounded a mountain village that's already been reduced to rubble, 
but determined Islamic militants refused to yield, fighting back 
from amid the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caucasus Mountains battle between the Russians and the

<HEADLINE> Seagram Posts Fourth-Quarter Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seagram Co. posted a smaller quarterly loss than  
expected, as solid results from music, theme parks and alcoholic 
beverages offset a loss in filmed enterainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time factors, Seagram lost $129 million, or 32  
cents per share, during the Montreal-based company's fourth quarter 
ended June 30. That compared with an operating loss of $12 million, 
or 3 cents per share, in the same three-month period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figures do not reflect a one-time gain from certain  
transactions with USA Networks that cut Seagram's net loss for the 
fourth quarter to $53 million, or 13 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the year-ago results don't include a gain from the  
sale of Time Warner shares and the Tropicana beverage operations 
that left Seagram with a net profit of $324 million, or 93 cents a 
share, for that quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenues rose to $3.52 billion from the year-ago  
total of $2.10 billion, with most of that gain coming from the 
acquisition of Polygram. The revenue gain actually amounts to just 
9 percent since last year's fourth-quarter revenues would have 
totaled $3.24 billion if Polygram had already been acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts had expected Seagram to post a  
fourth-quarter operating loss of 42 cents per share, according to a 
survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's report, Seagram's U.S. shares jumped 7 percent  
on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $3.50 to close at $53.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation  
and amortization -- a popular financial measure also known as 
``EBITDA'' -- rose to $259 million in the fourth-quarter. That's an 
increase of 17 percent from what Seagram and Polygram would have 
reported as one company in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the just-ended fiscal year, Seagram earned $686 million, or  
$1.81 per share, including the one-time gains from the Tropicana 
and USA deals and one-time expenses of $405 million related to 
integration of the acquired Universal and PolyGram operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the prior fiscal year, Seagram earned $946 million, or $2.68  
a share, including one-time gains of $926 million from the sale of 
Time Warner shares and $66 million from discontinued operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-year revenues totaled $12.31 billion, up 30 percent from  
$9.47 billion during the previous 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Skeptical About Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Several of the world's top athletes on  
Thursday said they don't trust the drug-testing methods which have 
led to a series of recent high-profile positive cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past couple of weeks when we've heard so many sudden  
cases of this ... I don't think I'm 100 percent sure that it's the 
correct testing procedure,'' American sprint star Marion Jones 
said. ``To say `yes,' I'd be lying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest shock came Wednesday when 39-year-old Jamaican  
sprinter Merlene Ottey withdrew from the World Championships after 
testing positive for the steroid Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford  
Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers 
tarnished by positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion on the whole matter is that over the last couple of  
weeks our beautiful and lovely sport has been marred by all of 
this,'' said Jones, who will be chasing an unprecedented four gold 
medals in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, the defending world 1,500-meter  
champion and mile world record-holder, is hoping the tests were 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand that in a few days four of the biggest  
stars in athletics were tested positive,'' he said. ``I'm surprised 
and I hope there's something wrong with the analysis or something 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many are surprised at the sudden rash of positive tests for  
Nandrolone, a common steroid which has been detectable for years. 
Among those testing positive for the drug were Ottey, Christie and 
British 200-meter runner Doug Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	American sprinter Maurice Greene, the world record-holder in the  
100 meters, called for blood testing at next year's 2000 Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the best thing to do is ... to take blood,''  
Greene said. ``That's going to be the best thing to do. I can't 
wait until that time comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, who has set 15 world records in  
long-distance events, also supported blood testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see this, all the young kids will think the stars are  
on drugs,'' he said. ``That is very bad because the young always 
follow the old. They should do more blood testing. It's a very bad 
situation at a very bad time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World 200-meter record-holder Michael Johnson was also highly  
skeptical when asked whether he had confidence in the testing 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in God and my parents,'' Johnson said.  
``That's about the extent of what I have confidence in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile athletes Thursday offered their own doubts.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a scary thing,'' said American 400-meter runner Jerome  
Young. ``They need to do more research. I think there was something 
wrong with the machine. There are too many athletes going down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deon Hemmings, one of the favorites in the 400 hurdles, declined  
to talk about fellow Jamaican Ottey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to comment at all,'' she said. ``I have very  
mixed feelings about it and I don t want to say anything. I haven't 
spoken to her (Ottey) for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Smith, the high-profile coach of Greene, Ato Boldon and  
other star sprinters, said the sport needs to accentuate the 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to carry on because our sport is down right now,'' he  
said. ``We have to work ... to get from here to the next step -- 
that is to bring light and positiveness to the sport.''

	Today is Friday, Aug. 20, the 232nd day of 1999. There are 133  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 20, 1968, the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations  
began invading Czechoslovakia to crush the ``Prague Spring'' 
liberalization drive of Alexander Dubcek's regime. 
</P>
<P>

to the Royal Air Force, saying, ``Never in the field of human 
conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, the Soviet Union publicly acknowledged it had tested a  
hydrogen bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, hundreds of people were killed in anti-French rioting  
in Morocco and Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, President Johnson signed a nearly $1 billion  
anti-poverty measure. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, the United States launched Voyager 2, an unmanned  
spacecraft carrying a 12-inch copper phonograph recording of 
greetings in dozens of languages, samples of music and sounds of 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Diana Nyad succeeded in her third attempt to swim from  
the Bahamas to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Video executive Jose Menendez and his wife,  
Kitty, were shot to death in their Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion 
by their sons, Lyle and Erik. British conservationist George 
Adamson, 83, was shot and killed by bandits in Kenya. Fifty-one 
people died when a pleasure boat sank in the Thames River in 
London.

<HEADLINE> Furrow Indicted on Federal Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Buford O. Furrow Jr. was indicted today by a  
federal grand jury on charges of murdering a postal worker, and 
prosecutors said that case will go forward before state charges 
involving last week's Jewish center shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old white supremacist was charged by the grand jury  
with murder of an employee of the United States, a charge that 
carries a potential death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Letter carrier Joseph Ileto was gunned down Aug. 10 shortly  
after five people were wounded at the nearby North Valley Jewish 
Community Center. Authorities have said the Filipino-American man 
was targeted because he was a non-white federal worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-count indictment also accuses Furrow of using a  
firearm during a fatal crime, a potential death penalty offense. 
The third charge was being a felon in possession of a firearm, 
which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas and Los Angeles County District  
Attorney Gil Garcetti announced the indictment in a joint statement 
that said they will continue their ``collaborative partnership'' 
but that the federal charges will be prosecuted first. 
</P>
<P>
	They said an experienced prosecutor from the district attorney's  
office will be designated as a special assistant U.S. attorney to 
participate in the federal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, five state counts of attempted murder and carjacking  
filed by the district attorney will be held in abeyance. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, who has ties to hate groups as well as a history of  
mental illness, surrendered in Las Vegas the day after the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Police Chief Bernard Parks released 911 tapes that  
recorded the terror of the attack on the community center and 
strengthened his call for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we want to see another incident or do we want to bite the  
bullet and get these guns off the street,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief wants a ban on assault weapons, on ``Saturday Night  
Special'' handguns and all unsafe handguns. He also has called for 
a ban on gun shows and strict regulation of gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes revealed fear and panic as well as fast action by  
employees of the Jewish center, where three boys, a teen-age 
counselor and a receptionist were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The callers, one a woman hiding under a desk, provided police  
and fire dispatchers vital information about the location and what 
was happening. There was also confusion, especially misinformation 
about the gunman's description. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please hurry. He's got a huge machine gun,'' cried the first  
woman to call 911. ``I don't know how many people are dead, but 
there's hundreds of children. There's a summer camp here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She stammered out the location of the center.  
</P>
<P>
	As a dispatcher sought information about the shooter, the woman  
said she had seen a white, heavyset man wearing black. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was shooting like crazy,'' she said and told of seeing the  
gunman run out across the parking lot. Other callers described the 
shooter as Asian or Hispanic or even as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived within four minutes of the first call.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association's lobbying arm has stated that  
Furrow was in violation of gun control laws already in place in 
California and has questioned whether new gun control proposals 
would have prevented the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks told reporters that he believes the public is ready for a  
wide-ranging ban on guns, but lawmakers and the NRA have deterred 
such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA President Charlton Heston said that he believes Parks ``is  
clearly one of the finest police chiefs in L.A. history'' but that 
Parks' ``comments about the NRA were inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's surely entitled to his opinions on assault weapons and  
handguns, though he is inadequately informed on their place in the 
Bill of Rights,'' Heston said.

<HEADLINE>  U.S., South Korea Stage War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- With hundreds of civilians watching  
from sidewalks and buildings, South Korean troops fired blanks and 
threw fake hand grenades today in a military exercise intended to 
train soldiers for war on the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea condemned the fourth day of joint exercises by U.S.  
and South Korean troops as a provocative act. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Pyongyang government said Wednesday it was ready  
for talks to resolve international concern over its reported plan 
to test-launch a long-range ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea said it was compelled to develop missiles because  
the United States plans to invade the North, but it was ready for 
negotiations ``if the hostile nations honestly ask for it out of an 
intention to alleviate our concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's simulated gunfight involved 1,200 soldiers and police in  
an eight-lane boulevard in northern Seoul. A group of soldiers 
played the role of North Korean infiltrators who tried to occupy a 
main government building. 
</P>
<P>
	It was part of a 12-day military exercise that largely involves  
computer-simulated games and is held every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior officers trained in a packed room at the U.S. Eighth Army  
base in central Seoul. Dozens of U.S. and South Korean military 
officials sat typing at computers while others filled in documents 
and placed stickers on maps. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the exercise is to improve the joint staff  
coordination ... to enhance deterrence against an enemy attack,'' 
said Col. Mark W. Graper, a spokesman for the U.S. Command in South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea denounced the exercises.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the U.S. imperialists continue to pursue confrontation and  
war, lending a deaf ear to our repeated warnings, they will be 
wholly responsible for all the ensuing consequences,'' said Rodong 
Shinmun, a ruling party newspaper. The report was carried by the 
North's official Korean Central News Agency.

<HEADLINE>  U.S., South Korea Stage War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- With hundreds of civilians watching  
from sidewalks and buildings, South Korean troops fired blanks and 
threw fake hand grenades today in a military exercise intended to 
train soldiers for war on the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea condemned the fourth day of joint exercises by U.S.  
and South Korean troops as a provocative act. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Pyongyang government said Wednesday it was ready  
for talks to resolve international concern over its reported plan 
to test-launch a long-range ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea said it was compelled to develop missiles because  
the United States plans to invade the North, but it was ready for 
negotiations ``if the hostile nations honestly ask for it out of an 
intention to alleviate our concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's simulated gunfight involved 1,200 soldiers and police in  
an eight-lane boulevard in northern Seoul. A group of soldiers 
played the role of North Korean infiltrators who tried to occupy a 
main government building. 
</P>
<P>
	It was part of a 12-day military exercise that largely involves  
computer-simulated games and is held every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior officers trained in a packed room at the U.S. Eighth Army  
base in central Seoul. Dozens of U.S. and South Korean military 
officials sat typing at computers while others filled in documents 
and placed stickers on maps. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the exercise is to improve the joint staff  
coordination ... to enhance deterrence against an enemy attack,'' 
said Col. Mark W. Graper, a spokesman for the U.S. Command in South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea denounced the exercises.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the U.S. imperialists continue to pursue confrontation and  
war, lending a deaf ear to our repeated warnings, they will be 
wholly responsible for all the ensuing consequences,'' said Rodong 
Shinmun, a ruling party newspaper. The report was carried by the 
North's official Korean Central News Agency.

<HEADLINE> Bush Gets More Specific on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush said today that he could have  
passed a seven-year background check for illegal drug use when his 
father was president, from 1989-1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In his most specific comments to date about an issue he insists  
he doesn't want to discuss, Bush told reporters today, ``Yes, I 
could have passed the standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner was peppered with  
questions for the second straight day about whether he ever used 
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over 20 years ago, I did some things ... I made some mistakes  
and I learned from those,'' he said. ``That's all I intend to talk 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush testily refused to answer questions Wednesday about whether  
he had ever used illegal drugs, insisting that such personal issues 
have no place in the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	But later in the day, The Dallas Morning News asked him about  
the requirement that federal employees answer questions about drug 
use to get high-level security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I understand it, the current form asks the question, 'Did  
somebody use drugs within the last seven years?' and I will be glad 
to answer that question, and the answer is 'No,''' he told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said today that he answered the question because it was  
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters asked him to delve deeper into his past. Could he have  
passed the standard while his father was in the White House? He 
answered yes. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug questions came as the Texas governor visited the West  
End Center for Youth, where he read to inner city children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be governor too, but you've got to make the right  
choices,'' he told one child. ``When someone says drugs are cool, 
you've got to say drugs are not cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Bush toured the city market area downtown. A man,  
carrying a big green sign with the word ``snort,'' yelled, ``Just 
answer the question. Did you do it? Don't feed the frenzy, just 
answer the question. Al Gore answered the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference Wednesday, Bush said rumors about his  
personal life were ``ridiculous and absurd,'' possibly planted by 
political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what happens? Somebody floats a rumor and that causes  
you to ask a question,'' Bush told reporters. ``And that's the game 
in American politics, and I refuse to play it. ... That is a game. 
And you just fell for the trap. And I refuse to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his first campaign for Texas governor in 1994, Bush has  
declined to answer some questions about his past. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was young and irresponsible, I behaved young and  
irresponsibly,'' is his oft-repeated answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug question continued to dog him as he campaigned later  
Wednesday in Baton Rouge, La. ``I made some mistakes years ago,'' 
he said. ``But I learned from my mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he quit drinking alcohol 13 years ago, when he  
turned 40. And in the wake of the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, Bush said he's been faithful to his wife of more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But since launching his presidential bid, Bush has steered clear  
of the drug question, saying he believes voters are weary of what 
he called ``the politics of personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's campaign says Bush believes there is a line to be  
drawn between legitimate questions about his record and other 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Important facts that people deserve to know about are how he's  
fulfilled his duties as governor, father, husband and employer. 
Those are relevant questions,'' said Bush spokesman Scott 
McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to take this on and say, `Enough is enough.' If  
that leads to mistaken assumptions about his past, that's fine with 
him. He's not going to itemize for the children of America and his 
daughters, who are watching, everything he did or did not do in the 
past,'' McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedians have capitalized on Bush's refusal to answer the drug  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	An Aug. 11 monologue by Jay Leno on ``The Tonight Show'': ``Bush  
has come under fire lately for not answering questions about 
possible cocaine use. Well, today, he came out for mandatory drug 
testing. He says he is for it. In fact, he said, 'Look, whatever 
drugs you've got, bring them by. I will test them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's exchange, Bush did not identify anyone he  
thought was planting rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think they're being planted? I know they're being  
planted. And they're ridiculous and they're absurd and the people 
of America are sick and tired of this kind of politics. And I'm not 
participating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, while seeking the White House in 1992, also faced  
questions about drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in England I experimented with marijuana a time or  
two and didn't like it,'' Clinton said. ``I didn't inhale and I 
didn't try it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An opinion poll taken earlier this year indicated Americans are  
about evenly divided on the question of whether the public needs to 
know about a candidate's past drug use. Just over half said ``yes'' 
in the February CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	An AP survey of 11 presidential hopefuls on Wednesday found that  
both the Democrats -- Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley -- have acknowledged trying marijuana. Eight Republicans 
said they hadn't used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaigns offered differing opinions on whether the question  
should be asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said the question is appropriate. ``I  
think Governor Bush is making a big mistake in not settling that 
issue and getting it behind him. ... Why not just say you didn't, 
if you didn't? And if he did, say why -- and how he's overcome it,'' 
Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every candidate has a responsibility to decide what questions  
are appropriate and how they are going to respond,'' said Gore 
spokesman Roger Salazar. ``The vice president thinks that this 
election will be decided by the voters on issues that affect their 
everyday lives and that is what he is focusing on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, former Gov. Ann Richards, whom Bush ousted in 1994,  
faced drug use questions from a Democratic primary election rival 
when she first sought the party's nomination in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A recovering alcoholic, Richards openly discussed her drinking  
and her recovery, but she refused to answer the drug question. She 
won the primary, and GOP candidate Clayton Williams didn't raise 
the drug issue. Neither did Bush four years later.

<HEADLINE> Bush Gets More Specific About Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush abandoned his strategy to  
ignore have-you-ever questions about past drug usage, prompting 
Republicans and Democrats alike to predict that he has opened the 
door to persistent, embarrassing queries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should have stuck with, 'I'm not talking about it,''' said  
Democratic consultant Dave Brown of Washington. ``The sharks won't 
ever stop circling now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under increasing pressure, Bush told reporters Thursday that he  
has not used illegal drugs in the past 25 years, declaring that if 
voters object to his refusal to reveal more ``they can go find 
somebody else to vote for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could have met the anti-drug standards of his  
father's White House, which inquired about an applicant's drug 
usage 15 years prior to background checks. President Bush served 
from 1989-93. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Bush told The Dallas Morning News that he had not  
used drugs in the past seven years -- the time frame used in normal 
FBI background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments were a dramatic departure from Bush's long-stated  
objection to questions about his personal history. He is asked 
almost daily about illegal drug use, though there is no evidence or 
credible allegation that he has ever violated drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours before speaking to the Dallas newspaper, he tried to  
dismiss questions about whether he ever used illegal drugs as 
``ridiculous and absurd rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of America are sick and tired of this kind of  
politics. And I'm not participating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Bush advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
he decided to respond to the background check question after having 
aides clarify the precedent in the Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor felt it was relevant to ask whether he could  
abide by the standards required of White House employees, aides 
said, and he hoped that staking out a 25-year time frame would 
settle any anxiety among voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Political consultants expected the questions to persist, but  
predicted little harm would come to Bush's campaign in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's proven his early statement -- that once you engage, it  
doesn't stop the questions -- was right. His initial instincts on 
this were right,'' said GOP political consultant Ed Gillespie, who 
doesn't work for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the amount of fire, this will soon smolder,'' said  
Democratic consultant James Carville. ``But as long as you have 
something smoldering, you can add fuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Carville, who has worked for President Clinton, said people  
care little about such personal issues -- especially after the 
Monica Lewinsky affair 
</P>
<P>
	``If all that didn't matter, I can't imagine what Bush might  
have stuck up his nose 20 years ago will move people one way or 
another,'' Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some rank-and-file Republicans are displaying signs of anxiety  
about Bush's background. Mike Francis, chairman of the Louisiana 
GOP, said party members eventually may seek more answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's right as a leader of the state party to  
demand this or that (of candidates), but I do think it's a very 
interesting question that Louisiana Republican voters will very 
soon force a 'yes' or 'no' on,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to keep GOP followers from getting jittery, the Bush  
campaign shipped ``speaking points'' to the offices of several 
lawmakers and governors. ``What you are talking about is ALL rumor, 
gossip and worse,'' the memo read. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, confronting the first contretemps of his front-running  
campaign, may have inadvertently exposed himself to questions about 
drug use into his teens by saying he could ``pass the background 
check and the standards'' applied at the White House today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration requires the FBI to ask White House  
applicants about drug usage since their 18th birthdays. Bush 
refused to answer that question Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to tell people I made mistakes and that I have  
learned from my mistakes. And if they like it, I hope they give me 
a chance. And if they don't like it, they can go find somebody else 
to vote for,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of things to come, he was asked at his next campaign  
stop about possible drug usage during his stint in the Texas Air 
National Guard from 1968-73. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never would have done anything to endanger myself,'' he  
replied.

<HEADLINE> Trane Recalls Nearly 10,000 Heaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost 10,000 electric heaters were recalled  
Wednesday because of faulty wiring that may cause fires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said some supplemental  
heaters that provide additional warmth for larger home electric 
systems may have defective wiring that doesn't properly control the 
motor. The accessory heaters -- made by the Trane Co. of Tyler, 
Texas, a division of American Standard -- cycle on and off, 
regardless of where the heater has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	That creates a potential fire hazard, said commission spokesman  
Ken Giles. However, no injuries or fires have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Trane and American Standard dealers sold the accessory heaters  
from October 1997 until May for $250 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should call 888-556-0125 or their local dealer to  
determine if their heater is part of the recall. The company will 
provide free inspection and repair.

                           *Johnny Byrne    	
</P>
<P>
	LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- Johnny Byrne, a guitarist who played  
with Ringo Starr in the pre-Beatles band Rory Storm and the 
Hurricanes, died Wednesday after collapsing at home. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Rory Storm and the Hurricanes was one of Liverpool's most  
popular bands in the years before Beatlemania, but unlike a host of 
other Merseyside bands, it never had a record on the British hit 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne and Alan Caldwell, who took the stage name of Rory Storm,  
started playing together in 1957 in a skiffle band called The 
Raving Texans, which combined elements of jazz, blues, country and 
folk. The group became the Hurricanes in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	With Starr on drums, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes played at the  
Kaiserkeller in Hamburg, Germany, in late 1960, getting star 
billing over The Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr joined The Beatles in 1962.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes continued performing until 1967. Caldwell died in  
1972, and Byrne went to work as an ambulance driver the same year.

<P>
	REDLANDS, Calif. (AP) -- Dee Fondy, who played for the Chicago  
Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds and was the last 
player to bat in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, died Thursday of 
pancreatic cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy grounded out for the last out at Ebbets Field in  
Pittsburgh's 2-0 loss to the Dodgers on Sept. 24, 1957. The Dodgers 
moved to Los Angeles the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .286 with 1,000 hits in eight seasons in the majors.  
Following his playing career, Fondy worked as a scout and front 
office official for the New York Mets and Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy, a native of Slaton, Texas, served in the Army during  
World War II and was part of the forces that landed on Utah Beach 
in Normandy in 1944, three months after D-Day. He received the 
Purple Heart.

<P>
	HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Former New Jersey Rep. Charles Samuel  
Joelson, who helped President Lyndon Johnson enact his Great 
Society social-welfare reforms, died Tuesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, the Paterson Democrat successfully pushed a  
congressional spending amendment that provided funding to school 
libraries nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Joelson, elected in 1960, served five terms and became known as  
a civil-rights advocate. He stepped down to become a state Superior 
Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his election, the Cornell University-trained attorney  
practiced law in Paterson, served as deputy state attorney general 
and a Passaic County prosecutor.

</P>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Galen Lemke, a former weapons plant worker  
who became a leading advocate for victims of beryllium disease, 
died Wednesday after a long battle with the illness. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	The often fatal disease, which can be treated but has no cure,  
results from exposure to dust from the metal beryllium. The metal 
is a hard, yet lightweight substance used to make nuclear weapons, 
electronics, auto parts and golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,200 workers have contracted the disease since the  
1940s, including 53 current and former Brush Wellman Inc. workers 
at the company's Elmore plant just outside Toledo, where Lemke 
worked. It is the nation's largest beryllium plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke's struggle to raise awareness about the disease led to an  
investigation by The Blade, which in March published a series of 
stories that said government and industry officials knew for years 
about the dangers of beryllium but allowed workers to be exposed to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the federal government for the first time acknowledged  
that workers were made sick from beryllium while making nuclear 
weapons and announced a plan to compensate many of them for medical 
care and lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke is survived by his wife, Betty; a daughter and a son.

                            *Kim Perrot    	
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Kim Perrot, the popular point guard who helped  
the Houston Comets win two WNBA championships, died Thursday of 
lung cancer, six months after she was diagnosed. She was 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot died with friends and family by her side at the  
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her 5-foot-5 frame, Perrot quickly became a starter and  
crowd favorite noted for ferocious play that helped the Comets win 
consecutive championships in 1997 and 1998, the league's inaugural 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Perrot averaged 8.5 points and 4.7 assists with 84  
steals in 30 regular-season games and was second in voting for WNBA 
defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's game, as her condition worsened, each player wore  
white stickers bearing Perrot's No. 10. Fans wore white ribbons in 
her honor. The game ended with chants of ``Kim, we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Lafayette, La., Perrot played four seasons at  
Southwestern Louisiana. She scored 58 points against Southeastern 
Louisiana in 1990, the second-highest total in NCAA history.

	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Howard Scammon, a former College of  
William and Mary professor whose theater instruction helped launch 
the careers of Glenn Close and others, died Wednesday after a long 
illness. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of William and Mary, Scammon joined the college's  
theater and speech department in 1948 and retired as its chairman 
in 1976. He continued to teach there part time for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other students of his who went on to success include Linda Lavin  
and Goldie Hawn. 
</P>
<P>
	When she returned to campus 10 years ago to give the  
commencement speech, Ms. Close credited Scammon with giving her the 
advice that she passed on to the graduates: ``Just go out there and 
do it.''

</P>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Eva Shain, who helped break the gender  
barrier for boxing judges and went on to score 5,000 fights, died 
of breast cancer Thursday. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Shain, of Fort Lee, N.J., earned a reputation as a competent  
boxing judge who blazed a trail for women. But she didn't consider 
herself a pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the idea of being a trailblazer. I was thinking  
about me, what I wanted to do,'' Shain said in a 1996 interview 
with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Jersey City, Shain worked as an interior decorator  
before getting her start in boxing by attending Golden Gloves 
matches with her husband, longtime ring announcer Frank Shain. She 
would score fights privately and then compare the judges scores 
with her own, to see if she was close. She usually was. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets closed higher Thursday on  
positive local news, but the big Tokyo exchange fell slightly amid 
worries that Japanese companies would lose overseas earnings from a 
stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 12.52  
points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 17,879.74. On Wednesday, the 
average rose 0.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about overseas earnings of companies kept investors from  
buying heavily into the Tokyo blue chips, said Robert Sasaki of 
Jardine Fleming in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were spooked as they saw the yen rise to seven-month  
highs, a trend that could hurt Japan's exporters by making their 
products less competitive in overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 111.63 yen in afternoon trading, down  
1.45 yen from its level late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late 
level of 112.03 yen overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares surged 3.2 percent as overseas fund  
managers scooped up selected blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 410.49 points to 13,403.59.  
On Wednesday, the Hang Seng had risen 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were flush with cash as foreign buyers overlooked  
interest rate concerns and relaxed their worries about tensions 
between China and Taiwan, said Louis Shum of Emperor Securities 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tension between China and Taiwan doesn't seem to be  
worsening,'' said Shum. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong investors have discounted interest rate worries amid  
indications that any rise in U.S. interest rates likely would be 
modest. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rose 2 percent as investors scooped up banking  
and finance shares. The SET index rose 8.24 points to 418.00. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares rallied 3.6 percent as domestic investors bought  
stocks on the stronger rupiah. The JSX Composite Index ended up 
20.381 points at 581.746. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose despite investors cashing in on recent  
gains. The Composite Index rose 2.36 points, or 0.30 percent, to 
758.44. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares rallied on foreign buying of selected shares. The  
PSE Index rose 54.11 points, or 2.6 percent, at 2,159.20.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Suspends Drilling in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- U.S. oil giant Exxon has suspended drilling off  
the Russian island of Sakhalin because of an environmental dispute 
with the Russian government. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon, one of the few major Western oil companies actively  
exploring in Russia, abandoned preparations for drilling at the 
Sakhalin-I oil fields Aug. 6 after the State Ecological Committee 
refused to endorse plans for an oil well, Tom Cirigliano, spokesman 
for Exxon in Irving, Texas, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute concerns how Exxon would discharge mud and other  
byproducts brought up during drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas-based company will press the government for permission  
to drill next summer in the $15 billion Sakhalin project, which is 
just north of Japan and much closer to Alaska than to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of ice and extreme weather conditions, drilling can be  
conducted only in the summer months. The suspension will set the 
drilling back at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cirigliano said the cancellation would cost the consortium  
developing the Sakhalin I field $9 million in lost preparation 
costs and result in hundreds of lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon said their problems highlight the difficult climate  
foreign companies face in trying to develop Russia's energy 
resources since the 1991 Soviet collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision makes it apparent that much more remains to be  
done before we can proceed with the significant investments,'' 
Exxon said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia is also facing immense environmental problems  
following decades of unbridled pollution by the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, an independent group of experts at the State  
Ecological Committee gave a negative assessment of Exxon's plans to 
discharge drilling byproducts into surrounding waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace Russia has repeatedly objected to the Sakhalin oil  
projects, arguing that they endanger marine life in the Okhotsk Sea 
near Japan. But Exxon contends that what it calls ``low-toxicity'' 
discharge is allowed by Russian law and has been approved in other 
offshore projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Russian experts' assessment, however, Russia's  
prime minister intervened and issued a decree endorsing Exxon's 
drilling plan. But the committee declined Exxon's recent request to 
reverse the negative appraisal in the wake of the prime minister's 
decree. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal status of the project remains murky. Exxon says its  
interpretation of Russian law is that it can't go forward without 
the experts' endorsement, which it is now seeking to be able to 
drill next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon holds a 30 percent stake in the Sakhalin I development and  
is the operator. The consortium also includes two Russian companies 
and a Japanese concern.

<HEADLINE> PBS Studies Spanish-American War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``It was all about that battleship of  
Maine,'' trumpeted the old song, paying homage to the fabled cause 
of the United States' first 20th century conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crucible of Empire: The Spanish-American War'' opens with the  
jingoistic tune about the doomed ship and then proceeds to vividly 
unravel the true complexity of America's venture into war and 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour documentary, narrated by Edward James Olmos and  
featuring the voices of actors and politicians as prominent 
figures, airs on PBS stations 9 p.m. Monday, Aug. 23 (check local 
listings). 
</P>
<P>
	It's a history lesson with spark and drama. And it has  
contemporary resonance, says Daniel B. Polin, who with Daniel A. 
Miller wrote and produced the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really the first war in which many of the elements which  
play such a key role in 20th century interventions appear,'' says 
Polin, citing the role of the media in fanning public support for 
war as one example. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as though we were rehearsing interventions that were  
going to happen. We get to see how these forces intersect and what 
it takes to actually get the United States to intervene,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Larger-than-life characters, including publisher William  
Randolph Hearst, Cuba's freedom fighter Gen. Maximo Gomez and 
Filipino revolutionary Emilio Aguinaldo, help bring to life the 
multifaceted story of ``Crucible of Empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So do the historians who have not reached unanimity on the  
conflict and its roots. Even the question of whether Spain would 
have lost Cuba eventually, U.S. forces aside, remains open for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion (accidental or not) of the USS Maine in Havana's  
harbor in 1898 ignited the Spanish-American War, but many other 
factors -- economic depression, national security, racism, a belief 
in America's role as international savior and, conversely, its 
potential as a colonial power -- combined to fuel it, according to 
diverse historical viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
	So, certainly, did the demands of a generation that felt  
deprived of the Civil War experience and thirsted for glory. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore Roosevelt, the future hero, expressed this sentiment:  
``I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film begins in 1893 with an America that veers abruptly from  
high expectations for the coming century into the nation's worst 
economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the frontier gone, there was something akin to a panic  
among people: 'If American institutions can't expand, they're gonna 
shrink,''' historian Stephen Ambrose tells us. ``... So there was 
an intellectual justification -- rationalization would be a better 
way to put it -- for 'Let's get our power overseas.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Other nations already were engaged in what historian Walter  
Lafeber calls an ``imperial race'': Great Britain, France, Russia, 
Germany and an emerging Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spain was a dwindling power, with its holdings reduced to  
rebellious Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and a handful of 
other islands. 
</P>
<P>
	American sympathies were roused in 1895 by newspaper accounts of  
a particularly vicious suppression effort in which Cubans were 
rounded up into what were essentially concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	But agreement on a response was not immediate. The ambitious,  
clever Hearst saw support of the Cuban independence movement as a 
``jingoistic way'' to bring the nation together and to boost his 
own prominence, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	To U.S. businessmen, however, war was a threat to their Cuban  
investments and to economic recovery at home. Republican 
president-elect McKinley shared their concerns, declaring in his 
1897 inaugural address: ``We must avoid the temptation of 
territorial aggression. War should never be entered upon until 
every agency of peace has failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But war was to be. And, when it was declared, Americans embraced  
it wholeheartedly: A call for 200,000 volunteers brought out 1 
million. If the cause seemed just -- to avenge the Maine and rescue 
enslaved islanders -- the result was less so. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States found it easy to relieve Spain of its holdings  
but difficult to fulfill its promises of freedom to the Cubans and 
Filipinos who had initially welcomed America's aid, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a blood bath in the Philippines as rebellion  
continued, now against the new U.S. occupying force. The death of 
one American soldier, according to the film, was followed by a 
general's order to kill all members of a village capable of force -- 
anyone over age 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Polin, who based ``Crucible of Empire'' on a project  
proposed by former CBS News documentary chief Perry Wolff and his 
brother, Leon, says he likes to think such long-ago tragedies are 
not empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we learn from the mistake of the Spanish-American War,  
and from Vietnam, that when we go into these things we ought not to 
try to acquire (territory) or impose our will.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux, Penguins Closer to a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux moved a step closer to owning  
the Pittsburgh Penguins when a county commissioner said Thursday he 
was satisfied with a financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bob Cranmer had complained that a deal between  
Allegheny County and Lemieux's group to pay off debts associated 
with improvements at the Civic Arena had been negotiated by staff 
without the approval of elected leaders or the county budget 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Cranmer said he was satisfied with a revised plan  
that shifts a portion of the debt from the county's general fund -- 
which is paid for by local property taxes -- to the county's 
Regional Asset District fund. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the district board voted to spend part of a special  
1-cent sales tax on repaying bonds sold to pay for arena 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' Hall of Famer is expected to finalize his deal to  
buy the team in the near future, perhaps as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This in our minds was certainly the final, final step that had  
to be completed. At least it appears that way now,'' said John 
Brabender, a spokesman for Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranmer's satisfaction with the revised deal ensures two votes  
on the three-member board of commissioners to approve the 
financing. Pittsburgh's City Council also is expected to endorse 
the new formula. 
</P>
<P>
	Both governments should vote on the revised plan in the next two  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But what troubled Cranmer was the question of who should repay  
more than $12 million borrowed for improvements that include luxury 
seating, a fancy scoreboard and lounges at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins also want to replace the 38-year-old Civic Arena,  
the oldest in use by the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	But the revised deal explicitly does not commit local  
governments to pay for a new arena by 2002, a revision Cranmer 
insisted on, saying language in the previous deal was ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial details of the new deal include the Regional Asset  
District agreeing to relieve the county and city of $10.7 million 
in debt payments, starting in 2007 and continuing through 2018. 
</P>
<P>
	The city and county still will pay an extra $6 million in the  
next 10 years to help bail out the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will pay $200,000 in cash toward the debt by December  
2000 and an additional $800,000 if the Penguins make at least $1 
million in profit in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG, which leases the Civic Arena and subleases it to the  
Penguins, agreed to pay $175,000 a year for the next five years to 
help retire the debt.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names White House Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer whose nomination for a top Justice  
Department job is on hold in the Senate will instead become 
President Clinton's new lead lawyer, the White House said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Nolan will succeed Charles F.C. Ruff as White House counsel  
next month, the White House said. The appointment marks the first 
time a woman has held the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The position is also a return to the White House for Ms. Nolan.  
She was an ethics adviser in the White House counsel's office 
during Clinton's first term. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a distinguished record of public service both in the  
White House and at the Department of Justice,'' a statement from 
Clinton said. ``While Chuck Ruff is a tough act to follow, I know 
of no one better than Beth to succeed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nolan, 47, is a senior Justice Department lawyer. Her boss,  
Attorney General Janet Reno, called her ``perfectly suited'' for 
the new job. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Clinton nominated Ms. Nolan to run the Justice  
Department Office of Legal Counsel, where she now works as a deputy 
assistant attorney general. The Senate has not acted on her 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough time for her because she's been on hold, so  
to speak,'' said Theodore Olson, a Washington lawyer who was Ms. 
Nolan's boss at the Justice Department during her first stint there 
from 1981-1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good for her that this has had a happy  
conclusion,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nolan also taught constitutional law, legal ethics and other  
subjects at George Washington University's law school between 
stints of government service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, who led Clinton's defense during impeachment proceedings  
in Congress, has already left his post. Clinton's first choice to 
succeed Ruff, acting counsel Cheryl Mills, declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills would have been both the first woman and first black to  
serve as the president's chief lawyer. She has worked for Clinton 
since the start of his presidency, and became a central player on 
the legal team that defended him and Hillary Rodham Clinton during 
the many investigations of the last few years -- from Whitewater and 
fund raising to the Monica Lewinsky affair.

<HEADLINE> Key German Business Index Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A closely watched index of German  
business confidence rose in July, a new portent of recovery for 
western European economies and the 11-nation euro currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the Ifo economic institute's monthly survey  
released Thursday indicated that Germany, Europe's biggest economy, 
would soon show an upswing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a much-noted rise in the Ifo index helped bolster  
the euro's rebound from its fall almost to parity with the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Munich-based Ifo tracks sentiment and prospects in western  
German manufacturing, wholesale and construction sectors. The 11 
western German states account for 90 percent of the country's 
economic output. 
</P>
<P>
	German output figures may not reflect the improvement  
immediately, but analysts said September industrial production data 
will provide proof of a solid recovery.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Suspend Krupp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings have suspended defenseman  
Uwe Krupp until he provides the team with medical records regarding 
a back injury that sidelined him for most of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp signed a guaranteed four-year, $16.4-million contract last  
summer. NHL rules prevent a suspended player from being paid, 
although the collective bargaining agreement between the league and 
the NHL Players Association says a team must honor a player's 
contract in the event of a hockey-related injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp has 90 days from the date of the suspension to respond  
through the players' association. Players are paid only during the 
season, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp has complied with the Red Wings' wishes to see doctors and  
specialists about the herniated disc in his back, an injury that 
allowed him to play in only 22 regular-season games in 1998-99, his 
agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're baffled,'' Roland Thompson told The Detroit News. ``It  
doesn't make any sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson told the Detroit Free Press that Krupp signed a release  
form allowing the Red Wings to obtain his medical records around 
Aug. 1 -- roughly the same time the club informed him that his 
contract would not be honored. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson told the News that he and Krupp rejected the same  
request in July because the club's demand ``didn't have any 
relevance to this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ken Holland and the team's attorney, Robert  
Carr, both said they had not received the release form. The 
suspension was the result of Krupp's refusal to furnish the medical 
records, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp was with the Colorado Avalanche when he missed the 1997  
Stanley Cup playoffs because of a herniated disc. He played 78 
regular-season games and seven playoff games with the Avalanche the 
following season, then signed with Detroit as a free agent.

<HEADLINE> Teammates Remember Pee Wee Reese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- When Jackie Robinson's widow remembers  
Pee Wee Reese, she thinks of the spot at the Dodgertown training 
facility in Vero Beach, Fla., where Pee Wee Reese Street meets 
Jackie Robinson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	To Mrs. Rachel Robinson, the crossing perfectly symbolizes the  
fortuitous intersection of Reese and Robinson's baseball careers in 
1947, the year Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and broke major 
league baseball's color barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of them grew from that experience,'' Mrs. Robinson said  
Wednesday at the funeral for Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop and 
captain of the Dodgers' ``Boys of Summer'' teams of the 1940s and 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese died Saturday in Louisville at 81 after a two-year fight  
with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, though a native of Jim Crow-era Kentucky, Reese refused  
to sign a petition that threatened a boycott if Robinson joined the 
team. Then, as Robinson was being heckled by fans in Cincinnati 
during the Dodgers' first road trip, Reese went over to talk to the 
second baseman, putting his arm around Robinson's shoulder in a 
gesture of inclusion and support. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Robinson, who was home in New York, recalled hearing what  
Reese had done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a very supportive gesture, and very  
instinctive on Pee Wee's part,'' she said. ``You shouldn't forget 
that Pee Wee was the captain, and he led the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Carl Erskine will never forget Reese's bravery.  
</P>
<P>
	``Think of the guts that took,'' he said. ``Pee Wee had to go  
home (to segregated Louisville) and answer to his friends. ... I 
told Jackie later that (Reese's gesture) helped my race more than 
his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 people attended the service at Southeast Christian  
Church for Reese, including nearly all the surviving Boys of 
Summer: Erskine; Duke Snider; Don Zimmer (who took a temporary 
leave from his post as bench coach of the New York Yankees); Joe 
Black; Don Newcombe; Ralph Branca; Clyde King -- even the deeply 
private Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a teammate for four years, a friend for 40,'' Koufax  
said. ``What is there to say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southeast minister Bob Russell eulogized Reese, an eight-time  
All-Star who played on seven pennant winners and one World Series 
winner, and who followed his playing career with one in 
broadcasting. The 45-minute service included video clips and a 
rendition of ``Amazing Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a lot of great baseball players, a lot of  
well-known announcers,'' Russell said. ``Pee Wee Reese is more 
remembered for being a good man, a gentleman, a leader, a 
competitor, a courageous person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell noted that ``Teammates,'' a book about Reese and  
Robinson and the friendship that grew between them, is now used to 
teach racial tolerance in some elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, whose father Walter moved  
the team from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, was impressed as a teen-ager 
by the esteem in which Reese's Boys of Summer teammates held their 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pee Wee had something, today you'd call it people skills,''  
O'Malley said. ``He knew how to communicate. I think he would have 
been an extraordinary manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung, a fellow  
Louisvillian, remembered playing golf with Reese and traveling with 
him to sign autographs at sports shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really something special when we went to New York,'' he  
said. ``His lines were as long as Joe DiMaggio's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the tradition, he was the greatest Dodger of them  
all,'' Snider said, remembering a trip to Hawaii with Reese and 
Zimmer to attend the baseball winter meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a big chair there that was called the `Kahuna  
chair,''' Snider said. ``Zimmer said to him, `Captain, that's your 
chair.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not all that analytical to be able to put into words what  
it was,'' Snider added. ``Whenever anyone needed any help, you went 
to Pee Wee, or he went to them. He was very concerned about each 
individual on the ball club and their happiness. Whenever anyone 
was having family problems, or in a slump, he'd help them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the way he handled himself.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Radioactive Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A former lab technician accused of  
seeking revenge on a coworker by smearing her chair with 
radioactive material has been arrested on a charge of assault with 
a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Blakis, 32, told police he thought the researcher who  
shared his work station had tried to poison him first, authorities 
said. His lips had begun to tingle and tests found a release of P32 
isotope, a colorless radioactive chemical used in DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a revenge kind of thing, but no evidence exists that  
she tried to harm him,'' said a prosecutors' spokeswoman, Tori 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
	In retaliation, Blakis smeared the compound on the chair of  
postdoctoral researcher Jingtong Zuo, Ms. Richards said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuo sat on the chair for about six hours before she discovered  
the contamination during a routine Geiger counter sweep, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators estimate Zuo was exposed to an average yearlong  
dose of radiation. Although she is not experiencing any symptoms of 
radiation poisoning, the long-term effects are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 1 incident took place at the University of California,  
Irvine. Blakis resigned his job.

<HEADLINE> Gay Lawmaker Discusses Bush's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas' only openly gay state legislator  
lawmaker said Thursday that Gov. George W. Bush told him in April 
he shouldn't take personally Bush's public remarks about gay 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Bush, now the leading GOP presidential  
candidate, denied that the governor made the comment. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Glen Maxey, an Austin Democrat, said Bush -- on an  
April 14 visit to the Texas House chamber -- congratulated the 
Democratic lawmaker on winning a bigger expansion of a children's 
health insurance program than the governor wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Maxey said, ``He put his hands on my shoulders and he  
pulled me in close. We were nose to nose. ... He says to me 'Glen, 
I value you as a person. I value you as a human being. And I want 
you to know that what I say publicly about gay people does not 
pertain to you personally.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``And of course, my rejoinder to that was when you say a gay  
person is not fit to be a parent, you're talking about me,'' Maxey 
said. He said Bush then moved on to greet a nearby lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he opposes allowing gay couples to adopt, saying,  
``I believe children ought to be adopted in families with a woman 
and a man who are married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan denied the governor made  
the comments as recounted by Maxey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor simply congratulated him on the Children's Health  
Insurance Program. That was the extent of the conversation,'' 
McClellan said. ``It's baffling if he (Maxey) was offended by 
something that supposedly happened four months ago that he's just 
now bringing it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxey said he cited the encounter after being asked on Wednesday  
by a reporter for the Houston Chronicle about the governor's stand 
on gay issues. The Chronicle reported the story Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Dawnna Dukes, D-Austin, said Maxey had recounted the  
conversation to her immediately after he and Bush had spoken. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dukes said of the governor's remarks, ``I think in this  
particular case, when he saw Glen Maxey, he felt bad about his 
public statements. I think in a way this was his apology. It just 
kind of got messed up.''

<HEADLINE> Sticky Coating Developed for Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's one of baseball's most embarrassing  
moments: You had a great swing -- but the bat flew out of your 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Many baseball players coat their bat handles with sticky pine  
tar to prevent that from happening. Of course, you then drop the 
bat in the dust and it gets pretty cruddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some French scientists have a better idea: They're developing a  
coating that's sticky when you touch it, but let go and it quickly 
hardens into a Teflon-like coating that repels dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a ``switchable adhesive,'' inventor Guillaume de  
Crevoisier of the French chemical company Elf Atochem writes in 
Friday's edition of the journal Science. For chemists, the term is 
temperature-sensitive ``fluorinated polymer coating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's still experimental. But University of Massachusetts  
engineer Thomas Russell, who reviewed the French work, said the 
polymer is unique because it switches between sticky and slick 
merely when subjected to body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of reasons why something of this nature could  
actually be used,'' Russell said, suggesting the baseball bats. 
``Or think of a Band-Aid. You want it to be sticky when it's on 
you,'' but not to stick to the trash can when you throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
	Adhesives -- and the hunt for more flexible ones -- are big  
business, Russell notes, pointing to sales of Post-It notes. 
</P>
<P>
	De Crevoisier combined a Teflon-like material with a stickier  
chemical. At room temperature, this crystalline polymer is solid, 
slick even. 
</P>
<P>
	But grab it, allowing the polymer to rise to body temperature,  
and the chemicals essentially melt a little, becoming sticky. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no reason the polymer couldn't be fine-tuned to adjust  
at other temperatures, de Crevoisier concludes in Science, 
suggesting everything from golf club coatings to industrial 
applications.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Bank Said in Laundering Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As much as $10 billion may have been laundered  
through one of the nation's largest banks in what investigators say 
is an operation run by Russian organized crime, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $4.2 billion alone passed through a single account at the  
Bank of New York in more than 10,000 transactions between October 
and March, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank has suspended two senior officers in its Eastern  
European division -- Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky of New York and 
Lucy Edwards of London -- pending the outcome of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kagalovsky declined comment, while an aide to Ms. Edwards  
said she was traveling. The newspaper said both women are married 
to Russian businessmen; one of them, Peter Berlin, the husband of 
Ms. Edwards, is believed to have controlled one of the bank 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators here and abroad have long examined whether front  
companies are raising money in North America for organized crime 
activities in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts under scrutiny at the Bank of New York have been  
linked to Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich, who is believed to be a major 
figure in Russian organized crime, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering refers to the practice of moving criminal  
profits through various bank accounts to make it appear as if the 
funds are legitimate. The Times said investigators believe some of 
the money in this case went to contract killers and drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York, with assets of $67 billion, is the  
nation's 17th largest. In a statement, the bank said it was 
cooperating with investigators and said no customer or bank funds 
had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no allegations of wrongdoing by the bank,'' the  
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Weather Pushes Grains, Soybeans Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures rocketed higher Thursday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after overnight rains missed bone-dry Midwest 
growing regions. Wheat also gained, while corn retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans led the gains after rainfall of up to an inch fell  
in Minnesota, Iowa and parts of Illinois, but missed fields that have 
languished for weeks under hot, dry conditions. Forecasters says those 
same fields likely will remain dry over the next week, which will increase 
the potential for lower yields. 
</P>
<P>
        Farm tours are finding that average yields for corn and soybeans  
are slipping as the dry weather prevents maturing crops from filling 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures also were supported by strong weekly export sales.  
The U.S. Agriculture Department reported that net export sales totaled 
566,800 metric tons, which was slightly higher than market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.89 1/2 a  
bushel; December corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.26 1/4 a bushel; December 
oats fell 1/2 cent to $1.14 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1/4 cents 
to $4.77 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle fell .15 cent to 65.65 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle rose .20 cent to 78.17 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose .80 cent to 43.20 cents a pound; February pork bellies fell 1. 
92 cents to 54.15 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Todd Stottlemyre Set To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Three months ago, Todd Stottlemyre tore his right  
rotator cuff, an injury that almost always means surgery, a year or 
more of rehabilitation and maybe the end of a pitcher's career. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Friday night, Stottlemyre will be on the mound as Arizona's  
starter in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuff is still torn. The right-hander refused surgery and  
opted for an intense strengthening program instead. Team doctor 
David Zeman calls the quick comeback a miracle. Stottlemyre calls 
it a gift. But both of them know that his next pitch could be his 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell him he may pitch one pitch and that will be it, or he  
may pitch the next five years,'' Zeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the back of his mind, between innings, between starts,  
Stottlemyre admits he wonders when or if the injury will reoccur. 
But he expects to block all that out when he's on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like I'm taking the mound with any diabilities or  
that I'm somehow not able to pitch,'' he said. ``I have no fear of 
letting go with that first pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre said he'll just cherish every trip to the mound from  
now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every start is a new gift,'' he said, ``to be able to put on a  
major league uniform and go out and compete at this level. That's 
all I want to do, to compete and be able to pitch the way I did 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 12 seasons, Stottlemyre has been one of baseball's most  
competitive players. So when he felt the pain in his arm while 
pitching in San Francisco on May 17, and exams showed that the main 
muscle in his rotator cuff was 70 percent torn, he weighed the 
options and surgery did not seem like a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 34 years old. He had just signed a four-year, $32 million  
contract with the Diamondbacks and the team was hoping to make a 
run at the NL West title. The same injury had ended the standout 
career of his father, Mel. He watched his brother, Mel Jr., undergo 
five surgeries on his shoulder and knee and never be able to 
compete again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played with Andy Benes' brother, Alan, in St. Louis. He had  
surgery in 1997 and he hasn't pitched yet,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I 
just didn't feel that at age 34, having surgery and coming back in 
two years and maybe being able to pitch was much of an option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, if this doesn't work, surgery can still be done.  
</P>
<P>
	For a month, he couldn't throw at all. Then he could play a  
light game of catch. Through it all, he worked out every day on 
weights and on the stationary bicycle. He took only one day off in 
just over three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's done is kind of overcompensate by strengthening the  
rest of his rotator cuff, all the muscles that stabilize his 
shoulder blade, his back, his abdomen,'' Dr. Zeman said. ``So he's 
using his whole body to pitch now, whereas by his own admission he 
was pretty much just forcing it before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre's dad, now the pitching coach for the New York  
Yankees, encouraged him from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got injured, he said, `One thing about it is it  
will take a lot of hard work, and you like to work,' '' Stottlemyre 
said. '' `You're going to enjoy finding a way to beat this thing,' 
and that's how I've taken it. It's a challenge and somehow with the 
help of the trainers and my family, we'll find a way to beat it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre slowly worked his way up to pitching hard, first in  
a few simulated games, then in three increasingly longer starts for 
the Diamondbacks team in the Arizona Rookie League. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter said he believes Stottlemyre won't show  
any hesitation on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will rear back and fire,'' Showalter said.  
</P>
<P>
	When Stottlemyre takes the mound at Three Rivers Stadium, he  
said will try to simply concentrate on doing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be able to go out there with a game plan,'' he  
said. ``Try to leave all the emotions of the last three months and 
what it means to me personally on that day, push it aside and just 
go pitch.''

<HEADLINE> Money Transmitters Must Now Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big money transmitters like Western Union and  
thousands of storefront operations -- all part of a $200 
billion-a-year business sometimes used by drug traffickers to 
launder money -- now will be required to register with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new rule, the Treasury Department is aiming to stanch  
illicit drug profits flowing to Colombia and other trafficking 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation announced by Treasury officials Wednesday stems  
from legislation enacted in 1994 as lawmakers became aware that 
some money-services businesses have been used by drug traffickers 
to illegally transfer large amounts of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	A key lawmaker today called the new rule an important step in  
fighting this form of money laundering but said the government took 
too long to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been more than four years since Congress passed the  
Money Laundering Suppression Act,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, 
R-N.J., who heads the House Banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions. ``This is an important first step but I am dismayed 
that it has taken this long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Roukema noted that Treasury still must issue new rules for  
money-services businesses to report suspicious activities by 
customers to law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury officials view the new rule as a strike at an Achilles'  
heel of organized crime -- the need to convert illegal and unusable 
proceeds into usable funds. An estimated $57 billion in drug money 
is laundered every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elisabeth Bresee, assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement,  
noted that some drug traffickers have moved their money laundering 
from banks to money-services businesses as banking regulations have 
been tightened. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money launderers are creative,'' she told reporters in a  
conference call. ``That's why we're trying to cut off all 
avenues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money-services businesses will have more than two years to  
register with Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 
known as FinCen. The requirement will take effect on Dec. 31, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to register will be considered a crime, punishable by  
fines of $5,000 a day and up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great majority of money-services businesses in the United  
States are law-abiding,'' said FinCen Director James F. Sloan. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials estimate the rule will apply to 5,000 to 8,000  
businesses nationwide, including big corporations such as Western 
Union, American Express and Travelers Express/MoneyGram as well as 
independent storefront operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses, which transmit money, sell and redeem money  
orders and traveler's checks, cash checks and exchange foreign 
currency, account for an estimated $200 billion a year in 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	By requiring the businesses to register with the government  
every two years, the officials said they will get the first 
comprehensive look at the money-services industry -- where the 
companies are, who owns them and what services they provide. 
</P>
<P>
	That will help law enforcement authorities discover where money  
laundering may be occurring and the risk of prosecution could drive 
``underground'' businesses into the open, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses also will be required to provide lists of their  
authorized agents starting Jan. 1, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule builds on a special emergency order that Treasury  
put into effect in 1996 after evidence showed that some money 
transmitting businesses and their agents in New York had engaged in 
a scheme to move drug money to Colombia. The temporary order 
required some money transmitters in the New York area and Puerto 
Rico to report information about all transmissions to Colombia and 
the Dominican Republic of $750 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen transmitting businesses were discovered to be sending  
$800 million a year to Colombia, far more than would be normal for 
people to send home to relatives, Ms. Bresee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire transfers from immigrants to their families abroad usually  
range between $200 and $500. 
</P>
<P>
	Under existing law, money-services businesses must report any  
currency transactions exceeding $10,000. Treasury postponed a 
decision on a proposal that would lower that threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	Ezra Levine, counsel to the Nonbank Funds Transmitters Group,  
which represents the large money-transmitting companies, called the 
new registration requirement ``a very positive development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money-services industry, which had been in discussions with  
Treasury officials on the rule since May 1997, believes it will 
help ``reduce burdens on the industry while protecting the public 
interest,'' Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ziverts, a spokesman for Western Union, said the rule was  
``not too onerous'' for the company and its 26,000 agents in the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Judge Eva Shain Dies at 81 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Eva Shain, who helped break the gender  
barrier for boxing judges and went on to score 5,000 fights, died 
of breast cancer Thursday. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Shain died at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, spokesman  
Jeff Camerato said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shain, of Fort Lee, N.J., earned a reputation as a competent  
boxing judge who blazed a trail for women. But she didn't consider 
herself a pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something I wanted to do. It was a challenge,'' Shain  
said in a 1996 interview with The Associated Press. ``It wasn't the 
idea of being a trailblazer. I was thinking about me, what I wanted 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Jersey City, Shain worked as an interior decorator  
before getting her start in boxing by attending Golden Gloves 
matches with her husband, longtime ring announcer Frank Shain. She 
would score fights privately and then compare the judges scores 
with her own, to see if she was close. She usually was. 
</P>
<P>
	Shain worked amateur fights for eight years and got her  
professional license in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, she was a judge for a title fight between  
Muhammad Ali and Earnie Shavers. It was the first time in history a 
woman had judged a heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction later landed her in the Guinness Book, Trivial  
Pursuit and on the TV quiz show ``To Tell The Truth.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flap Hits Nuke Weapons Plant Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- To Merri Wood, he was a colleague and  
fellow member of a small community of scientists -- those who build 
nuclear bombs and know how to keep secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she doesn't quite know what to make of Wen Ho Lee.  
</P>
<P>
	Is he spy or scapegoat? Either way, she says, ``there are no  
winners in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The uproar over the loss of nuclear secrets to China that has  
preoccupied politicians in Washington for months is nowhere more 
personal than among those like Ms. Wood who live and work on the 
rugged mesa in northern New Mexico where, 54 years ago, scientists 
in secret built the world's first atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	A weapons computer scientist fired from the Los Alamos National  
Laboratory last March, Lee is under investigation on suspicion he 
gave China secrets about America's nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	While he denies that allegation, the investigation also has  
unleashed charges of lax security and plain inattention when it 
comes to protecting nuclear secrets. A culture of scientific 
arrogance, the politicians and pundits have become fond of calling 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Los Alamos lab, 43 square miles of rugged cliffs, pine  
forests and high desert scrubland, is at ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Already the mishandling of the Lee investigation has brought  
calls for discipline against a highly respected former lab 
director, and many scientists here worry about a backlash that 
could harm the lab's ability to attract top talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos scientists seem to know little more than the rest of  
America about what Lee may or may not have done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the truth is. We don't know how much was  
really compromised, and we don't know if Wen Ho is really guilty or 
not,'' says Ms. Wood, who came to the lab 20 years ago with a Ph.D 
in physics to work on weapons design. 
</P>
<P>
	If he's ``guilty of incredible stupidity ... he probably  
deserved firing, but doesn't deserve to be roasted 
internationally,'' she continues. ``And if guilty of espionage ... 
how dare he do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words have a sharp edge to them, uncharacteristic for this  
scientist, who has a love of dance and has raised two children. She 
has spent most of her professional life helping design the most 
lethal weapons of mass destruction and considers her coworkers as 
close family -- the people who consoled her when her mother died and 
were with her when she went through the trauma of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not deserve being tarred with a broad brush,'' she says,  
dismissing suggestions there is widespread disregard for security 
at Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of us who have worked under difficult  
circumstances for a long time because we know security is important 
and we put up with it,'' she said in an interview. ``Security is a 
way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this she is not alone.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't cuss in church and you don't talk about classified  
information,'' insists Stephen Younger, a physicist who has 
designed bombs, seen them carve huge craters into the Nevada 
desert, and now heads Los Alamos' weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger bridles at complaints by a presidential advisory panel  
of a ``culture'' of lax security and arrogance at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one understands better what nuclear weapons can do than  
designers,'' says Younger. ``When you walk out to a crater that 
you've made and see this crater hundreds of feet in diameter and 
you know you held that object in your hand and you know everything 
about it, and it did this. You understand the need for secrecy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----------	 
</P>
<P>
	There is a casual, relaxed feel to Los Alamos on the surface  
that belies the tensions. At midday in the cafeteria, there is not 
a single coat and tie to be seen. Shorts and sneakers are not out 
of place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very laid back, but very intense intellectually,'' says  
Terry Hawkins, who spent 25 years in Air Force intelligence and has 
been at Los Alamos for 11 years, now as a manager in programs 
dealing with nuclear nonproliferation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab boasts 4,615 physicists, engineers and computer  
specialists with advanced degrees. Fewer than 900 of them work 
exclusively on nuclear weapons and only a handful are actually 
designers. The 450 foreign visitors, including 93 from China, are 
not allowed ``behind the fence'' as the divide between top-secret 
and unclassified research is known. 
</P>
<P>
	To work inside the fence is to work on the weapons programs.  
Once it was where new weapons were created; now it is where 
physicists and nuclear engineers use the world's fastest computers 
to develop complex codes to assure, short of actual testing, that a 
bomb will actually work if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Only those with special ``Q clearances'' -- a level beyond  
top-secret -- are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly a quarter century, Wen Ho Lee worked in this  
environment as part of weapons design team. Even while under FBI 
suspicion for three years, the Taiwan-born computer specialist had 
daily access to the country's most secret warhead codes. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was fired, it was disclosed Lee had transferred into  
his unclassified computer network thousands of files of 
super-secret ``Legacy'' codes -- an archive of warhead development 
going back decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee continues to live in his modest, neatly landscaped one-story  
house in White Rock, a 15-minute drive from the lab. With one 
exception, he has declined interviews. In an appearance on CBS' 
``60 Minutes'' he denied giving China any secrets, although 
acknowledging the computer file transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that Wen Ho is a criminal. He's basically an  
honest man,'' says Bryan Kashiwa, a computer scientist who has 
worked with him. Whatever he did ``I don't believe he did it with 
any malicious intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The word `scapegoat' comes up a lot,'' says David Gurd, a  
physicist who works in the non-weapons areas; his wife, Pam, a 
computer programer at the lab, isn't so sure. ``I think there's 
something to it,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Lee investigation already has had a deep impact at Los  
Alamos, one of the nation's two nuclear weapons labs. The site was 
selected by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1943 for its 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger says he has no problems with the new security measures  
being ordered by the Energy Department. But he worries about 
overreactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you put a big fence around this place and say you can't  
interact with the outside world because your work is too secret, 
this program will fail, the weapons program will fail,'' he says. 
To maintain nuclear weapons without actual testing, ``we need the 
very best science and technology available'' and sometimes that's 
from a foreign country, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists sense a backlash has already begun, especially  
against the hundreds of foreigners who do unclassified research at 
Los Alamos. No espionage or loss of secrets has ever been linked to 
a foreign visitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a high sense of anxiety, not just among foreign  
nationals but U.S. citizens too,'' says Rajan Gupta, who came to 
Los Alamos from India 13 years ago as an Oppenheimer Fellow and 
decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Some foreign scholars involved in non-weapons research complain  
that funding for projects is harder to get, their access to 
unclassified computers has been restricted and their freedom of 
movement has been constrained. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing has caused more of a stir than plans to require  
widespread polygraph testing of thousands of scientists with secret 
clearance. Some fear careers may be ruined by false readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic mail also will be more closely monitored and lab  
workers have been told to report any ``close and continuing 
contacts'' between U.S. scientists and researchers from 
``sensitive'' countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need to protect sensitive and classified information has  
never been an issue,'' says Gupta. But he argues the current 
atmosphere could be ``disastrous for science at Los Alamos'' and 
its ability to attract not only foreigners but American 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are constantly being reminded that ... tomorrow they could  
just decide, 'We don't really want you here.' That is a very 
demeaning situation,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the scientists question whether the loss of nuclear  
secrets was anywhere nearly as extensive as the rhetoric from 
Washington would suggest. Or whether the losses even occurred at 
Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	No one may ever know how China obtained its information about  
the W-88 miniaturized warhead on which the Wen Ho Lee investigation 
is centered or even if it came from Los Alamos, U.S. intelligence 
experts acknowledge 
</P>
<P>
	A report by a presidential intelligence advisory panel as well  
as a recent congressional report both questioned why the FBI 
focused exclusively on Los Alamos when it first pursued the alleged 
theft of the W-88 data in 1996. Such information was available 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	That may all be irrelevant to Los Alamos and its scientists,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	Klaus Lacker, a native of Germany who has worked at Los Alamos  
for 15 years, including five on classified research, worries about 
the impact on general scientific research if the issue becomes 
embroiled in presidential politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``People here haven't got the feeling that it's hit bottom  
yet,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Continue Downward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European shares continued to sag Thursday,  
influenced by the slide in U.S. stocks on the back of a 
wider-than-expected trade deficit for June. 
</P>
<P>
	Worst hit were resources and energy stocks, but technology  
shares also were hurt by weakness in the Nasdaq Composite index. 
The Dow Jones Stoxx basic resources index was down 1.5 percent, the 
energy index closed 1.8 percent lower and the technology index was 
off 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, shares of Alcatel-Alsthom closed down 3.10 euros at  
139.80 euros, while Nokia in Helsinki dropped 4.1 percent to 78.80 
euros. That caused the Finnish stock market to fall 3.3 percent, 
the biggest decline in the European bourses. 
</P>
<P>
	Total and Elf-Aquitaine were among the biggest losers on the  
French market. 
</P>
<P>
	A record trade deficit for June in the United States sent bond  
yields rising and hurt the dollar, causing the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average index to lose more than 100 points at the open. At 1600 
GMT, the Dow was down 90.86 points at 10,900.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed down  
3.25 points, or 1.1 percent, at 302.94, while the Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that joined 
the single currency, was down 3.76 points at 316.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 59.35 points at  
3,679.48 points, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index was down 47.47 points 
at 3,637.23. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index was down 0.8  
percent. The Paris CAC-40 index was 1.5 percent lower, Milan's 
MIBtel index fell 0.8 percent and Amsterdam's AEX Index fell 1.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares was down 83.8  
points, or 1.4 percent, at 6,118.

<HEADLINE> Gore Family Heads to N.C. Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIGURE EIGHT ISLAND, N.C. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and his  
family are making a return visit this summer to a private North 
Carolina Island where they vacationed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a great time when they were here before, and they  
look forward to coming back,'' said Raleigh businessman Tom 
Hendrickson, who helped make arrangements for the Gores' trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, fresh from a presidential campaign trip to  
Iowa, was expected to arrive at Figure Eight Island on Friday and 
stay through Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The island, just north of Wrightsville Beach, offers plenty of  
privacy. Only residents, their guests and people with business on 
the island -- pizza deliverers, mail carriers and workmen -- are 
allowed across a drawbridge over the Atlantic Intracoastal 
Waterway. 
</P>
<P>
	During his last vacation there, Gore was spotted jogging,  
reading and water-skiing with his children.

<HEADLINE> Baby Born at 18 Ounces Goes Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A baby born so tiny that her father's  
wedding band could fit around her leg has beaten the odds and gone 
home for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Katelin Elizabeth Moran weighed 1 pound, 2 ounces when she was  
born nearly four months premature on May 11. During her 100 days in 
St. Peter's Hospital, she went through operations to repair a leaky 
valve in her heart, retina problems in both eyes and a hernia. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time she left Wednesday, weighing 4 pounds, 5 ounces,  
Katelin had come to be known by nurses and other staff as the 
hospital's ``littlest angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katelin, born to Kelly and Shawn Moran, still faces another  
operation to remove a cataract from her eye, but she is going to 
make it, likely without long-term problems, said Dr. Angela 
Mallozzi, the hospital perinatologist who delivered her. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds of a baby born as small as Katelin surviving are about  
one in 10, and many such children suffer from severe and lifelong 
medical problems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soccer Likely To Play in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- The U.S. soccer team likely will play in Cuba next  
year -- almost 53 years to the day of the last game between the 
teams in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Major League Soccer commissioner Doug Logan, acting on  
behalf of the U.S. Soccer Federation, delivered a letter to the 
Cuban Football Federation on Thursday requesting home-and-home 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only was it warmly received, we've picked a day -- July  
19,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only time the United States played in Cuba was a 5-2 loss on  
July 20, 1947, 12 years before Fidel Castro. The Americans are 
2-1-1 against Cuba, winning the last game 3-0 on Feb. 1, 1998 at

<HEADLINE> CART Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Don't call Jimmy Vasser racing's forgotten  
man, at least not in front of team owner Chip Ganassi. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a bunch of bull; he's not the forgotten man,'' Ganassi  
said Thursday while watching the former CART champion circle 
Ganassi's new track in suburban Chicago. ``He just had a great 
finish last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser, who gave Ganassi the first of three consecutive  
championships as a team owner in 1996, finished a hard-closing 
fourth at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course last Sunday. Nonetheless, 
Vasser took a back seat to rookie teammate Juan Montoya, who scored 
his fifth victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's scored four victories since his breakthrough year  
in '96, Vasser has sometimes seemed an afterthought in light of his 
teammates' sensational performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Zanardi won consecutive championships before leaving this  
season for Formula 1. Now there's Montoya, bidding to give Ganassi 
a fourth straight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser doesn't object to being called forgotten, but doesn't  
agree with it, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm perfectly secure with my accomplishments and my talents  
and who I am,'' said Vasser, who has no victories and is 10th in 
the driver standings. ``We're not satisfied with where we are. 
We've made some mistakes that have cost us points and race wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never just the driver. I'm on a great race team and I'd  
like to think I had something to do with building it. It wasn't 
like that when I came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still one of the more solid guys out here,'' Ganassi  
said. ``You're not scraping him off the wall all the time. He's the 
consummate professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his car owner's endorsement, Vasser has the security of  
being in the first year of a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still look over your shoulder,'' he said. ``You can never  
relax. You're judged by your last race.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BUSY MAN:* Ganassi has more on his mind this weekend than  
defending his driver. As president of the new track, ``it's been 
very difficult,'' he said. ``I've got a lot of running around to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to make sure my peer group is taken care of. I've got  
to see to it that new fans are exposed to racing in the right way. 
There are a lot of high-level people who will be here -- and I'm 
trying to win a championship on top of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow team owner Carl Haas can sympathize, because Haas can  
remember the first year he took over the Milwaukee Mile as 
promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of got it separated,'' Haas said. ``I had people  
responsible for the daily running of the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Haas presented his first race at Milwaukee in 1993, he was  
a double winner. Not only were the stands full, but his driver, 
Nigel Mansell, won the race. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE MEARS:* Look for a familiar name to pop up next season,  
either behind the wheel of an Indy car or at the Indianapolis 500 -- 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Mears, son of off-road specialist Roger Mears and nephew  
of four-time Indy 500 winner Rick Mears, is poised to move up to 
the big time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's ready,'' says Uncle Rick, who is closely  
following Casey's career in the steppingstone Indy Lights series. 
``I think he's the only driver who's finished every lap of every 
race. Now he needs to get a win under his belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without that first taste of victory, Casey Mears is tied  
for second in the series, behind teammate Oriol Servia of Spain. 
``I want to move up and on,'' Casey Mears said. ``I've been in Indy 
Lights for three seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first two years were under the aegis of the Mears brothers,  
with Rick's son, Clint, in a second car. A lack of sponsorship 
forced the brothers to merge the operation with Dorricott Racing. 
Clint is now teaching at a driving school in California, awaiting 
another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey is just waiting to move up. The big question is where.  
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, he'd prefer to run both for the CART championship and  
the Indy 500, but a ride in the rival Indy Racing League -- an 
all-oval circuit -- remains an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been scoring better on ovals,'' Rick Mears said, ``but  
he's quick on both.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DREAM TEAM:* Imagine Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr., the two  
winningest drivers in CART's 21-year history, sons of racing stars 
and stars in their own right, driving for the same team. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Al's willing, Michael's willing, but the only man who  
currently could make it happen says it's not possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser is looking for a new ride next season after losing his  
seat with Roger Penske. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'd be super,'' Unser said when asked how he'd like to pair  
with Andretti. ``It would bring back old memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to the fact that his father, Al Unser, and  
Michael's father, Mario Andretti, once were part of a three-man 
race team in the early 1970s. ``That was the first super team,'' Al 
Jr. recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	An Unser-Andretti pairing would be a marketer's dream, but  
Michael is under contract to the Newman-Haas team, which also has 
Christian Fittipaldi. ``I'm assuming they're happy with him 
(Fittipaldi),'' Unser said. ``He's won a race and been very 
competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to have Al on the team,'' Michael said. ``It'd be  
great. I'm all for it if you could work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's the rub.  
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Carl Haas would have to field a third car were he to  
sign Unser and ``that would be impossible for me,'' Haas says. 
``I've got my drivers for 2000 and a three-car team is not 
possible. It's hard enough to try to do it with two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he could come up with the necessary sponsorship money,  
``it's not the money,'' Haas says. ``It's just the logistics. It's 
so competitive these days. I don't want to take on that big a 
task.''

<HEADLINE> Radio Proposal Draws Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A landmass about 15 miles long, Vashon Island  
has two police cars, one fast-food chain and depends on a ferry 
system to link it to the mainland at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	But, insists resident William Morosoff, the island still has a  
vibrant culture -- kept alive by artists, activists and local 
merchants -- and one that should be represented by its very own 
radio station. He wants the Federal Communications Commission to 
adopt rules that would create thousands of new low-power FM radio 
stations across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I hear the word Vashon on the radio or TV is if  
there is a serious ferry problem,'' says Morosoff, an aerospace 
consultant who runs a bed and breakfast on the island. ``The island 
is considered a non-place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most active outpourings of public comment the  
agency has seen, more than 2,500 interested parties have submitted 
their thoughts on an FCC proposal offered earlier this year that 
would enable ``micro'' radio broadcasters to operate with low power 
levels from 1 watt to 1,000 watts - far less powerful than big city 
stations that often boast 50,000 watts of power. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC stopped licensing low-powered FM radio stations around  
1978 to help solidify regular FM stations. But FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard and others have pushed for the proposal to help increase 
the diversity of voices on the airwaves. It could be months before 
a final decision is issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The variety of the applicants is as unusual as the number: a  
Korean language radio station, an Islamic charity foundation and a 
suburban public library all have chimed in backing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents of the plan also have formed a strong coalition,  
from the industry that makes radios to the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial broadcasters have compiled hundreds of pages of  
documentation arguing that low power radio stations could degrade 
service to listeners. A study commissioned by the National 
Association of Broadcasters surveyed the impact of relaxing the 
buffer zones around existing stations to make room for new 
low-power ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers, testing 28 common radios including car and clock  
radios, determined that low-power radio could cause significant 
interference with existing stations. A study by the Consumer 
Electronics Manufacturers Association, with support from National 
Public Radio and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, reached 
similar conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-power radio proponents led by the National Lawyers Guild  
Committee on Democratic Communications commissioned their own 
study, which concluded that there is some leeway in FCC's current 
interference rules and that low-power stations will create less 
interference than caused by some existing licensed stations. 
</P>
<P>
	But broadcasters also argue that regulators are jumping the gun  
by introducing low-power stations without knowing how these 
stations will impact digital radio, when that service is 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the public interest in rushing to provide a new class  
of radio to serve a few listeners before knowing how it would 
affect future digital service to all listeners?'' said Eddie 
Fritts, president of NAB. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the proposal has piqued the imagination of hundreds  
around the country, who believe a local radio station would serve a 
unique community function at a relatively small price -- as low as 
$2,500 for a 1-watt station to $100,000 and up for a 1,000-watt 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feinberg, executive director of the Middle Country Public  
Library in Centereach N.Y., sees a station headquartered at the 
library as an innovative way to draw in more of the community's 
residents, particularly young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to attract kids to libraries,'' admits Feinberg.  
Young adults would also gain from the hands-on experience by 
helping to run the station, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	By airing storytelling sessions and speeches by featured  
lecturers, the library could extend its reach to homebound 
residents, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little left of small communities,'' says  
Feinberg. ``I think this would just emphasize that role that we 
play even more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others see a low-power station not as an enhancement but as a  
necessity for their areas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Orcas Island, part of the San Juan Islands between Washington  
state and Canada's Vancouver Island, local disaster response groups 
say such a station is needed to keep residents informed about 
serious weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bennett, district chief of the volunteer fire department,  
recalls two cases -- a huge snowstorm incapacitating people several 
years ago and a power outage about a decade ago -- when residents 
relied on word-of-mouth to find out what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically neighbor talking to neighbor,'' Bennett said.  
</P>
<P>
	But people on the island need to know if the ferry they depend  
on to get to the nearest landing, is out of service, says Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need is good local information,'' Bennett said.

<HEADLINE> Former Ballplayer Dee Fondy Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDLANDS, Calif. (AP) -- Dee Fondy, who played for the Chicago  
Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds and was the last 
player to bat in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, died Thursday of cancer. 
He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year, died  
at Plymouth Village retirement center, said his youngest son, Joe 
Fondy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dee Fondy was one of my favorite people,'' baseball  
commissioner Bud Selig said. ``He had a great sense of humor. He 
and I used to kid each other a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy grounded out for the last out at Ebbets Field in  
Pittsburgh's 2-0 loss to the Dodgers on Sept. 24, 1957. The Dodgers 
moved to Los Angeles the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .286 with 1,000 hits in eight seasons in the majors.  
Following his playing career, Fondy worked as a scout and front 
office official for the New York Mets and Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran into Willie Mays once and he said, `I've still got the  
bruises from the tags your dad used to give me. He was a hard-nosed 
player,''' recalled his son, Joe Fondy, a freelance cameraman who 
has covered major league games. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed originally by the Brooklyn Dodgers, Fondy came to spring  
training in 1949 and competed with Gil Hodges and Chuck Connors for 
the starting job at first base. The position was won by Hodges, and 
Connors eventually became a TV star in the Western series, ``The 
Rifleman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy played in the Dodgers' farm system until being traded to  
the Cubs. He won a spot on their roster and his first major-league 
hit was a bases-loaded triple off St. Louis pitcher Ken 
Raffsenberger on April 17, 1951, in Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy was traded to Pittsburgh in 1957, where midway through the  
season he led the National League with a .365 average. The next 
year he was traded to Cincinnati for Ted Kluszewski, a transaction 
mentioned by Tom Cruise's character in the 1988 movie ``Rainman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his playing career, Fondy worked as a scout for the Mets  
and the Brewers, where he signed Paul Molitor, who went on to more 
than 3,000 hits. He retired from baseball in 1995 after serving as 
a special assistant to the Milwaukee general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was as good a judge of talent as I've ever known,'' Selig  
said. ``He played a great role in the development of the Brewers. I 
had as much faith in his baseball knowledge as anyone I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy, a native of Slaton, Texas, served in the Army during  
World War II and was part of the forces that landed on Utah Beach 
in Normandy in 1944, three months after D-Day. He received the 
Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Fondy's other surivivors are twins Jon Fondy and Jan Cornell of  
Las Vegas. His wife, Jacquelyn, died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral is Saturday in San Bernardino.

<HEADLINE> Is Bush Eyeing Dole and Her Support? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The congratulatory fax to Elizabeth Dole came  
from an old pal who happens to be a top official in rival George W. 
Bush's campaign. A sign, her husband said, that Dole has something 
Bush needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Women voters.  
</P>
<P>
	The private overture from former Republican Party chairman Haley  
Barbour, now co-chairman of Bush's effort, can't help but fuel 
whispers -- from within Dole's own camp, even -- that if Dole can't 
beat Bush's formidable bankroll and poll numbers in the race for 
the GOP presidential nomination, she might increasingly count on 
joining him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to keep looking at each other,'' former Sen. Bob  
Dole, her husband, said Thursday. But it's president, not vice 
president that she's running for, he added. ``She's not trying to 
do anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has this inherent strength that's so good for the party,  
so good for everyone who's involved in Campaign 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole should know. The GOP's traditional -- and  
ever-more-gaping -- deficit to Democrats when it comes to women 
voters helped lead to his presidential defeat in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour wrote Dole after she placed a strong third behind Bush  
and Steve Forbes in the Ames, Iowa, straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ames is a vivid reminder that there is a huge appetite out  
there for Elizabeth Dole's candidacy,'' Barbour told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing Barbour's gesture, the former senator said: ``He  
knows where we've needed muscle in the party. We've got some pretty 
scary people out there when it comes to what women see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a dismal spring of organizational disarray and sinking  
poll numbers, aides said Dole had earned a new lease on political 
life. On a West Coast fund-raising swing, Dole said her strategy 
for making the most of this second chance is ``Just keep moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She promised to roll out the ideas on crime, drugs, taxes and  
education to prove herself more qualified than Bush, the Texas 
governor, to head the GOP ticket in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in her circle of Washington staff and advisers, with an eye  
on Bush's lead, said privately that if Dole can keep the momentum 
going into the winter primaries, she cements herself a fallback 
position by forcing Bush to make her his running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Her strong appeal among women already makes her a must-have on  
any Republican ticket hoping to overcome the GOP's gender gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Another top Bush operative, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
flipped the Dole team's postulate inside out, saying that if Dole 
now does poorly in the primaries, she loses any chance of joining a 
Bush ticket. She would have a more guaranteed shot, this person 
said, had she stayed out of the race, keeping her mystique and 
celebrity unblemished. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, called the talk of No. 2  
``inevitable chitchat in political circles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the better she does, the more the chitchat will  
grow. But she's running for one position and one position only, and 
she's running to win,'' Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole herself seems to strain to keep the competition with Bush  
congenial, feeding theories that she's carefully avoiding burned 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing personal,'' she said, painting herself as a workhorse  
candidate keeping her head down. When arguing her point that Bush 
is less qualified than she for the White House, Dole gently poked 
at him not by name but as ``one other candidate I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were traces of resentment over Bush's whopping lead and  
his ``gobs of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To capitalize on any post-Ames momentum, Dole is rushing out two  
fund-raising appeals this week that boast of her Iowa showing and 
ask for the money to keep going. Her campaign, which was focused 
almost exclusively on Iowa, is now scrambling to organize for New 
Hampshire's leadoff primary. 
</P>
<P>
	A back-to-school swing will, she hopes, win a spotlight on her  
plan for school safety and discipline. An anti-drug policy is due 
to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll draw a very, very clear line in the sand ... and force,  
if we can, a discussion with George W. Bush. If he chooses to 
remain silent, he gives Mrs. Dole a wide open field,'' strategist 
Tony Fabrizio said. 
</P>
<P>
	She is moving up -- from October to mid September -- a kickoff  
from her hometown of Salisbury, N.C. And she looked ahead to a 
dizzy pace of 25 fund-raisers in the next 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican strategist close to her campaign said that when  
the next finance reports are filed Sept. 30 she'll need to bring 
her fund-raising tally to at least $5 million to remain a credible 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	She raised $3.5 million in the first six months of this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Senator Dole said he was working the phones to raise money and  
to convert workers from the now-defunct Lamar Alexander campaign. 
Already, 10 of Alexander's Iowa organizers enlisted with Dole this 
week.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Fined Over Streisand Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- A helicopter pilot charged with flying too  
low over Barbra Streisand's wedding last summer pleaded no contest 
to disturbing the peace and was fined $500 and grounded for 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Butler was also placed on two years' probation Wednesday  
and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler was arrested Feb. 25 after a seven-month investigation by  
sheriff's investigators into complaints that a helicopter pilot 
carrying a photographer flew dangerously close to Ms. Streisand's 
outdoor wedding to James Brolin on July 1, 1998, at her estate. 
</P>
<P>
	The event attracted 15 helicopters, but witnesses said Butler's  
helicopter separated from the others and flew recklessly low above 
the 250 guests. The legal level was 500 feet.

<HEADLINE> Family Sought by Coast Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Coast Guard and its Canadian counterpart  
are searching for a family of four that disappeared off the East 
Coast while sailing from Florida to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Stewart, Debbie Stewart and their children, Chad, 16,  
and Mischa, 12, of Ludlow Falls, Ohio, last spoke to their 
relatives around July 25 from Newport, R.I., according to Coast 
Guard Cmdr. Jim McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say the family's credit cards were last used on  
July 26 in Newport. Their cellular phone was last activated on Aug. 
3 near Piscataway, N.J., located about 20 miles inland from the 
entrance to the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	In the more than two weeks since, there has been no contact with  
the Stewarts. The Coast Guard has been unable to locate them 
despite an aerial search along the East Coast and calls to marinas 
along the New England coast, the Hudson River Valley and the St. 
Lawrence Seaway, which parallels the U.S.-Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have basically vanished,'' said McPherson, speaking from  
Coast Guard headquarters in Washington. ``We have no reports of 
finding life jackets or life rings or (signals from) emergency 
beacons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers have investigated the possibilities of a hoax and that  
the family is simply overdue, but the time that has passed and the 
lack of contact with relatives have raised concerns. Richard 
Stewart is described as an inexperienced sailor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had situations where we've had single-hand sailors  
change their itinerary and not tell anybody, but it's seldom that 
you have an entire family disappear,'' McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was aboard a 65-foot sailboat, the ``Jolly Joyce.''  
The ketch is cream-colored with two white sails and carries a gray 
10-foot dinghy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dayton (Ohio) Daily News reported today that the family had  
been living on the boat in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., since buying it 
in January. Chad and Mischa are home-schooled, according to their 
older sister, Beth Stewart. She told the newspaper she stayed 
behind in Ludlow Falls, near Dayton, to run the family's two video 
rental stores. The family home is also up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials said the Stewarts intended to sail north  
along the coast to the St. Lawrence Seaway and then to the Great 
Lakes. The ultimate destination was the Michigan home of Debbie 
Stewart's parents, Beth Stewart told the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	En route, one of the boat's two engines died near Newport and  
the other started faltering, so the family docked there and sought 
repairs, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Al Bennett, based at 
Atlantic Area Headquarters in Portsmouth, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stewarts had problems finding parts, however, because the  
boat was nearly 30 years old. Bennett said a family friend located 
some parts in Louisiana and intended to install them in Fort 
Lauderdale, but the Stewarts never returned, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone in Newport overheard them saying they might keep going  
(to the Great Lakes), but we're not sure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the family initially decided against using the Hudson  
River because they would have had to take down the sailboat's mast 
upon reaching the Erie Canal, the Coast Guard has searched and 
called marinas throughout New York because of the nearby cell phone 
use. The phone was turned on but no call completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadians are also searching off Nova Scotia and along the  
St. Lawrence River on the assumption the Stewarts could have 
continued north. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know which way they went and our search area is  
literally the Atlantic Ocean and the Hudson River,'' said 
McPherson. ``What we're hoping is somebody gives us a better search 
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked anyone with information about the Jolly Joyce or the  
Stewart family to call the local Coast Guard station.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio No. 22 on ESPN's List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ESPN's countdown of the greatest athletes of the  
century reaches No. 22 with Joe DiMaggio on Friday night and the 
presentation includes rare footage of the Hall of Famer singing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cameo, DiMaggio managed to get through one line -- ``Have  
you ever been in heaven?'' -- when his off-key effort was 
interrupted by an actor playing an outraged listener. DiMaggio 
shrugged off the complaint saying, ``I'm a center fielder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ESPN tribute to him included interviews with former New York  
Yankees teammates Phil Rizzuto, Jerry Coleman and Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	There was extensive coverage of the catch by Brooklyn's Al  
Gionfriddo's against the bullpen fence in the 1947 World Series 
that robbed DiMaggio of a triple and left the Yankees slugger 
kicking the basepath dirt in disgust, one of his very rare displays 
of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman recalled DiMaggio's great pride and how it was shaken  
once near the end of his career by manager Casey Stengel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hitting fifth,'' Coleman said of the Yankees longtime  
cleanup batter. ``Joe never hit fifth. I don't think he ever 
forgave him for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there was the scouting report near the end of DiMaggio's  
career that recommended throwing fastballs inside. ``He can't get 
around on it anymore,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, DiMaggio left baseball as one of its most heroic  
figures and married film star Marilyn Monroe. Much of the ESPN 
treatment deals with their stormy nine-month relationship including 
the famous exchange when Marilyn returned from a trip to entertain 
American troops overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, Joe,'' she gushed, ``you never heard such cheering.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I did,'' the taciturn slugger replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Even after their divorce, DiMaggio remained loyal to his  
ex-wife, rushing to her side in troubled times. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe's brother, Dominic, who played center field for the Boston  
Red Sox, spoke warmly of DiMaggio, who died March 8 at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always the perfect gentleman,'' he said. ``He did  
everything with style, on the field and off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Hall of Famer Ted Williams remembered the grace with which  
his longtime rival played the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it so easy and made it look so good -- going for a ball,  
hitting a ball, throwing a ball,'' Williams said. ``He never looked 
bad. I never saw him look bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio is the fourth baseball player on the ESPN list,  
following Sandy Koufax, No. 42; Mickey Mantle, No. 37; and Lou 
Gehrig, No 34.

<HEADLINE> Salt Water Threatens Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Salty seawater is creeping upstream in some  
Eastern rivers, potentially threatening municipal water supplies as 
the drought continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Reduced streamflow in rivers such as the Delaware and Hudson is  
allowing the encroachment, the U.S. Geological Survey reports. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Hudson River, the salt front is about five miles  
downstream from the water intakes for the city of Poughkeepsie, 
north of New York City, the Survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's standing still and water which is being pumped  
into the Hudson from area reservoirs is keeping the salt front at 
bay,'' Survey hydrologist Ward Freeman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, the salt front may begin moving upstream again  
and only significant rainfall will wash out the threat. ``It's 
serious because Poughkeepsie relies on freshwater from the Hudson. 
They don't have any groundwater resources they can draw from,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Poughkeepsie faced a similar problem during the drought of  
1995 water was released from the Sacandaga Reservoir to block 
further saltwater movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delaware River, which feeds much of the Philadelphia  
region's water supply, is also being monitored for saltwater 
encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the salt front is near the Philadelphia International  
Airport, 20 miles downstream from the city's water intakes. But 
that's 11 to 12 miles upriver of where it normally is in summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep the salt front downstream from the mouth of  
the Schuylkill River,'' said hydrologist Tony Navoy. ``There are a 
series of reservoirs up the Delaware River and into New York and we 
have to tap into those to keep the river flows high enough to keep 
the salt at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navoy said a well field near Pennsauken, N.J., which serves much  
of suburban Trenton, could be affected if the salt front moves 
further upriver. 
</P>
<P>
	If groundwater levels in that well field fall below mean sea  
level and river water is salty, the salt can contaminate the 
underground water. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its bad taste, salt water can be a serious health  
hazard for people on salt-restricted diets. Salt causes the human 
body to retain water, making the heart work harder and increasing 
blood pressure. Salt water can also corrode underwater equipment 
and cause freshwater organisms to move or die off.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Wrap Up Arms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The United States and Russia reaffirmed on  
Thursday their 1972 treaty banning missile defense systems and 
agreed in principle to work on further reducing their nuclear 
warhead stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements came after three days of high-level discussions  
between the two nations about their nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main points the sides discussed was the United  
States' desire to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so it 
can build a limited missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The system the United States wants to build would be designed to  
shoot down a single missile or a small number of missiles. It would 
not be effective against a massive attack, the kind Russia is 
capable of launching, the Americans say. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow strongly opposes changes to the treaty, saying a missile  
defense system in the United States would upset the current 
strategic balance. But President Boris Yeltsin agreed to discuss 
ABM modifications when he met President Clinton in June. 
</P>
<P>
	After this week's talks, the two sides said the ABM treaty ``is  
the cornerstone of strategic stability'' between them. No specific 
proposals were discussed and no major decisions reached, but the 
sides agreed that ABM must remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides also agreed in principle to start work on a START III  
treaty that would cut nuclear warheads to 2,000 to 2,500 per 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But before they can work on such a treaty, they have to finish  
ratification of START II. That treaty, which calls for both 
countries to scale back from around 6,000 warheads to 3,000 to 
3,500 each, was signed in 1993. But Russia's parliament has yet to 
ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian lawmaker involved in the talks said START II's  
ratification depends on a U.S.-Russian agreement on the ABM 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian side made it plain that (START II) can be ratified  
only if there is a mutually acceptable stand'' on the ABM treaty, 
Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of parliament's committee for 
international affairs, told the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has urged the lower house, the State Duma, to make  
START II ratification a priority. But Communists and other 
hard-liners have balked, saying the treaty endangers Russia's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate ratified START II in 1996.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: Teaching Mrs. Tingle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Curious thing about ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' the new  
high-school squirm-and-jump movie: It actually features a 
three-dimensional adult character -- someone who stands out amid the 
jump cuts, product placements and lithe bodies of post-''90210'' 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	This someone is the abundantly talented Helen Mirren. She plays  
the title character in a movie that, in a world after Columbine, 
could have been simply distasteful and exploitative, but ends up 
being thought-provoking and compellingly blackhearted. ``Teaching 
Mrs. Tingle'' is a dark-side-of-suburbia morality play as 
engrossing as a good highway accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Eve Tingle is a thoroughly unpleasant history teacher at  
Grandsboro High who repels colleagues, terrifies the principal and 
belittles students to tears. Nothing's good enough for this woman 
and her barely repressed rage; she's the teacher from hell. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaste but pulchritudinous good girl Leigh Ann Watson (Katie  
Holmes of ``Go'' and TV's ``Dawson's Creek'') is inches away from 
being valedictorian, which would give her the college scholarship 
her waitress mother never had and allow her to pursue her dream: 
being a writer. As graduation approaches, one thing stands between 
Leigh Ann and her future: Mrs. Tingle. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Mrs. Tingle wrongly accuses Leigh Ann of cheating, she,  
best friend Jo Lynn and Luke, the classmate responsible for the 
mess, go to the teacher's (gated and turreted!) house at night to 
plead their case. But things fall apart, and within minutes Mrs. 
Tingle is unconscious and they've tied her to her bed. 
</P>
<P>
	What unfolds from there is a psychological chess match between  
the seniors and their teacher. Physically, they're in command; 
mentally, Mrs. Tingle is running the show. ``Things are just 
starting to get fun,'' she spits. 
</P>
<P>
	For Leigh Ann and Jo Lynn, it's a moral decision: They CAN kill.  
But will they? 
</P>
<P>
	Mirren is deliciously prickly as Mrs. Tingle, whose callous,  
malevolent exterior may or may not hide a deep pain that made her 
sour. The restraint of Kevin Williamson's script prevents her from 
becoming a broad-brush parody, as is the fate of so many adults in 
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' -- also written 
by Williamson, who's making his directorial debut with this film. 
``Tingle'' was his first screenplay, written years ago and 
``inspired'' by a real-life experience with a harsh teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh-faced Holmes has perfected her maiden-with-an-edge  
persona and carries it off well, but it may be time for her to move 
on; she can only be drenched and bewildered so many times before it 
gets old. 
</P>
<P>
	A most pleasant surprise is Marisa Coughlan as Jo Lynn, an  
aspiring actress who struggles to be comfortable with her identity 
and is led into shattered confidence by Mrs. Tingle's mind games. 
The scene in which Jo Lynn re-creates Linda Blair's demonic 
possession in ``The Exorcist'' before a bound-and-gagged Mrs. 
Tingle is utterly hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine supporting characters help ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' along.  
Jeffrey Tambor is his usual welcome self as the slightly addled 
Coach Wenchell. Michael McKean is the appropriately administrative 
Principal Potter. And the most pleasant surprise of all? Grownup 
brat-packer Molly Ringwald as a substitute teacher with a decidedly 
sexual approach to French history. 
</P>
<P>
	Competent, though less memorable, is male love interest Luke  
Churner (Barry Watson of TV's ``7th Heaven), this movie's Skeet 
Ulrich/Freddie Prinze Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems with ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' come toward the end.  
Sometimes Mrs. Tingle borders on sympathetic, and those are the 
most captivating moments. But at the conclusion, as her ambiguity 
melts away and she becomes a cliche -- proving once again to the 
ticket-buying audience that adults are cardboard characters in 
their universe -- the character collapses. 
</P>
<P>
	Simultaneously, the Prerequisite Portentous Camerawork so  
liberally deployed in ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last 
Summer'' kicks in with all its rear views and quasi-Hitchcockian 
tilts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this film transcends the teen-exploitation genre -- and  
with a few tweaks, it could have been far better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' a Dimension Films release, is rated  
PG-13.

<HEADLINE> Bomber Testifies About 1963 Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two white supremacist leaders during a  
period of Ku Klux Klan violence went before a federal grand jury 
investigating the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist 
Church that killed four black girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Shelton, former head of the United Klans of America,  
entered the federal building today for his appearance and declined 
to comment as he walked past reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the first to testify was J.B. Stoner, who was  
convicted in 1980 for an earlier bombing of a black church, a 
nonfatal 1958 blast at Birmingham's Bethel Baptist Church. He 
served most of his 3 1/2 years in prison with Robert Chambliss -- the 
only man convicted so far for the deaths of four little black girls 
in the Sept. 15, 1963, explosion at Sixteenth Street Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Birmingham News reported today that Stoner said he was not  
questioned about the time he spent in jail with Chambliss and was 
not surprised by any questions. But he would not discuss the 
specifics of his grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal investigation at the time of the Sixteenth Street  
bombing resulted in no charges. Former Attorney General Bill Baxley 
led an investigation in the 1970s that resulted in the murder 
conviction for Chambliss. The investigation was reopened yet again 
in 1997, with federal agents saying there was new information. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoner, 75, and Chambliss shared a cell separated from other  
inmates, who had threatened them, Stoner said. Chambliss died in 
prison in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prison had gotten the best of him and he didn't have his wits  
about him,'' Stoner told the News. ``But he prayed every night to 
say he was innocent and to ask God to punish Bill Baxley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also testifying Wednesday was Wayne Monk, who was married in the  
early 1970s to the daughter of bombing suspect Bobby Frank Cherry. 
He said he testified about rumors that he heard while he was a part 
of the family. He said he had heard ``hearsay'' about Cherry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember where I got my stories from,'' Monk said. ``I  
just heard tales. I don't know if he (Cherry) was guilty or if he 
was just bragging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least three other people reportedly have told the grand jury  
that Cherry, 69, had boasted of being involved in the 1963 bombing.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Town Faces Flood Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLEPORT, Iowa (AP) -- He's been burned out and flooded out of  
his home, but John Zapf says he won't be bought out. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has approved more than $1 million to buy  
homes and businesses flooded last May by the Volga River and Honey 
Creek in eastern Iowa. Zapf, born here 43 years ago, is among those 
who aren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just used to it here,'' Zapf said Thursday from his mobile  
home a stone's throw from the Volga. 
</P>
<P>
	This hamlet of 67 people was under water last spring. All but 23  
people have since moved out and the Littleport City Council faces a 
big decision: whether to allow the community to become 
unincorporated. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say 32 homes, about 90 percent of the community,  
are in a flood plain and eligible for the voluntary buyout offered 
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ``risk reduction program'' the government would buyout  
the homeowners to move them out of the flood plain to prevent 
property damage or injuries. The agency wants to create either an 
open space or recreational wetland in Littleport, nestled in a 
valley off a county road some 50 miles northwest of Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
	Other towns have faced similar circumstances. After Midwest  
flooding in 1993, the Missouri towns of Pattonsburg and Rhineland, 
along with Valmeyer, Ill., agreed to relocate out of flood plains. 
Over the years, other small communities have essentially 
disappeared after the government bought out residents and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	And Littleport isn't alone. Mayor Al Pritchard said FEMA buyout  
offers are being made to hundreds of homeowners in Independence, 
Cedar Falls and Dunkerton affected by flooding this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, I just don't know what we'll do until we get  
more information,'' Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor himself has moved. He once owned a Littleport tavern  
called Al's -- famous for its giant hamburgers -- but now calls 
nearby Edgewood home. 
</P>
<P>
	It was May 16 and 17 when the Volga, fed by drenching rains,  
spilled over its banks in what many considered a 500-year flood -- 
so rare it happens once every 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Not much was spared. The bank and post office, which shared the  
same building near the river, are both closed. The community has 
more or less become a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
	Clusters of houses sit deserted, overrun with ankle-deep mud,  
weeds and debris. In all of them, windows are broken -- not by 
vandals, but from furniture that floated high enough to crash 
through the windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I managed to save a glider rocker and a few antique pieces  
that I had put enough varnish on that they withstood water 
damage,'' said Gary Stewart, whose two-story white house took on 7 
feet of water. Eight inches of dried mud was left caked on his 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone had shoveled a path from just inside the front door and  
into the main floor -- but that was before warning notices, affixed 
with duct tape, were hung by the front door. 
</P>
<P>
	The placards, declaring the buildings structurally unsound,  
warn: ``Entry may result in death or injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FEMA and the state are providing more than $1.1 million in grant  
money to move people out of the flood plain, said Dennis Harper of 
the Iowa Emergency Management Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Littleport are awaiting appraisals of their  
properties, though Harper said $30,000 ``is a pretty fair 
assessment across the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zapf had his flood-damaged mobile home removed and is living in  
another one parked in the same spot. He said he doubts he'd be paid 
enough to move. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his brother, Dan, who lives across the street in the  
house that their grandparents and parents lived in, also is 
staying. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Stewart.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Volga, it done a number. I'm moving to Elkader, even  
though it's not very pleasant to have to start over,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Pritchard, who estimates Littleport is 140 to 150 years  
old, isn't sure how much longer it will remain a town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a farming community, just a little place where  
everybody helped everybody. Everyone was always pretty much 
together on things,'' he said. ``It's sad to go back down there. 
The wife doesn't even want to go down there after what happened.''

<HEADLINE> Growth Predicted for Russian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's economics minister predicted Thursday  
that Russia's economy would grow by 1.5 percent in 2000, while the 
Finance Ministry finalized its draft budget for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The year 2000 may become a turning point in the economic  
development of Russia,'' said Economics Minister Andrei 
Shapovalyants. 
</P>
<P>
	If the economy does grow, it would only be the second period of  
growth in the 1990s. In 1997, it grew by 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapovalyants also said that industrial output would grow by 3  
to 4 percent and that Russian exports would climb 6 percent in the 
next three years, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The predictions came as Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov  
unveiled the final budget draft for 2000. Kasyanov said Russia 
would spend 801 billion rubles ($25 billion) and take in revenues 
of 743 billion rubles ($32 billion) in 2000, similar to figures for 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Russia's 2000 draft budget, inflation is forecast  
at about 18 percent, while the average annual ruble rate will be 32 
to the dollar. One dollar now sells for around 24.6 rubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's economy has been showing signs of at least superficial  
improvement since the economy plunged a year ago. Though no major 
economic reforms have taken place since then, the economy has been 
boosted by high world oil prices and increased domestic production.

<HEADLINE> TotalFina May Sweeten Elf Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The chairman of the Franco-Belgian oil giant  
TotalFina said Thursday his company's takeover bid for rival Elf 
Aquitaine might be sweetened a bit, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
	Thierry Desmarest said any new TotalFina bid will show only ``a  
limited increase'' on the company's original offer for ELF in an 
effort to create the world's fourth largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	TotalFina launched a $43 billion hostile bid for Elf in early  
July. Several weeks later Elf made a $51 billion counterbid, and 
the two companies have been embroiled in a war to win over 
shareholders ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	The messy battle is the latest example of the radical shakeup  
now underway in European business where the need for consolidation 
is paramount in a new era of global competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale de Paris has been trying to take over rival  
banks Paribas and Societe Generale to create the world's largest 
bank -- with assets of more than $1 trillion. But it has gained only 
a third of Societe Generale shares and 31.5 percent of its voting 
rights. French regulators is expected to step in and broker a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a fair offer which was around 20 percent above the  
market price,'' Desmarest told a news conference. ``At that level, 
Elf shareholders get the majority of the synergy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Desmarest stressed that TotalFina would only consider making a  
sweetened offer if Elf demonstrated it was open to friendly merger 
talks, which would speed up the merger and increase value. 
</P>
<P>
	A French appeals court Wednesday ruled that TotalFina can  
continue its bid. The court decided not to suspend TotalFina's bid 
pending a case scheduled for Oct. 11 that was brought by Elf 
contending that French stock market regulators should have 
disallowed TotalFina's takeover bid on technical grounds.

<HEADLINE> Greene Chasing 3 Golds at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Maurice Greene swaggers onto the stage  
like a rap star, flashbulbs popping all around him, basking in the 
fame that befits his status as the world's fastest man. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene grabs the microphone and delivers his message for the  
day: ``Beware of the Phenomenon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is referring to himself, using a nickname that sums up  
the spectacular impact he has had on sprinting in the past three 
years, highlighted by his 100-meter world record of 9.79 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Greene has his sights set on another prize: three gold  
medals at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old American is competing in the 100, 200 and  
400-meter (4 x 100) relay. Carl Lewis (1983 and 1987) and Michael 
Johnson (1995) are the only male athletes to win three golds at a 
single worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is seeking to become the first man to complete a 100-200  
sprint double at the worlds, and the first at any major 
championship since Carl Lewis won both events at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100-meter heats are Saturday, with the semifinals and final  
on Sunday. The 200 heats start Tuesday, with the semis Wednesday 
and final Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just eager to get on the track and run,'' Greene said  
Thursday. ``They say the track is very fast. I just want to see how 
fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In only three years of elite competition, Greene has already  
established himself as one of the most prolific sprinters in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	He has broken the 10-second barrier -- the standard for  
excellence in the 100 -- 22 times, including six times this year 
alone. Only Namibia's Frankie Fredericks has run more sub-10 races 
(26), but he accomplished it over an eight-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene entered sprinting lore on June 6 in Athens, Greece, when  
he shattered Donovan Bailey's world record (9.84 seconds at the 
1996 Atlanta Olympics) by an astounding five-hundredths of a 
seconds. He became the first man to run legally under 9.80 (Ben 
Johnson's 9.79 was erased from the books after his positive drug 
test at the 1988 Olympics). 
</P>
<P>
	While Greene looks untouchable in the 100, a gold medal in the  
200 is no certainty. Greene is still learning the longer sprint and 
his best time this year (19.92) is behind the 19.86 run by 
Fredericks and Ato Boldon and the 19.87 by John Capel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 200 is a challenge for Maurice,'' said Greene's coach,  
John Smith. ``It's an event he's not run a great deal, but he's 
real good at it. So he needs to step up in this area to become that 
sprinter he's always wanted to be -- not only tops at the short 
races, but be able to go up to the furlong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With training partner Boldon out of the championships with an  
injury, Fredericks shapes up as Greene's biggest rival in the 200. 
In the 100, Bruny Surin, Obadele Thompson and Fredericks are the 
main challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been speculation that, without Boldon and Bailey to push  
him in Seville, Greene will be less motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about that,'' Smith said. ``That's why I'm  
there. We'll find a reason to run fast. The mere fact that Ato is 
not there means that Maurice will be running with Ato in his spirit 
and his heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith should know.  
</P>
<P>
	After Greene failed to qualify for the 1996 Olympics, he looked  
washed up. But then he packed his bags and moved from Kansas City 
to Los Angeles to train with Smith, the former sprinter whose 
charges include Boldon and Jon Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Maurice first came to me, he told me one of his goals is  
to be the best, to be the best there ever was, and he wanted to 
carry track and field on his back,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wanted to bring sprinting back to America, and  
within one year he did (winning the world 100-meter title in 1997), 
and in two years he brought the record back to America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Greene has improved on and off the track since taking  
the '97 gold in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a lot more confident in himself,'' Smith said. ``He knows  
now when he puts himself out there he can accomplish his goals. 
He's a mature competitor. He takes the sport seriously. He feels 
his responsibility is to carry his weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Greene's greatest assets, Smith said, is rising to the  
occasion at the big meets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's able to push the elevator and go up to a different floor  
every time,'' Smith said. ``I've seen him go higher, higher and 
higher. He's a wonderful architect. I'd like to know how he does 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' Ankiel To Finally Make Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals have decided the future  
is now for Rick Ankiel. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, general manager Walt Jocketty said he was  
not going to rush Ankiel, a second-round draft pick in 1997 who 
turned 20 last month but has one of the most promising arms in 
baseball. Then he went 6-0 with an 0.91 ERA at Double-A Arkansas, 
and St. Louis promoted him to Triple-A Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching Ankiel throw six innings of one-hit ball Monday,  
Jocketty had seen enough that he can't wait for September to bring 
him up with the rest of the minor-league callups. Ankiel, who was 
7-3 with a 3.16 ERA in 16 starts for Memphis, will make his first 
major-league start Tuesday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few days, we decided to kind of speed the process up  
a little,'' Jocketty said.

	Jocketty said the main reason Ankiel is getting an earlier look  
is the demotion of Jose Jimenez, who was been a disappointment 
after his no-hitter and two-hitter against Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about it at length with our minor-league personnel  
after I saw him pitch,'' Jocketty said. ``We just decided since we 
were making the change with Jimenez, we would bring Rick up now and 
give him an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's no coincidence that Ankiel's debut will come on the road,  
in low-key Montreal to cut down on pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ankiel had 119 strikeouts in 88 1-3 innings at Memphis. Last  
year he had 222 strikeouts at Peoria and Prince William, both Class 
A teams, leading all minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really going to get too much attention,'' manager Tony La  
Russa said. ``But I'm really going to be oblivious, and so will 
(pitching coach) Dave Duncan to popular opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to watch this young man and do what's best for  
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jocketty told it, Ankiel likely will be with the  
Cardinals for the rest of the season. But to La Russa's way of 
thinking, it all depends on how Ankiel does. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he struggles, he's out of there,'' La Russa said. ``Mostly,  
we have a spot in the rotation. We're not forcing anybody out. You 
look at the candidates and he's the guy that gives us the best 
chance to win, so we'll give him a start and then we'll see if he 
pitches well enough to get another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ankiel will be the Cardinals' youngest pitcher to make his debut  
since Al Hrabosky also broke in at age 20 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Another top prospect, infielder Adam Kennedy, will join the team  
Friday in New York. Kennedy, 23, was the team's No. 1 draft pick in 
1997 and he batted .329 with 10 homers, 62 RBIs and 18 steals in 89 
games at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy also played for the United States' silver medal-winning  
team in the Pan American Games last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be surprised if he doesn't hit in the big leagues,''  
Jocketty said. ``He's hit everywhere he's played. He deserves to 
come up here and show what he can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for the pair on the 40-man roster, the team likely  
will place injured players Darren Bragg and Scott Radinsky on the 
60-day disabled list. Infielder Placido Polanco has been optioned 
to Memphis to make room for Kennedy and a pitcher will be sent down 
to make room for Ankiel. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second demotion in about a month for Polanco, who  
batted .271 with 15 RBIs in 71 games. He was recalled Aug. 1 from 
Memphis.

	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Steve Elkington's mind was at ease  
when he played the International on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington endured a scary medical emergency with his caddy, Joe  
``Gypsy'' Grillo, at last week's PGA championship. About an hour 
before Elkington's scheduled tee time in the first round of the PGA 
last Thursday, Grillo, 48, experienced tightness in his chest, 
couldn't feel his arm and was having difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was feared he had suffered a heart attack, and he was taken  
to a Chicago hospital. Elkington immediately withdrew from the 
tournament and accompanied Grillo to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The diagnosis wasn't as dire.  
</P>
<P>
	``He had an asthmatic seizure,'' Elkington said Thursday. ``He  
passed all the stress tests. His heart is fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gypsy is family. He's a real close friend of mine. I thought  
he was going to die. He wasn't breathing. He was in a lot of 
distress. I thought it was real important to be there with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so shook up I probably couldn't have made a  
two-footer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the crisis is past, Elkington's bag is being lugged  
this week by Jimmy Johnson, a friend from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy caddies for me on and off,'' Elkington said. ``He's  
pinch-hitting this week. Gypsy doesn't caddy for me here normally 
anyway because of his asthma.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------

	 *PICKY NICKY:* Call Nick Price a traditionalist.  
</P>
<P>
	While the majority of his colleagues love the International  
format, a modified Stableford scoring system that rewards birdies 
more than it penalizes bogeys, Price isn't sold. 
</P>
<P>
	A birdie is worth plus-2 points, while a bogey counts minus-1.  
Thus a player in this tournament who fires four birdies and four 
bogeys has 4 points, as opposed to being even par under the 
standard stroke-play format. Other players say they like the break 
in the routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd still prefer it be 72-hole stroke play,'' Price said  
Thursday after scoring 7 points. ``Making a birdie and then making 
a bogey and being 1 point up is not what golf is about, to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price, however, benefited nicely from the format. He received 5  
points for his eagle on the 17th hole. He stands comfortably on the 
leaderboard, whereas in a standard tournament he would have shot a 
modest 1-under-par. 
</P>
<P>
	Price also took a shot at the Jack Nicklaus-designed course.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a couple of goofy holes out there I've never liked on  
the golf course,'' he said. ``You have to hit the ball sky high to 
be able to play them, and I'm generally a pretty low-ball striker, 
so I feel I'm at a disadvantage here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRIO OF TAP-INS:* Mark O'Meara didn't put much pressure on his  
putting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his six birdie putts, three were from a mere 8 inches away.  
</P>
<P>
	He hit an 8-iron to gimme range on the 11th hole, a 9-iron to  
the same distance on the 15th, and chipped to that distance on the 
par-5 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people can handle those,'' O'Meara told the media. ``Even  
you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When several reporters shook their heads in jest, he added,  
``OK, maybe not you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	THIRD AND SHORT:@ David Sutherland made two eagles, on the  
eighth and 14th holes, helping him post a score of 12. ... Perry 
Moss made the best of his good fortune. An alternate, Moss said he 
``found out about 30 minutes before my tee time'' that he was in 
the tournament. He scored 8 points. ... Peter Jacobsen posted 
minus-3 points and subsequently withdrew because of an ankle 
injury. ... Playing the back nine first, Greg Norman scored minus-7 
points on that side, then had plus-7 on the front to finish at 
zero.
