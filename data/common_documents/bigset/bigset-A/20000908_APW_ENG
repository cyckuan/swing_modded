<HEADLINE> Scientists Unearth Mayan Marketplace  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- It was a sprawling Mayan mall, built 24
centuries before there was a Starbucks, a Gap or a food court to
fill it.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan and American scientists working deep in the jungles
of northern Guatemala have discovered ''Cancuen,'' a lost city
that, for more than 1,200 years beginning in 400 B.C., was one of
the most important commercial centers of the Mayan world.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which scientists believe will take 10 years to fully
unearth, features a 270,000-square-foot Mayan palace with three 66
foot-high floors and 170 rooms, making it among one of the most
grandiose Mayan structures ever discovered, National Geographic
Society announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The society is a chief sponsor of the Cancuen excavation
project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started off working with what we thought was a small
palace, part of a small Mayan settlement,'' said Arthur Demerest, a
Vanderbilt University archaeologist and head of the Cancuen
project. ''What we found was a palace 20 times as large as we were
expecting and an important Mayan marketplace that had been
forgotten for almost 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-square-mile city featured a crowded rectangular layout of
heavy stone walls, 11 spacious stone-tiled patios, and buildings
with cubbyhole-like rooms and thick, multileveled roofs.
</P>
<P>
   While Demerest said scientists aren't sure how many Mayan
merchants called Cancuen home, it is thought to have attracted
thousands of traders from nearby highland settlements, including
the majestic city of Tikal, 85 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Cancuen, an ancient Maya word meaning ''Place of the Serpent,''
became a key trading post because it featured a dock on the River
Passion in what today is southern Peten, Guatemala's northernmost
province, Demerest said.
</P>
<P>
   First discovered in 1905 by Austrian explorer Tobert Maler,
scientists and looters ignored the site because it appeared to be
devoid of treasure and artifact-laden temples and burial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''A city that was built only for commercial purposes and not for
religious ones seemed uninteresting to a lot of academics and
worthless to a lot of looters,'' Demerest said. The city is now
overrun with jungle-dwelling animals like howler monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Cancuen was devoid of the breathtaking temples that dominate
Tikal and other Mayan sites because its inhabitants buried their
dead in surrounding highland areas.
</P>
<P>
   Though work at the site has been suspended until next spring
because of the arrival of the seven-month rainy season, scientists
have already recovered dozens of artifacts in nearby mountain
caves.
</P>
<P>
   After its 1905 discovery, Cancuen remained shrouded by a jungle
curtain of mud and dense foliage until 1967 when a group of Harvard
graduate students visited the city for less than a week and brought
back crude sketches of what they thought was waiting to be
discovered there.
</P>
<P>
   Demerest and scientists from Guatemala's City's Valley
University were drawn back to the area in April because
hieroglyphics inscribed in artifacts recovered in Tikal and Dos
Pilas, the ancient Maya's largest commercial center, made reference
to a market place called Cancuen and its powerful fourth-century
B.C. ruler, Tah Chan Wi, or ''Celestial Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederico Fahsen, the foremost Guatemalan authority on
deciphering Mayan hieroglyphics and the Cancuen project's
co-director, said the Cancuen ruler married his daughter to the
king of Dos Pilas, 55 miles to the northeast, to establish
relationships with surrounding settlements rather than go to war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mayan cities have been in constant war, with their
constructions dedicated to the gods and the heavens,'' Fahsen said.
''Here we have exactly the opposite.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Fewer Antibiotics Prescribed  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Doctors and parents apparently are paying
attention to warnings that unnecessary use of antibiotics can be
harmful by creating drug-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors wrote fewer antibiotic prescriptions for children at the
end of the 1990s than at the start of the decade, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our survey suggests that physicians are getting the message
that overuse of antibiotics can be harmful,'' said Linda F. McCaig,
a survey statistician who will present the report to the Infectious
Diseases Society of America this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the CDC and other medical groups began a campaign to
tell doctors and parents that when antibiotics are overused, they
kill harmless bacteria while the resistant bacteria thrive and
multiply.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the focus of the campaign was to educate parents on
what kind of illnesses might be viral and don't need antibiotics.
So maybe more are staying home because they know it's a virus. Or
maybe they don't come in because they know the child wouldn't get
an antibiotic,'' McCaig said.
</P>
<P>
   An annual survey of about 2,500 doctors shows that the
antibiotic prescription rate in the United States dropped 34
percent from 1989-90 to 1997-98 for children under the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was 12 percent when the CDC researchers compared the
rates only for children brought to a doctor's office because of an
earache, bronchitis, sore throat, sinus infection or upper
respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very exciting,'' said Dr. Stuart Levy, president of
the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics and director of
Tufts University's Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug
Resistance. ''The question will be, 'Can it be continued?'''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has estimated that half of all antibiotics prescribed
during visits to doctors' offices are for colds or other viruses,
which cannot be treated by antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   That overuse is considered a major reason that more and more
germs have become resistant to antibiotics over the past decade or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Several antibiotics are now useless against germs they used to
kill. One-quarter of all germs that cause sinus, ear and blood
infections, pneumonia and some kinds of meningitis shrug off two or
more antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Send Jefferies Home  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Gregg Jefferies, bothered by injuries much of the
last two seasons, has been sent home by the Detroit Tigers and may
consider retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies, who turned 33 on Aug. 1, was limited to 70 games last
season because of injuries. On May 30, after playing in 41 games
this season, he went on the 60-day disabled list with a pulled left
hamstring and hasn't played since.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers trainer Russ Miller told Jefferies before Thursday
night's 6-4 loss to the Anaheim Angels that he wasn't getting any
better.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russ told me it's going to take at least three to four months
to heal,'' Jefferies said. ''He said, 'In fairness to you, you've
been sitting three months, so go on home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jefferies was reluctant to leave the Tigers, who have
rebounded from a 5-17 start to push their way into the AL wild card
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them, 'Look, if you want me to stay here, I will do
whatever you want me to do,''' Jefferies said.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Phil Garner told Jefferies he would be better off
back home in Pleasanton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a part of him that wanted me to stay, but he
knew,'' Jefferies said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies has bounced back from injuries in the past. He missed
52 games in 1996 with a torn ligament in his left thumb. Yet he
managed to play 104 games that season, and hit .292.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his limited playing time, Jefferies went out of his way
to say how much he enjoyed playing for Garner, who became the
Detroit manager during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was pretty unbelievable,'' Jefferies said. ''I get pretty
emotional when I talk about him. He's the best I've ever played
under.
</P>
<P>
   ''Phil treated me like the years I had. Last year, to me,
doesn't seem like it happened. He erased all that. He gave me my
respect back, which is so key to a player. It's pretty emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he retire?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if my legs will handle it anymore,'' Jefferies
said. ''I tore two hamstrings just running. So, we'll see.''

Philippine Hostage Release Delayed

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Negotiators delayed their departure Friday for
a southern Philippine island after new snags threatened to stop Muslim rebels
from releasing all six Europeans they are still holding. They blamed the delay
on plane problems. Earlier, however, an official close to the negotiating team
said Libyan officials had brought only $4 million in ransom money, or enough to
pay for the release of only four of the hostages. The Abu Sayyaf rebels had
earlier pledged to free all six on Friday.

assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan two years ago. The Keenans' attorney, Morris

Butler: Annan Hindered U.N. Program

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan set in motion a process
in 1998 that contributed to the eventual breakdown of the U.N. weapons
inspection program, a former chief of the program said tonight. ''Did he harm
our operation? Yes,'' said Richard Butler, the Australian who once headed the
now-defunct U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM. Speaking to a gathering at
the American Enterprise Institute, Butler said the turning point occurred when
Annan sent three envoys to Baghdad to discuss the Security Council resolutions
on Iraq that were passed after the Persian Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Report: Brown and White Panda Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- The world's only brown and white panda living in
captivity has died at the age of 29, China's official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The panda, named Dan Dan by her caretakers, had been ailing for
years with cataracts and other health problems and was diagnosed
with cancer in May, Xinhua reported late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Her condition deteriorated on Sept. 1 when she began suffering
spasms and became unable to stand or eat, and she died Thursday
after falling into a coma, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dan was discovered in Foping county in central Shaanxi
province in 1985 and had lived ever since in a zoo in the central
city of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   Although her coat was an unusual brown and white, she gave birth
in 1989 to a male cub, Qin Qin, that was black and white, the
panda's typical coloration.
</P>
<P>
   The giant panda is indigenous only to China and about 1,000 of
the animals remain in the wild, scattered through reserves in the
western and central provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
   China has made strenuous efforts to preserve what have virtually
become national emblems. They continue to be threatened, however,
by loss of habitat, poaching and the animal's low reproductive
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Zoologists from China's giant panda breeding research center in
western Sichuan province took samples of skin, internal organs and
other tissue from the dead panda for genetic research, Xinhua said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Runner Killed in Acident  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A Nigerian runner who had been training
with his nation's Olympic team was struck by a car and killed
Thursday night in southwestern Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Hyginus Anugo, 22, a promising 200- and 400-meter runner who had
participated in the World Junior Championships in 1996 in Sydney,
was hit as he crossed a street, the official Olympic News Service
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a very quiet person, an easy-going person,'' Nigerian
coach Brown Ebewele told the Japanese news agency Kyodo. ''When the
news got to us, everybody was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's Channel Seven television said Anugo was killed while
running to catch a bus, but the Kyodo reported Anugo was killed
while heading back to his room at Southern Cross Bible College.
</P>
<P>
   New South Wales police confirmed a man had been struck by a car
and killed, but would not release any additional details until
relatives had been notified.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, said
Anugo did not have Olympic accreditation and was not staying at the
Olympic athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
   Anugo was with the team in Adelaide, in south-central Australia,
where final selections for relay squads were made. Anugo was not
selected after failing to finish in the top six in a recent team
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nigerians brought a few more athletes than had qualified
(for the Olympics),'' Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's high commissioner in Australia, Rufai Soule, flew to
Sydney from Canberra to get information from authorities about the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
sent a condolence note Friday to the Nigerian team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president expressed his sympathy and expressed the
sympathy of the IOC to the national Olympic committee of Nigeria
and the family of the athlete who was killed tragically last
night,'' said IOC director-general Francois Carrard.
</P>
<P>
   New South Wales Premier Bob Carr said his thoughts were with
Anugo's teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We grieve with them as they do about the death of someone
drawn to Sydney by this huge event, the Olympics,'' Carr said. ''We
think of all the time that he put in his training and all that he
may have expected to achieve in Sydney.''

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rules Out Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Yasser Arafat seems very much concerned
with his place in history these days.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old former guerrilla chief, who has led the
Palestinians through four turbulent decades -- from exile and
conflict to the brink of statehood -- was faced with perhaps the
most difficult decision of his political life during this week's
Mideast consultations on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting on full control over all of east Jerusalem, including
major Islamic shrines, might cost him the state he has so long
fought for. Compromise could earn him the label of traitor in much
of the Arab and Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made it clear Thursday that despite strong pressure from
President Clinton himself, he would not budge on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to remember, you are speaking to Yasser Arafat,'' the
Palestinian leader, wearing his trademark military-style olive
green pants and jacket, admonished a CNN interviewer when asked if
he would compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will continue to liberate all the Islamic and Muslim holy
places,'' Arafat said with growing agitation, his voice rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''If not, another one will come to liberate them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said he simply did not have a mandate to relinquish
Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem's walled Old City, or
share sovereignty there with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't betray my people. I can't betray the Arabs. I can't
betray the Christians. I can't betray the Muslims,'' Arafat said
adamantly.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bluster might be tactical. Arafat is a skilled,
experienced negotiator, who has logged long hours with Israeli
prime ministers and is known to sometimes use theatrics to confuse
an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said Thursday that negotiations would continue, and he
hoped talks would focus not only on Jerusalem, but on other key
issues such as the future borders of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He said he paid little heed to being publicly blamed by the
United States for the deadlock in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not on my mind. It is part of the mass media
propaganda,'' he said. ''As I have mentioned, I have respect for
President Clinton, for what he is doing.''

<HEADLINE> Mideast Negotiators To Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With an eye on the calendar, President
Clinton sent Israeli and Palestinian negotiators back to work after
they failed to reach agreement on how to share Jerusalem holy sites
despite his personal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimism prevailed, however. U.S. officials said only a few
weeks remained to secure a treaty, and the second-tier negotiators
who are to reconvene in the coming days in the Middle East have not
scored many achievements in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Clinton's mediation effort during this week's
U.N. Millennium Summit was the fate of a 36-acre walled compound in
Jerusalem's Old City. It is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount,
the site of their former Temples, and by Muslims as Haram
as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, with two mosques marking the spot
where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has proposed complex sovereignty arrangements
to accommodate rival Israeli and Palestinian claims, including
placing some areas under divine sovereignty to enable both sides to
save face in accepting the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday he was willing
to contemplate U.S. ideas, provided Arafat was willing to
reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said no Israeli prime minister would ever accept
Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount -- ''a cornerstone of
our identity'' -- but suggested he would not necessarily insist on
full Israeli control over the sacred compound.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in turn, said anything less than full Palestinian
sovereignty over all of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem,
including the Old City and its Muslim and Christian holy sites, was
out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't betray my people. I can't betray the Arabs. I can't
betray the Christians. I can't betray the Muslims,'' Arafat told
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for the first time, revealed specifics of a U.S. proposal
made at the Mideast summit in July at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. presidential retreat, he said, Clinton suggested
either postponing agreement on all of Jerusalem by one or two
years, or on the Old City by 15 years, while trying to reach an
accord on the remaining issues such as borders of a Palestinian
state and the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''After quite painful hesitation, we were ready to say that we
are ready to contemplate it,'' Barak said, adding that the
Palestinians rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat bristled at accusations that he was to blame for the
deadlock, saying he was holding out for the legitimate rights of
his people.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said he felt it had been a
mistake to focus on the hardest dispute, over the holy sites.
Negotiators will now try to make progress on the other issues, such
as land, refugees and borders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we finish four out of five (issues), we will go armed with
this success,'' he said. ''Isn't it much better than leaving
everything to failure?''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said both sides promised
to work hard, adding that Clinton would be available to the
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the truth is, just look at the calendar,'' she said.
''There is not a lot of time. And I think we are talking about the
fact that there are a relative number of weeks here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak noted that the U.S. Congress, which would have to approve
billions of dollars in funding for a peace treaty, will adjourn in
early October.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader faces his own deadline. The Israeli
parliament, increasingly hostile to Barak's peace policies,
reconvenes at the end of October -- and may have enough votes by
then to topple him.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was to leave Friday for the Gaza Strip to lead a PLO
meeting that will decide whether to proclaim a state on Wednesday,
the deadline for a peace treaty, or set a new date.
</P>
<P>
   A postponement is likely, since Arafat has been cautioned by
many world leaders at the U.N. summit that unilateral steps would
harm peace prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Arafat should expect to get a worse deal, not a
better one, by playing for time. ''I don't believe President
Clinton or the Israeli government will be able to negotiate under
the same terms two months from now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giants 13, Padres 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his fifth homer in four
games and drove in three runs as the San Francisco Giants beat San
Diego 13-0 Thursday night for their season-high ninth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks added a three-run homer to give him 1,002 RBIs for
his career, and Shawn Estes pitched seven shutout innings to win
his ninth game in his last 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Estes (14-4), who leads the majors in run support, gave up five
hits, walked one and struck out eight. He has beaten the Padres
seven times in his career, his most victories against any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants extended their lead in the NL West Division over
second-place Arizona to a season-high 8&AMP;frac12; games, the largest lead
San Francisco has had in September since a nine-game edge over
Cincinnati on Sept. 19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard led off the third inning with a double, and Bonds
hit Matt Clement's 1-0 pitch out for his 44th homer of the season,
giving the Giants a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added another run in the fifth. Bill Mueller and
Bonds walked to open the inning. One out later, J.T. Snow singled
into right field to score Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' 22nd homer of the season highlighted an eight-run sixth
for the Giants. Bobby Estalella led off with a walk. After Estes
sacrificed him to second, Benard singled him home. Mueller's single
ended Clement's night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Erdos was summoned to face Bonds, who drove in Benard with
an infield grounder. Jeff Kent and Snow followed with run-scoring
singles and Burks then hit a 2-2 pitch from Erdos into the left
field bleachers. Estalella capped the scoring with his 14th homer
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (12-14) allowed six runs on seven hits in 5 1-3 innings
as the Padres had their three-game winning streak stopped. Clement,
who struck out five and walked six, is 1-4 in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Rios and Juan Melo each singled home a run in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Padres' INF Gabe Alvarez was recalled from Las Vegas of the
PCL before the game. ... Clement, who leads the NL with 22 wild
pitches, is the only Padres starter not to miss a start this
season. ... Greg LaRocca became the 10th player to make his major
league debut with the Padres this season. He singled in the fifth.
... San Diego 3B Phil Nevin missed the game with a lower abdominal
strain. ... Estes leads the majors with 38 double plays induced.
... Bonds hit his 52nd career homer against the Padres. He's only
hit more against the Phillies (56). ... The Giants have 200 homers,
their most since 205 in 1987. ... The Padres tied a NL mark (Mets
in 1967, Phillies in 1996) by using their 53rd (LaRocca) and 54th
(Alvarez) different player of the year.

<HEADLINE> France Fuel Protest Widening  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Throughout France, a crippling nationwide protest
over high fuel prices is forcing drivers to go to extremes for
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   At a Shell station in Paris on Thursday, businessman Louis
Chevalier filled two plastic containers with gas, a favor for a
colleague visiting from the central city of Tours, where it is
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's taking them back with him on the train tonight,''
Chevalier said.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by French truckers was entering its fifth day
Friday. After they sealed off the roads to nearly 100 of the
country's oil refineries and fuel depots, many gas stations were
forced to hang ''empty'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Senior government ministers, hoping to keep the movement from
snowballing, warned protesters to end their blockades before they
hurt France's newly healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we let things go on, that could break the process of growth
and development that's going on in our country,'' Transport
Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot told RTL radio.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations began quietly in August, with fishermen
blocking a few ports to protest rising fuel costs. After the
government offered them financial help, truckers began calling for
attention, and farmers and taxi drivers added their voices to the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   In northern France on Thursday, farmers in more than 50 tractors
blocked all freight access to the Channel Tunnel, preventing trucks
from boarding trains to Britain, said Vincent Fournier, an activist
with the FNSEA union.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, about 150 farmers and truck drivers protesting the
high cost of fuel blockaded the entrance to a Shell Oil refinery in
northwest England early Friday. They refused to let trucks pass
into or out of the refinery at Ellesmere Port, south of Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   The French government had offered to give truckers a 5-cent
reimbursement per liter of fuel this year, and a 3.5-cent refund
per liter on gasoline taxes next year.
</P>
<P>
   After most truckers rejected the offer Wednesday, Socialist
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said the government would go ''no
further'' and ruled out future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, in New York at the U.N. Millennium
Summit, called Thursday for a rapid end to the protests and said
oil-producing nations should be aware of the harm that high prices
can cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are aware there's a problem,'' he said. ''It's world
growth that is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   World oil prices have more than tripled since hitting a 12-year
low of less than $11 a barrel in December 1998, before the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries slashed production to
force prices higher.

Atlantis Fueled For Morning Liftoff

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis was fueled early Friday
for liftoff on a mission to furnish the growing international space station.
Forecasters said rain and low clouds could scuttle the 8:45 a.m. launch. Because
of the extremely short launch window -- just a few minutes -- the weather had to
be good from the outset. Atlantis' 11-day voyage will be the first shuttle
flight in almost four months and the start of what NASA hopes will be a
rapid-fire series of missions to the space station. The seven astronauts and
cosmonauts will be the first to float into the space station's new Russian-made

<HEADLINE> Newport's Cliff Walk Needs Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- The historic trail that hugs Newport's
craggy coastline offers views of crashing waves on one side and of
some of the city's grandest estates on the other.
</P>
<P>
   But years of neglect and storm damage have chipped away at the
terrain, making portions of the 3.5-mile Cliff Walk perilous for
pedestrians. Now, a city commission is trying to raise as much as
$20 million to save the popular trail that is visited by 250,000
tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are whole areas of the walk that are practically
impassable, with tremendous erosion problems,'' said Laurence
Cutler, head of the newly revived Cliff Walk commission.
</P>
<P>
   The city, state and federal government have long trumpeted the
trail's historic and environmental significance, but no one has
taken responsibility for the pathway since it is unclear who owns
it.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the trail predate Colonial times, when the earliest
settlers needed access to the ocean. More was built in the late
1800s, as the area grew in popularity as a retreat for the
Vanderbilts, Astors and others among the nation's wealthiest
families. Several mansions on famed Bellevue Avenue overlook the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is private property through which a public walk goes,''
Cutler said. ''It's extraordinarily unique.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has paid to repair some storm damage over the
years, and in 1975, the walk was designated a National Recreation
Trail. But there has been little ongoing maintenance, aside from
some individual efforts, such as volunteers who collect trash.
</P>
<P>
   Some sections are crumbling. Another often floods. A tunnel
through one part is pitch dark and damp.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, three people have died after falling off the walk,
and several others have been seriously hurt, including a New York
man who fell 14 feet and became wedged between two rocks last
month.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit over a 1991 fatal accident convinced Mayor Richard
Sardella to revive the long-dormant commission. He asked Cutler, a
former Harvard University professor of architecture and urban
design, to lead the group.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Michael Cain, a college student, sued over his
fatal fall, saying the city, state and a university with property
along the path were responsible. Cain's family lost, but a dissent
by a state Supreme Court justice sent a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The record ... is replete with evidence that every defendant,
for more than a decade before Cain's tragic death, had knowledge of
the extremely dangerous conditions on Cliff Walk, yet did
nothing,'' the justice wrote. ''I do not believe that one can hold
out an implicit invitation to visit a tourist attraction ... then
seek to escape liability to those who have accepted the invitation
and are injured or killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler envisions improvements such as building separate trails
geared to tourists, hikers and people interested in the walk's
history. Signs telling people where to enter and exit, along with
more trash barrels and portable toilets would also make the walk
more tourist-friendly, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   But before any restoration can begin, the city must resolve
local differences over what the walk should be. There is also the
challenge of figuring out how to pay for such a project; last
month, U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., toured the walk to
highlight the need for federal funding for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many property owners along the trail who have complained about
littering and vandalism want it left as is, fearing an upgrade
could bring more tourists. But city leaders believe these concerns
can be addressed, while also solving the broader public safety
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Without some action, Cutler feels the pathway he describes as
the city's ''jewel'' could be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Cogliano and fiance Matthew Marra, from New York City, were
drawn to the walk by a relative of Cogliano's who recently visited.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you read about Newport, it always mentions Cliff
Walk,'' Cogliano said. ''It has a spectacular view of the ocean and
an ocean view of the mansions.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Hammer, chairman of the city Planning Board, volunteers
collecting trash on the Cliff Walk and hopes repairs can be done
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The walk is one of the things that makes Newport what it is,''
Hammer said.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Mood Lifting After Summer  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Greg Simon, a senior policy adviser in Al Gore's
presidential campaign, bounded into the back of Air Force Two,
spread his arms and burst into song.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where is their drug plan, the country wonders,'' he sang to
the tune of the title song to the musical smash ''Evita.''
</P>
<P>
   With two months until the Nov. 7 election, the mood in Gore's
campaign is distinctly upbeat. The candidate and his top aides
think they are on a roll, and polls suggest Gore has gained ground
in his fight with Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore's got that spring in his step because he's seeing the
doors to the White House swinging open,'' said Larry Sabato, a
University of Virginia political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gore faced criticism that he's stiff and programmed,
but that's slowly changing. As he has gained in the polls, he has
become more confident and upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his arrival Thursday night at a rain-soaked New Orleans
rally before an adoring mob of 10,000, Gore told reporters he'd
felt a lift in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having fun ... there's been a real surge of energy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging through the battleground of Michigan on Wednesday, Gore
headed to Comerica Park where the Detroit Tigers had a game. He
strode onto the field during batting practice and reporters shouted
at him to throw a few pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way,'' Gore responded. Within minutes, the jacket was off
and Gore was perched on the mound, working up a sweat throwing
pitches and bouncing the first one off the batter's leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has reason to be optimistic,'' said Andrew Kohut, of the
Pew Center for People and the Press. ''In the polls I've seen he's
made real progress. Only a month and a half ago he was 19 points
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's summertime surge is generally dated to the week before
the Democratic National Convention, when he picked Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   He's also engaged Bush on a series of topics, ranging from
health care to the robust economy -- all issues where polls suggest
voters are receptive to the vice president's message.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he successfully launched that at his convention,''
said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute of Public
Opinion. ''Bush seems to be content with his father's
administration as cover. I'm convinced that in the end you've to be
your own person.''
</P>
<P>
   These factors have combined to allow Gore to define himself
apart from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Historically, vice presidents always emerge on their own, it's
just a question of when,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''He's done
that earlier than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that the changing dynamic of the race has
shifted perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before the convention, the consensus was it was Bush's (race)
to lose,'' said Sabato. ''The consensus has flipped 180 degrees.
It's now Gore's to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Bush promised Thursday to retool his campaign. The
changes include a new slogan, ''Real plans for real people,'' and
far more interaction with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane argued that voters paying only scant attention to the
election tend to be swayed by personalities, but ultimately make a
decision based on their self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately people will come back to the issues,'' he said,
offering a cautionary note. ''You have to remember that all these
polls show this is a very, very close election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were virtually tied in two surveys of likely
voters released Thursday. Gore had a 47 percent to 44 percent edge
in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, and the two were tied at 47 percent
in an ABC-Washington Post survey -- both win the margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said Gore also has been helped by a Bush campaign that
seems to have been distracted by a series of side issues, including
the ongoing debate over debates with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors work in Gore's favor, too.
</P>
<P>
   The robust economy is an advantage for the incumbent. Gore also
has all the tools of the White House at his disposal. With each
policy announcement, campaign aides trot out prominent Cabinet
officials to argue Gore's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could all change tomorrow, but Bush is going to have become
a dynamo and I don't see much evidence that he's a dynamo,'' said
Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   He said the primary strength of Bush's campaign has been a sense
that he was certain to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you take away the inevitability factor from Bush there
isn't a lot there,'' said Sabato.

<HEADLINE> U.N. To Make Peacekeeping Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Chastened by U.N. failures around the
globe, the leaders of the Security Council used the Millennium
Summit to promise an overhaul of U.N. peacekeeping operations so
troops can respond more quickly and robustly to world trouble
spots.
</P>
<P>
   The pronouncement, however, was not in the typical form of a
Security Council resolution -- an indication that the 15 presidents
and prime ministers weren't entirely comfortable with making such
concrete, legally binding pledges to better finance peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the document will nevertheless be one of the major outcomes
of the summit, which concludes Friday with the adoption by the
whole U.N. membership of a statement on the role of the United
Nations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of documents, position papers and texts told only
part of the summit's story that featured a notable first -- a chat
and handshake between President Clinton and Cuban President Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Another summit legacy will be the apparent failure to reach a
Mideast peace deal. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
rejected Clinton's proposal to split control of Muslim and Jewish
holy sites in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-day meeting, which clogged New York City streets
with motorcades and protests, will likely be hailed as a success
merely for having occurred, drawing more leaders together than ever
before to discuss the challenges confronting the globe in the third
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the point of stepping foot on Mars if there is still
hunger in several regions of our planet?'' asked Rene Preval, the
president of Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions were raised throughout the second day of speeches
Thursday and were likely to continue on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the issue of the disparities between rich and
poor in his address to the council, saying it must address broader
security issues related to disease, poverty, education and climate
change if it wants to make a change in keeping the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we confront the iron link between deprivation, disease
and war, we will never be able to create the peace that the
founders of the United Nations dreamed of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The world body is currently engaged in 14 peacekeeping
operations -- most of them in the world's poorest countries -- with
more than 37,000 troops and civilian police deployed from East
Timor to Cyprus and Sierra Leone at an annual cost of about $2.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 U.N. civilian staff are engaged in 14 other
political and peace-building missions from Afghanistan to Burundi
and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Council members met against a sobering backdrop: the killing of
three U.N. relief workers assisting refugees from East Timor; the
rebel seizure of 500 U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone; highly
critical reports of the U.N. role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and
the 1995 slaughter of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the two-hour meeting, the council leaders -- from
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France, Jamaica, Malaysia,
Mali, Namibia, Netherlands, Russia, Tunisia, Ukraine, Britain and
the United States -- vowed ''to strengthen the central role of the
United Nations in peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   They underlined the importance of rapid deployment of U.N.
peacekeepers and called for realistic mandates that the soldiers
can fulfill, proper training and equipment for them, and an
overhaul of the U.N. peacekeeping department.
</P>
<P>
   But their proclamation wasn't in resolution form. A
one-paragraph resolution was adopted, but it said only that the
council ''decides to adopt'' the attached annex, which contained
the text of the council pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats were divided on whether the annex itself was legally
binding. It was a compromise after more than a week of closed-door
negotiation. Council diplomats said several countries couldn't
agree to make such specific pledges in a full-fledged resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than watering down the resolution to be palatable to all,
they decided to adopt the declaration as an annex to a resolution,
the diplomats said.

<HEADLINE> Farmer dumps, donates eggs to protest low prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIDDLETOWN, Md. (AP) - A Western Maryland farmer said he has
dumped or sold at far below cost more than 12,000 eggs this week to
dramatize a steep drop in farm prices.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Sowers said he would rather trash the eggs than sell them
to a processor for as little as 6 cents a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like wasting food,'' he said, tossing a tray of 30
eggs into a huge manure pit on his egg-and-dairy farm near
Middletown. ''We're not planning on throwing them away if I can
give them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sowers is selling small eggs off his farm for 10 cents a dozen,
which he said is 30 cents below his production cost. He said he has
sold about 12,000 eggs and dumped 1,200 since beginning his protest
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There is scant demand for small eggs, according to the United
Egg Producers, a national cooperative based in Atlanta. But even
Grade A large eggs, the type favored by consumers, have dropped
from 60 cents to 48 cents a dozen nationally since 1998 while
retail prices have held fairly steady, spokeswoman Billie Jo Corell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brown, vice president of Urner Barry Publications Inc.,
a Toms River, N.J., firm that quotes egg prices for the national
market, blamed overproduction, especially in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole industry is under a lot of pressure from the
corporate farms,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Sowers is not dumping large eggs. He said he has a lot of small
eggs because many of his 106,000 chickens have not yet grown big
enough to produce large eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said throwing away eggs has some logic, since a 1 percent
shift in supply can affect the regional price by 5 percent or more.
''He may make a difference in his neighborhood,'' Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Promises Changed Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- George W. Bush is giving his embattled
campaign a face-lift, with a new slogan, more interaction with
voters and, perhaps, retired Gen. Colin Powell at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from brief, stock speeches came after the Texas
governor was pelted Thursday with unsolicited advice from
establishment Republicans worried that he had ceded too much
momentum to Democratic presidential rival Al Gore. He sought to
reassure them by acknowledging the need to retool the campaign and
casting himself as the underdog against an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   But he also suggested the complainers are fair-weather friends,
few in number and ''ready to jump out of the foxhole before the
first shell is fired.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's Washington. I'm used to that kind of politics out of
Washington,'' Bush, shrugging, told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, criticism of his record-breaking $100 million
campaign piled up.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a single one of us that's not discouraged,'' said
Tom Slade, a former Florida legislator and state GOP chairman. ''We
had a 15, 20 point lead. We were just whistling down the street,
and now we're whistling past the graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also conceded that some changes were in order. ''We're
listening,'' Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. ''We know it is
well intentioned. Republicans want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wants more town hall meetings -- a format
trademarked by former GOP rival John McCain and used heavily by
Gore to his advantage. Bush also signaled new flexibility on
presidential debates. While saying he preferred his own schedule,
he no longer appeared wedded to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want there to be debates,'' he said. ''There will be
debates. I'm confident there will be debates. As to what they look
like and where they are, it'll be worked out in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he was wrapping up a five-day swing across
battleground states with stops here and in Springfield, Mo., to
talk about Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was to spend the weekend at his Texas ranch before his
proposed -- but increasingly unlikely -- debate Tuesday with Gore.
The vice president has refused to accept Bush's proposal until he
agrees to the three debates proposed by the Commission on
Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Bush strategist, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the campaign miscalculated by assuming Gore would be condemned
for reneging on a pledge to debate ''anywhere, anytime.'' Instead,
Bush was accused of ducking debates by substituting NBC and CNN
sessions for two of the three offered by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Bush suggested he might spend less time
talking to reporters and more time in front of audiences. Hughes
said he would do more retail politicking with voters in places like
coffee shops and cafeterias, rather than his practice of delivering
stock speeches before GOP activists.
</P>
<P>
   And a campaign official suggested the popular Powell, who
appeared with Bush in Michigan and Ohio on Thursday, might make a
return appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the retooling included the introduction of a new
slogan, ''Real Plans for Real People.'' The move recalls the last
major overhaul of Bush's campaign after he lost New Hampshire's GOP
primary and abruptly rolled out a ''Reformer with Results'' slogan
to counter McCain's maverick image.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also said the changes include the offering Republican
governors -- mostly from battleground states -- for Sunday talk-show
interviews instead of campaign officials like herself.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush allies in the GOP plan to air a new ad, with the
campaign's approval, reminding voters of the 1996 campaign
fund-raising scandals and questioning Gore's education agenda,
sources familiar with discussions about the spot said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Poll: In Sum, Gore, Bush Close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential race remains very close,
according to two new polls, but Al Gore has gained an advantage
over George W. Bush on top issues such as the economy, education
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore and Republican Bush were virtually tied in the two
new polls released Thursday. Gore had 47 percent to 44 percent for
Bush among likely voters in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Both
candidates were tied at 47 percent in an ABC-Washington Post poll
of likely voters. Bush led Gore in polls taken before the two
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have got to understand it's going to be a tight race,''
Bush said in Detroit amid reports that Republicans are growing
nervous about his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore both had about nine of 10 votes from their own
parties and were about split among independents in the CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   When people were asked whether they would vote for the Democrat
or Republican candidate in their congressional district, they split
at 46 percent for each party. The congressional split was about as
close in the ABC-Washington Post poll.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-Washington Post poll shows Gore has opened up a 50-38
advantage on education, and has a slight edge on managing the
economy and Social Security. Gore has double-digit leads on
improving the health care system and protecting the environment.
Bush has an edge on holding down taxes and handling national
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bush retains an advantage on perceptions of his strong
leadership and more appealing personality. But Gore has erased
Bush's advantage on trust, leaving the two even on that quality.
Bush, of late, has questioned Gore's trustworthiness on the stump
and in ads. Gore has a healthy lead on the qualities of caring
about the less fortunate and having the knowledge of world affairs
to serve effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led among people who dislike President Clinton personally,
but agree with his policies.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush held about a 20-point lead among men, Gore has opened
up an 18-point lead among women in the ABC-Washington Post poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush had them because he talked about education,'' Gore
pollster Stan Greenberg said of women voters. ''And people were
nervous about (Democrats) because of the last two years (White
House scandal). But Gore made a powerful impression on them at the
Democratic convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 777 likely voters was taken
Monday through Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points. The ABC-Washington Post poll of 810 likely
voters has an error margin of 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Oil Politics Seep Into Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As furnaces fire up against the chill winds of
autumn, Americans face a season of heavy fuel bills and a political
bout over who's to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The blaming started anew Thursday when Republicans, responding
to a 10-year high in oil prices, accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of squandering U.S. influence with oil-producing
nations and standing helpless to protect consumers now.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's Democratic presidential campaign shot back that
Republican rival George W. Bush has no energy policy at all, other
than ''to let his friends in the oil industry drill our wilderness
areas,'' as spokesman Doug Hattaway put it.
</P>
<P>
   From Pennsylvania through the Midwest and to the Pacific
Northwest, many of the nation's most keenly contested states in the
presidential election are also wintry states, where voters could
well feel the double sting of high fuel prices at the pump and in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign sniping aside, those voters were bound to hear
little from the candidates to help them through frigid weather any
time soon, even with fresh predictions from the Energy Department
that home heating oil will cost 30 percent more this winter than it
did last, and natural gas will cost 27 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, President Clinton met Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Abdullah on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit and
pressed the case for oil-producing nations to increase production
and bring down prices. Leaders of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries meet Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to spur domestic exploration and production to make
the United States less dependent on foreign oil. Gore pursues the
same objective through different means -- seeking to curb
consumption by spending more on conservation, energy efficiency and
other forms of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither plan has a quick payoff.
</P>
<P>
   And opportunities are slim to propose a major new program at
this stage of the campaign, now that Bush and Gore have laid out
spending plans and tax cuts consuming most, if not all -- if not
more than all -- of the projected budget surplus over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the candidates offered no immediate fix
for the prospect of steep price increases in oil and natural gas
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Their campaigns merely pointed out Thursday that Gore supported
Clinton's decision in July to stockpile 2 million barrels of
heating oil in the Northeast, and that Bush opposed earlier efforts
by some congressional Republicans to cut federal money to help the
poor heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil stocks currently are about 25 million barrels below
the acceptable range. At the same time, wholesale natural gas
prices have more than doubled from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Spiking gasoline prices in the spring and summer created an
intense stir in the campaign, with Gore raising questions about
possible gouging by the oil companies, Bush blaming the Clinton
administration for being soft on OPEC, and members of Congress
considering -- then dropping -- the idea of scaling back 4.3 cents of
the gasoline tax on each gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's selection of Dick Cheney, a fellow veteran of the oil
business, as running mate led Gore to charge that the Republicans
are in the pocket of that industry, pursuing ''an agenda of rising
gas prices and smog-filled skies that is of Big Oil, by Big Oil and
for Big Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans resumed their attack Thursday, saying the
administration has frittered away the influence and good will the
United States had with oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait after the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ''That neglect and failure of leadership is now bringing the
inevitable consequences: higher prices for families who need to
heat their homes this winter, coupled with higher prices at the gas
pump,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said the gist of the Clinton-Gore energy policy seems to be:
''SUV owners -- drop dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles generally get poor gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Gore ''has a real energy policy that would make a
difference for consumers, keep down oil prices and clean up our
air.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes tax breaks to help consumers buy an upcoming
generation of fuel-efficient vehicles -- including SUVs -- as well as
incentives for energy efficient homes and cleaner power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposals include allowing drilling in the coastal strip
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Eligible For Some Funds  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan has cleared the initial hurdles
in the battle to receive $12.6 million in federal campaign funds
earmarked for the Reform Party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members of the Federal Election Commission have
recommended to the panel that Buchanan be preliminarily certified
for the funds. However, at least one commissioner opposed the
proposal, expressing a desire to discuss the matter in public.
Buchanan rival John Hagelin also seeks the federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our understanding that the audit staff of the FEC, with
total support of the general counsel, will be recommending to the
commission that they certify Pat Buchanan to receive the $12.6
million in federal funds,'' Bay Buchanan, the candidate's sister
and campaign chairwoman, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A public hearing on the issue is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the decision, the losing side is certain to appeal in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much of the $12.6 million Buchanan could receive has
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Any FEC action requires votes from four of the six commission
members.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's rival, Hagelin, also has filed documents with the FEC
to claim the $12.6 million. FEC officials are expected to determine
within a week whether he will be eligible for the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party split at its convention in Long Beach, Calif.,
last month, producing Buchanan and Hagelin as dueling nominees for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Thursday, a state judge in California declined to
block Hagelin from campaigning under the party's banner.
</P>
<P>
   A faction of the party aligned with Buchanan had asked Superior
Court Judge James L. Wright to force Hagelin and his loyalists to
immediately stop a broad array of political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Wright refused to do so after meeting privately with lawyers for
both sides. He also turned down their request that he declare a
presidential nominee, but said he would hear arguments in the case
next Wednesday. Attorneys said a ruling could be issued then.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan spokesman K.B. Forbes said the former Republican isn't
a party to the lawsuit, filed by the Reform Party faction aligned
with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan faction had sought an order barring Hagelin and his
allies from portraying Hagelin as the nominee, working to place him
on state ballots, collecting donations, issuing news releases,
operating the party's official Web site and recruiting members.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., refused to
designate a nominee as part of a similar suit brought by the
Buchanan faction, saying he lacked jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Estate Tax Bill Veto Stands  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's offer to provide limited
relief from the estate tax is not swaying Republicans who failed to
override his veto of a bill to abolish the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had their chance. The American people wanted repeal,''
said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ''Playing around with
it so the Democrats can keep more money in Washington -- we're not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   By a 274-157 vote Thursday, the House fell 14 votes short of the
necessary two-thirds margin to override the veto with 431 members
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three Democrats voted with all but one Republican for the
override, compared with 65 Democrats who supported the legislation
in June when it passed 279-136. Thirteen Democrats switched their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the vote and said the 10-year, $105 billion
repeal bill was ''a huge tax cut for the most well-off Americans''
that threatened the nation's economic health and critical
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the congressional leadership is serious about estate tax
relief for small businesses, family farms, and principal residences
of middle-class families that have increased in value, they should
work with me in a fiscally responsible manner as Democrats in
Congress have proposed,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said they would try to resurrect less costly
proposals that would immediately increase inheritance tax
exemptions, including the $675,000 individual exemption, to reduce
its impact on middle-class people, farmers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe we can sit down and reach consensus on some legislation
that would be acceptable,'' said Rep. John Tanner, D-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP sponsors said they would settle for nothing less than
full repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one way to rid the code of this immoral, unfair
and economically unsound tax, and that's to eliminate it,'' said
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a clear House majority favored repeal and polls show
many Americans believe the tax is inherently unfair, Democrats said
just as many people want Congress to focus on paying down public
debt, improving education and creating a Medicare prescription drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also portrayed the bill as a giveaway to wealthy
families -- only about 2 percent of estates owe the tax each year --
and only one part of a huge GOP tax cut that would consume too much
of the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never have so many spent so much time to give so much money to
so very few,'' said House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that the veto by Clinton, and by extension
Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, was another signal that
Democrats want to spend the surplus on more federal government
programs instead of returning a portion to taxpayers. Republican
nominee George W. Bush favors repealing the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say to the president: This veto does not mean that money is
now available for Washington spending,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill. ''We will not use it to expand government.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors also took issue with the Democratic characterization of
the estate tax as primarily benefitting the rich, contending that
it forces millions of middle-class people to spend thousands of
dollars on insurance and estate planning and threatens jobs of
people when businesses and farms are broken up to pay the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death tax has given purgatory a new meaning,'' said Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee. ''Death as an event should not trigger a tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore both called wavering Democrats to shore up
support for the veto, House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats voted for repeal in June but opted to sustain
the president's veto and kill the bill this time: California's Joe
Baca, Anna Eshoo, Sam Farr, Tom Lantos, and Zoe Lofgren; Colorado's
Mark Udall; Florida's Allen Boyd and Peter Deutsch; Maryland's
Albert Wynn; New Jersey's William Pascrell; New York's Mike McNulty
and Nydia Velazquez, and Virginia's Jim Moran.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 8.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman, who says he's a ''truth
teller,'' not an ''attack dog'' critic of the Republicans, came to
George W. Bush's Texas to raise anew the Democrats' contention that
Bush has failed to provide health care for millions of children.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush's running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney laid his own campaign plans for Lieberman's home state of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Connecticut senator and vice presidential running
mate of Al Gore, planned to meet Friday in Houston with Texas
families, some of whom have struggled to get health care services
for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking aboard his plane en route to Houston, Lieberman said:
''We're going to talk about children's health care and particularly
about our plan'' to extend health insurance to all children by the
year 2005. Asked whether he would point out that some 1.4 million
Texas children lack health insurance, he said, ''It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has said repeatedly that he sees himself not so much
in the ''attack dog'' role traditionally taken by some vice
presidential candidates as in the role of ''truth teller.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge recently ordered Texas to improve its Medicaid
program, ruling that too many low-income families were not getting
the care they need despite a 1996 agreement in which the state
promised to make major improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, has said his government is performing
well on the matter and that the court order was the work of a
liberal, activist judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee this week began airing
television commercials pointing to the federal court order and
saying, ''Bush's record: It's becoming an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman planned to return to Texas on Monday with stops in
Austin and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in turn, was to campaign Friday in the senator's home
state, appearing at a senior citizens community in Shelton to talk
about Medicare and prescription drug coverage. Later, Cheney was
attending a Republican fund-raiser in Greenwich.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Cautions on Playing Politics  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen urged the
nation's top military leaders to speak honestly about strains on
combat readiness but not ''beat the drum'' in hopes of fattening
their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen delivered the message in a private meeting with the chiefs
of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines as well as the commanders
in chief of the major warfighting commands around the world,
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Acknowledging that this is a tricky political time, (he) said
to them that he expected them to play straight on the readiness
issue, to give the facts, not to beat the drum with a tin cup in
hand to try to generate more pressure for defense spending, but, on
the other hand, to talk honestly about pressures they face,'' Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The service chiefs are scheduled to testify before the Senate
Armed Services Committee on Sept. 27 on military readiness, an
issue which Texas Gov. George W. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney
-- who served as defense secretary when Bush's father was president
-- have sought to use against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Bush and Cheney have accused the Clinton
administration of running down the military by sending troops
abroad too often on questionable missions and by spending too
little on replacing older weaponry. The consequence, Bush and
Cheney argue, is a military with low morale, inadequate training
and outdated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Cohen favors a vigorous public debate on military
issues but wants to ensure that it be conducted in a context
recognizing that the United States remains the largest military
power in the world and spends more each year on defense than its
NATO allies combined. Bacon said there is a natural tendency for
military leaders to want bigger budgets, larger forces and more
benefits for their troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enterprising generals and admirals will always find ways, very
good ways, to spend more money,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The service chiefs told Congress earlier this year that current
budgets do not meet all their needs -- particularly for
modernization -- although they have insisted that U.S. forces are
ready to meet their wartime missions.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a Republican who has been defense secretary since the
start of President Clinton's second term, told reporters Wednesday
in Norfolk, Va., that he wanted to keep the military out of the
political debate over readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am determined not to allow the military to be drawn into
this type of political debate during the course of the campaign in
the final two months,'' Cohen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, Bacon was prepared to rebut some of Bush's
charges, including Bush's mention of food stamp use by military
members as evidence that troops need bigger pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, unfortunately, there are members of the armed services on
food stamps,'' Bacon said. ''The good news is that the percentage
of the force on food stamps is far less today than it was when
President Bush was president and Secretary Cheney was the secretary
of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the third year of Bush's term, there were about 19,400
troops on food stamps, representing about 0.9 percent of the total
force, Bacon said. In 1995, that had fallen to 11,900, or 0.8
percent, and today it is 5,100 troops, or 0.4 percent of the force,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Thursday to a Veterans of Foreign Wars gathering in
Detroit, Bush said, ''Having a military ready to fight and win a
war requires a military with high morale. I'm going to work with
Congress to pay our troops more money. I will work with Congress to
make sure our troops are better housed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said the military services cannot meet their
recruiting goals and are stretched so thin on resources that the
Navy ship USS Decatur ''moved out to sea and had to come back
because of a lack of fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Decatur and Bush's charge that it symbolized a
readiness problem, Bacon said the ship returned to port earlier
than scheduled because it completed its training, not because of a
fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think completing your training early qualifies in most
people's minds as a readiness problem,'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Lane To Ease Traffic At Border  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Abigail Fuentes spent 25 minutes waiting to
cross the U.S.-Mexico border and considered herself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've spent an hour, sometimes more sitting in this traffic.
It's the worst,'' said Fuentes, who lives in San Diego but crosses
the border almost daily to visit relatives in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Those long waits should be ending for thousands who regularly
drive through the world's busiest border. A new automated commuter
lane will cut to just two or three minutes the time it takes
prescreened drivers to cross, U.S. and Mexican officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Doris Meissner, was chauffeured through the new commuter
lane to inaugurate the program already in use in El Paso and at the
Otay Mesa crossing east of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters were expected to begin using the lane later in the
day, after they paid an annual fee of $129 and passed an FBI
background check. There's no charge to use the other lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The commuter lane represents a bi-national effort to ease
traffic congestion at the border without sacrificing efforts to
prevent illegal immigrants and contraband from entering the
country, Meissner said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast majority of people who use this port of entry are law
abiding, and we want to facilitate their crossing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Each weekday, an average of 42,000 cars and 30,000 pedestrians
cross from Tijuana to San Diego through the San Ysidro Port of
Entry. The number of cars swells to 65,000 on weekends, and
holidays can bring twice as many, according to the U.S. Customs
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new express lane works like an advanced version of automatic
toll systems used on bridges and roads around the country. When an
enrolled vehicle approaches the border, it sends a signal to an
inspector in the immigration booth and calls up a background file
from a database.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of everyone authorized to cross in that vehicle appears
on a screen, and the inspector can choose to stop the motorist for
questioning or send them to a secondary inspection area. Drivers
must swipe a card through a scanner as a final step to entry.
</P>
<P>
   Most motorists will pass through without a pause, but cars will
be randomly searched for contraband, INS officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters, shoppers, tourists and employees of border businesses
make up the majority of crossers, but San Diego is also a major
center for drug smuggling. Even as Meissner spoke Thursday, customs
agents stopped a vehicle with 74 pounds of marijuana in the tires.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,300 have signed up to use the commuter lane, 70 percent
of whom are American citizens. The others are Mexicans with visas
to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   After 6,000 enroll, U.S. authorities plan to open a second lane.
INS officials expect about 12,000 will use the program.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Bill Advances in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to make China a normal trading
partner permanently is headed for Senate passage next week after
clearing obstacles raised by critics of the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would end Congress' annual debate and
certification of normal trade with China was approved by the House
last May.
</P>
<P>
   It has broad support in the Senate, but also faces amendments
from senators who argue that permanent trade status should be tied
to China improving its human rights and weapons proliferation
records. Backers in turn stress that the approval of amendments
would kill the bill this year, because there wouldn't be time for
the House to consider any changes before this session of Congress
ends next month.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Senate decisively rejected three proposed
amendments. One, offered by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., would have required the president to certify
that the Chinese people were being given religious freedom; a
second by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., mandated that the United
States support the transfer of clean energy technology as part of
energy projects with China; the third, by Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C., retained annual review of U.S.-China trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, who also plans to offer amendments on China's human
rights and labor rights, argued that ''we cannot award China with
PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) while she continues to
harass and jail people because of their religion and beliefs.'' He
lost by a 69-28 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of an amendment-free bill stressed that failure to
pass the bill this year would have serious consequences for
American farmers, businesses and workers.
</P>
<P>
   China, as part of its soon-to-be entry into the World Trade
Organization, has agreed to major cuts in the tariffs it imposes on
foreign goods. The United States can benefit from those WTO-based
cuts only if it gives China permanent normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be shooting ourselves in the foot, to say the
least,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said in opposing the Hollings
amendment to retain annual reviews. ''We Americans would be giving
up all the market-opening benefits that China has agreed to.'' The
Hollings measure went down 81-13.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle remaining before final passage is a possible
amendment by Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., encouraging the imposition of economic sanctions when
China, or another country or company, builds up weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators supported the intent of the Thompson measure but
opposed its attachment to the trade bill. Talks were held Thursday
with the Senate leadership about the possibility of taking up the
Thompson measure as a separate bill after the trade bill is passed,
but there was some opposition and no agreement was reached, Senate
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Peace Efforts Yield Little  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton came to a United Nations
gathering with the promise of his last, best opportunity to press
for Middle East peace. He departs Friday with much smaller gains to
show for three days of statecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, left uncharacteristic holes in his schedule
for Friday in hopes that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak might yet be nudged to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is obviously prepared to be engaged at any
time,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday. ''It's
a floating operation and we're working hard and meeting with
whomever we can in order to try to pursue the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to devote Friday evening to a pursuit he is more
sure of -- raising political money. He will be the draw at a
fund-raising reception among Manhattan dot-com executives, with the
proceeds benefiting Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate bid in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the
last in a parade of world leaders who have sat down with Clinton
during the U.N. Millennium Summit this week.
</P>
<P>
   The China meeting comes as the Senate is poised to vote on a
trade pact that is one of the Clinton administration's highest
priorities during the final few weeks of the legislative session.
Approval would ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, which sets rules for global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bill, already passed by the House, would mean
significantly lower tariffs for Americans selling goods in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in Congress, organized labor and human rights groups
oppose the trade pact on grounds that it could mean an exodus of
U.S. jobs to the cheaper labor market. Some also claim it amounts
to a reward for China for a poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly has pressed Zemin and other Chinese leaders
to address human rights abuses by the country's security apparatus,
and the United States has protested China's crackdown on the Falun
Gong religious sect.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Zemin also comes a week after Clinton announced
he is deferring a decision on whether to build a national missile
defense. China vigorously opposes the shield, calling it a
violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided to leave it to his successor to choose whether
to pursue an anti-missile defense system. Uncertainty over U.S.
intentions hung over Clinton's meeting earlier in the week with
Russian President Vladimir Putin, also a vocal critic of U.S.
pursuit of the shield idea.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. summit represented Clinton's last address to the world
body, and the last time he will see some leaders before he leaves
office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Over three days, Clinton signed a security agreement with Russia
that aides said beefs up existing arrangements. He also pressed the
case for peace in a variety of world trouble spots, including
Cyprus, the Balkans and the African nations of Sierra Leone and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton had rapid-fire sessions with the leaders of
South Korea and Turkey, spoke to a group of African leaders, and
addressed the U.N. Security Council. While more than a dozen other
heads of state spoke at the Council session, Clinton passed notes
with his pal, British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The president squeezed in a quick get-together with French
President Jacques Chirac before hosting a private reception at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art for a select group of leaders. The
United States omitted leaders of its least favorite regimes, such
as Cuba's Fidel Castro, and officials from Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Clinton complained that the cost of oil is too
expensive, ''not just for America but for the world,'' and said it
could lead to a recession somewhere around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had told Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah
that he hoped oil-producing nations would agree to increase
production when they meet this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had hoped that OPEC production increases in
March and again in June would force prices down to the $20 to $25 a
barrel range. Those price reductions never developed, and continued
strong worldwide demand has kept prices above $30 a barrel through
much of the summer.

<HEADLINE> Barges, Farmers Win River Battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though President Clinton awaits with a
threatened veto, barge and farming interests have won the latest
round in their battle with environmentalists over water levels in
the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 52-45 Thursday to retain legislative language
that blocks federal agencies from allowing a springtime surge in
the river's flow to save endangered shorebirds and fish. The
restriction has been enacted each of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   With their vote, senators rejected an effort led by Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., that would have allowed the
extra water into the 2,500-mile waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe people, property and fish can all be protected at
the same time without increasing the risk of flooding,'' said Sen.
Kit Bond, R-Mo., the author of the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was included in a $22.5 billion measure financing
energy and water programs for the coming fiscal year. The overall
bill was approved 93-1, more than two months after the House
approved a similar version. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., cast the only
''no'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's passage was a rare bit of progress as Congress
struggled to complete its budget work for fiscal 2001, which begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 13 annual spending bills that finance government
agencies remain incomplete, and eight -- including the energy and
water measure -- face administration veto threats. House Republican
leaders had hoped to approve three of the measures on Thursday --
covering the Treasury, Congress and the District of Columbia -- but
didn't even try in the face of likely defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers is months away from revising its
''master manual'' for managing Missouri River dams and is working
with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore habitat for
three threatened and endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife agency wants to release more water starting next
year at Gavins Point Dam on the border between Nebraska and South
Dakota, a change intended to replicate the natural flow of the
river before it was dammed for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers worry about an increased risk of flooding and say that
at the very least, the spring rise would keep their fields too wet
to plant. And the navigation industry says the plan's call for low
midsummer waters would shut down traffic from barges carrying
steel, fertilizer, construction materials and other cargo during
critical summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said outdated river management policies favor the $7
million barge industry downstream, but threaten a $90 million
upstream recreation industry -- not to mention the least tern,
piping plover and pallid sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, this rider is designed to protect special downstream
financial interests and to stop effective management of the
river,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall bill is nearly $1.3 billion above this year's levels
and is loaded with water and energy projects for every state. But
while it adds $400 million to Clinton's $13.5 billion request for
defense programs like nuclear weapons testing, it trims $600
million from his $9 billion proposal for domestic programs, such as
energy research.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is for Senate-House bargainers to write a
compromise bill.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Safety Bill Passes Senate  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pipeline workers who reveal safety problems
would receive whistleblower protection under a Senate-passed bill
that also would increase fines, boost state oversight and require
operators to disclose more information about their pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., which passed Thursday
without objection, also increases funding for the federal agency
that oversees pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said ''there is no doubt'' that an
Aug. 19 natural gas pipeline explosion in Carlsbad, N.M. -- which
left 12 dead -- created momentum to pass the bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in communities through which pipelines go (will) know
what is going on and have some say,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require pipeline operators for the first time to
submit detailed plans to the federal Office of Pipeline Safety
showing that the operators had conducted tests and inspections and
taken other steps to make the lines safe.
</P>
<P>
   The operators also would be required to show the Transportation
Department agency that they have trained employees operating the
pipes. Fines for safety violators would be increased from $500,000
to $1 million, and federal funding for the Office of Pipeline
Safety would increase by $13 million annually by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, Gorton and McCain have been pushing to pass tougher
pipeline safety legislation after a Bellingham, Wash., gasoline
pipeline rupture and explosion last year left three people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee approved McCain's bill in June,
but the measure stalled for weeks, largely due to criticisms of the
bill by the natural gas industry officials, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   She said industry officials realized they had a public relations
problem following the New Mexico disaster and relented on some of
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But an industry official said the accident did not play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Friedmann, senior vice president of legislative affairs for
the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said it took
time for all the parties involved in talks over the bill to reach
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's a tough bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said penalties in the bill are still too weak and
that the Office of Pipeline Safety should not be left to enforce
the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions of the bill would:
</P>
<P>
   --Require operators to report spills of 5 gallons or more, rather
than the current requirement of more than 200 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   --Allow states -- with Office of Pipeline Safety permission -- to
investigate pipeline accidents and examine new pipeline
construction.
</P>
<P>
   --Require operators to make available to the public maps,
emergency response plans and spill incident reports.
</P>
<P>
   Several House pipeline safety bills have been introduced, but
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., is
crafting a new bill similar to McCain's version that a
Transportation subcommittee is expected to take up as early as next
week.

<HEADLINE> MTV Awards Security Was Tight  </HEADLINE>
By ALY SUJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- While a gathering of world leaders kept
authorities on alert on Manhattan's East Side, a gathering of rock
stars in midtown created a whole new set of security jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers and rock's private armies of bodyguards were out
in force to keep the peace at MTV's Video Music Awards Thursday
night as the second day of the United Nations Millennium Summit
wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Radio City Music Hall, hundreds of New York Police
Department officers kept watch over fans standing six-deep on the
sidewalks. Top-selling acts such as Britney Spears, boy band 'N
Sync and foul-mouthed rapper Eminem relied on their own keepers for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, at least five men in the crowd had been
arrested, charged with sexually abusing women.
</P>
<P>
   One bodyguard for the band Rage Against the Machine tried in
vain to shield an unruly band member from police and was himself
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Bassist Timmy Commerford, who disrupted the show by dangling for
several minutes above the stage, was hustled outside by a phalanx
of plainclothes officers, pushed against a limousine, and
handcuffed. He was charged with assault and resisting arrest,
according to New York Police Detective Ed Reuss. His bodyguard,
Perrin Bentle, was arrested for obstructing justice.
</P>

members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation promised
a protest against the network. The organization has criticized the

against homosexuals and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard that (gay and lesbian rights group) GLAAD might be

things moving peacefully. We're particularly concerned that
something might happen,'' Zimet said.

<P>
   In the crowd outside, two men and three teen-age boys were
charged in separate incidents with sexually abusing six women.
Police said that in all of the cases, the suspects rubbed up

<HEADLINE> Calif. Docs Can Recommend Marijuana  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The government cannot penalize California
doctors who recommend marijuana for medical purposes under the
state's voter-approved medical marijuana law by revoking their
prescription licenses, a federal judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The order by U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup Thursday
came a month after the federal government said it would resist the
law, known as Proposition 215.
</P>
<P>
   Alsup wrote that the Department of Justice is permanently
prohibited from revoking licenses to dispense medication ''merely
because the doctor recommends medical marijuana to a patient based
on a sincere medical judgment and from initiating any investigation
solely on that ground.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that his order applies even if ''the physician
anticipates that the recommendation will, in turn, be used by the
patient to obtain marijuana in violation of federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We really cannot comment this evening,'' Department of Justice
spokeswoman Gretchen Michael said. ''We haven't seen the judge's
order yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could have broad implications for several states with
similar laws. It was the latest development in a conflict between
federal narcotics laws and the California initiative approved by
voters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The state initiative allows seriously ill patients to grow and
use marijuana for pain relief, with a doctor's recommendation,
without state penalties. But federal law says marijuana has no
medical purposes and cannot be administered safely under medical
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives similar to California's have been passed in Alaska,
Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit,
contended that the government's position violates doctors' free
speech rights, and that many doctors were resisting recommending
pot for fear of losing their federal right to prescribe medication.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is important because doctors and patients can feel free
to discuss marijuana as an option,'' said Graham Boyd, an attorney
with the American Civil Liberties Union.

<HEADLINE> Fans Flock To See Ventura  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of fans flooded a New York bookstore
where Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura was signing copies of his new
book, ''Do I Stand Alone?''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great man,'' said Paul Wein, press secretary for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who waited in line to get his copy signed. ''In
respect to the question he raises in his book, he doesn't stand
alone. I'm with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wein was among more than 300 people who crowded into Borders
bookstore in the World Trade Center, where he signed about 500
copies of his second book.
</P>
<P>
   Several times during the signing, the governor heard shouts of
''Jesse for president,'' a suggestion he shrugged off for the
umpteenth time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want the job,'' he said, adding that he was happy to
be governor.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Author John Gray is used to couples talking
about their problems, but now they're singing about relationship
woes.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's best-selling book ''Men are from Mars, Women are from
Venus'' has been turned into a musical comedy revue in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The show features five couples -- all friends -- and the
day-to-day struggles of each relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always thought themes from the book would make a great
musical comedy,'' Gray said. ''It's taken six years to bring it to
the stage but it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't have to worry about feeling like they will be
attending a seminar. This is pure entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical debuts Sept. 18 at the Flamingo hotel-casino and
will run indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Julie Andrews Settles Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Julie Andrews settled a medical
malpractice lawsuit with doctors who she said destroyed her singing
voice with a botched operation.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached Thursday with Dr. Scott Kessler, Dr.
Jeffrey Libin and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said Andrews
spokesman Gene Schwam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am glad to have settled this case in a favorable manner and
am glad to close this chapter on an event which was unfortunate for
all concerned,'' Andrews said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews has been unable to sing professionally due to what the
suit described as ''profound vocal difficulties, including severe
hoarseness'' since she underwent surgery to remove non-cancerous
throat nodules in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was recommended after Andrews experienced
difficulties with her throat and voice while performing seven to
eight shows a week of ''Victor/Victoria'' between October 1995 and
June 1997, the lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said Andrews was never told the operation carried the
risk of complications that might leave her unable to sing. Instead,
it alleged, doctors said the operation would eliminate her vocal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews won an Oscar for her role in ''Mary Poppins'' and
starred in ''The Sound of Music.'' Her stage credits include the
original Broadway versions of ''My Fair Lady'' and ''Camelot.''

<HEADLINE> Liberia Controlling Yellow Fever  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- An outbreak of yellow fever in Liberia appears to
be coming under control, and fears that the disease had spread to
the nation's capital have proved unfounded, the World Health
Organization said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 102 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported so
far, up from 79 early last week, said Gregory Hartl, spokesman for
the U.N. health agency.
</P>
<P>
   The cases have been centered in Garwular, a town in Grand Cape
Mount County on Liberia's western border with Sierra Leone. Four
people have died.
</P>
<P>
   A WHO campaign to vaccinate 150,000 people in the region at risk
from the outbreak started Tuesday and should end next week, Hartl
said. ''So far it seems to be doing the trick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials were concerned that the disease could put 1.5
million people at risk in the west African country's capital,
Monrovia. But ''the suspected cases which we thought were on the
outskirts of Monrovia proved not to be yellow fever, and we have no
confirmed cases outside Grand Cape Mount County,'' Hartl said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted through mosquito
bites. About 15 percent of those infected become seriously ill, and
half of those die.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure, but vaccinations are effective for at least 10
years.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Offender's Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether
criminals seeking to avoid stiff, career-offender prison sentences
in federal court can attack the validity of their earlier state
court convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said Friday they will use the case of a California
five-time loser to decide an issue that has split the federal
appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 2000-2001 term will not begin until Oct. 2 but the
justices occasionally grant review to cases during their summer
recess. Arguments in the California case likely will be heard in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration lawyers did not oppose Earthy Daniels'
appeal to the nation's highest court even though they said a
federal appeals court correctly blocked his challenge to prior
state court convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The question raised by Daniels' appeal ''has divided the courts
of appeals, recurs with frequency (and) is important to the
stability of federal sentences,'' Justice Department lawyers told
the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels was convicted in a California court of illegal
possession of a gun. He received a 16-month prison sentence. His
case was referred to federal authorities, and Daniels subsequently
was sentenced to nearly 15 years in prison under the federal Armed
Career Criminal Act.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires defendants convicted of possessing a firearm
after a felony conviction to be sentenced to long prison terms if
they had previous convictions for violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels previously had been convicted in state courts -- twice
for burglary and twice for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked the federal sentence, contending that at least two
of his state court convictions were tainted because he had been
denied effective legal help before pleading guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Daniels could
not use a challenge to his federal sentence to attack the
underlying state court convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1994 Supreme Court
decision in which the justices limited defendants' ability to
challenge previous convictions after being sentenced under federal
laws aimed at punishing habitual criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress did not prescribe and the Constitution does not
require such delay and protraction of the federal sentencing
process,'' the court said back then. But the 1994 decision made an
exception for defendants who challenge prior federal convictions
based on a claim they were denied effective legal help.
</P>
<P>
   The case acted on Friday is Daniels v. U.S., 99-9136.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Mass Arsenic Poisoning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Bangladesh faces the ''largest mass poisoning of a
population in history'' because of arsenic contamination of its
drinking water supplies, a study by the World Health Organization
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The research by Allan H. Smith, professor of epidemiology at the
University of California at Berkeley, said that between 33 and 77
million of Bangladesh's 125 million people were at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Smith predicted a big increase over the coming years in the
number of cases of disease caused by arsenic -- ranging from skin
lesions to cancers of the bladder, kidney, lung and skin and
cardiovascular problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bangladesh is grappling with the largest mass poisoning of a
population in history because groundwater used for drinking has
been contaminated with naturally occurring inorganic arsenic,''
said the study, published in WHO's monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The scale of this environmental disaster is greater than any
seen before,'' wrote Smith. ''It is beyond the accidents at Bhopal,
India, in 1984 and Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on visits to Bangladesh by Smith in 1997 and
1998 and adds to the warnings by the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.S.
government and other agencies that Bangladesh is facing huge health
risks because of the arsenic.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of arsenic in ground water occurs naturally, but
has become a widespread danger in the past three decades, when the
Bangladesh government has dug 5 million wells to provide drinking
water and save millions of people from cholera, diarrhea and other
waterborne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh first reported the problem in 1993. The World Bank
and UNICEF have provided Bangladesh more than $34 million to help
build alternative sources of drinking water such as storage of rain
water or treatment of pond water.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's study urged the government to do more to provide
arsenic-free water, educate communities about the risks and treat
and monitor patients.

<HEADLINE> Milan Opera House Abolishes SRO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Milan's venerable La Scala is giving up its
200 standing-room-only spots, beloved by some of the opera house's
most ardent and least affluent fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fire safety concerns have authorities shutting off the space at
the rear of the gilt-and-plush balconies, starting when
performances resume Tuesday after the summer break.
</P>
<P>
   That shuts the standees out of the coming season's celebrations
of the 100-year anniversary of the death of Giuseppe Verdi, Italy's
foremost opera composer.
</P>
<P>
   Opera-goers will be allowed back into the space, though probably
in regularly assigned seats, after completion of a two-year
renovation due to start at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Performances will be held at another Milan house while the
222-year-old La Scala is closed for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000-2001 season, La Scala's capacity is reduced to
2,015 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Opera fans used to line up for hours for last-minute
standing-room-only tickets, at $5 the cheapest spots in the house.
The least-expensive tickets will now cost between $25 and $40,
while top tickets for opening night can run up to $1,500.

<HEADLINE> Lockhart's Leaving White House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the prospect of high-paying speeches,
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart is preparing to leave and
turn over his job to his deputy, Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, mulling a number of job offers, said Friday that he
will leave by Oct. 1. ''I am trying to sort through what my next
career will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to go on the speaking circuit until he
settles on a position. Colleagues say he has lined up several
hundred thousand dollars in speaking fees; Lockhart said that
figure was exaggerated but declined to discuss specifics. ''I look
forward to talking about the experiences over the last five
years,'' he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> MTV Awards Keep Viewers Guessing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Eminem marched into the MTV Video Music Awards
rapping his signature song and trailed by an army of lookalikes,
perhaps his salute to music fans who stood by him despite a summer
on the firing line.
</P>
<P>
   The profane rapper won video of the year and best male video for
''The Real Slim Shady'' on Thursday, capping a raucous awards show
disrupted by a high-altitude stage crasher.
</P>
<P>
   Teen favorites 'N Sync won three awards for ''Bye Bye Bye.''
Soul stars Aaliyah and Macy Gray, veteran rockers Red Hot Chili
Peppers and Icelandic singer Bjork won two trophies apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's dramatic entrance came a few hours after a gay rights
group protested his violent lyrics outside Radio City Music Hall.
This summer, he filed for divorce from his wife, was sued by his
mother, was arrested for attacking someone with a gun and saw his
brutal lyrics widely condemned.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sold 6 million copies of his latest album.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank the fans, first and foremost,'' he said.
''But, really, every time a relative sues me, every time a critic
tries to slam me in the press, I sell more records. I really want
to thank you people for making my record as big as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Jim Carrey, who introduced Eminem's performance, offered a
lukewarm endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy his music, but he scares me,'' Carrey said. ''His
lyrics are totally socially irresponsible. But I think if we just
spend more time with our kids, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   A musician whose band lost its bid at an award pulled a strange
stunt -- climbing a stage prop and refusing orders to jump -- and was
later arrested for assault and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Timmy Commerford, bass player for the rock band Rage Against the
Machine, shouted something indecipherable as he towered over the
band Limp Bizkit, which was accepting an award for best rock video.
He was hustled out of Radio City, handcuffed and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he's OK,'' said Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst. ''I hope
he gets his head checked soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Five men were also arrested in the crowd outside the awards
show, charged with sexually abusing women.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts Shawn and Marlon Wayans and several presenters kept a
nervous censor bleeping out profanities throughout the show. MTV
even bleeped out a reference to a character on ''The Sopranos,''
Big Pussy.
</P>
<P>
   But singer Britney Spears stripped from a man's suit to a
revealing bodysuit as she performed the Rolling Stones classic
''Satisfaction.'' She won no awards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the night's best jokes was silent: Napster founder Shawn
Fanning appearing on stage in a Metallica T-shirt. The heavy metal
band is leading the fight to stop Fanning's Internet song-sharing
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nice shirt,'' MTV's Carson Daly said. Metallica's Lars Ulrich,
sitting in the audience, feigned sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who won best new artist in a video for her breakout hit,
''I Try,'' confessed on stage that she hated making videos.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just real tedious,'' she said later. ''It's not my thing.
I make music.''
</P>
<P>
   With MTV airing fewer videos, the annual show has become less
about artistry and is instead a sort of Junior Grammys. Music
industry insiders and journalists vote on the award winners.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of fans crowded the streets around Radio City Music
Hall. Security was tight, particularly because taping for the
Source Hip-Hop Music Awards was halted by a melee in California
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation protested MTV's support of Eminem, saying his lyrics
promote violence against homosexuals and women.
</P>
<P>
   MTV ran a public-service advertisement discouraging violence
against gays directly after Eminem's performance, which GLAAD's
Scott Seomin called, ''a very small consolation.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 81; Dow Sheds 59  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip and technology stocks tumbled Friday
as anxious investors sought to take profits in the face of more
corporate earnings warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 58.83 at 11,201.04.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 80.79 at 4,017.56, nearly
erasing its 85.01-point gain Thursday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 9.36 to 1,493.15.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're doing now is pricing in some measure of an economic
slowdown. We're looking at a fair number of warnings about
slowdowns in the third quarter,'' said Chris Dickerson, an analyst
with Global Market Strategists in Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, a handful of companies warned that
their earnings would not meet expectations, including automotive
parts maker TRW, whose stock fell $1.63 to $43.63 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A warning from Gadzoox Networks pushed its shares down $1.88 --
or more than 18 percent -- to $8.44 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of First Data dropped $3.94 to $39.75, a 9 percent change
after an analyst downgraded the credit-card transaction processor's
stock to ''outperform'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Dow fell 50.77 after chemical company DuPont
warned that its earnings would be down because of soft demand and
increased costs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, investors had bid blue chips higher.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, the analyst, said the market's focus on tech stocks
one day, then blue chips another reflects its lack of direction -- a
listlessness which makes life difficult for investors and money
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime anything looks to be moving, money mangers jump into
that sector because they have to squeeze out what percentage of
profit they can. They'll jump in for a couple of days and then jump
out,'' he said. ''There's a rush almost to avoid not losing out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 4.62 at 538.20.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a 5-to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 452.11 million
shares, compared to 450.77 million the previous session.

<HEADLINE> 30 Die in Indian Boat Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCKNOW, India (AP) -- An overcrowded boat capsized Friday in a
river in India's most populous state, drowning at least 30 people,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat overturned in the Pilakhar River near Pashpura village
in northern Uttar Pradesh state, police spokesman O.P. Mani
Tripathi said. The area is 105 miles east of India's capital, New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Many villagers across India use boats as public transport in
remote areas. Scores of people are often crammed into large
vessels, and with lax safety laws, many drownings occur each year.

<HEADLINE> UK Detectives in China for DNA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Three British detectives are taking DNA samples
in southeast China in hopes of identifying 58 illegal immigrants
found suffocated in the back of a truck in England.
</P>
<P>
   The samples will be taken from presumed relatives of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives, who traveled to Fujian province after arriving
in Beijing on Tuesday, will work with Chinese authorities during
their investigation, the official China Daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives' mission is part of efforts by Chinese and
British authorities to identify the 58 Chinese found dead in June
in the back of a truck carrying tomatoes from Zeebrugge, Belgium,
to Dover, on the southern English coast.
</P>
<P>
   Many if not all of the victims were believed to have come from
areas around Fuqing and Changle cities in Fujian, the China Daily
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coastal province, where the illicit trade in people
smuggling is based, has tightened border controls since the truck
deaths and intensified crackdowns on the smugglers, known as
snakeheads, who charge up to $60,000 to spirit illegal immigrants
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Reaffirms Primacy of Church  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican's reaffirmation of the primacy
of the Roman Catholic Church over other religions is the latest
salvo fired by conservatives in a behind-the-scenes battle on the
church's agenda for the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration Tuesday broke no new doctrinal ground, but its
tone and the mere fact that it was issued drew expressions of
dismay from leaders of other denominations.
</P>
<P>
   And coming on the heels of other developments, it suggested that
conservatives hold the upper hand in outlining what actions a
successor to Pope John Paul II could take.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a sign of a silent and tenacious battle taking place,''
said papal biographer Marco Politi, who covers the Vatican for the
Rome newspaper La Repubblica.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Vatican documents have sought to end debate on issues
pressed for by liberals within the church, reaffirming the
prohibition on women becoming priests and on divorced and remarried
Catholics receiving communion.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 3 beatifications that coupled 19th-century Pope Pius
IX with the much-beloved John XXIII, who reached out to other
religions and was associated with the reforms of the 1960s, also
caused consternation. Pius IX, known as the last pope king, is
anathema to liberals and Jews, who consider him anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   And a document circulated internally this summer but not made
public stresses the Catholic church's identity as ''mother'' of all
churches and decries what it called the common misuse of the phrase
''sister churches'' in ecumenical dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said it issued the latest document regarding
religious pluralism because of the spread of ''religious
relativism'' that it said was endangering the church's missionary
message.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the Roman Catholic Church as the guiding light for
spiritual salvation for all humanity, the document said:
</P>
<P>
   ''This truth of faith does not lessen the sincere respect that
the church has for the religions of the world, but at the same time
it rules out, in a radical way, that mentality of indifference
(that) leads to the belief that 'one religion is as good as
another.'''
</P>
<P>
   A top Vatican missionary official, Archbishop Marcello Zago,
told the Vatican's missionary news service Fides that the
declaration was needed because some theologians ''especially in
certain sectors of Asia'' had cast doubt on evangelization and the
seeking of converts from other religions.
</P>
<P>
   But the document also reiterated the church's position that
other Christian denominations ''derive their efficacy from the very
fullness of grace and truth entrusted to the Roman Catholic
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of other denominations were unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that Anglican and other churches are not 'proper
churches' seems to question the considerable ecumenical gains we
have made,'' said the Anglican leader, Archbishop of Canterbury
George Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings have been stirred up despite efforts by John Paul
throughout his 22-year papacy to close rifts among Christians and
improve relations with Jews, Muslims and other non-Christians.
</P>
<P>
   These include an extraordinary meeting in Assisi in 1986,
bringing together 11 non-Christian religions in prayer and fasting,
a visit to Rome's main synagogue, and prayers at Jerusalem's
Western Wall in March.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who is 80 and suffers from the symptoms of Parkinson's
disease, has bucked the church hierarchy in insisting on going
ahead with such initiatives as his call for forgiveness for the
church's sins through the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But he has antagonized some in other faiths. In India last year,
for example, he insisted that his bishops had the right to spread
the faith anywhere in Asia, where Catholics are a tiny minority.

<HEADLINE> Russian Officials Deny Sub Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials on Friday denied that a
government investigation had concluded the Kursk nuclear submarine
was sunk by a missile fired by a Russian ship.
</P>
<P>
   The military prosecutor's office also insisted Friday that its
criminal investigation into the Aug. 12 disaster does not focus
blame on the 118 sailors aboard, who were all killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report Friday in Germany's Berliner Zeitung,
Russia's Federal Security Service concluded the Kursk was hit by a
new anti-submarine rocket fired by a nuclear-powered cruiser, the
Peter the Great. Both vessels were taking part in naval exercises
in the Barents Sea when the Kursk sank.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, the Russian navy, the commander of
the Peter the Great and a special commission investigating the
disaster all denied the newspaper's report.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no basis for the information in the German
newspaper,'' the Federal Security Service said in a statement
carried by Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Naval spokesman Igor Dygalo also denied the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nonsense. Cruisers never carry real warheads, only
training weapons, during military exercises,'' said Oksana
Onishchenko, the spokeswoman for the special commission's head,
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Peter the Great, Capt. Vladimir Kasatonov,
said the ship practiced firing missiles -- without warheads -- but
said the Kursk ''could not have been the area of a missile launch
even in theory,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Berliner Zeitung said the Peter the Great fired a Granit
rocket armed with a new target-seeking warhead. The Kursk was later
determined to have been within 1,312 feet of the rocket, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with
another vessel, although they have also admitted the powerful
explosions that gashed the submarine's hull could have been caused
by an internal problem.
</P>
<P>
   The military prosecutor's office said in a statement Friday that
it was focusing its investigation on an unidentified vessel they
believe collided with the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   American officials believe an internal torpedo misfire was
responsible for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said technical data provided by
the United States this week could help find the cause of the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information which we received yesterday comes from the
technical monitoring of the area where the Kursk sank,'' Putin said
at the United Nations. ''It refers to explosions registered in the
area, and will help us analyze the situation and make conclusions
on what caused the catastrophe.''

<HEADLINE> Mafia Center To Open in Sicily  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORLEONE, Sicily (AP) -- Sicily's hamlet of the ''boss of
bosses'' is breaking the golden Mafia rule: It's talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   And, starting in December, it's showcasing it -- opening a Mafia
documentation center that will allow scholars, law enforcement
agencies and the general public to study organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''This culture of the word will fight the culture of silence,''
proclaimed Pippo Cipriani, mayor of this tiny hillside town near
Palermo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Omerta,'' or the code of silence, is the fundamental Mafia
rule. Breaking it brought death to many here, but it is also the
first step in the anti-Mafia fight, and a particularly poignant one
in the town that has become a Mafia namesake.
</P>
<P>
   It was from here that Salvatore ''Toto'' Riina ruled organized
crime for 20 years until his arrest in 1993. In ''The Godfather''
movies, Corleone was the padrino's family name.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want people to appreciate the will to speak out, the effort
of this village,'' Cipriani said Friday, adding that his project is
not danger-free. ''Thus far, it has been relatively quiet, but
we'll need to act cautiously -- though without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, due to open in December in a 17th-century convent,
will house documents and videos from Italy's anti-Mafia agencies,
the media and private collections.
</P>
<P>
   It will be linked to the University of Palermo and host yearly
conferences on the topic of the fight against organized crime.
Italy's anti-Mafia commission is providing some of the funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''An adequate information center will also be an instrument of
fight,'' Cipriani said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Italy has seen growing willingness by the
public to speak out against the Mafia, and by Mafiosi to turn
state's evidence against it.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Congress Lifts Immunity  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE NORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Argentina's Senate approved a
measure Friday that strips lawmakers of their immunity from
criminal investigation -- a move prompted by the outcry over a
vote-buying scandal that has implicated 11 senators.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will become law if it is signed by President Fernando
De la Rua. But it doesn't mean lawmakers will be subject to arrest
or prosecution for wrongdoing: While the measure lets
investigations of legislators proceed, it leaves the rest of their
immunity intact.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, with only two senators opposing, came a day after the
lower house approved the bill. Previously, it had languished in
Congress for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's swift approval was seen as a clear sign that the Senate
wants to rebuild its image. Lawmakers began their drive to push the
bill through after the bribery scandal erupted last week.
</P>
<P>
   A federal probe has been launched into accusations that several
senators took bribes in return for supporting a controversial labor
reform bill passed by the Senate last April. The investigator,
federal judge Carlos Liporaci, has named 11 senators as being
implicated.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the Senate approved a keynote economic bill
aimed at lifting Argentina out of a 16-month-long recession.
</P>
<P>
   The bill aims to assuage investors' concerns over Argentina's
short-term financial position, giving increased powers to the
executive branch in the event of a financial emergency. However,
the Senate introduced amendments that watered down the bill
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea had appealed to Senate not
to make the changes, saying they would ''drastically reduce''
Argentina's financial capacity in a time of crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ship Finds N. Koreans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese ship towed more than 100 North Koreans
aboard a barge back to North Korea after it found them drifting at
sea, China's state news agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members of the Chinese ship, the Zhehai 314, spotted the
motorless, flat-bottomed barge on Thursday as it drifted about 54
miles south of Dandong port, near the North Korean border, Xinhua
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Its passengers told Chinese crew members that their vessel was
being pulled by a tugboat on Monday when the tow line snapped. They
were waving their clothes to draw attention, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese vessels towed the barge into North Korean waters after
failing in attempts to contact that country's maritime authorities,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Xinhua report did not say where the barge had been headed or
describe the health of the passengers, who had spent four days
adrift.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of North Koreans live illegally in China. Many
fled food shortages and tough living conditions back home.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan: Immigrants Back to China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan took a small step toward opening
direct transportation links with rival China on Friday, putting 115
illegal Chinese immigrants in boats and returning them to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan frequently returns stowaways and other illegal immigrants
to China by allowing Chinese boats to pick them up on Taiwan's
outlying islands and ferry them back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's repatriation was the first time Taiwanese boats
took the mainlanders on the two-hour trip to China. The boats left
the island of Matsu and sailed to the southeastern Chinese province
of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Teh-shun of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles
Taiwan's China policy, said those being returned were legally
employed by Taiwanese fishing boats but didn't have the required
documents to be on Taiwanese land. He said it was a special case
and that future repatriations would not necessarily be conducted
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends on future situations,'' Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since
the Communist Party took over the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of direct transportation links, business
between the two sides is booming, with Taiwanese investing as much
as $40 billion since they were allowed to enter the mainland market
in the 1980s. Much of the trade flows through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Many Taiwanese businesses are clamoring for the transportation
ban to be lifted, and newly elected Taiwanese President Chen
Shui-bian has pledged to study the issue seriously. However,
political tensions remain high between the two sides, and there is
no timetable for ending the ban.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Slain Premier Slams Barak  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would
never have offered Palestinians control over parts of the Old City
of Jerusalem, as Ehud Barak has done, Rabin's widow said in remarks
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yitzhak is spinning in his grave,'' Leah Rabin told the Yediot
Ahronot daily.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin started the peace process with the Palestinians. His
widow's remarks were likely to inspire Israeli hard-liners, who
oppose Prime Minister Barak's proposed concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said in response: ''I respect her.''
</P>
<P>
   ''More than once I have asked myself how Yitzhak would have
acted in these situations,'' Barak told public television. ''He was
the man who brought me into political life. I am convinced that I
am doing the correct things for the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was gunned down in 1995 by an opponent of his peace
policies after he became the first Israeli premier to shake the
hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, reviled as a terrorist
until he signed an interim peace accord with Rabin's government in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has reportedly offered Arafat sovereignty in Arab
neighborhoods and control of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, while
Israel would have sovereignty on the Temple Mount, where the
biblical Jewish Temples stood.
</P>
<P>
   The hill, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, the Noble
Sanctuary, is the site of the Islamic Dome of the Rock shrine and
the Al-Aqsa mosque. Arafat demands full Palestinian sovereignty
there. Peace talks are stalemated over the issue, which caused the
failure of a July summit between Arafat and Barak in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Rabin said concessions in Jerusalem were a taboo for her
husband, who fought in the 1948 war that followed Israel's creation
and watched as Israeli forces lost the Old City and its Jewish
residents were taken captive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was thankful that in 1967 he was the army chief of staff
who liberated it,'' she said. Israel captured the Old City, along
with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is in New York attending the U.N. Millennium Summit.
President Clinton met separately with Barak and Arafat but
apparently failed to achieve a breakthrough in the stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Rabin criticized the way Barak is handling the
negotiations. She said Barak should not have gone into crucial
talks with Arafat before repairing the personal relationship
between the two leaders, which she said had been strained for
months.
</P>
<P>
   She said the peace process Rabin started was designed to build
trust and good will, but that has not happened. Despite Barak's
claims, she said, he is not Rabin's spiritual successor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not have made concessions on the Temple Mount and the
Old City,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Rabin ridiculed Arafat's reported offer of Israeli
sovereignty over the Jewish Quarter in the Old City, while the
Palestinians rule the rest of Jerusalem, including Muslim,
Christian and Jewish holy sites. ''They are prepared to let us pray
at the Western Wall. Isn't that beyond belief?'' she scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Wall is the last remnant of the biblical Temple
Mount. Most rabbis ban Jews from entering the Temple Mount because
of its holiness, and the Western Wall below has become Judaism's
holiest site for prayer.

<HEADLINE> 20 Feared Dead in W. Timor Massacre  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATAMBUA, Indonesia (AP) -- Hundreds of gun-toting militiamen
staged a show of force Friday in a West Timor village where U.N.
officials fear the militants killed 20 people despite Indonesia's
promises to impose control in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of new slayings came as Indonesia's embattled president
tried to reassure world leaders at the United Nations about the
situation in West Timor, where U.N. workers said militiamen were
terrorizing the populace and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials in East Timor said there were reports that
militiamen went on a rampage in Betun village on Thursday that left
20 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of 20 dead could not be confirmed independently. All
U.N. workers fled West Timor after a militia-led mob stormed U.N.
offices in Atambua, 30 miles north of Betun, on Wednesday,
slaughtering three foreign relief workers and three other people.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian army officers said only that 11 people had died in a
clash between militiamen and villagers near Betun, 18 miles from
the border between West Timor and U.N.-administered East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, President Abdurrahman Wahid said his government had
sent a battalion of troops to West Timor and that he had asked the
United Nations for funds to relocate militamen from the province to
other parts of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is under control,'' Wahid told a news conference
Friday on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit. ''The
situation now is going very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The militias are the same gangs that, with backing from elements
in the Indonesian military, wreaked destruction in East Timor after
residents there voted for independence in an August 1999
referendum. Militiamen were pushed into the western part of Timor
island when U.N. peacekeepers took control in the east.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, about 1,000 militiamen, some dressed in Indonesian
military uniforms and brandishing guns and machetes, gathered in
Betun for the funeral of one of their commanders killed earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Militia chiefs at the gathering demanded East Timorese leaders
allow the militiamen to return to East Timor or face all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is quite evident that Indonesian authorities are
not in control in West Timor,'' said Norwegian Col. Brynar Nymo,
spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers in the East Timorese capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
   On roads throughout the region, militiamen set up blockades,
extorting money and cigarettes from passing motorists and searching
cars for any remaining foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Bernard
Kerblat said West Timorese locals and refugees from the east were
living in fear in areas under militiamen's control.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 120,000 individuals in a hostage-like situation''
because of the militias, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 U.N. and other relief workers who had been caring for
East Timorese refugees have been evacuated from West Timor since
Wednesday's attack attack in Atambua, which the world body says was
the worst ever against its civilian staff.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the UNHCR said any return of relief operations is a
question of ''not when but if.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ransacked and burned UNHCR office in Atambua, Indonesian
officials searched through files scattered on the floor. Windows
and desks were smashed. Computers lay in pieces. Blood was
splattered on the ground in a local hotel that had housed many of
the humanitarian workers.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has blamed his domestic opponents of fueling the violence
in Timor and in other parts of the country in a bid to destabilize
his reformist government.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Friday that fighting the day before between
government troops and separatist rebels in Aceh, another
violence-plagued territory, had left eight dead. The deaths brought
to 84 the number of people killed in Aceh since early June.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 101; Dow Tumbles 38  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip and technology stocks fell Friday as
investors, reacting to a series of earnings warnings, decided to
take profits from the market's recent rally.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 101.24 at 3,997.11.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 37.74 at 11,222.13 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 10.31 to 1,492.20.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're doing now is pricing in some measure of an economic
slowdown. We're looking at a fair number of warnings about
slowdowns in the third quarter,'' said Chris Dickerson, an analyst
with Global Market Strategists in Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, a handful of companies warned that
their earnings would not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A warning from Gadzoox Networks pushed its shares down $1.94 --
or more than 18 percent -- to $8.38 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive parts maker TRW's stock fell nearly 10 percent early
in the day on its warning of disappointing results, but, by
afternoon, its shares had inched back up to $43.88, only $1.40, or
3 percent, off its closing price Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of First Data dropped $2.94 to $40.75, a nearly 7 percent
change after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Corp. analyst downgraded
the credit-card transaction processor's stock to ''outperform''
from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, shares of retailer Burlington Coat Factory
surged $2.06 to $14.94 -- a 16-percent jump -- after it reported an
increase in its sales at stores open at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, the Global Market Strategists analyst, said the
market's focus on tech stocks one day, then blue chips another
reflects its lack of direction -- a listlessness which makes life
difficult for investors and money managers.

shares, compared to 776.58 million the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Negotiators To Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After a brief encounter with Yasser
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak summed up peace efforts
with the Palestinians in two words Friday: ''No good.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak told The Associated Press he made a last-ditch approach to
the Palestinian leader before Arafat's scheduled departure for Gaza
and urged him to reach an accord in the little time remaining
before next week's self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was not responsive, Barak said with evident
disappointment. The prime minister said he had no meetings
scheduled with either President Clinton or Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in New York over the weekend. But his spokesman,
Gadi Baltiansky, said the prime minister was seeing American
mediator Dennis Ross later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are hung up mostly over Jerusalem. Arafat is
unyielding in his demand for sovereignty over the eastern part of
the city and has resisted compromises offered by Clinton and
pleadings by Barak that the Palestinian was missing an opportunity
to gain statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza City, the Palestine Liberation Organization's Central
Council is to meet Saturday to consider whether to move forward
with a unilateral declaration of statehood Wednesday as Arafat has
indicated he would do absent an overall settlement. Albright and
other U.S. officials have cautioned Arafat they would not support
such a state.
</P>
<P>
   Next Wednesday is the deadline that Barak and Arafat set last
year for overall agreement. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart now
calls that deadline ''artificial'' and says Clinton is prepared to
keep working past it for an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat met separately with Clinton on Wednesday at the
Millennium Summit that brought the two leaders and more than 100
others to New York for traffic-snarling deliberation at the United
Nations on ''soft'' international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing Friday for a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern, Clinton was overheard saying: ''This Middle East thing, it's
maddening.'' The president held his arms wide apart, as if to
signify the issues are too wide to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Second-tier Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to resume
talks in the Middle East next week. However, pessimism prevailed.
U.S. officials said only a few weeks remain to secure a treaty, and
lower-level negotiators have scored few achievements in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Clinton's mediation effort during this week's
U.N. Millennium Summit was the fate of a 36-acre walled compound in
Jerusalem's Old City. It is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount,
site of their two former Temples, and by Muslims as Haram
as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, with two mosques marking the spot
where they believe Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has proposed complex sovereignty arrangements
to accommodate rival Israeli and Palestinian claims, including
placing some areas under divine sovereignty to enable both sides to
save face in accepting the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he appealed in his Friday meeting with Arafat for
them to ''get something done'' before time runs out. But, shaking
his head, Barak said he did not get a positive reply.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he would contemplate hard-to-accept American
proposals, provided Arafat would reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis feel the prime minister has gone too far already
in virtually assuring Palestinian control of almost all the West
Bank, Gaza and some neighborhoods in Jerusalem and near suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   He may face efforts to force him from office when the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, reconvenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also has said no Israeli prime minister would ever accept
Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount -- ''a cornerstone of
our identity'' -- but suggested he would not necessarily insist on
full Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in turn, said anything less than full Palestinian
sovereignty over all of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem,
including the Old City and its Muslim and Christian holy sites, is
out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't betray my people. I can't betray the Arabs. I can't
betray the Christians. I can't betray the Muslims,'' Arafat told
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said he feels it has been a
mistake to focus on the hardest dispute, over the holy sites.
Negotiators will now try to make progress on the other issues, such
as land, refugees and borders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said both sides promised to work hard. ''But the truth
is, just look at the calendar,'' she said. ''There is not a lot of
time.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Affairs Head Makes Apology  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the federal Bureau of Indian
Affairs apologized Friday for the agency's ''legacy of racism and
inhumanity'' that included massacres, forced relocations of tribes
and attempts to wipe out Indian languages and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ''By accepting this legacy, we accept also the moral
responsibility of putting things right,'' Kevin Gover, a Pawnee
Indian, said in an emotional speech marking the agency's 175th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Gover said he was apologizing on behalf of the BIA, not the
federal government as a whole. Still, he is the highest-ranking
U.S. official ever to make such a statement regarding the treatment
of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The audience of about 300 tribal leaders, BIA employees and
federal officials stood and cheered as a teary-eyed Gover finished
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was a very heroic and historic moment,'' said
Susan Masten, chairwoman of California's Yurok tribe and president
of the National Congress of American Indians. ''For us, there was a
lot of emotion in that apology. It's important for us to begin to
heal from what has been done since non-Indian contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Tortalita, the governor of New Mexico's Acoma Pueblo
tribe, welcomed the apology but said, ''If we could get an apology
from the whole government, that would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gover's statement did not come from the White House,
President Clinton's chief adviser on Indian issues, Lynn Cutler,
said Gover sent her a copy of his speech late Thursday and the
White House did not object to it.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's government has formally apologized for abuses in
government-run boarding schools for Indians but has rejected calls
for a broader apology. Australian Prime Minister John Howard also
has rebuffed repeated calls for an apology to that country's
Aboriginal population for similar abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Gover recited a litany of wrongs the BIA inflicted on Indians
since its creation as the Indian Office of the War Department.
Estimates vary widely, but the agency is believed responsible for
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agency participated in the ethnic cleansing that befell
the Western tribes,'' Gover said. ''It must be acknowledged that
the deliberate spread of disease, the decimation of the mighty
bison herds, the use of the poison alcohol to destroy mind and
body, and the cowardly killing of women and children made for
tragedy on a scale so ghastly that it cannot be dismissed as merely
the inevitable consequence of the clash of competing ways of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The misery continued after the BIA became part of the Interior
Department in 1849, Gover said. Children were brutalized in BIA-run
boarding schools, Indian languages and religious practices were
banned and traditional tribal governments were eliminated, he said.
The high rates of alcoholism, suicide and violence in Indian
communities today are the result, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Poverty, ignorance and disease have been the product of this
agency's work,'' Gover said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 90 percent of the BIA's 10,000 employees are Indian and the
agency has changed into an advocate for tribal governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never again will we attack your religions, your languages,
your rituals, or any of your tribal ways,'' Gover promised. ''Never
again will we seize your children, nor teach them to be ashamed of
who they are. Never again.''

<HEADLINE> Fujimori dodges questions on Berenson; justice minister says case for courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on
Friday dodged reporters' questions about the case of jailed New
Yorker Lori Berenson; his justice minister maintained it was a
matter for the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot in advance anticipate a judgment,'' Justice Minister
Albert Bustamante said at a news conference that Fujimori held on
the sidelines of U.N. Millennium Summit. ''We belong to the
executive, not to the judicial branch of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a possibility of being condemned and (a possibility)
of being freed,'' Bustamante added.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, was convicted of treason by a military tribunal in
1996 for allegedly helping a rebel group, the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, plot an attack on the Peruvian Congress.
She denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian government recently revoked a life sentence handed
down by a military court of hooded judges and granted Berenson a
new, civilian trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said at the time that Berenson's sentence was
overturned because of new evidence showing Berenson was not a
leader of the rebel group as she was charged when convicted of
treason four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian president on Friday told reporters that the
nation's constitution requires a military trial for people arrested
of terrorist violence or of being leaders of terrorist
organizations. Civilian courts handle ''simple terrorism,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's case is now being examined and prepared by a
prosecutor and a judge in closed-door hearings. Once the evidence
and witness testimonies have been collected and reviewed, a higher
prosecutor will formally charge Berenson. She will then appear in
an open trial before a three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction of terrorism by a civilian court carries a minimum
20-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's parents, Mark and Rhoda Berenson of Manhattan, have
worked ceaselessly to demonstrate their daughter was a journalist,
not a terrorist, and to condemn harsh conditions she has lived
under in Peruvian prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology
student, arrived in Peru in 1994 as an accredited reporter for a
pair of liberal-leaning U.S. magazines, Third World Report and
Modern Times.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian authorities charged that she used the press credentials
as a ruse to interview members of Congress, while her real motive
was providing a blueprint of the building. They describe her as a
frustrated radical who came to Peru in search of a revolution.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Fighting in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Gunbattles erupted this week
between rival factions in Sierra Leone, U.N. officials said Friday,
raising fears for the safety of six British soldiers held hostage
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian U.N. peacekeepers witnessed several hours of gunfire
Wednesday between members of the West Side Boys, a renegade
military gang that is holding the captives, and a ragtag
pro-government militia of traditional hunters, U.N. spokeswoman
Hirut Befecadu said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred along a road in Magbeni, a village about
45 miles east of the capital, Freetown, Befecadu said. The fighting
has since died down although armed U.N. convoys were escorting all
civilians moving through the area, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The village is close to where the West Side Boys captured 11
British soldiers and a Sierra Leonean soldier on Aug. 25. Five
British officers were freed last week.
</P>
<P>
   British army spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Tony Cramp said negotiators
feared that clashes between the skirmishing factions could
jeopardize ''the safety of our soldiers still in captivity.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cramp said British officials remain committed to talks
with the captors and said the two sides were in regular contact. On
several occasions, officials have spoken with the hostages, who
they said remained in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The West Side Boys are a notoriously undisciplined gang that has
fought both the Sierra Leone government and the country's brutal
rebel Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several dozen British paratroopers arrived in
Sierra Leone from Dakar, Senegal, to give negotiators the option of
a military rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The British hostages, members of the 1st Irish Regiment, were
stationed at Benguema, about 25 miles east of Freetown, where
British instructors were training Sierra Leonean army recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The captured men's colleagues were being returned to Britain
this week, and 220 others from the regiment were being flown in to
replace them.
</P>
<P>
   They are retraining Sierra Leone's shattered defense force to
fight the rebels, who are responsible for the deaths and
intentional mutilation of tens of thousands of civilians since war
began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after signing a July 1999 peace accord, the
Revolutionary United Front rebels renewed Sierra Leone's war in May
by seizing hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers and attacking towns.

<HEADLINE> A flotilla of experts to discuss vitality of world's canals  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - It's almost like being transported into
the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The meandering trail is a man-made ribbon of water. Fields,
forests and quaint villages roll gently into view. In place of the
clip-clop of a mule, there's the soothing, putt-putt rhythm of a
boat engine.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising the Erie Canal is clearly Tom Grasso's favorite way to
get across New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's relaxing, it's calming, it's just fun,'' the retired
geologist said. ''The scenery is gorgeous, the history is
spectacular. You can't say enough about how hectic our lives are,
but on the canal it's like the other end of the extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Grasso acknowledged, ''one of the appeals of canaling
is there's not a lot of people interested in it. There's not a long
line anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the irony.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Canal Society of New York, Grasso's mission
is to turn the state's 525-mile Barge Canal system into a
recreational hotspot - or at least something more akin to the
highly traversed, artificially created waterways of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping to pick up a few dynamic ideas about canal
revitalization at the six-day World Canals Conference, which opens
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 300 canal experts and enthusiasts in attendance will
be historians, entrepreneurs and government officials from as far
away as Britain, France and the Czech Republic. Greeting the
visitors will be a flotilla of as many as 100 boats that will
congregate along the Genesee River after heading north into the
city from the Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The 175-year-old canal carried a million settlers into the
nation's heartland and created a cheap route for hauling lumber,
wheat, stone and other cargo. It transformed New York into
America's first boom state before being largely eclipsed by trains,
trucks and the St. Lawrence Seaway up north, which opened up the
Great Lakes to oceangoing vessels.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 tons of freight are still carried each year across
the entire New York network, which includes the Champlain, Oswego
and Cayuga-Seneca canals. But the focus has shifted to luring
recreational traffic since the Transportation Department turned the
reins over to the New York State Thruway, the waterway's proprietor
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a weeklong vacation on a canal, not altogether unusual in
places like Ireland, Belgium and France, is still ''a bit foreign''
to most Americans, said Kristen Hanifin of the New York State Canal
Corp., a Thruway subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   And so progress is coming slowly. The Thruway said nearly
142,000 pleasure craft passed through locks on the entire canal
system last year, up from 132,000 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With federal and state funds pouring into renovating the canal
system and its surroundings in recent years, Hanifin thinks U.S.
canal cruises will inevitably become more popular. ''People these
days are always looking for something a little bit unique,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Oil Fields Will Pump Again  </HEADLINE>
By GERALD NADLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin showed his
support at the signing Friday of a U.S.-backed $292 million loan
package to revitalize part of Siberia's giant Samotlor oil field.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was in New York for the U.N. Millennium Summit of
world leaders, came to the signing of the agreement at Russia's
U.N. mission after meeting Cuban President Fidel Castro there.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year loans, guaranteed by the Export Import Bank of the
United States, will let the Tyumen Oil Company of Russia buy oil
equipment and services from the Dallas-based Halliburton Co.,
formerly run by Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Samotlor is Russia's biggest oil field, but it is in need of
vital repairs. The field is now waterlogged, after it was flooded
in the Soviet era when workers pumped in water in an attempt to get
the oil out quickly -- a shortsighted policy that ruins the oil
wells.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to congratulate you and wish you all the best,''
Putin told the gathering of officials and bank and oil executives.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Kukes, president and chief executive officer of Tyumen
Oil, said Putin's presence at the signing was ''a clear signal for
the business and investment communities in the West that Russia is
open'' to investment.
</P>
<P>
   He said the revitalized Samotlor field will produce up to
360,000 barrels a day of oil next year, of which 140,000 barrels
will be exported.
</P>
<P>
   The loan money will be provided by the New York branch of
Commerzbank AG of Germany as part of an estimated three-year
project to stop the decline, and maintain and increase the
production of the portion of the Samotlor field controlled by
Tyumen Oil.
</P>
<P>
   The $292 million is part of what will eventually be a $672
million loan package. Some $509 million of that will be guaranteed
by the Export-Import Bank, the largest ever guaranteed by the bank
to a Russian company.
</P>
<P>
   The loan package was five years in the making. The State
Department gave the go-ahead for the deal in March after putting it
on hold in December because of concerns about Tyumen's business
practices.

<HEADLINE> Three dead in Atlantic City shooting  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A man with an assault rifle opened
fire on a car stopped at a red light about two miles west of the
city's Boardwalk casino district Friday, killing three of the four
occupants. At least 24 shots were fired into the vehicle,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth man in the car was slightly injured by flying glass,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings occurred about 4 a.m. near a remote parking lot
for casino workers.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant remained at large Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz said investigators are
convinced the assailant and his victims knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect was being sought, Blitz said, but he would not release
the person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were identified only as black males in their 20s
from the Atlantic City and Pleasantville area. Autopsies were being
performed Friday afternoon, Blitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Blitz said the driver of the 1989 Honda Accord exited the car
and tried to flee but was gunned down in the road. Passengers in
the front seat and left rear seat were killed by gunshots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the shots were fired from another
vehicle or the assailant was on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda with two bodies inside was discovered in a marshy area
alongside the road - U.S. 30, known locally as the White Horse Pike
- about 100 yards from where the driver's body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Blitz would not say if the man who survived was an accomplice of
the shooter. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment, but
was not admitted. It was not clear if he remained in police
custody.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings happened near the entrance to a parking lot for
employees of marina district casinos, but Blitz said there was no
indication the incident had any connection to casinos or casino
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The crime scene is about one mile west of the Harrah's Atlantic
City and Trump Marina casinos.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the eastbound White Horse Pike between Absecon and
Atlantic City was closed for 4&AMP;frac12; hours as investigators and members
of the Atlantic County Medical Examiner's Office examined the scene
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City-bound traffic was rerouted to the Atlantic City
Expressway, causing long delays.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoreans Unload Sucres in Change  </HEADLINE>
By CARLOS CISTERNAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Like a hot stone in their hands,
Ecuadoreans are casting off their last wads of sucres, their
national currency. As of midnight Saturday, the sucre will be
worthless for normal street transactions -- replaced by the American
greenback.
</P>
<P>
   This small Andean nation, wracked by political and economic
disorder for years, is completing a six-month transition to making
the U.S. dollar its official currency. Ecuador joins Panama and
nine other countries in which the U.S. dollar is legal tender.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption of the dollar comes after the near collapse of
Ecuador's corruption-ridden banking system, which contributed to
driving down the sucre's value from 7,000 to the dollar in January
1999 to nearly 30,000 to the dollar at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the switchover will end record inflation running
at 104 percent a year, Latin America's highest. The step is
designed to prevent the government from printing excessive money to
meet its budgetary needs. Economists blame Ecuador's economic woes
on decades of deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   So far, signs indicate that the plan is working. Monthly
inflation has plunged from 14.3 percent in January to 1.4 percent
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that many Ecuadoreans are unhappy with
the loss of their national currency because of its value as a
symbol of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic ''funeral'' for the sucre on Saturday, a group of
actors, painters, writers and musicians plan to carry a small
coffin filled with sucre bills in a procession from the Central
Bank to Quito's main cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to gather to say a final goodbye to our beloved
currency,'' said Ana Fernandez, coordinator of the event. She said
groups also will convene in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, for
''a historic commemoration'' to say farewell to the sucre,
Ecuador's currency since 1884.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, many people recognize that the change
appears to be stabilizing a chaotic economy, and they are relieved
that the six-month transition, in which both currencies circulated
simultaneously, is ending.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ready for the sucre to disappear. We were all confused
by getting change in different currencies,'' said Ricardo Tipan,
37, who makes a precarious living hauling vegetables from farms to
the city in a dilapidated pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out the math of transactions during the transition
period -- $1 equals 25,000 sucres -- has been exasperating to many
businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of Ecuadoreans earn less than $30 a month,
making the dollar appear disproportionate to the meager means of
the average Ecuadorean and unwieldy for most small purchases. A $20
bill is worth 500,000 sucres.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of U.S. currency spawned a boom market for
cardboard conversion charts, sold by street vendors for 1,000
sucres, or 4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that tool as a crutch, figuring out a simple 70-cent
purchase turned into a time-consuming mental workout for people
carrying both sucres and cents: two quarters, a dime, two
1,000-sucre coins, and two pennies.
</P>
<P>
   A blizzard of radio, newspaper, and television ads by the
Central Bank this week have been reminding Ecuadoreans to change
their sucres before their buying power vanishes Saturday at
midnight. Central Bank officials said Friday that some $420 million
in sucres have been removed from circulation but $41 million are
still out there.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses have refused to accept sucres for the last
several weeks, fearing they would get stuck with worthless
currency. But the Central Bank ads say leftover sucres may still be
switched at special locations until March 9.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Military To Make Deep Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With a decision to cut 350,000 troops, Russia's
leaders appear to have acknowleged that they can no longer afford
armed forces like those that once stood eyeball to eyeball with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The troop reduction, confirmed Friday by Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, would slash the ministry's forces from 1.2 million
personnel -- an enormous force that no longer gets enough money to
properly equip, train and feed its troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''A corresponding decision has been made, and now (we) are
preparing suggestions for the president on how to carry it out,''
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a ceremony at the headquarters of the
Kantemirovskaya tank division outside Moscow, Sergeyev said the
reduction would be complete by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The move appears to reflect Russian leaders' growing recognition
that the nation's lagging economy can no longer afford a military
modeled on the Soviet forces that squared off against the United
States and Europe during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   That required a large land army of troops and tanks, thousands
of combat aircraft and hundreds of ships, plus thousands of nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The current Russian defense budget is just $5.1 billion,
compared with annual U.S. defense spending of about $290 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just can't afford to keep up a world-class armed forces
on that kind of money,'' said Keith Bush, head of the Russian and
Eurasian Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk ''is just one example of overreach,'' said Bush,
pointing to the lack of rescue and safety equipment that left the
navy floundering to reach the nuclear sub after it sank Aug. 12.
Pilots don't fly enough to keep up their skills, there's no money
for new equipment and common soldiers sometimes go unfed.
</P>
<P>
   Following the sinking of the Kursk, Russian President Vladimir
Putin said Russia should trim its military into a ''compact'' and
modern fighting force.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the disaster, Putin had made reviving the armed
forces a top priority. One of his first actions as president was to
approve plans to modernize Russia's conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia already has cut its armed forces down from 5 million
troops in the past decade under a reform program launched by former
President Boris Yeltsin. But military restructuring lagged under
Yeltsin, weakened by illness and unpopularity in the later part of
his rule, which ended with his resignation Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The program announced by Sergeyev would carry the Yeltsin-era
reduction even further. The deepest cuts would come in land forces,
with about 180,000 troops removed from active service, the Interfax
news agency reported, citing an unidentified source in the Defense
Ministry. Among other cuts, the navy would lose 50,000 personnel
and the air force about 40,000, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts would come from the 1.2 million troops counted under
Sergeyev's Defense Ministry. There are yet more counted under the
Interior Ministry, the intelligence services, the Interior
Ministry, and even the railroad forces.
</P>
<P>
   But just cutting back won't be enough, said Alexander Golts,
military affairs writer for Moscow's Itogi magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is whether Russia also changes the goals it
sets before the military -- from maintaining an unaffordable parity
with the West to dealing with local conflicts like the war in
Chechnya, where troops are bogged down in a fierce struggle with
guerrillas seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
   Without a new orientation, Russia will still face a mismatch
between what it wants and what its economy will pay for, Golts
said: ''As long as the task of offsetting NATO exists, all these
cuts will not achieve their effect.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Marks Bombing Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Muscovites heaped carnations Friday on a memorial
cross commemorating an apartment bombing a year ago that killed 93
people and helped prompt Russia to send troops back into breakaway
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials blamed Chechen rebels for the bombing in
southeastern Moscow and three others last September -- attacks that
rattled the nation and heightened fears that the government was
powerless against crime.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family of the victims gathered Friday at the empty
lot that is all that remains of the apartment building. They
embraced, cried and laid flowers on a memorial stone and cross. A
small chapel is to be erected on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The blast collapsed all nine stories in the center section of
the block-long building. The rest was later demolished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing similar had ever happened in Russia or the Soviet
Union. What happened last year, we couldn't have imagined in our
worst nightmares,'' Viktor Zakharov, chief of the Federal Security
Service's Moscow branch, said in an interview published Friday in
the Kommersant newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators have determined the chain of events
leading up to the bombings and the guilty parties. He claimed a
prominent warlord in Chechnya, a Jordanian who goes by only one
name, Khattab, had paid $500,000 to the man who allegedly organized
the two Moscow bombings, Achimez Gochiyayev.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said 33 suspects are in custody, but others,
including Khattab and Gochiyayev, are at large in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin responded by sending troops into Chechnya, where
lawlessness had become rampant after Russian troops withdrew at the
end of a 1994-96 war against separatists.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Church Asks for Pardon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The top Roman Catholic official
in Argentina said Friday the church would ask forgiveness for its
role during the country's military dictatorship and other past
errors.
</P>
<P>
   The church plans to make the apology late Friday at the National
Eucharist Congress, the central event of its Millennial
celebration. The congress, which hopes to draw 100,000 pilgrims,
takes place in Cordoba, Argentina's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to confess before God everything we have done badly,''
Monsignor Estanislao Karlic, president of Argentina's Episcopal
Conference, told reporters. The Argentine church was known for its
conservative stance during the 1976-83 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Karlic added that he hopes the apology would a starting point
''for the reconciliation of all Argentines.''
</P>
<P>
   The apology comes six months after Pope John Paul II asked for
forgiveness for the church's past errors -- including its role
during the Nazi Holocaust and other acts of political and religious
repression.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine church had made a self-criticism for its role in
the dictatorship, in 1996 saying ''all that we did was not enough
to prevent such horror.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statement was widely considered as insufficient and
there has been mounting pressure for a fuller apology.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates 9,000 people disappeared in the
dictatorship and are believed to have been killed. Human rights
groups put the death toll at up to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse the church hierarchy of giving official sanction
to the military government and doing little to prevent the human
rights abuses that took place.

<HEADLINE> Cohen To Indonesia: Restore Calm  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On President Clinton's instructions, Defense
Secretary William Cohen is to tell Indonesian leaders next week
that the army must restore security to East and West Timor or risk
losing country's international support.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen will be in Indonesia next week as part of a six-nation
Asian tour. The Pentagon said Friday that Cohen expects to meet
with President Abdurrahman Wahid and senior leaders of the
Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official, previewing Cohen's trip on condition he not
be identified, said the secretary's message to the Indonesians will
be strong: ''Indonesia's failure to protect an American citizen and
other international aid workers, and the more general failure of
the Indonesian army to provide security for the international
relief operations, threaten to destroy the international good will
toward Indonesia at a time when it needs it most.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address Wednesday to the U.N. Millennium Summit in New
York, Clinton noted the deaths Wednesday of an American and two
other U.N. workers at the hands of a mob led by pro-Indonesian
militia gangs in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The president urged Indonesian authorities ''to bring those
responsible to justice, to disarm and disband the militias and to
take all necessary steps to insure the safety of those continuing
to work on humanitarian goals there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, in New York for the global summit, insisted Friday that
''everything is under control'' despite reports of more slayings by
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are the same gangs that, with backing from elements
in the Indonesian military, wreaked destruction in East Timor after
island residents voted for independence in an August 1999
referendum. Militiamen were pushed into the western part of Timor
Island when U.N. peacekeepers took control in the east.
</P>
<P>
   After that episode, the Clinton administration cut off
military-to-military relations with Indonesia. The Pentagon said
Friday the administration was not yet prepared to resume military
contacts, but its ultimate goal is to bring about the kinds of
conditions in Indonesia that would permit such ties.
</P>
<P>
   On his most recent visit to Indonesia, last September, Cohen
accused the military of ''aiding and abetting'' militia violence
against civilians in East Timor, which is now administered by the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> MTV's Message: Girls All Grownup  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The little girls are all grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears shed her wholesome teen queen image at the MTV
Video Music Awards Thursday night, stripping off a man-style tuxedo
to reveal a nude-colored glimmering bikini top and matching pants
as she performed a version of The Rolling Stones' ''Satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears, 18, also teamed with fellow teen pop sensation Christina
Aguilera, 19, onstage as presenters -- and both wore sexy black
dresses with thigh-high slits.
</P>
<P>
   The red carpet outside Radio City Music Hall was a parade of
stars, each trying to be sexier and more daring than the other.
Everyone was a candidate for the most-talked about outfit at the
awards -- a la Jennifer Lopez at this year's Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez toned down her look from that memorable green Versace gown
with the plunging neckline and slit-up-to-there skirt, opting for a
white midriff-baring top and hiphugger pants made for her by
boyfriend Sean (Puff Daddy) Combs' Sean Jean clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   Lil' Kim, however, didn't stray from her typically shocking
look. She arrived in a revealing reddish-orange spider-web design
that looked more like lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Ginsberg, entertainment editor for Women's Wear Daily, a
leading fashion newspaper, and W magazine, wasn't impressed with
Lopez, Kim -- or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a severe lack of fashion. People were going for
coolness instead of style,'' Ginsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty of cleavage, bellybuttons and shoulders on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera's asymmetrical dress was held up by a shoulder strap on
only one side, and two of the three members of Destiny's Child
showed off bare shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny's Child, winners for the R&AMP;B video ''Say My Name,'' also
kept up with another trend -- leather -- as the three women wore
similar but not matching studded black leather outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Best hip-hop video award winner Sisqo wore a studded red leather
outfit during his onstage performance. Black leather was the
fashion choice for the majority of 'N Sync, which won three awards
for the ''Bye Bye Bye'' video. Professional wrestling star Chyna
wrapped herself in what looked like a leather flag.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of stars stuck to more traditional award-show
fashions, including Toni Braxton in a tuxedo (although she was
missing the shirt). Moby and two of the Red Hot Chili Peppers wore
monochromatic suits, shirts and ties, sporting the look made
popular by ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' host Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem went the opposite route, wearing a series of baggy
athletic pants and plain white T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ''People used to try to do fashion at these awards, but now they
make grunge look good,'' Ginsberg said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - At first, her public appearances were furtive
and mayoral aides lied about who she was. Then, as her relationship
with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani threatened to explode into scandal, she
disappeared from public view.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the lame duck mayor's second term winding down,
Judith Nathan has taken an increasingly high public profile,
performing functions formerly carried out by Donna Hanover,
Giuliani's wife, and the city's official first lady.
</P>
<P>
   At the inauguration of new Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik
last week, there was Nathan - not Hanover- front row center,
snapping pictures with a small silver camera and nodding
encouragingly as the mayor spoke.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before, the 45-year-old pharmaceutical company
executive marched alongside the mayor at the city's West Indian Day
Parade, decked out in a big straw hat and white shirt casually
knotted at the midriff. She beamed, joked with the mayor, waved to
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And there she was at the Republican National Convention, at a
fundraiser for Rep. Rick Lazio, marching in a Fourth of July parade
on Staten Island - increasingly taking on the role of First Lady of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hanover -Giuliani's wife of 16 years and the mother
of his two children - has been conspicuously absent from most
official events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course this is very hurtful, but Donna is acting with
enormous grace and dignity, taking care of her children and
continuing her First Lady work for various New York City
charities,'' Hanover spokeswoman Joannie Danielides said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, 50, a television personality and actress, has publicly
accused her husband of not only cheating with Nathan, but also of
having an affair with former mayoral aide Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas. Both Giuliani and Lategano-Nicholas have denied
having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   While Hanover has hired a divorce lawyer, Giuliani has not,
though he has said that he is seeking a legal separation - which he
took pains to point out this spring is not the same as a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that Giuliani, 56, is able to flaunt his
relationship with Nathan, who he has described as his ''very good
friend,'' without much complaint for two reasons: He has only 14
months left in office, and the public is still grateful to him for
the city's chugging economy and precipitous drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unintended consequence of term limits,'' said
Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute. ''Anyone who was running for election wouldn't be doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Republican Giuliani dropped out of a race for the U.S.
Senate against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in May, he cited
his prostate cancer, not his marriage woes as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican political consultant Jay Severin said President
Clinton's relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky has
changed the landscape, and since then, the public has affected a
live-and-let-live attitude about the moral shortcomings of its
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the public display and the public reaction to this is
extraordinary,'' said Severin. ''The fact that he can do this is
scandalous, but there is no scandal, ipso facto, it must not be
scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University public policy professor Steven Cohen said
public expectations of its leaders have evolved over a short period
of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are sophisticated enough to separate the personal from
the professional where they can now say, 'He's a pretty good public
official, but I wouldn't want to have dinner with him.'''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Nathan has become just another character in the fabric
of the city's life - a far cry from the days not-too-long ago when
she marched anonymously behind the mayor in parades, and Giuliani
aides told reporters that she was a friend of various mayoral
aides.
</P>
<P>
   So what does the future hold for the couple?
</P>
<P>
   Manos Zacharioudakis, who lived with Nathan and her 15-year-old
daughter in Manhattan before Nathan started seeing Giuliani last
year, has an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is going to be a next Mrs. Giuliani,'' he said, ''she
is going to make a perfect wife. She is an extraordinary
individual.''

<HEADLINE> Irish Leader Invites Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern invited
President Clinton to return to Ireland for a last visit as
president, but the White House said Friday no trip is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern told Clinton that a power-sharing government is back on
track in Northern Ireland, and that sectarian violence was kept to
a minimum during the often-volatile summer marching season.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders met while both were attending the U.N.
Millennium Summit. If Clinton does not make a trip to Ireland, it
is likely their last meeting before Clinton leaves office in
January, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ahern said to the president, 'We'd love to have you back.' The
president said, 'I'd love to go back,' but we can't plan anything
now,'' a senior administration official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Clinton
did not condition a trip on further progress toward peace in
Northern Ireland, although that has been a sticking point before.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was greeted warmly during an Irish trip in 1998, and
said last year he would go to Belfast ''at the drop of a hat if
there is some contribution I can make to the ongoing peace process
and the work still to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who often mentions his own Irish heritage as a preface
to discussions of ethnic and religious divisions, has taken a
direct interest in the long process to end sectarian violence in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He helped broker the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement that
established a power-sharing government with representatives of
pro-British Northern Ireland unionists and Sinn Fein, the mainly
Roman Catholic party linked to the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared dispirited earlier this year when the process
faltered, but in May, he hailed the decision of Northern Ireland's
Protestants to revive the power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to meet next week at the White House with David
Trimble, leader of the main Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists;
and Seamus Mallon, a leader of the moderate Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party.

<HEADLINE> Court says some evidence should have been released during Diallo trial </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Judge Joseph Teresi was not acting within
the law when he denied the media access to documents in evidence in
the high profile Amadou Diallo murder trial, the Appellate Division
of state Supreme Court noted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Existing law does not permit the blanket denial of access to
documentary trial exhibits,'' the Appellate Division wrote. That
was noted in a judgment that dismissed on procedural grounds the
media's petition for access to the records during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The petition by seven news organization was dismissed as moot
because the four New York City police officers on trial have since
been acquitted and the evidence is now available to the public. The
trial ended in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing that the appellate court recognized that a
blanket denial of public access to documentary trial exhibits is
impermissible, but nevertheless refused to vindicate the public's
right on a procedural basis,'' said Michael Grygiel, a First
Amendment lawyer who represented the news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Grygiel is considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, an African immigrant, was shot and killed in the Bronx
in February 1999. Teresi, an Albany County Supreme Court judge,
took over the case when courts determined pretrial publicity in the
Bronx had made it impossible to select an unbiased jury there.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Teresi didn't allow the press access to
evidence, including police and coroner's reports that were
discussed during cross examination. He said doing so could impair
''the integrity of the evidence and interfere with the orderly
conduct of the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Access to those documents could have helped reporters understand
the testimony, according to Grygiel. He added that denied access
may have impeded reporters' ability to cover the news.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, Daily News, Newsday, the New York Post,
The New York Times, the Albany Times Union and the New York Law
Journal, challenged Teresi's actions in the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state Attorney General's Office, which
represented Teresi, said the Appellate Division ''ruled
appropriately in the matter,'' but would not comment further.

<HEADLINE> Nasdawq Ends Down 100; Dow Falls 38  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks plummeted Friday, carrying the
rest of the stock market lower, as investors reacting to a series
of earnings warnings decided to take profits from the market's
recent rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index closed down 100.05 at 3,998.30,
according to preliminary calcuations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 38.11 at 11,221.76 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 7.87 to 1,494.64.
</P>
<P>
   The declines more than erased the gains made during a tumultous
week on Wall Street, where investors first abandoned tech stocks
for blue chips and then completely changed their strategies.	   ''What we're
doing now is pricing in some measure of an economic
slowdown. We're looking at a fair number of warnings about
slowdowns in the third quarter,'' said Chris Dickerson, an analyst
with Global Market Strategists in Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened, a handful of companies warned that
their earnings would not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A warning from Gadzoox Networks pushed its shares down $1.94 --
or more than 18 percent -- to $8.38 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive parts maker TRW's stock fell nearly 10 percent early
in the day on its warning of disappointing results, but, by
afternoon, its shares had inched back up to $43.81, only $1.44, or
3.2 percent, off its closing price Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of First Data dropped $2.69 to $41, a more than 6 percent
change after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Corp. analyst downgraded
the credit-card transaction processor's stock to ''outperform''
from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech communications firm MPower Communications fell $3.44
to $8.88, a decline of more than 27 percent after a Merrill Lynch
analyst cuts its rating to ''accumulate'' from ''buy.'' The
downgrade came a day after MPower revised its third- and
fourth-quarter outlook downward, saying its haste to get to the
market proved more costly than it expected.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, shares of retailer Burlington Coat Factory
surged $2.13 to $15 -- a 16 percent jump -- after it reported an
increase in its sales at stores open at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, the Global Market Strategists analyst, said the
market's focus on tech stocks one day, then blue chips another
reflected its lack of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the week, investors had bid blue chips higher. But they
shifted their attention to the Nasdaq on Thursday, sending it up
85.01, while the Dow fell 50.77 after chemical company DuPont
warned that its earnings would be down because of soft demand and
increased costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime anything looks to be moving, money mangers jump into
that sector because they have to squeeze out what percentage of
profit they can. They'll jump in for a couple of days and then jump
out,'' Dickerson said. ''There's a rush almost to avoid not losing
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 5.29 at 537.53.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 958.62 million
shares, compared to 973.54 million the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.23 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 1.43 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 1.32 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> New NHTSA Head in Eye of Storm  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- WANTED: Manager to lead agency at center of
huge consumer product safety case. Must be willing to face angry
lawmakers, critical media. Expected to initiate policy changes and
persuade Republican Congress to increase budget. May be replaced in
January when new president takes office.
</P>
<P>
   This is the job Sue Bailey took over three weeks ago when she
became administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the physician and former Navy Reserve officer has
been in the middle of the maelstrom over the recall of 6.5 million
Firestone tires. The brands of tires recalled have been linked to
at least 88 U.S. traffic deaths and dozens more overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has earned plaudits for making herself available to the
media, going before congressional panels to explain the agency's
positions and remaining generally upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think I'd ever feel as good about working any place
as the Pentagon, but I feel that good here because we are saving
lives,'' Bailey told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA -- pronounced nit-sah -- is the federal agency under the
U.S. Department of Transportation responsible for improving
automotive safety. The agency sets and enforces safety standards
for vehicles and investigates possible defects.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's actions are almost always opposed by the auto
industry and its well-funded lobbyists on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton nominated Bailey for NHTSA's top job this
summer when she was an assistant secretary of defense and the first
woman to lead the Military Health System, responsible for the
medical care of 8.2 million military personnel. Before that she
worked in private medical administration and was in the U.S. Navy
Reserves, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.
</P>
<P>
   Former NHTSA Administrator Joan Claybrook, now president of
consumer advocacy group Public Citizen that often criticizes the
agency, said the job is high-pressure even without something like
the Firestone recall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's doing a pretty good job,'' Claybrook said of
Bailey. ''It's a very tough position to be put in the middle of a
huge controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA has been criticized for not acting sooner to alert the
public about the Firestone tires, but most of the anger has been
directed at Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co., which
had data indicating problems long before NHTSA was contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has fiercely defended the agency, saying it acted as soon
as it had enough evidence to start an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   When she testifies in front of a third congressional panel
investigating the case next week, Bailey said she will ask for more
funding and resources so the agency can uncover problems sooner.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Before Hillary Rodham Clinton can truly
proclaim herself the Democratic Party's U.S. Senate candidate
against Rep. Rick Lazio, she must win a primary Tuesday against a
little-known physician from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And, ''Grandpa Munster'' is at it again. Cigar-chomping actor Al
Lewis, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York in 1998 as
the Green Party's candidate, faces a three-way primary for that
party's Senate nomination this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McMahon, a 39-year-old orthopedic surgeon, managed to force
Clinton into a primary by collecting the signatures of more than
40,000 Democrats across the state. He needed just 15,000. She got
on the ballot by being the unanimous choice of the Democratic state
convention.
</P>
<P>
   While McMahon has boasted of pulling off a primary upset, the
Clinton camp and the state's Democratic Party hierarchy, which is
solidly behind the first lady, have largely ignored the doctor's
challenge. McMahon has been met by sparse crowds as he tours the
state. Many of those who do show up wonder who he is.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, greeted like a celebrity at most stops, has
declined to debate him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're focused on the real debate in this race - the one
between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio,'' Clinton spokesman Howard
Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican until 1997, McMahon has stressed Clinton's lack of
New York roots and his familiarity with health care issues as
reasons to vote for him.

   New York pollster Lee Miringoff of Marist College's Institute
for Public Opinion said Clinton should have little trouble sending
McMahon back to his medical practice and that the challenge won't
get much attention unless he approaches or breaks the 30 percent
mark. Even then, according to Miringoff, the results would mean
little given the expected low turnout for the state primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would reflect that there is some anti-Hillary stuff there,
which we already know,'' the independent pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 5 million enrolled Democrats in the state who
are eligible to vote in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Polls for the primary are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. in New
York, on Long Island and in Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Erie
counties. They are open from noon to 9 p.m. in the state's other 51
counties.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event that Clinton loses the Democratic primary,
she will remain on the November ballot as the candidate of the
state's Liberal and union-backed Working Families parties.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has no Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   There are other U.S. Senate primaries in New York on Tuesday,
including:
</P>
<P>
   -Actor-comedian-political activist Lewis, who played ''Grandpa''
in ''The Munsters'' television series, faces a three-way Green
Party primary against Ronnie Dugger, the founding editor of the
Texas Observer who has written biographies of both Lyndon Johnson
and Ronald Reagan; and Mark Dunau, an organic farmer. Results of
the Green Party primary may not be known for several days after the
vote because paper ballots are being used in New York City for that
race.
</P>
<P>
   -Former Watertown Mayor Jeff Graham faces Jeff Beller, an Albany
area advocate for renewable energy, in the battle for the
Independence Party nomination. It is the New York arm of the
national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   -Republican Louis Wein, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in
1990 on the Right to Life Party's line, is facing John Adefope, a
telephone company engineer, for the anti-abortion party's Senate
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Indian Affairs head apologies for agency's 'legacy of racism'  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The head of the federal Bureau of Indian
Affairs apologized Friday for the agency's ''legacy of racism and
inhumanity'' that included massacres, forced relocations of tribes
and attempts to wipe out Indian languages and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ''By accepting this legacy, we accept also the moral
responsibility of putting things right,'' Kevin Gover, a Pawnee
Indian, said in an emotional speech marking the agency's 175th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Gover said he was apologizing on behalf of the BIA, not the
federal government as a whole. Still, he is the highest-ranking
U.S. official ever to make such a statement regarding the treatment
of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The audience of about 300 tribal leaders, BIA employees and
federal officials stood and cheered as a teary-eyed Gover finished
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was a very heroic and historic moment,'' said
Susan Masten, chairwoman of California's Yurok tribe and president
of the National Congress of American Indians. ''For us, there was a
lot of emotion in that apology. It's important for us to begin to
heal from what has been done since non-Indian contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Tortalita, the governor of New Mexico's Acoma Pueblo
tribe, welcomed the apology but said, ''If we could get an apology
from the whole government, that would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gover's statement did not come from the White House,
President Clinton's chief adviser on Indian issues, Lynn Cutler,
said Gover sent her a copy of his speech late Thursday and the
White House did not object to it.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's government has formally apologized for abuses in
government-run boarding schools for Indians but has rejected calls
for a broader apology. Australian Prime Minister John Howard also
has rebuffed repeated calls for an apology to that country's
Aboriginal population for similar abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Gover recited a litany of wrongs the BIA inflicted on Indians
since its creation as the Indian Office of the War Department.
Estimates vary widely, but the agency is believed responsible for
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agency participated in the ethnic cleansing that befell
the Western tribes,'' Gover said. ''It must be acknowledged that
the deliberate spread of disease, the decimation of the mighty
bison herds, the use of the poison alcohol to destroy mind and
body, and the cowardly killing of women and children made for
tragedy on a scale so ghastly that it cannot be dismissed as merely
the inevitable consequence of the clash of competing ways of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The misery continued after the BIA became part of the Interior
Department in 1849, Gover said. Children were brutalized in BIA-run
boarding schools, Indian languages and religious practices were
banned and traditional tribal governments were eliminated, he said.
The high rates of alcoholism, suicide and violence in Indian
communities today are the result, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Poverty, ignorance and disease have been the product of this
agency's work,'' Gover said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 90 percent of the BIA's 10,000 employees are Indian and the
agency has changed into an advocate for tribal governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never again will we attack your religions, your languages,
your rituals, or any of your tribal ways,'' Gover promised. ''Never
again will we seize your children, nor teach them to be ashamed of
who they are. Never again.''

<HEADLINE> Internet pedophilia charge against Catholic school leader  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - The principal of a Catholic grade
school in the Bronx was arrested Friday and accused of sending
sexually explicit images of children over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   James Irwin, 51, of Yonkers, principal of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel school, pleaded innocent at his arraignment in Yonkers City
Court. He did not return a phone call to his home.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said the children in
the photographs apparently were not from Mount Carmel, which
enrolls about 290 children aged 4 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   At the school on Bathgate Avenue, only half a day of classes had
been scheduled, and the children had been sent home before parents
could be notified of Irwin's arrest. Afterward, some teachers had a
meeting at the school, but questions were referred to Monsignor
John Ruvo, the pastor, and then to Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for
the Archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said Irwin, the school's principal for 15 years,
''won't be going back to Our Lady of Mount Carmel.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never had any complaints or indications of anything
being amiss with him,'' Zwilling said. ''We were very surprised to
learn this morning that he had been arrested. ... We will be
looking, investigating as much as we possibly can to see if there's
anything in the past, any activity that we may have missed or not
been aware of at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was the 36th man charged in Westchester County in
connection with Internet pedophilia in the four years since the
district attorney established an office targeting the offense.
Seven other cases are pending and the other 28 have all brought
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of those men, Irwin was caught in a sting involving an
undercover agent.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, the agent posed as a man interested in child
pornography, Pirro said. After a discussion online, ''This
defendant indicated that he was willing to send to the investigator
images of children engaged in sexual activity, and that's just what
he did.'' The alleged offense occurred between Aug. 2 and Sept. 1,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was charged with seven counts of promoting an obscene
sexual performance by a minor. He could be sentenced to seven years
in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Agents seized his home computer, a Gateway laptop, which was
displayed at Pirro's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''This computer, in addition to the records of America Online as
well as the communications with the undercover from my office, will
substantiate the felony charges,'' the district attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the origin of the pictures, Pirro said, ''Our
investigation will continue to find out who is making these images,
who is transmitting them and who is in possession of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet, as positive and as wonderful an innovation as it
is, is a tool for pedophiles,'' Pirro said. ''They're out there
looking for children, our children, to engage in sexual activity
with, or as in a case like this, promoting obscene sexual
performances by children. This is the reality of today's world.''

<HEADLINE> America feasts on double-fried frites, boutique beer -- and Belgian royalty </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Forget Diana and Charles, of the historic 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Philippe and Mathilde, of Belgium, a pair of practical
royals fit for the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince and his suave princess are set for a five-day,
17-event royal tour of New York meant to crown double-fried frites
(known to culinary commoners as french fries) and beer as stylish -
and profitable. That even means dropping by a Manhattan supermarket
to tout all things Belgian.
</P>
<P>
   The new royals have been the centerpiece of Europe's fantasy
life since their December wedding bells, heard by tens of
thousands, with F-16s flying over the palace in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   But after they fly into New York on Saturday, accompanied by a
phalanx of European media, the prince will be ringing the opening
bell at the New York Stock Exchange. And he'll be dipping into
dollars - selling Belgian products.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden fascination with a country of 10 million whose
image has often paled against its southern neighbor, France?
</P>
<P>
   This is the New World, ever in search of fresh things to taste,
drink and see.
</P>
<P>
   And ''Belgium is a well-kept secret that deserves to be better
known by many more Americans,'' the prince said before the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, New York has fallen hard for things Belgian, sprouting
restaurants like Belgo, an East Village eatery that serves mussels
20 ways and 101 beers with names like Lucifer and Delirium Tremens
to a twentysomething crowd; its floor-to-ceiling design ''bands''
are patterned after the growth rings of the mussel shell.
</P>
<P>
   A lower Manhattan neighborhood in the West Village, peppered
with bistros and other Belgian eateries, is dubbed Little Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Belgian chocolates, Godiva has been joined by
such rarefied producers as Hans Burie, which offers the White House
handmade in chocolate and an all-chocolate, life-size car, or
Nirvana, ''the best chocolates this side of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The royal couple will blitz Manhattan, from a fund-raiser for
the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce at the very exclusive
Metropolitan Club to a presentation to show it's not all about
hedonism - a hard-sell about Belgian biotechnology at the World
Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, Belgium's future king wields power with real
political teeth: The constitutional monarchy appoints each new
government, uniting a linguistic patchwork of Dutch and
French-speakers often at each other's ethnic throats.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old prince and his 27-year-old princess both speak
English; he studied at Oxford and Stanford universities, and has
led other trade missions.
</P>
<P>
   The recent health problems of Belgium's King Albert II, 66, have
started tongues wagging that he might yield the throne to his son.
</P>
<P>
   But, although the prince drives a Porsche and flies F-16s, he's
no fast-lane eye-catcher. As in the case of Britain's reserved
Prince Charles and the scintillating Princess Diana, it took the
''Mathilde Factor'' for the Belgian royals to seduce the world.
</P>
<P>
   After a secret three-year courtship, the prince suddenly
announced his betrothal last autumn to Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz, a
young aristocrat working as a speech therapist. She is to become
the first Belgian-born queen in her nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the young woman will hit the South Bronx to visit a
halfway house run by a Belgian nun who is a chaplain at Rikers
Island jail.
</P>
<P>
   And, three years after the death of Diana - as beloved in New
York as at home - America will get a look at a new princess dubbed
the ''Queen of Hearts.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals judge allows Labor Day Parade participate to cook  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A state appeals court judge, overruling the city
and a lower court decision, said Friday that participants in
Saturday's Labor Day Parade will be allowed limited outdoor cooking
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Richard Wallach of the State Supreme Court's Appellate
Division said cooked food and food service from vehicles will be
allowed from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. in the parade's staging area,
from 44th to 48th streets between Fifth and Madison avenues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wallach limited cooked food service to ''frankfurters,
hamburgers and sausages,'' to be distributed from carts and trucks
approved by the Department of Health ''as evidenced by a currently
valid decal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're cooking with gas now,'' said Douglas Menagh, lawyer for
the New York City Central Labor Council. The council, a group of
about 500 unions that plan and run the parade, sued the city over
rules governing the event.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, most of which have been on the books for years but
mostly unenforced, include no open-flame cooking, no food service
from parked vehicles, and no alcohol. Menagh said police didn't
tell the unions until Aug. 30 that rules governing outdoor events
would be strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Menagh complained Thursday to Justice Bruce Allen that the
unions would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if they were
prevented, on such short notice, from selling food.
</P>
<P>
   Many locals have already paid for food, services and equipment
to accommodate an expected 500,000 people at this year's
festivities, with some union locals spending close to $20,000,
Menagh argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen ruled in favor of the city. The judge said that
despite the unions' possible financial losses, he could not stop
the city from enforcing existing laws. On Friday, Menagh appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We argued that after 20 years of not enforcing these rules,
police should not be allowed to enforce them now, especially since
they only gave us 10 days notice,'' said Menagh. ''That 20 years of
silence is deafening.''
</P>
<P>
   Menagh said the unions agreed to the alcohol ban because it is
consistent with their position on public drinking.
</P>
<P>
   City Corporation Counsel Michael Hess said Wallach ''in a sense,
split the difference.'' He said the judge reiterated that open
flames are banned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern, and the judge recognized that, was health and
safety,'' Hess said. ''We're very pleased with the decision. We
don't have a beef with the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade starts at 11 a.m. Saturday. It will begin at 44th
Street and proceed north on Fifth Avenue to 72nd Street. The
reviewing stand is at Fifth Avenue and 69th Street.

<HEADLINE> Polling firm settles dispute with Microsoft over ''spam'' blacklist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An Internet polling company has removed
Microsoft Corp. from a federal lawsuit that accused a string of
Internet service providers of blocking correspondence with many of
its 6.6 million online panelists.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive Inc., the publisher of the Harris poll, said
Friday that e-mail links have been restored with nearly 1.2 million
members served by Microsoft's Hotmail e-mail service.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Rochester-based company dropped Microsoft from a
lawsuit filed here in July that accused more than a dozen Internet
service providers of blocking e-mail to as many as 2.7 million
panelists.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arose when Mail Abuse Prevention System, a nonprofit
California company established to fight e-mail abuse, added Harris
to a blacklist of businesses that purportedly send unsolicited,
bulk e-mails or ''spam'' - an accusation the market research
company denies.
</P>
<P>
   The company also dropped America Online Inc. from its lawsuit in
August, but is seeking unspecified damages from Redwood City,
Calif.-based MAPS as well as AltaVista Co. and six other service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our e-mail is getting through to over 98 percent of our
members,'' said Harris spokesman Ben Black. ''We're in negotiations
with all the ISPs (Internet service providers) and the negotiations
are going extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ISPs dropped from the lawsuit, he said, ''didn't even
realize they were blocking us.''

<HEADLINE> Governor asks council to stop bear hunt  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman wants New Jersey's
first planned bear hunt in three decades stopped, and has asked the
state Fish and Game Council to call it off.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Friday she would allow local police to kill bears
deemed dangerous as a way to combat the state's growing bear
nuisance problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our strategy recognizes that potentially dangerous contacts
between bears and humans in New Jersey have been on a dramatic
increase and it authorizes lethal force on those bears that pose an
immediate threat,'' Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that our bear management strategy will provide a
higher degree of overall safety than the proposed random hunt,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman does not have the legal power as governor to order the
hunt canceled, said spokesman Pete McDonough. She outlined her
request to suspend the hunt in a letter to the council Friday, 10
days before it was scheduled start.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Game Council Chairman John W. Bradway Sr. refused to
comment on Whitman's request or what action council members plan.
The group meets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we will discuss it, it will be in executive session. It
won't be in public,'' Bradway said. Two members asked him to hold
those discussions privately, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Whitman's five-point plan, bears considered a nuisance would
be relocated, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a nuisance bear that has been relocated and has been tagged
returns and becomes a nuisance again, that's it. This is one strike
and you're out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor proposed more money and training for police and
increases to the Department of Environmental Protection's bear task
force. Whitman also plans public education programs designed to
limit human encounters, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is everything we've been asking her to do all along. The
hunt wasn't going to solve anybody's problems,'' said Janine Motta,
a spokeswoman for New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Motta, whose group had gone to court to block the hunt, praised
Whitman's proposal to train local police because they often respond
to incidents before state experts can get there.
</P>
<P>
   The state does recognize the potential dangers with bears in
populated areas, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have logged 29 cases where bears entered homes,
25 attacks on livestock and 40 pet attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Another 34 incidents with ''aggressive'' bears have been
reported, and 1,600 complaints from residents have been filed,
McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt is scheduled to begin Sept. 18 and is open to anyone
with a hunting license. Although the season could last until
December, wildlife officials have said hunters might reach the
175-bear harvest limit in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Council ordered the first bear hunt in 29
years to curb a bear population it estimates at more than 1,000.
Residents in northern New Jersey, the heart of the bear population,
have complained the animals have broken into cars and homes, killed
pets, destroyed property and scared people.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the division has overestimated the number of bears
and hasn't researched enough alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 towns have passed resolutions opposing a bear hunt.
West Milford has joined the Animal Rights Alliance and some
residents in filing an appeal to the state Fish and Game Council
order allowing the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill calling for
cancellation of the hunt, but the Assembly did not take up the
measure before it ended its session for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm certainly encouraged that the governor's office is doing
what they can to postpone the hunt,'' bill sponsor Sen. Louis C.
Bassano, R-Union, said.

<P>
   The delay gives the Assembly time to debate the hunting ban,
Bassano said.

<P>
   ''I believe that we have the votes to pass that legislation,''
he said.

   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, said in a statement he
supports Whitman's proposal.

   ''I will personally provide whatever legislative support is
necessary to fund and staff the alternative proposal offered today
by the governor,'' Collins said.

<HEADLINE> IRS Citizen Board Confirmed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after Congress legislated sweeping
changes in the operations of the Internal Revenue Service, the
Senate finally confirmed seven people to serve as ''private life''
members of an IRS oversight board.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate confirmed the group by voice vote Friday, ending
months of roadblocks erected by individual senators often for
unrelated reasons. The Treasury secretary and IRS commissioner are
permanent members of the nine-member board.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS overhaul gave the panel the power to review agency
operations to ensure taxpayers are treated properly and oversight
responsibilities regarding management and recommendations for
future IRS commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a talented group of people who will bring many skills
to the nation's tax agency,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles
Rossotti. ''The oversight board is an important part of our efforts
to modernize the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven approved Friday are:
</P>
<P>
   --George L. Farr, former vice chairman of American Express, to a
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   --Charles L. Kolbe, an Iowa cattle rancher, to a three-year term.
</P>
<P>
   --Nancy Killefer, a former Treasury Department official, to a
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   --Larry R. Levitan, former partner at Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co., to a
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Nickles, law professor at Wake Forest University, to a
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Tobias, former president of the National Treasury
Employees Union, to a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   --Karen Hastie Williams, a partner at Crowell &AMP; Moring law firm,
to a three-year term.

<HEADLINE> District attorney's house listed for $5.2 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, whose
mover-and-shaker husband lost his job when he was convicted of tax
fraud, said Friday that they are selling their much-gossiped-about
home for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-room house in Harrison, which was closely scrutinized for
Albert Pirro's trial, is listed for $5.2 million and has held
fabulous parties for the likes of Donald Trump and Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But ''it's just bricks and mortar,'' the district attorney said
during an unusual, informal chat with reporters. ''As long as the
children are with me and everybody's healthy, everything's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no idea where she would end up living, but
wants to remain close to her White Plains office. There has been
speculation that the district attorney, who earns $136,000 a year,
would take a higher-paying private job to make up for her husband's
lost salary as a real estate attorney and lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro and his accountant, his brother Anthony, are
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 28 for deducting $1.2 million in
personal expenses as business write-offs. Many of the expenses,
including electronic gates, a wrought-iron pigpen and a paneled
wine cellar, involved the Pirros' home.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro said he spent $2 to $3 million on his defense. An
appeal could cost $1 million more.

<HEADLINE> Prague Jews Will Rebury Remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The Jewish community will rebury
remains of 120 people unearthed during construction in downtown
Prague at a new site to comply with religious rules, an official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Workers found the remains when they hit a 13th century Jewish
cemetery two years ago during construction of an underground garage
under the building of Czech insurance company Ceska Pojistovna.
</P>
<P>
   An archaeological dig started in February 1999 subsequently
unearthed 120 skeletal remains, provoking strong protests from
Jewish organizations at home and abroad, which saw it as a
desecration of a Jewish burial site. Building at the site was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there has been a debate on whether to rebury the
remains at the old site under the building or at a new site.
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Danicek, head of Prague's Jewish community, said in a
statement Friday that progress in the construction means the bodies
cannot be reburied at the old site.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that on the recommendation of the country's
head rabbi, the Jewish community had decided to ''bury the remains
at the New Prague Jewish Cemetery, where all related religious
rules can be complied with without problems.'' l

<HEADLINE> Breast-Implant Photos on FDA Site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal health officials are posting on the
Internet stark photographs of what a woman's breast looks like when
a breast implant leaks or causes other problems, an effort to
ensure women are fully informed of the risks before surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the Food and Drug Administration ruled that
saline-filled breast implants could continue selling even though
they break open at high rates -- as long as women are informed that
one in six will require additional surgery within three years to
fix problems.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA demands that surgeons provide special brochures
detailing those risks before surgery. But critics contend that by
the time women visit a surgeon, most already have decided to get
the implants and won't heed warnings -- even if the surgeon doesn't
downplay them.
</P>
<P>
   And in an emotional meeting last spring, women told the FDA that
written warnings don't convey what their chests look like after an
implant failure. The FDA's scientific advisers urged the agency to
provide photographs for potential implant recipients.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials searched the Internet and found one plastic
surgery group that did show such photographs but paired them with
other pictures showing that corrective surgery could help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't feel that was very balanced,'' FDA medical device
chief Dr. David Feigal said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So the FDA has posted on its Web page --
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants -- photographs showing three
complaints. They are: capsular contracture, when scar tissue around
the implant tightens enough to cause painful breast disfigurement;
a deflated implant; and how the breasts wrinkle and sag if
problem-causing implants are removed but not replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Also available is a consumer handbook detailing the
controversial history of breast implants and other options, such as
rebuilding breasts using fat from other parts of the body. The free
handbook also is available by calling 1-888-INFO-FDA, and the
agency hopes to add the photos to an accompanying brochure within a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Saline-filled implants are the only implant option for most
women. Some 130,000 women received them last year. The FDA has
banned silicone-gel filled breast implants except for a few women
who get them in strictly controlled clinical trials.

<HEADLINE> Faith-school issue divides village; courts may decide  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO, N.Y. (AP) - Michael Havens thought he had a great idea
for his students to raise money: Sell bricks to members of the
community and allow personal messages to be etched on them, then
use the bricks to repave the sidewalk in front of the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was beautiful,'' said Havens, who saw the same thing during
a trip to Idaho a couple of years ago. ''We have a beautiful
Georgian building, and changing the blacktopped front entranceway
to nicely, personally engraved bricks seemed like a nice idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to everybody in this quiet village of 1,500 at the eastern
edge of Lake Ontario, about 30 miles north of Syracuse. Once
religion was brought into the mix, tempers flared.
</P>
<P>
   Now the school district is being sued in a battle of
constitutional issues - freedom of speech vs. the separation of
church and state - and Havens, the former superintendent, is long
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Three residents - two of them reverends - filed suit Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Albany, charging the district with violating
their free speech and equal protection rights.
</P>
<P>
   One of the litigants, the Rev. Ronald Russell, pastor of the
Church of God, helped ignite the dispute with a simple purchase. He
bought a handful of bricks for his son Joshua's graduating class of
1999 and had two Christian messages etched on them: ''Jesus Saves''
and ''Jesus Christ is the Lord of this School.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was a great idea, tremendous,'' said Russell, who
served in the U.S. Air Force for 24 years before becoming a pastor.
''They were a great fundraiser and really enhanced the school's
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Passer didn't think so. She didn't like what she saw on
the sidewalk in front of Mexico Academy and Central School and
challenged district officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't against the bricks,'' said Passer, whose husband
teaches math at the school. ''I was for some guidelines. They were
allowing people to put whatever they wanted on them. So we went
over, walked the walk, wrote down the ones we had objections to and
tried to talk with them about it. We tried to discuss this with
them for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, district officials moved the bricks in question under
a bush. Then, after some legal advice, they responded to Passer's
complaint by placing a metal plaque on the brick path: ''The
messages on this walk are the personal expressions and
contributions of the individuals of Mexico Academy and Central
School Community.''
</P>
<P>
   Passer was not placated, so she bought her own brick in February
and had ''Keep Abortion Legal'' inscribed on it. ''I feel very
strongly about a woman's right to control her body,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials blocked her purchase, then removed the bricks
inscribed with Jesus and redid the rules. The use of Jesus is
prohibited in public schools because it promotes one religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to, but I had to put them in a position where
they could see that a plaque from them saying these are
contributions to the Mexico Academy and Central School community
was not enough,'' said Passer, who is Jewish. ''We are not of that
belief system. This is a public school. If you want private values,
you go to private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Havens, who had been a fixture in the 2,800-student district for
24 years before leaving for another district in April, said the
district lawyer advised that the bricks inappropriately promoted
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an outcry among residents in this devoutly
religious community, which has eight churches, four of them within
100 feet of one another, on Church Street.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbfounded, in March, on a hill next to his church, Russell
stuck a big wooden cross in the grass with this message tacked
across the front: ''Welcome to Mexico! A Town Where Jesus Christ Is
Not Welcomed in the Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We made a statement with it,'' said Russell, who removed the
sign after about 10 days. ''There's no doubt everybody takes sides
on an issue like this, and that's a shame because it wasn't meant
to be provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Erected at a somewhat obscure site, that sign was easy to miss.
Not so for the one 71-year-old Hadwen Hinman stuck in his front
yard for a month. It read: ''Jesus Christ is Still Lord of This
School.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a disciple of Jesus Christ, first of all,'' said Hinman, a
former mayor who has lived in the same house across the street from
the high school since he got out of the Army in 1954. ''Secondly,
the Constitution was written by the principles of the Bible, and to
deny people the right to put a brick in that says 'Jesus Saves' or
'Jesus is Christ' is against my right in the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame,'' said Hinman, who was in the fourth grade when
the school was built in 1938 and graduated from it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have given in on having a Menorah at Christmas time because
we had a Christmas tree in front of the school,'' Hinman said.
''Well, a Christmas tree does not denote anything of Jesus Christ.
It's strictly secular. We couldn't have a picture of Jesus up, we
couldn't have the crib, we couldn't have Mary and Joseph, we had to
change our Christmas Special to Winter Special, we had to change
our Easter Program to Spring Program. All because of one family.
Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   Along Main Street, several businesses joined the fight, putting
up small ''Jesus Is Lord'' signs in their windows. It was part of a
campaign launched by five churches that banded together and
distributed 1,000 pins, 1,000 signs, and 1,000 bumper stickers
bearing that message.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bricks were like a final straw of a continuation of the
policy of zero access and freedom of gathering, freedom of
speech,'' said 43-year-old Paul Anderson, assistant pastor at
Believers Chapel whose family has lived in the area for four
generations. He is one of the litigants. ''It was the catalyst for
a bunch of pastors to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Duane Comes, who graduated from the high school in June, said a
lot of people were tired of the whole ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are getting annoyed with it now,'' Comes said.
''They think that it should be over. But I keep telling everybody,
'What if it was you, what if it was your brick, your opinion or
your belief?' You're not going to want it taken it away.'''
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to go to trial in the spring, said Steven
H. Aden of the Rutherford Institute, the Virginia-based legal aid
society for conservative religious causes that is representing the
three residents who are suing.
</P>
<P>
   Interim superintendent Robert DiFlorio said the taxpayers can't
afford to fight the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This district is poor,'' DiFlorio said. ''If this is a form of
punishment, it's not a very Christian attitude.''

<HEADLINE> Naval Aviation Seen Facing Problems  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Naval aviation is suffering from serious
training and funding problems, and many aviators believe their
service's leaders are afraid to admit or address the matter
forthrightly, the Navy's inspector general said in a report
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''From captains to airmen, we heard grave concern that Navy
leadership is either out of touch or uninformed, or just does not
care enough to address the plight of our people in meaningful
ways,'' Vice Adm. Lee F. Gunn, the inspector general, wrote of his
findings from surveying naval aviators nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The study was completed April 28 but not made public until
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn said the problems in naval aviation stem from money
shortfalls and a mismatch between resources and requirements. He
also said there was evidence of ''self-inflicted wounds'' from
internal Navy decision making.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the overall combat readiness of naval
aviation is ''largely being maintained at acceptable, albeit
declining, levels.'' To maintain this readiness, aviators and
sailors are being overworked, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people have had enough, and they have not been shy about
telling us of their anger and frustration,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious problems in naval aviation is a decline
in training, it said. This has resulted in part from a shortage of
aircraft spare parts, which means air squadrons have fewer planes
available during the times they are training for overseas
deployments -- the most stressful period of training.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of training opportunities with advanced weapons, such as
precision-guided missiles, has taken a toll on actual Navy aviation
missions, the inspector general concluded. The rate of successful
strikes on targets in Iraq -- during missions patrolling the
''no-fly'' zone in southern Iraq -- and in Kosovo during last year's
air campaign was ''far below those that should be achievable,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of shortages of advanced weapons available for training,
some air crews drop these weapons for the first time in actual
combat.

	   GARFIELD, N.J. (AP) - The borough's public works superintendent
is accused of stealing money from a locked desk at police

<P>
   Police had set up a hidden camera in the office where the thefts
occurred after the first two incidents occurred on Aug. 11 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately $900 was taken in the three thefts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Election Monitors,300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Passaic County's elections this fall will be
overseen by a federal monitor who'll look to ensure that Hispanic
voters have full access to the balloting process.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three federal judges Thursday appointed a former
federal prosecutor in Newark to oversee the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Timpone will earn up to $275 per hour to oversee the
vote. He'll start work Monday, moving into an office at the county
administration building in Paterson.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also monitor the election for the state Attorney General's
office, which initially wanted a retired Superior Court judge to do
the work.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job, as I see it, as monitor is to see that anybody who has
the right to vote can vote,'' Timpone said. ''It's as simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Timpone's appointment is the latest action by the federal
government to ensure that Passaic County's elections are accessible
to Hispanic voters. Last year, the Justice Department threatened to
sue the county and city of Passaic over an alleged pattern of
discrimination against Spanish-speaking voters.
</P>
<P>
   The county and city avoided a suit by agreeing to new procedures
in election districts with high Hispanic populations, such as
printing ballots in Spanish and English, advertising election
notices in Spanish-language newspapers, and hiring bilingual poll
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Timpone, 49, worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark from
1984 to 1995, serving as chief of special prosecutions, overseeing
corruption cases against public officials. He also was part of a
commission appointed by Gov. Whitman to investigate the failure of
the state's new auto-inspection system.

<HEADLINE> Garvey Expresses Shock at Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steve Garvey expressed shock Friday at being
sued by the Federal Trade Commission for acting as host of a diet
drug advertisement that federal regulators contend was deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last month, builds on an April suit that alleged
Enforma Natural Products Inc. and two of its principals, Andrew
Grey and Fred Zinos, made ''false and unsubstantiated'' claims
about ''The Enforma System.''
</P>
<P>
   The company claimed in television and Internet ads that users
could lose weight without dieting or exercise, regardless of how
much they ate.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1969-82 and
the San Diego Padres from 1983-87, was the host on an Enforma
infomercial and appeared on the company's World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my knowledge, this would represent a precedent in that a
host is being asked to bear financial responsibility for a product
he endorses, and that he has found to work,'' Garvey said in a
statement. ''For this reason, we fully expect the support of the
Screen Actors Guild in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my understanding that everything stated in the
infomercial was in strict compliance with the law, and I had every
reason to believe that Enforma's legal representatives had
performed due diligence by reading materials discussing the
research on the ingredients in the Enforma system.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said the product had worked for him and his family, and
added: ''I have always been an advocate of exercise and responsible
nutrition, and never suggested that people should not exercise or
eat responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement listed in the complaint, Garvey said, ''Look at
all these delicious supposedly forbidden foods: barbecued chicken
and ribs, buttered biscuits. Foods you can eat when you crave them
without guilt, without worry, and it's all because of a few little
capsules.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enforma System consists of two diet supplements. One
prevents absorption of dietary fat, and the other increases the
body's capacity to burn fat, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Enforma Natural Products already settled the FTC suit against it
with an agreement to return $10 million to customers. Another
Enforma infomercial host, Lark Kendall -- identified in the ad as
Kendall Carson, nutritionist -- also agreed to a settlement,
surrendering her talent fee and accepting an order not to
''misrepresent her professional status'' or repeat claims she made
about Enforma.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey's management company, Garvey Management Group Inc., also
was named in the August suit along with the infomercial producer
and executives of the production company.
</P>
<P>
   A first baseman, Garvey played in nine All Star games and was
the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Enforma System purchasers seeking refunds can
complete forms from the FTC's Web site, http://www.ftc.gov, or call
202-326-3123.

<HEADLINE> Accusations From Banking Committee  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee chairman is
accusing the Clinton administration of ''secretly'' giving some
banks approval to buy stocks of commercial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, says Treasury Department officials are
trying to give banks powers they did not get under major
legislation enacted last November allowing them to expand into
other financial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Leach made his objections public Friday in a letter to
Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke, Jr., whose Treasury
division oversees nationally chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke later responded that it was appropriate for his agency to
give permission and that it did not have to be put into a formal,
written policy because it only affected three banks.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said he had learned that Hawke's office ''has given verbal
approval to at least two national banks to acquire and hold ...
shares of stock of commercial companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The banks and companies were not named.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secret verbal approvals of this extraordinary nature
communicated by (federal) bank examiners are blatant attempts ...
to change the regulatory framework'' of the financial services law
enacted last year, Leach told Hawke. In addition, he said, they
represent ''a usurpation of the Congress' law-making powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach's letter followed a meeting between the two men on
Wednesday at which Leach raised the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response released late Friday afternoon, Hawke said
the three banks are being allowed to buy the shares and hold them
temporarily as a way to hedge their risks in derivatives
transactions. The banks use the stocks ''solely for hedging'' and
not for investment or speculative purposes, he told Leach.
</P>
<P>
   The stock purchases ''have no implications at all ... for
breaching the wall between banking and commerce,'' Hawke said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he maintained, since the permission only applies to
three banks, a verbal ''supervisory answer'' was sufficient rather
than a written policy.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives, which are traded around the globe in an $80
trillion market, are complex financial instruments whose value
depends on the value or change in value of an underlying security,
commodity or asset.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping financial services law removed Depression-era
barriers and allowed banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to get into one another's businesses. It does not,
however, allow banks to acquire commercial companies or vice versa.
Chase Manhattan Bank cannot buy General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy-makers, Leach among them, have long opposed the
mixing of banking and commerce, which they believe could expose
taxpayers to huge risk by giving commercial and industrial
companies access to federal deposit insurance and other guarantees
for banks.
</P>
<P>
   Leach asked Hawke to provide documents related to the issue by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time a Republican lawmaker tangled with the
presidentially appointed Comptroller. In May 1997, then-Sens.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., accused
Hawke's predecessor, Eugene Ludwig, of trying to expand his domain
by recruiting state-chartered banks to convert to nationally
chartered status.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 120; Dow Falls 39  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks dropped sharply Friday,
carrying the rest of the market lower, as investors reacting to a
series of earnings warnings decided to take profits from the
market's recent rally.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index closed down 119.94 at
3,978.41, giving the Nasdaq a drop of 255.92 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 39.22 at 11,220.65,
giving the average a drop of 18.13 for the week, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 8.01 to 1,494.50, leaving it 26.27 points
lower on the week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's declines extended a volatility streak that began
Tuesday, when traders returned from the Labor Day holiday.
Investors started the week by abandoning tech stocks in favor of
blue chips; they then turned their strategy around entirely on
Thursday and revamped it again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the volatility was a series of warnings
throughout the week from companies that their upcoming earnings
reports would fall short of investors' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're doing now is pricing in some measure of an economic
slowdown. We're looking at a fair number of warnings about
slowdowns in the third quarter,'' said Chris Dickerson, an analyst
with Global Market Strategists in Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened Friday, an earnings warning from
Gadzoox Networks pushed its shares down $2.06 -- just over 20
percent -- to $8.25 on the Nasdaq. Gadzoox helps companies connect
computers that store large amounts of information.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive parts maker TRW's stock fell $1.44 to $43.81,
although it recovered from an earlier drop of nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   First Data dropped $2.69 to $41, a more than 6 percent decline,
after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Corp. analyst downgraded the
credit-card transaction processor's stock to ''outperform'' from
''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech communications firm MPower Communications fell $3.44
to $8.88, a decline of more than 27 percent, after a Merrill Lynch
analyst cuts its rating to ''accumulate'' from ''buy.'' The
downgrade came a day after MPower revised its third- and
fourth-quarter outlook downward, saying its haste to get to the
market proved more costly than it expected.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, shares of retailer Burlington Coat Factory
surged $2.13 to $15 -- a 16 percent jump -- after it reported an
increase in its sales at stores open at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, the Global Market Strategists analyst, said the
market's focus on tech stocks one day, then blue chips another
reflected its lack of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the week, investors had bid blue chips higher. But they
shifted their attention to the Nasdaq on Thursday, sending it up
85.01, while the Dow fell 50.77 after chemical company DuPont
warned that its earnings would be down because of soft demand and
increased costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime anything looks to be moving, money mangers jump into
that sector because they have to squeeze out what percentage of
profit they can. They'll jump in for a couple of days and then jump
out,'' Dickerson said. ''There's a rush almost to avoid not losing
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 7.12 at 535.70 -- down 6.21 from a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.19 billion
shares, less than the 1.21 billion shares in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.23 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 1.43 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 1.32 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> Austria Sanctions Recommended Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A European Union report on Friday said diplomatic
sanctions against Austria were becoming counterproductive and
should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel and Vice
Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer of the far-right Freedom Party
called on the organization to end the sanctions ''exactly as fast
as'' as they were imposed in February.
</P>
<P>
   The 119-page report by a three-member panel was submitted Friday
to French President Jaques Chirac, whose country now holds the
six-month rotating European Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was appointed by the European Union in July to examine
Austria and the sanctions that EU governments imposed to express
their discontent over the inclusion of Joerg Haider's Freedom Party
in Austria's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The party had run an anti-immigrant campaign and Haider made
statements supportive of some aspects of the Nazi regime, though he
has denied pro-Nazi leanings.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the Freedom Party had populist and radical
elements. It also said that the Austrian public was aware of the
existence of racism, anti-Semitism and antipathy to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the sanctions had ''already triggered
nationalistic feelings in Austria'' because they had sometimes been
interpreted as directed against the Austrian people rather than the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the measures would be ''counterproductive''
if kept in place and therefore should be ''ended.'' It concluded
that Austria was ''respectful of common European values.''
</P>
<P>
   The document said Austria showed a level of consideration for
the rights of immigrants, refugees and minorities that was on a par
with other EU nations and in some cases was superior.
</P>
<P>
   Under the sanctions, Austria's EU partners broke off all
bilateral political contacts with the govenment in Vienna,
restricted the advancement of Austrian personnel at EU headquarters
in Brussels and snubbed Austrian ministers at routine meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic measures also include boycotts of school trips,
cultural exchanges and military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The three experts -- former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
former Spanish Foreign Minister Marcelino Oreja and German law
expert Jochen Frowein -- turned their report over to Chirac in a
45-minute meeting. Chirac had no comment. France has been one of
Austria's most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Foreign Minister Karl-Heinz Grasse, speaking in
Versailles, urged Austria's EU partners to lift the sanctions
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were imposed in one day,'' said Grasser. ''They can be
lifted swiftly.''

<HEADLINE> China's President Speaks of Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FACKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said Friday
he wants to build friendly ties with the United States, and
Washington can do the same by honoring Beijing's claim to Taiwan
and granting China permanent normal trading status.
</P>
<P>
   In his only policy address while in New York for the U.N.
Millennium Summit, Jiang stressed that China was not a threat to
the United States. He said his country sought to be a constructive
member of the international community, a goal the United States
could help bring about by supporting China's efforts to modernize
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''A developed China will play a positive role in maintaining
world peace and stability and will by no means pose a threat to
anybody,'' Jiang told a luncheon attended by more than 300 U.S.
business executives.
</P>
<P>
   However, he also reiterated warnings against what he called
''interfering in each other's internal affairs'' -- a barb aimed at
U.S. criticism of China on human rights and other issues, most
particularly Taiwan. Jiang called Taiwan the biggest issue still
dividing his country and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive
question in China-U.S. relations,'' he said. ''Our relations have
experienced ups and downs over the decades, most of which can be
traced to the Taiwan question.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and the trade pact were among the topics covered Friday
during a 90-minute meeting between Jiang and President Clinton,
according to American officials. The two also discussed missile
proliferation, religious freedom in Tibet and China, and
developments in North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States officially supports Beijing's position that
Taiwan, which split with China during the communist takeover in
1949, is still part of China and must eventually reunite with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has been critical of threats in the past by
Beijing to use force if Taiwan tries to declare independence.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang sought to strike a conciliatory tone, urging the United
States to honor its pledges not to support Taiwanese independence
while proclaiming a willingness to talk directly with Taiwan's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also spoke at length on economic ties, calling on the U.S.
Senate to pass a bill it is now debating that would give China
status as a normal trading partner, offering it the same permanent
access to U.S. markets enjoyed by most trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will vote on the bill next week. It has faced bitter
opposition by some U.S. lawmakers and labor leaders, partly out of
fears more U.S. companies will move production to low-cost
factories in China.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday he believed the trade legislation
would pass, though ''we still have more work to do'' to line up
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said the measure offers a ''win-win outcome'' for his
country and the United States, both by opening China's markets to
foreign products and by strengthening China's bid to join the World
Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Senator's boat sinks with none aboard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Sen. Frank Lautenberg's Filibuster got all
wet.
</P>
<P>
   The Filibuster, a powerboat owned by the New Jersey Democrat,
hit rocks and sank after breaking loose from its mooring off
Martha's Vineyard in strong winds, his office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No one was aboard and Lautenberg was not at his summer house on
the Massachusetts island at the time, spokeswoman Retha Sherrod
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Fin powerboat was recovered and was brought ashore to
a lot of the Martha's Vineyard Shipyard, said Judy Searle, a worker
in the yard's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Martha's Vineyard Times reported that Tisbury harbormaster
Jay Wilbur said the 29-foot twin outboard and another craft in the
outer harbor got loose Monday night during northeast winds of about
30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a sheltered harbor in a northeast wind,'' Wilbur told
the weekly.
</P>
<P>
   A message left Friday for Wilbur was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg spokeswoman Retha Sherrod said the senator was
unavailable to comment Friday, but said the boat was a 25-footer.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Ballet Cancels Season  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The money-strapped Cleveland San Jose Ballet
has laid off its 41 dancers and 40 staff members, canceled its
upcoming season and left the future of its West Coast partner in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fair to the dancers and staff to have to worry every
week whether they will be paid,'' said Robert Jones, president of
the Cleveland board.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Ballet entered a joint venture in 1985 to create a
ballet known in San Jose, Calif., as the San Jose Cleveland Ballet
and elsewhere as the Cleveland San Jose Ballet. Although they share
dancers, the twin programs are financially independent and governed
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the San Jose end, which is solvent, the Cleveland arm has
operated in the red for the last decade, incurring a deficit of
$300,000 last year. Two weeks ago, Jones said the season would be
canceled unless $1 million were raised. Only $60,000 was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Audience count in 1999 reached 78,000 in Cleveland and 70,000 in
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose executive director Andrew Bales said he had ''no clue''
whether the San Jose could begin as scheduled next month:
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we don't at this time have the dancers and
repertoire we have sold to the community.''

<HEADLINE> Jet's wreckage is spotted, surviving pilot identified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIGANTINE, N.J. (AP) - The wreckage of an F-16 that crashed
into the Atlantic Ocean last week was found Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage crews that had been searching for a week spotted it on
the ocean floor, about two miles east of Brigantine beach,
according to Col. John Dwyer, spokesman for the New Jersey Air
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   They will attempt to recover it Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $18 million jet, operated by the 177th Fighter Wing in Egg
Harbor Township, was ditched into the sea Aug. 31 after its engine
failed during a training exercise over the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot tried to return to the base but was worried the jet
didn't have enough power to land, so he turned around and steered
it out to sea to avoid harming people or property.
</P>
<P>
   He ejected safely and was rescued unhurt from a life raft.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was identified Friday as Maj. David G. Haar, 41, of
Great Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-year veteran of the Air National Guard, Haar had logged
more than 2,200 hours in the air, including 1,270 in F-16s, before
the incident. He has been grounded since, pending an Air Force
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The probe will probably take about a month, Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Haar's name was withheld from public release for more than a
week because Air Force investigators wanted to get the first
interview with him, before the media, Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Haar could not be reached for comment Friday. The Guard said it
would not make him available for interviews, and he did not return
two telephone messages left at his home.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Complicates Senator's Bid  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BAKST
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Already regarded as vulnerable in his run
for re-election, Sen. Rod Grams is now dogged by a criminal
investigation that may tie his campaign to an e-mail attack aimed
at a Democratic challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Grams and his campaign have denied involvement. But court
documents made public Thursday show an apparent link between
Christine Gunhus, his former chief of staff and now a top campaign
aide, and e-mails intended to sour Democrats on trial lawyer Mike
Ciresi, who is locked in a primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that the mere allegation of a dirty
trick could haunt Grams. Polls already suggest the general election
will be tight no matter who Democrats nominate in Tuesday's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Virtually anything that disadvantages Senator Grams, even in a
small way, may actually determine the outcome,'' said Steve Smith,
a congressional scholar at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators searched Gunhus' house after finding that an
e-mail account used to send the messages was accessed at least four
times from a phone line registered to her. The e-mails may have
broken laws that require campaign literature to be labeled with its
source.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly sent by a concerned Democrat, the e-mails portrayed
Ciresi as a hypocrite whose law firm defended many corporate
wrongdoers at the same time he was playing up an image as a legal
fighter for important causes. Ciresi was the lead attorney in
Minnesota's lawsuit against tobacco companies, which ended in a
$6.1 billion settlement for the state.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the first e-mails were sent, in May, Ciresi was
considered a front-runner in the race and was hoping to get the
party endorsement. Instead, the endorsement went to state Sen.
Jerry Janezich, a more lightly regarded candidate without Ciresi's
considerable financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Janecek, a Republican strategist, said the longer the case
looms, the bigger liability it becomes. Grams and Gunhus have been
forceful in their denials, but Janecek said they should be airing
their defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stuff like this does not happen in a court of law; it happens
in the court of public opinion,'' she said. ''Even though you're
theoretically in a judicial proceeding, in politics you have to
play it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The race for Grams' seat is one of about a dozen Senate races
being closely watched around the nation. The nonpartisan Rothenberg
Political Report, a Washington-based newsletter, rates Grams as
''highly vulnerable,'' its worst category for a senator facing
re-election.

<HEADLINE> Corzine schedules three debates, two on network TV; Franks agrees  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine announced
Friday he has scheduled three debates with Republican opponent Bob
Franks, two of them on network television.
</P>
<P>
   Franks immediately accepted the dates, but kept up his criticism
of the free-spending Democrat for his refusal to appear with Franks
side by side more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   One-hour debates with tentative October dates would be telecast
on two Sundays on ABC and CBS network television affiliates in New
York and Philadelphia. A third debate is to be scheduled on New
Jersey Network (NJN) public television.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has been attacking Corzine for refusing a more aggressive
schedule of 21 debates - one in each county in the state - that the
Republican has been pushing for since June.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign said this schedule of debates should end
any quarreling about the issue. Campaign spokesman Tom Shea has
said no statewide candidates in New Jersey have ever agreed to more
than three debates in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   During the primary campaign against former Gov. Jim Florio,
Corzine would not agree to any network television debates while
spending some $12 million on those same TV stations for ads over
the course of eight weeks. He debated Florio four times, including
at a cable TV network studio and on NJN.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he hoped the three October debates will settle the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy that the debate about the debates is behind us,''
Corzine said, chastising the Franks campaign for refusing to help
arrange these debates jointly. ''It is unfortunate that we had to
do it alone, but I am glad that we got it done. New Jersey voters
deserve no less.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he believes the candidates should appear more
frequently. ''The people of New Jersey are entitled to see Jon
Corzine and Bob Franks on the same platform answering the same
questions in a variety of forums,'' and at alternate sites in the
state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At their last joint appearance at a VFW forum on Aug. 29, Franks
complained that Corzine required that Franks remain outside the
auditorium while Corzine gave a speech and answered questions from
a panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign, in turn, complained one of the three panel
members asking the questions was a prominent Republican figure in
state government. The Democrat told the audience that night he
preferred forums because they gave candidates and audiences a
chance for direct discussion without interruptions from a political
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled to appear together again Saturday at a state
Conference of Mayors meeting in Cumberland County.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative dates for broadcast of the CBS debate are Oct. 1
or Oct. 8, to be broadcast on the New York's WCBS-TV Channel 2 and
Philadelphia's KYW-TV Channel 3. It will be cosponsored by the
Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC debate is set for broadcast Oct. 22 on WABC-TV New York
Channel 7 and WPVI-TV Philadelphia Channel 6. It will be
cosponsored by the Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The third debate to be aired on NJN has not yet been given a
date. It is to be cosponsored by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the primary season, the final debate of the series
is early, a full 16 days before Election Day.

<HEADLINE> Cheney unfazed by Republican ad praising Lieberman  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTON, Conn. (AP) - While Republican vice presidential
candidate Dick Cheney campaigned in Connecticut Friday, a member of
his own party was running TV ads in the state lauding the integrity
of Cheney's opponent, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   During the stop in Lieberman's home state, Cheney said he did
not feel slighted by the television ad by Mark Nielsen, a
Republican who is challenging Democratic U.S. Rep. James Maloney
for the 5th District seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, images of Lieberman, former President George Bush and
U.S. Sen. John McCain are shown as a narrator says, ''Today, when
America wants leaders with honesty and integrity...''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he was not embarrassed by the ad, even though it
praises his opponent, Lieberman, and does not show either him or
his running mate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''My attitude, when I get out around the country, is (to)
encourage Republican candidates to do whatever they can to get
elected, and if Mr. Nielsen thinks that'll help him get elected in
Connecticut, more power to him,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spoke with reporters before meeting with senior citizens
in Shelton to talk about Medicare and prescription drugs. He also
was scheduled to attend a Greenwich fund-raiser that was expected
to raise $250,000 for the state Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who is challenging Maloney for the second time after a
close race in 1998, said his TV ad was intended to contrast
Lieberman's reputation for integrity with the reputation of
Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said the ad was not meant to slight Cheney. He said he
used Lieberman because he is so well-known in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a useful example that I can use in pointing out my
opponent's deficiencies,'' Nielsen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ads began running Friday on the NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox
affiliates in the Hartford-New Haven market.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Nielsen says Maloney took tens of thousands of
dollars in illegal campaign money, then ''let his brother take the
fall and serve the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney was not charged with violating any election laws. His
brother, Robert, was convicted in 1997 for violating federal
election law by reimbursing some donors for contributions he
solicited.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also claims Maloney broke his promise not to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney on Friday blasted Nielsen, saying the ad contains ''one
falsehood after another.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a gross embarrassment to the Nielsen campaign,''
Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney noted that the U.S. attorney's office determined there
was no evidence that he had any knowledge of his brother's
activities and that when he learned about the violation, he
refunded the money.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said he consistently has voted for tax cuts and was not
the big spender described by Nielsen in the ad.

<HEADLINE> Port Authority detective charged in online sex case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOMERVILLE, N.J. (AP) - A detective with the Port Authority
Police Department was arrested Friday and charged with using his
computer to try to entice teen-agers into committing sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Kane, 51, of Cranford, was charged with three counts of
attempted endangering the welfare of a child, and three counts of
attempted promoting obscene material.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset County Prosecutor Wayne J. Forrest said agents of the
Northeast Regional Child Exploitation Task Force began an
investigation in February of an individual who identified himself
by the online screen names of ''Jimk136'' and ''PeterPan136.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the defendant approached officers who were posing online
as children aged 13 and 14, instructing them how to perform various
sexual acts. Forrest also said Kane sent the agents several
pornographic photographs online.
</P>
<P>
   Kane, who is assigned to the Drug Enforcement Administration's
Task Force at Newark International Airport, was arrested at work
without incident by task force members and computer crime
investigators from the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Somerset Prosecutor's Office was involved because the task
force is based in Franklin Township.

<HEADLINE> President will cast ballot for first lady in primary  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton should be able to
count on at least two votes in Tuesday's U.S. Senate Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the first lady's New York Senate campaign on
Friday said President Clinton will join his wife Tuesday to cast
his first vote in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons plan to vote in the primary Tuesday morning at the
Douglas Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua, according to Karen
Finney, spokeswoman for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Hillary has been working hard and isn't taking any votes
for granted, there will be two votes cast on Tuesday that she feels
pretty confident about,'' Finney said.
</P>
<P>
   Finney said it wasn't yet certain whether daughter Chelsea
Clinton would vote in person or by absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady moved into the Clintons' $1.7 million house in
Chappaqua in January and her husband and Chelsea recently
registered to vote in New York state. Tuesday's vote will be the
first for both the president and his daughter in a New York
election. Hillary Clinton has voted already in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, running against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio,
faces a primary challenge from Mark McMahon, a little-known
Manhattan orthopedic surgeon. Lazio faces no primary.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican until 1997, McMahon has stressed Clinton's lack of
New York roots and his familiarity with health care issues as
reasons to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Polls say Clinton should easily dispatch McMahon, with
predictions that the challenger will hardly be noticed unless he
gets near the 30 percent mark.

<HEADLINE> Continental plane aborts takeoff after engine fails  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The National Transportation Safety Board is
investigating why an engine on a Continental Airlines DC-10 spewed
parts onto the runway at Newark International Airport, causing the
pilot to abort a takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in Tuesday's incident, the second time in
less than five months that a Continental DC-10 engine suffered an
''uncontained engine failure'' at Newark airport, one of its hubs.
</P>
<P>
   In such failures, which are uncommon, parts go through the
engine covering. The engines are designed to eject parts out the
rear, which poses less of a threat to the aircraft and its
occupants, an aviation expert said.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark incidents involved different aircraft, but both were
Flight 60, from Newark to Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are isolated, separate instances of engine failure,''
Continental spokesman David Messing said from the airline's Houston
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   All engines on Continental's 24 DC-10s are made by General
Electric Co., Messing said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We use them, the manufacturer, exclusively for all
overhauls,'' he said. Messing could not say when the most recent
maintenance was performed on the engines that failed.
</P>
<P>
   GE Aircraft Engines, based in Cincinnati, performs overhauls
every few years, but routine maintenance is done by the airline, GE
spokesman Rick Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He could not immediately provide the date of the last overhaul
for either of the engines involved, which he said were about 20 to
25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The engine model, CF6-50, has a good service record and is the
best-selling engine for large aircraft, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The early indications are that both engines suffered a failure
toward the rear of the engine, not the heart, he said. As a result,
neither lost all power.
</P>
<P>
   The DC-10 is used by more than 60 airlines and has an excellent
service record, Messing said. Continental, which has more than 500
aircraft, is replacing its DC-10s with Boeing 767s over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has not determined the cause of the April 25 incident.
</P>
<P>
   That plane returned to Newark 34 minutes after takeoff with two
of its three engines failing, blown tires and ruptured hydraulic
lines, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's incident took place about 7:20 p.m. when the center,
or No. 2, engine failed during takeoff, Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Jim Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The takeoff was aborted after sparks and debris were seen coming
from the engine. Airport workers found turbine blades and metal
debris on the runway afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The 237 passengers safely exited the plane on the runway after
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the engine will taken apart
by agency personnel, along with FAA and GE representatives. He
could not say when that would happen or when a cause would be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   FAA records show 25 uncontained engine failures from 1985-99,
resulting in two deaths and 16 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a little unusual,'' said William D. Waldock, a
professor of aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The most common causes are metal failure or when birds are
sucked into the engine. An unbalanced turbine blade can also cause
such a failure, but that is usually detected during routine
maintenance, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   The GE engines are reliable, but require more attention as they
log more miles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real key is the maintenance. If it's maintained properly,
you can keep running them almost indefinitely,'' Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark incidents are the latest problem for Continental
involving a DC-10. French investigators announced Monday that a
stray length of metal that gashed a tire of a supersonic Concorde,
leading to a fuel tank fire and dooming the flight, probably came
from a Continental Airlines plane that took off on the same runway
four minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Continental officials are cooperating with that investigation,
but have not said that the metal part was from one of their DC-10s.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment PAC Cancels Starr Salute  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The political action committee raising money
for the House impeachment managers has canceled next month's salute
to former special prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   A notice on the House Managers PAC Web site Friday said: ''We
wish to honor Judge Starr for his integrity but at this time we
feel it more appropriate to place our tribute on hold for a
possible rescheduling.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising salute was designed to help fill the coffers of
the PAC, which was formed to financially aid the 13 House
Republicans who prosecuted President Clinton in his Senate trial.
Through June 30, the PAC had raised just $76,787 and had only
$37,230 in the bank. Tickets for the salute began at $100.
</P>
<P>
   No reason for the cancellation was given, and calls to PAC
officials were not returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The salute was scheduled for Oct. 4, however, and that turned
out to be the week that Congress hoped to adjourn so lawmakers
could go home and campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 13 House managers, Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., is at
the top of the Democratic congressional hit list this fall. He is
being challenged by state Sen. Adam Schiff in what promises to
become the most expensive House race in history. Rogan polled just
51 percent of the vote in winning re-election two years ago in a
district that went for Clinton in both 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a solicitor general under former President Bush, was
appointed to take over the Clinton investigation by a three-judge
panel in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, he presented a voluminous and sexually
explicit report to Congress about Clinton's relationship with
former intern Monica Lewinsky, arguing that he had found
''substantial and credible information ... that may constitute
grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the House impeached Clinton on two articles of
perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate voted to acquit in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The following October, Starr resigned his post, stating in a
letter that his departure was prompted by the ''intense
politicization'' of his work.

<HEADLINE> Schumer opposes talk of casinos in Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ZACHARIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Donald Trump may have to find another way to
make his next millions, if Sen. Charles Schumer gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said Friday that Trump will ''face serious opposition''
if he tries to go forward with his reported plan to team up with an
American Indian tribe to open the world's largest casino on the
west side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said in Tuesday's New York Post that if state and federal
officials approve a proposal for the St. Regis Mohawk Indians to
open a casino in the Catskills, he may propose building one with
another Indian tribe on 100 acres of underdeveloped land he owns
near the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire developer fears that a casino in the Catskills
would siphon business away from Atlantic City, N.J., where he owns
three hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer supported the Catskills plan, which would land the new
casino 75 miles from midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   New York state law prohibits casinos, but federal law allows
them on Indian reservations. Indian tribes also can have
off-reservation land put into trust for a casino. There was no word
on which tribe Trump would be dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said the same set of criteria that led him to eagerly
support the Catskills casino proposal now leads him to adamantly
oppose building one in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''While a casino might be a good bet for a struggling area in
need of an economic shot in the arm, it is a poor gamble for a
bustling metropolis,'' Schumer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''A city that already boasts the Empire State Building, the
Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Center does not need the Taj
Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing surveys and meetings with community leaders, Schumer also
said Manhattan residents are strongly opposed to a local casino.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's spokeswoman said he was unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he would support casino gambling in
New York City as long as the casinos were kept free of organized
crime and a portion of the revenue stayed in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt that if they allow casino gambling in New
York, then New York City should be a part of that, because it would
be just another way of diverting money out of the city,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer insisted that he will do everything he can ''to make
sure it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   New York state now has two casinos.

<HEADLINE> Three men shot to death in pre-dawn roadside ambush  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A man with an assault rifle opened
fire on a car at a traffic light Friday, spraying it with bullets
and killing three of the four people inside.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 shots were fired in the pre-dawn ambush on U.S. 30,
about two miles west of the city's Boardwalk casinos, according to
Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were identified as Lamont Wilson, 21, Richard White,
26, and Michael Demps, 20, all of Pleasantville. The fourth man
wasn't identified by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   They probably knew the killer, Blitz said. There was no
indication the attack was random, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who remained at large late Friday, approached the
blue-green 1989 Honda Accord as it was stopped for a red light and
began firing, Blitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on the driver's side, he walked around the car,
shooting at the unarmed occupants, Blitz said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Wilson managed to get out and flee, causing the
car - which was still in gear - to roll forward. But he was shot to
death as he ran down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The killer then walked around the back of the car and up to the
front-seat passenger's side, firing through the windows and killing
the two passengers on the right side of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Passing motorists witnessed the 4 a.m. attack, which blew out
the back window and both windows on the right side of the car and
left seven bullet holes on the passenger's side of the front
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's body landed about 100 yards from the spot where the car
came to rest, in a salt marsh alongside the road, next to a parking
lot for employees of Harrah's Atlantic City and Trump Marina
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor, who was sitting in the left rear seat, was injured
by flying glass but was not shot, Blitz said. He was cooperating
with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Blitz would not comment when asked whether the survivor was
purposely spared by the killer.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined comment on whether the gunman was waiting for
the victims' car at the intersection or got out of another car
stopped for the traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   Blitz would not give a motive, a physical description or any
information about what precipitated the slayings, saying he didn't
want to tip his hand. He ruled out road rage, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a particular interest that the suspect or suspects not
read about it until I'm prepared to make an arrest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No weapon was recovered. The spent shell casings were .223
caliber, he said. No weapon was found in the car, either.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies were being performed on all three victims Friday. The
results were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the eastbound highway, between Absecon and Atlantic
City, was closed for 4&AMP;frac12; hours as investigators and members of the
Atlantic County Medical Examiner's Office examined it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City-bound traffic was rerouted to the Atlantic City
Expressway, causing long delays.

<HEADLINE> Barak Can't Persuade Arafat  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After a brief encounter with Yasser
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak summed up peace efforts
with the Palestinians in two words Friday: ''No good.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak told The Associated Press he made a last-ditch approach to
the Palestinian leader before Arafat's scheduled departure for Gaza
and urged him to reach an accord in the little time remaining
before next week's self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was not responsive, Barak said with evident
disappointment. The prime minister said he had no meetings
scheduled with either President Clinton or Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in New York over the weekend. But his spokesman,
Gadi Baltiansky, said the prime minister was seeing American
mediator Dennis Ross later Friday. Ross met separately with
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are hung up mostly over Jerusalem. Arafat is
unyielding in his demand for sovereignty over the eastern part of
the city and has resisted compromises offered by Clinton and
pleadings by Barak that the Palestinian was missing an opportunity
to gain statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza City, the Palestine Liberation Organization's Central
Council is to meet Saturday to consider whether to move forward
with a unilateral declaration of statehood Wednesday as Arafat has
indicated he would do absent an overall settlement. Albright and
other U.S. officials have cautioned Arafat they would not support
such a state.
</P>
<P>
   Next Wednesday is the deadline that Barak and Arafat set last
year for overall agreement. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart now
calls that deadline ''artificial'' and says Clinton is prepared to
keep working past it for an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat met separately with Clinton on Wednesday at the
Millennium Summit that brought the two leaders and more than 100
others to New York for traffic-snarling deliberation at the United
Nations on ''soft'' international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing Friday for a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern, Clinton was overheard saying: ''This Middle East thing, it's
maddening.'' The president held his arms wide apart, as if to
signify the issues are too wide to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Second-tier Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to resume
talks in the Middle East next week. However, pessimism prevailed.
U.S. officials said only a few weeks remain to secure a treaty, and
lower-level negotiators have scored few achievements in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Clinton's mediation effort during this week's
U.N. Millennium Summit was the fate of a 36-acre walled compound in
Jerusalem's Old City. It is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount,
site of their two former Temples, and by Muslims as Haram
as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, with two mosques marking the spot
where they believe Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has proposed complex sovereignty arrangements
to accommodate rival Israeli and Palestinian claims, including
placing some areas under divine sovereignty to enable both sides to
save face in accepting the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath dismissed ''the idea of
God's sovereignty.'' Shaath said he believed that Arafat had
convinced Clinton ''that it is impossible to solve the issue of
Jerusalem without total Palestinian sovereignty over the city and
the holy places inside it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he appealed in his Friday meeting with Arafat for
them to ''get something done'' before time runs out. But, shaking
his head, Barak said he did not get a positive reply.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he would contemplate hard-to-accept American
proposals, provided Arafat would reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis feel the prime minister has gone too far already
in virtually assuring Palestinian control of almost all the West
Bank, Gaza and some neighborhoods in Jerusalem and near suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   He may face efforts to force him from office when the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, reconvenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also has said no Israeli prime minister would ever accept
Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount -- ''a cornerstone of
our identity'' -- but suggested he would not necessarily insist on
full Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in turn, said anything less than full Palestinian
sovereignty over all of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem,
including the Old City and its Muslim and Christian holy sites, is
out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't betray my people. I can't betray the Arabs. I can't
betray the Christians. I can't betray the Muslims,'' Arafat told
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiator Shaath said he feels it has been a mistake to focus
on the hardest dispute, over the holy sites. Negotiators will now
try to make progress on the other issues, such as land, refugees
and borders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said both sides promised to work hard. ''But the truth
is, just look at the calendar,'' she said. ''There is not a lot of
time.''

<HEADLINE> Denver Newspaper Merger OK Advised  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department lawyers recommended Friday
that Attorney General Janet Reno approve the proposed joint
operating agreement between Denver's daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Reno will make the final decision on the proposal to merge the
business operations of the Denver Rocky Mountain News and the
Denver Post.
</P>
<P>
   The E.W. Scripps Co., whose subsidiary publishes the Rocky
Mountain News, and the Media News Group Inc., whose subsidiary
publishes the Post, asked the Justice Department to approve the
plan May 12. Scripps sought a truce in the two papers' war for
readership after the News lost more than $120 million during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're gratified that the (department's) antitrust division has
recommended approval of our application in Denver,'' said Tim
Stautberg, vice president of communications for Scripps.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great news to protect two editorial voices into the
future, while protecting jobs on both sides,'' said Tom Botelho,
the Post's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Justice Department's antitrust division found
that the News was in danger of failing, meaning it qualifies for a
joint operating agreement under a 1970 federal law. The Denver
proposal was the first request for a newspaper JOA since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision will come after a 30-day public comment period,
which starts after the antitrust division's ruling is made public.
The ruling was sealed Friday to allow the Post and News time to
seek confidentiality for some financial information.
</P>
<P>
   The Post has sought to keep most of its business records
private, arguing that it does not have to open its books to public
scrutiny because it is not the newspaper in danger of failing.
Stautberg said Scripps would not object to making its financial
information in the recommendation public.
</P>
<P>
   Botelho said Post officials had not finished their review of the
recommendation to decide if the paper would ask to have any
portions kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newspapers would share profits under the 50-year
deal, both would keep separate newsrooms and publish separate
editions during the week. Weekend editions would be published under
a joint masthead, with the News publishing on Saturday and the Post
taking the more lucrative Sunday paper.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of both papers have said they do not expect job cuts
in the newsrooms, but layoffs are possible in other areas. The News
has 1,785 employees, while the Post has 1,870. Unions at both
papers have endorsed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver newspapers had fought a vigorous circulation war for
more than a century. The Post switched from publishing in the
afternoon to publishing in the morning in 1984 to face the News
head-on. By the 1990s, the newspapers were slashing subscription
costs to the point where the News was selling papers for a penny a
day.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the papers sought peace, the News had a daily
circulation of 446,465 and a Sunday circulation of 552,085,
compared with the Post's 413,730 daily and 558,560 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the edge in circulation, the News lost $123 million in
the past decade and was in danger of being shut down. The Post, on
the other hand, made $200 million during the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Torch triggers fire in Jamestown manufacturer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAMESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A spark from a torch was blamed for a
fire that heavily damaged a 100-year-old building that used to
house a furniture maker.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out at 8:20 a.m. as workers used acetylene
torches to cut bolts off an old air ventilation system on the top
floor of the 200,000-square-foot, four-story Art Metal building. It
recently was sold and the owner planned to convert it into a
multi-use site.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members said they placed metal sheets over the rubber and
foam roof before they started cutting with the torch to reduce the
risk of a spark igniting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the damage was contained in the center of the
building and at one end, all on the fourth floor. The heavy
concrete construction - floors about six inches thick - helped
prevent major damage, a fire official said.
</P>
<P>
   Art Metal was a metal office furniture maker that employed more
than 1,400 people at its peak. The company closed in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter suffered a deep bruise to his neck when a helmet
fell from the third floor and hit him.
</P>
<P>
   Jamestown is 58 miles southwest of Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> Cone Expected To Miss 1 Start  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The New York Yankees got good news about David
Cone: Manager Joe Torre expects the injured pitcher to return to
the rotation next Friday after missing one start.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's range of motion in his left shoulder was improved, Torre
said before Friday night's game against the Boston Red Sox. Cone
separated the shoulder Tuesday diving for a popped-up bunt in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great news for Conie, for sure, and us, too,'' Torre said
of the report from Dr. Stuart Hershon, the team physician.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams missed his fourth straight game
with a strained right rib cage and Torre said Williams probably
wouldn't play this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is expected to rejoin the Yankees on Saturday and be
replaced on the mound Sunday by rookie Randy Keisler. Cone will
have a workout Tuesday with an eye toward starting next Friday at
home against Cleveland, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everything goes well, he'll probably take his next turn on
Friday,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had gone 15 games without a win before winning three of his
last four decisions. He was 4-11 with a 6.16 ERA when he was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI taken Wednesday showed ''minimal bruising, better than I
thought,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss of Cone, Torre said the Yankees' starting
pitching ''is probably as good as it's ever been in the time I've
been here.'' New York won three World Series in his four previous
seasons as manager.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens started Friday night's game with a 7-0 record
since June 9, Andy Pettitte is 17-7, and Denny Neagle allowed one
run in eight innings in the Yankees' 7-3 win at Kansas City on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Keisler, a lefty, is scheduled to make his major league debut
after going 14-5 with a 2.89 ERA this season with Triple-A Columbus
and Double-A Norwich. Torre expects him to handle the pressure of
his first major league start, coming in Fenway Park against the
Yankees' top rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that he's excited about it, he's not trying to hide
that fact and I think that's a good sign,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was batting .309 with 28 homers and 111 RBIs when he
was sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was able to throw. He was able to run around. But (the
injury) is still there,'' Torre said. ''You just have to be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger replaced him in center field and batted ninth
Friday.

U.N. Summit Ends With Resolution
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Ending a historic three-day summit, the world's
leaders pledged today to resolve humankind's problems, with a New Millennium's
resolution promising to send every child to school and deliver millions from
destitution by 2015. Negotiated for weeks, the eight-page Millennium
Declaration, is a catalog of the world's troubles -- poverty, war, AIDS,
pollution, human rights violations and much more -- and a promise to deal with
them. ''We recognize that, in addition to our separate responsibilities to our
individual societies, we have a collective responsibility to uphold the
principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level,'' the
declaration reads.

Bush To Negotiate on Debates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The Bush and Gore campaigns will meet with the
presidential debate commission next week to negotiate terms for a fall series of
televised confrontations, the campaigns said today. Republican George W. Bush
had been insisting on a schedule that would include only one
commission-sponsored presidential debate and two other less-formal TV
appearances. But some supporters had raised concerns that his stance was being
read by some voters as a reluctance to debate. Al Gore, the Democratic vice
president, has said he would consider other formats only after Bush agreed to
the widely telecast commission debates.

on Friday all six European hostages they have held for months in the Philippine
jungle, making a partial offer that forced the government to cancel the entire
release, an official said. Abu Sayyaf rebel leader Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang
informed a mediator that he would only free three of the Europeans, negotiators
said. Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado then attempted to call
Andang by satellite phone to push for the release of all six, but was unable to
reach him.

Ford Extends Truck Plant Shutdown
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor has extended the shutdown of three truck factories
by one week to divert 30,000 tires toward a massive recall. The tires are needed
to fill replacement orders for 6.5 million Firestone truck tires recalled in
early August. A longer shutdown is possible, Ford said today. The plants in St.
Paul, Minn., Edison, N.J. and Hazelwood, Mo., have been closed for two weeks so
that 15-inch tires used as standard equipment on Ford Explorer/Mercury
Mountaineer sport utility vehicles and Ford Ranger pickups can be sent to Ford
and Lincoln/Mercury dealers.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Al Gore celebrated an ''even-up'' presidential race today

about unanswered questions in his Social Security plan. Gore, at Delgado
Community College to promote his education agenda, faulted Bush for not
specifying how he would replace the Social Security money used to pay
current-day benefits, money he proposes to divert into private investment
accounts. Gore, the Democratic nominee, then appropriated a common theme in
Bush's stump speech about trusting the American people over big government.

<HEADLINE> NHTSA To Seek More Money, Authority  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration will ask Congress next week for more money and
authority to require companies to provide product data on foreign
recalls, customer claims and legal settlements, the agency's
administrator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bailey said the agency wants to have the request ready by
Tuesday, when the Senate Commerce Committee holds a hearing on the
recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires. The brand of tires have been
linked to 88 U.S. traffic deaths and dozens more overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey told reporters that for the agency to act on safety
problems sooner, manufacturers must be required to turn over data
on customer claims, legal settlements and foreign safety actions.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. officials have admitted the company
collected information from 1997 to 1999 that showed the
now-recalled tires caused most of the property damage and injury
claims, but only used the information to determine profit loss, not
safety problems, and never alerted NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has been criticized for beginning a Firestone
tire recall in 16 foreign countries more than a year before the
U.S. recall was launched. No law required Ford to notify U.S.
authorities, and the company did not. Ford uses Firestone tires on
many vehicles, including the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that I think it would be very hard for anyone
reasonably to determine that manufacturers' self-policing worked
well in this case,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials also are expected to testify at Tuesday's
hearing. ''We will be open and honest with them,'' said John Lampe,
Bridgestone/Firestone executive vice president. ''We have nothing
to hide.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates 7, Reds 3, 1st Innings  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Kendall doubled in two runs and Alex
Hernandez hit his first major league homer as the Pittsburgh
Pirates won their seventh in a row, beating the Cincinnati Reds 7-3
Friday night in the first game of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had lost 31 of 46 and were 26 games below .500 with
the majors' worst record until starting their longest winning
streak since winning seven in a row in from May 28-June 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Ritchie (8-7), one of the majors' best pitchers last
September with a 3-1 record and 2.93 ERA, won his second in a row
this month despite allowing Sean Casey's two-run homer. Ritchie
gave up three runs and five hits in six innings, leaving after
throwing 117 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall was in a 5-for-23 slump before getting hits in his first
three at-bats, including run-scoring doubles in the third and
fourth. The double in the fourth followed Hernandez's leadoff homer
into the center-field seats that put the Pirates back in front,
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had tied it in the top of the fourth on Ken Griffey
Jr.'s leadoff single and Casey's 13th homer. Casey grew up in
suburban Pittsburgh and his drive to center was greeted by more
than a few cheers from what then was a small crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Casey also tripled with one out in the eighth and Pittsburgh up
4-3, but reliever Scott Sauerbeck got Dmitri Young on a grounder
and pinch-hitter Mike Bell to pop up. The Pirates then scored three
runs against reliever John Riedling on Adrian Brown's double and
John Vander Wal's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who had a 1-6 homestand against Colorado and San
Francisco before sweeping a California road trip, took a 1-0 lead
in the second on a walk, left fielder Dmitri Young's error on
Warren Morris' single and Scott Williamson's major league-leading
21st wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson (5-8), making his first since Aug. 23 because of
lower back spasms, pitched 3 2-3 innings, yielding four runs --
three earned -- and six hits while walking four. He lasted seven
innings in each of his previous three starts before going on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' first two runs resulted from walks by Williamson.
Brown walked leading off the fourth and scored on the first of
Kendall's two doubles.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The doubleheader was the first between the teams in Three
Rivers Stadium since Aug. 22, 1975, when both were in first place.
They would go on to meet in the NL championship series, with the
Reds winning. ... The Pirates are 7-0 this month. They have not had
a winning September since 1992, when they last won a division
title. ... The doubleheader is the Reds' first of the season. ...
The Reds lost for the fifth time in 15 games.

<HEADLINE> Rowing Official Gets Olympic Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- John T. Garnjost, a well-known
international rowing official, became the first American to receive
the Olympic Order from the International Olympic Committee for
service to a sport in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Garnjost, 64, is generally recognized as the father of Taiwanese
rowing and was presented with the Olympic order Thursday by C.K.
Wu, Taiwan's member of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Garnjost, an import-export broker, first came to Taiwan in 1958
while serving in the U.S. Air Force and subsequently returned for
several years in the 1970s while on assignment for an employer,
actively working on site development and personnel training for
rowing in Taiwan, which has since risen to Olympic levels.
</P>
<P>
   Garnjost served as the Chinese Taipei delegate to the
International Rowing Federation Congress in 1983, that approved
Taiwan's first application for membership in the international
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The father's role in the birth of a baby is limited,''
Garnjost said after accepting the award. ''In rowing, as in life,
there has been countless effort and teamwork in the development in
this sport in Taiwan. Today, we have an internationally proven
rowing course, two registered umpires and rowers throughout the
country.''

<HEADLINE> Cheney Promotes Prescription Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTON, Conn. (AP) -- Campaigning on Joe Lieberman's turf
Friday, Dick Cheney promoted the GOP ticket's plan to help seniors
pay for prescription drugs and criticized a Democratic ad against
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another display of the Clinton-Gore routine -- attack,
exaggerate and misrepresent,'' said Cheney, the Republican vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney told seniors at an assisted living center in Shelton,
Conn., that Bush's $198 billion Medicare reform and prescription
drug program was superior to Democrat Al Gore's $253 billion
prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   The former defense secretary spent most of the day on the
defensive, however, with Democrats lobbing rocks at him for missing
out on a chance to vote for GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush
in the Texas primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News reported Cheney did not vote in 14 out
of the last 16 elections. Cheney has lived primarily in Dallas for
the last several years, but registered to vote in Wyoming in July
to smooth the way for his vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said extensive traveling kept him from becoming involved
in state or local politics, though he said he voted in ''every
federal primary and general election in the last twenty-some
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore's campaign was quick to seize on the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that Dick Cheney did not receive a major-league
vetting by George W. Bush,'' said Chris Lehane, spokesman for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Cheney shrugged off a new poll showing his unfavorable
ratings among voters was growing. The poll, by ABC-Washington Post,
showed 42 percent of voters viewed Cheney favorably, while 20
percent viewed him negatively -- almost double his negative ratings
shown in a poll take after Bush chose him as a running mate about
six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't spend a lot of time worrying about my favorables or
unfavorables,'' Cheney told reporters. ''It's not a personality
contest in terms of the vice-presidential campaigns. It's about
which ticket can win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorability ratings of Gore's running mate, Lieberman, have
nearly doubled to 46 percent from 24 percent a month ago, the poll
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent of voters had a negative opinion of Lieberman in
the latest poll, up from 10 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman got a boost from an unlikely source -- a GOP
congressional candidate who helped arrange Cheney's visit to
Shelton. Lieberman was featured in TV ads for Mark Nielsen that
showed the Connecticut senator's picture as an example of a leader
''with honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said he put Lieberman, whom he respects, in the ad that
began airing Friday as a contrast to his opponent, incumbent Rep.
Jim Maloney, and acknowledged that endorsing Cheney's opponent on
the day of his campaign appearance was ''unfortunate'' timing.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney shrugged that one off too. ''If Mr. Nielsen thinks
that'll help him get elected in Connecticut, more power to him. We
need his vote in Washington,'' he told local reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the day at a state-party fund-raiser in Greenwich,
Conn.

<HEADLINE> Court: Lee Hearing Should Be Open  </HEADLINE>
By JON SARCHE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A hearing to determine whether nuclear scientist
Wen Ho Lee should be kept behind bars until his trial will be open
to the public, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted part of a request
from The Associated Press that the hearing Monday be open. The
court said only proceedings dealing with sensitive information will
be held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   The court initially said the hearing would be closed for
security reasons. The AP's petition Friday said closure could be
justified only to protect a specific and compelling state interest
and if no less restrictive means are available to protect that
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're extremely happy with the ruling, and we hope that most,
if not all, of the hearing Monday will be in open court,'' said
Julie Aicher, chief of the AP's Albuquerque, N.M., bureau. ''We
think it's important for the public to know as much as possible
about the government's reason for opposing bail in this highly
publicized case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is accused of downloading restricted material about
nuclear weapons to unsecured computers and tapes while working at
Los Alamos National Laboratory. His trial is set for Nov. 6, and he
could face life in prison if convicted. He has been in solitary
confinement since his arrest last December.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors contend that Lee should remain in jail
before his trial, saying he still poses ''irreparable harm'' to the
country if released.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers have filed two motions seeking his release pending
trial. The U.S. Attorney's office in Albuquerque filed a response
late Thursday, saying Lee's claim that he will suffer significant
harm by remaining jailed ''does not overcome the potential
irreparable harm to the United States'' posed by his release.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker, who signed Lee's release on $1
million bail last week before the 10th Circuit stayed his order,
set strict conditions for his release, including electronic
monitoring, restrictions on travel and limits on the number of
people with whom Lee could communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee insists the conditions are sufficient, prosecutors
said Lee would be a risk because he could pass on the tapes or
communicate their contents directly or through intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the human rights committee of the New York Academy of
Sciences sent a letter to the court saying Lee's continued
incarceration pending trial undercuts the group's efforts to
protest the jailing of scientists by totalitarian governments
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientific groups have also protested the conditions of
Lee's arrest.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Passage of China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Concluding a whirlwind week of diplomacy,
President Clinton assured Chinese President Jiang Zemin the Senate
will approve an agreement giving Beijing permanent normal trade
relations in return for slashing tariffs on American goods sold in
the vast Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday the accord was ''good for the development of
democracy and human rights in China, and I know it's good for
American-Chinese relationships over the long run.'' The Senate is
to vote next week on the deal, the biggest trade bill of the year
and one of Clinton's top foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved by the House last May. Some senators who
believe trade with China should be linked to its human rights and
weapons proliferation record are pushing for amendments that would
force the bill to go back to the House for further consideration.
Bill proponents say that would kill the bill's chances for
enactment this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the bill will pass and I'm pleased at the progress
it's making in the Senate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang told U.S. business executives at a policy luncheon that
the measure offers a ''win-win outcome'' for his country and the
United States, both by opening China's markets to foreign products
and by strengthening China's bid to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for the first time in a year, Clinton and Jiang talked
on the final day of the U.N. Millennium Summit, a three-day
gathering of about 160 world leaders. Clinton's attempts during the
summit to salvage peace talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat came to naught.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Middle East thing, it's maddening,'' Clinton exclaimed at
a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. The president
held his arms wide, as if to say the issue was too large to grasp.
Clinton also met with Bolivian President Hugo Banzer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jiang met a week after the president deferred a
decision on whether to build an anti-missile defense system
protecting the United States. China and Russia had argued that a
missile shield would upset the strategic balance and lead to a new
nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ''The missile defense issue will be resolved by my successor,''
Clinton said during a photo opportunity. Their 90-minute meeting
was notable for its frank tone and the easy exchange between the
two leaders, a senior administration official told reporters
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The talks covered the strains between China and Taiwan,
Beijing's missile sales, religious freedom in China and Tibet,
trade, the thaw in relations between North and South Korea and
North Korea's proposal for outside help with missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official took issue with recent reports suggesting
that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il was joking when he said his
country would abandon its missile development program if other
countries would put its satellites into space. U.S. experts have
scrutinized the Korean language version of what Kim said and
determined ''it was a positive discussion, not that it was a
joke,'' the official said, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is prepared to take Kim's idea seriously if he
is prepared to move forward, the official said. ''In broad terms,
that is an idea worth pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton delayed a decision on deploying missile defenses,
China is pressing the United States to abandon the program
completely. Clinton said he would urge his successor to engage in
serious talks with China and other countries to explain the threat
the United States believes makes such a system necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I don't know whether we're going to end up
convincing people and reaching a common understanding but I will
sure encourage my successor -- whoever it is -- to engage in that
effort very seriously,''' the official said. ''And he said, 'Jiang,
I hope that you will engage in that effort equally seriously, that
you'll think about this and you'll be ready to engage on it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said Clinton's idea was good and that the Chinese take the
issue seriously, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Taiwan, the official said China is ''in a wait and see
attitude'' about newly elected Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian.
The official said the Taiwanese leader ''has made a number o moves
to take the edge off the fact that he is from the democratic
progressive party which has traditionally been a pro-independence
party.'' China views Taiwan as a renegade province and vows it will
use force if necessary to prevent its independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive
question in China-U.S. relations,'' Jiang said at the luncheon.
''Our relations have experienced ups and downs over the decades,
most of which can be traced to the Taiwan question.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Negotiate on Debates  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- After weeks of sniping from a distance, the
Bush and Gore campaigns will meet with the presidential debate
commission next week to negotiate terms for a fall series of
televised confrontations, the campaigns said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush had been insisting on a schedule that
would include only one commission-sponsored presidential debate and
two other less-formal TV appearances. But some supporters had
raised concerns that his stance was being read by some voters as a
reluctance to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, the Democratic vice president, has said he would
consider other formats only after Bush agreed to the widely
telecast commission debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told his campaign chairman, Don Evans, to tell the
commission he would ''meet with them anywhere, anytime to discuss
with them and with the Gore campaign a way to work out a plan so
there will in fact be debates,'' said Bush communications director
Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, said simply, ''We are
pleased that the Bush campaign has agreed to meet with the
bipartisan commission on presidential debates. We look forward to
that meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, executive director of the Commission on
Presidential Debates, said in a statement, ''We are working to
schedule a meeting with Bush and Gore campaigns representatives
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been anxious to get all the talk about debate
negotiations off center stage. Republicans concerned about Gore's
surge in polls have complained the topic has been a distraction for
the campaign and for voters Bush is trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being discussed at in the Bush camp is accepting
as many as two commission-sponsored debates while trying to secure
a less formal non-commission session to start off the debate
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Bush campaign received word from NBC that there
would not be a debate on Tuesday night -- the first of the
non-commission debate offers Bush had accepted -- unless both
candidates agreed to appear. Gore sent the network a letter on
Monday saying he wanted to first agree to the prime-time commission
debates before considering other matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Bush put his campaign's new closer-to-the-people
style into practice, sharing coffee and spending more than an hour
in face-to-face politicking at a telecommunications-equipment
factory near Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what I'm good at,'' he declared. ''I like meeting
people, my fellow citizens, I like interfacing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign working hard to gain more control of the image
Bush projects, he later lined up near his campaign plane with
several dozen Pennsylvania motorcycle police officers who had
escorted his motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   He used them as a backdrop to thank the Fraternal Order of
Police for endorsing his candidacy at its annual convention in
Oklahoma City. ''They'll have a friend in the White House,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The events came a day after he promised to do more
people-to-people events in the face of criticism from some top
Republicans that he had not been energetic enough in countering Al
Gore's rise in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We turn on a dime,'' said campaign spokeswoman Hughes. ''We're
going to continue to have more conversations with Americans in
settings where they live and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush is getting help from Washington Republicans.
Hughes has offered consultant Ed Gillespie a job on the team and is
awaiting his reply.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day buying a cup of coffee at the ''Jitter Cafe''
inside the Marconi Communications plant, then he walked over to a
group of about 40 workers seated at cafeteria tables.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get in that booth, remember who came by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One woman asked him about the presidential debates. He
reiterated his criticism of Gore but also said of him, ''This guy
is a good debater. I hope I'll be able to hold my own.''
</P>
<P>
   One worker, Todd Blumer, asked Bush how he would make difficult
decisions as president. Bush said it was important ''to stand on
principle and listen. In politics, you can't worry about polls or
focus groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Also, I take great solace in my faith and my family as well,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before a larger group, Bush later fielded questions for more
than a half hour -- some of them critical.
</P>
<P>
   One worker told Bush that, as a Democrat, he didn't think the
Republican Texas governor was getting his message across. Bush
conceded that he had to do a better job at that, ''I've got to get
out and talk to people. I'm going to do a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I'm going to welcome Democrats in my campaign --
that's how I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To a question on Bush's treatment by the news media, the
candidate said, ''Sometimes it comes out fairly and sometimes
frankly I don't care for the coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing for me to do to get my message out is to speak
directly to people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the day campaigning in Pennsylvania and Missouri --
two swing states his campaign views as critical -- and then was
going back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He will spend most of the weekend on his ranch near Waco. Bush
was bringing with him a thick briefing book to prepare for debates.
</P>
<P>
   He has already had several practice sessions, including one last
weekend, in which Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., played the role of Gore.

<HEADLINE> Man runs on Field at Cubs Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A man ran on the field at Wrigley Field in the
seventh inning Friday, stripped, stood on the mound and made an
obscene gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs' Eric Young had just singled to lead off the
seventh when James Short, 43, of Deerfield, Ill., ran onto the
field from near the visiting team's dugout. Short stopped shy of
the mound, took off his shorts and shirt, and then stood on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Ricky Gutierrez, who was at the plate, was seen
laughing along with several other players.
</P>
<P>
   Short was taken away by security guards, who grabbed him by his
hair and rushed him off the field and through the stands, still
naked. He was charged with criminal trespass and indecent exposure,
a Chicago police spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Returns to Cardinals Lineup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Mark McGwire was back in the St. Louis
Cardinals lineup Friday night, even though it was for only one
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, batting second and listed as the second baseman, took a
called third strike from Milwaukee's Jeff D'Amico in the first
inning. As planned, McGwire then left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa wanted McGwire, who was
activated from the disabled list before the game, to get a taste of
live pitching.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was placed on the 15-day disabled list July 13,
retroactive to July 7, because of patella tendinitis in his right
knee. He is still unable to play first base, his usual position.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central-leading Cardinals hope to use McGwire as a
pinch-hitter in September. It's uncertain whether he will be able
to return to the lineup on a full-time basis if St. Louis reaches
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has hit 30 home runs despite missing 70 of the
Cardinals' 140 games. He took part in batting practice and crushed
at least 10 balls over the wall in left field as his teammates
stopped and watched.
</P>
<P>
   After J.D. Drew led off the game with a single, McGwire stepped
to the plate and was greeted by cheers from the sparse crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire worked the count to 1-2 before taking a called third
strike. He fouled off three pitches.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Destroys Car in S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A car bomb exploded outside a
crowded cafe on Friday night, the latest attack in a growing
campaign of urban terror being waged in this coastal city. There
were no immediate reports of injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb detonated outside the Obz Cafe, located in an area of
restaurants and bars frequented by students at the University of
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the explosive appeared to be similar to those used
in three attacks in August.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb went off a day after a judge Pieter Theron, 50, was
assassinated. He was getting out of his car in the driveway of his
Cape Town house on Thursday when a man and woman drove past in a
stolen vehicle and killed him with five shots.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the city -- a picturesque tourist
destination known for its tabletop mountain, pristine beaches and
vineyards -- has experienced a series of attacks against
restaurants, police stations and gay bars, which have left three
people dead and more than 100 injured. Some homes have also been
bombed.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for any of them. But police
and politicians have blamed a Muslim vigilante group called People
Against Gangsterism and Drugs. About 100 members are currently
awaiting trial on a range of other charges including possessing
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The group has repeatedly denied responsibility for the attacks
and says it does not condone violence.

<HEADLINE> 2 Salmonella Cases Linked to Juice  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Washing oranges to get germs off their peels
may not be enough to make sure the juice stays safe, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two salmonella outbreaks in the past 16 months have been linked
to unpasteurized juice made from sanitized oranges, CDC researchers
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The safest orange juice to drink is labeled as pasteurized or
made from concentrate, said researcher Josefa Rangel, who
investigated an April outbreak which sickened 88 people in eight
states.
</P>
<P>
   In June and July 1999, an outbreak affected 423 people in 20
states and three Canadian provinces, the CDC said. Forty-four
people were hospitalized, and one died in what was the largest
outbreak to date from orange juice contaminated during production.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had washed or chemically treated whole oranges,
killing virtually all bacteria on their peels, before extracting
the juice, Rangel said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is working on rules for the process and expects to have
them finished this year, agency scientist Shellee Anderson said.
She would not say whether a safety warning is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Gunter, general counsel for the National Juice Products
Association, said that, as far as she knew, the group's 68 members
either pasteurize juices or make them from concentrates, which are
heated enough to kill bacteria while the concentrates are being
made. Most major juice makers are members of that association.

U.N. Summit Closes With Resolution
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Finishing a historic three-day summit today, the
world's presidents, prime ministers and kings pledged to resolve humankind's

Bush To Negotiate on Debates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The Bush and Gore campaigns will meet with the
presidential debate commission next week to negotiate terms for a fall series of
televised confrontations, the campaigns said today. Republican George W. Bush
had been insisting on a schedule that would include only one
commission-sponsored presidential debate and two other less-formal TV
appearances. But some supporters had raised concerns that his stance was being
read by some voters as a reluctance to debate. Al Gore, the Democratic vice
president, has said he would consider other formats only after Bush agreed to
the widely telecast commission debates.

Feds Weigh In on Napster Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The federal government weighed in on the closely
watched case against Napster Inc. for the first time today, saying the
music-sharing service is not protected under a key copyright law, as the company
claims. In briefs to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for the U.S.
Copyright Office said Napster has ''no possible defense'' against claims by the
recording industry that it facilitates widespread copyright infringement. The
agency, whose position is not binding, sided with U.S. District Court Judge
Marylin Hall Patel, who in July ruled for the industry, finding that Napster is
contributing to widespread copyright infringement in violation of the 1992 Audio
Home Recording Act.

Congresswoman Disclaims Gore Comment
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A black congresswoman who asserted Vice President Al Gore
has a low ''Negro tolerance level'' backed off today, saying the claim was in a
draft statement not meant to be released. Rep. Cynthia McKinney's office issued
a statement on Aug. 29 related to a lawsuit brought by three black Secret
Service agents in which she said Gore's ''Negro tolerance level has never been
too high,'' said McKinney, D-Ga. After a week of Associated Press efforts to
reach her for comment, her office issued a new statement late today. ''These
remarks originated in a draft of a press release that was in the editing process
and were never intended for public distribution. I disclaim all of those
comments,'' she said in the new statement. The lawsuit contends black agents are
passed over for promotions on Gore's security detail.

IRS Citizen Board Confirmed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after Congress legislated sweeping changes in
the operations of the Internal Revenue Service, the Senate finally confirmed
seven people to serve as ''private life'' members of an IRS oversight board. The
Senate confirmed the group by voice vote today, ending months of roadblocks
erected by individual senators often for unrelated reasons. The Treasury
secretary and IRS commissioner are permanent members of the nine-member board.
The IRS overhaul gave the panel the power to review agency operations to ensure
taxpayers are treated properly and oversight responsibilities regarding
management and recommendations for future IRS commissioners.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal health officials are posting on the Internet stark

before surgery. Last May, the Food and Drug Administration ruled that
saline-filled breast implants could continue selling even though they break open
at high rates -- as long as women are informed that one in six will require
additional surgery within three years to fix problems. The FDA demands that
surgeons provide special brochures detailing those risks before surgery.

<HEADLINE> 40 Brits Injured in Bus Crash  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- John Brown remembers that his tour bus full of
British tourists zigged and zagged like ''a Walt Disney ride''
before flipping on its side and coming to a screeching halt in the
middle of Nevada's high desert.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a nightmare,'' he told reporters Friday at Washoe Medical
Center in Reno, about 200 miles north of the crash site near
Tonopah, Nev.. All 41 people aboard were injured, some seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two people remained hospitalized Friday, including
Brown's 44-year-old wife, Audrey. She was in satisfactory condition
with face and shoulder injuries after being dragged along the
ground as the bus slid 200 feet on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Highway Patrol blamed Thursday's crash on ''driver
inattention.''
</P>
<P>
   A 72-year-old woman from Derby, England, lost both her arms. She
and five others who were seriously injured were the first airlifted
to hospitals 200 miles away -- to the north to Reno and the south to
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking forward to the trip on to Hawaii. But I only
care that we're not dead. We're alive,'' said Brown, 47.
</P>
<P>
   Five people remained in serious condition Friday in hospitals in
Reno and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists had flown from London to San Francisco, where they
started the bus leg of the tour, traveling to Los Angeles and Las
Vegas. They were headed north again Thursday for Mammoth Lakes,
Calif., when the bus went off U.S. 6, a two-lane road in remote
central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The driver tried to overcorrect to the left, and the bus
traveled across both lanes and went off the left side of the road,
authorities said. The driver again overcorrected, and the bus
overturned and slid for about 200 feet on its side.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Richard James said an
investigation was continuing but no drugs or alcohol were involved
and speed was not believed to be a factor either. ''We're pretty
much focusing on driver error,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, from Scotland, said the driver's side was sliding on its
side ''and passengers were being dragged physically along the side,
which resulted in horrific injuries. I never thought I was really
going to be injured. At that point, it was something like in a
carnival, a Walt Disney ride where you go up and down but you
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the bus stopped, people were crying, he said, adding:
''Everybody was trying to console each other. We knew we had to get
people out of the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Lotfali Rankouh of Los Angeles, suffered minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was registered to California Sun Lines Inc. in
Chatsworth, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a perfect record,'' said Reza Olandj with California
Sun Lines.

<HEADLINE> Young Twins Set to Join NHL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- While 19-year-old twins Daniel and
Henrik Sedin are looking forward to NHL life in Vancouver, Canucks
coach Marc Crawford is preaching patience.
</P>
<P>
   The Sedins, selected second and third overall by Vancouver in
the 1999 entry draft, are here with 22 other Canucks as the team
prepares for the upcoming NHL season with a 10-day training camp
and exhibition games against teams from the Swedish Elite League.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know they will always be of interest because of the newness
of them and because of the fact they are identical twins and are
both such high draft picks and they performed so well in other
places,'' Crawford said, comparing the attention to that received
by a young Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing we can do about that. But we are also very,
very conscious that they are a young part of this team and with all
young players there is a time for adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the twins skate live for the first time, Crawford
spoke of two adjustments the Sedins must make: in hockey and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The hockey adjustments involve a new forechecking system and
improved skating.
</P>
<P>
   ''In North America there is much more pressure on the puck
carrier right away and forechecking is much more aggressive,''
Crawford said. ''First they have to learn to become decent
forecheckers and get good anticipation and quickness with pursuit
of the puck. The other adjustment is that, when you have the puck,
the other team is going to be on you a little quicker. Over here
the puck carrier is allowed to carry the puck a little more
freely.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford quickly enrolled nine-year NHL veteran Trent Klatt as
an on-ice tutor. By pairing the Sedins with Klatt, a good
forechecker who works hard on both his skating and puck pursuit,
Crawford hopes to start the process early.
</P>
<P>
   The twins were expecting the change after meeting with Vancouver
coaches earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Sweden we are standing on the blue line waiting for the
other team to come, and in the NHL you have to forecheck all the
time so that will be a big difference,'' Henrik said.
</P>
<P>
   For the cultural adjustment, the Canucks will rely on fellow
Swedes Markus Naslund and Mattias Ohlund.
</P>
<P>
   Up until this year, the Sedins lived with their parents in
Ornskoldsvik, a small mill-town about 360 miles North of Stockholm.
Naslund, who grew up in the same town, remembers struggling to
adjust to North American life when he first arrived in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to them about pretty much everything. They had
questions and I've tried to answer the ones I could,'' said
Naslund, adding the lifestyle change is often harder than the
hockey. ''It's a big adjustment and for me it was the first time
really that I was that far away from home and living in a different
country and struggling a bit with the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, who coached Sweden's Peter Forsberg during his first
year in Quebec, isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the sense that these guys will become players whether
we do anything special with them or not,'' he said. ''They are
smart, intelligent kids and they are very driven. I think they'll
pick it up rather quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Leader Meets Israel's Barak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The leaders of Israel and Qatar met for
the first time Friday, despite dimming prospects for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   Qatar wanted to show that ''there are Arabs ready to extend
their hand to Israel if there is a just and fair peace with the
Arabs,'' Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin
Jabor al-Thani, told his country's Al-Jazeera television.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has established tentative contacts with several Arab
states since its 1993 recognition of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Qatar and Oman, two small Gulf nations, have
low-level ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium
Summit, Qatar's leader, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani, urged
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to reach an agreement with the
Palestinians, Qatar's foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
   The Qatari leader sided with the Palestinians in their dispute
with Israel over Jerusalem holy sites. ''All Muslim areas in east
Jerusalem should be returned'' to the Palestinians, the Qatari
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said in a statement that the two countries
decided to develop fledgling relations. ''Qatar is an enthusiastic
supporter of the peace process, and hopes for its success,'' the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Ford extends truck plant shutdown for another week  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. said Friday that it has extended
the shutdown of three truck factories by one week to divert 30,000
tires toward a massive recall.
</P>
<P>
   A longer shutdown is possible, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The tires are needed to fill replacement orders for 6.5 million
Firestone truck tires recalled in early August.
</P>
<P>
   The plants in St. Paul, Minn., Edison, N.J. and Hazelwood, Mo.,
have been closed for two weeks so that 15-inch tires used as
standard equipment on Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer sport
utility vehicles and Ford Ranger pickups can be sent to Ford and
Lincoln/Mercury dealers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the shutdown has freed up about 70,000 tires, but has
trimmed 15,000 Rangers and 10,000 Explorers/Mountaineers from
Ford's production. Ford said the additional week will cut another
8,500 Rangers and 5,400 Explorers from production. Not all the
vehicles would have used 15-inch tires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are monitoring the situation week by week,'' Martin Inglis,
vice president of Ford North America, said in a statement. ''We are
seeing increased production from Goodyear, Michelin and other tire
makers and expect that to grow rapidly in the next week or two. The
safety and peace of mind of our customers remain our greatest
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The plants employ about 6,000 workers, who get paid during the
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Firestone tires under recall - all P235/75R15-size ATX and
ATX II models, as well as Wilderness AT tires in the same size
built in Decatur, Ill., - have been linked to 88 deaths and at
least 250 injuries by federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Ford said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that it has agreed to bear some of the costs of
Firestone's recall. Ford did not give any additional details of the
cost-sharing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials also said it is too soon to tell how Firestone's
tire recall and Ford's plant shutdowns will affect Ford earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company said about 30 percent, or about 1.9 million, of the
6.5 million tires recalled have been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has counted 63 personal injury lawsuits and 35 class action
lawsuits pending against the company related to the tire recall.

<HEADLINE> Saul and Robert Steinberg sued by their mother for total $6.2 million </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Financier Saul Steinberg, chairman of the
diminished Reliance Group Holdings, and his brother Robert have
been sued by their mother for repayment of alleged debts totaling
$6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Steinberg, 83, of Palm Beach, Fla., says in court papers
filed Thursday that Saul, 61, had failed to repay $4.7 million she
loaned him, and Robert 57, vice chairman of Reliance, had not
repaid a $1.5 million loan.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, Mrs.
Steinberg said her sons signed agreements to repay her by Dec. 31,
1999. She said both have made periodic interest payments but
neither has paid any of the principal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although our client would like to resolve this matter without
resort to litigation,'' Mrs. Steinberg's lawyer, Mitchell Hurley,
wrote Saul Steinberg in letter filed with the lawsuit, ''her less
formal appeals for payment so far have been unavailing.''
</P>
<P>
   In another letter to the sons' lawyer, Hurley denied that Mrs.
Steinberg arranged to have the debts forgiven upon her death. ''Ms.
Steinberg has made no such 'arrangements,''' Hurley wrote to Marvin
J. Goldstein, ''and intends to collect the money your clients owe
her in full.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Steinberg is in precarious financial condition due to the
recent troubles at Reliance,'' Hurley wrote in an Aug. 21 letter to
Goldstein. ''As you are undoubtedly aware, Ms. Steinberg's sole
sources of income are the Reliance dividend and interest payments
on the two notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Robert Steinberg missed two recently due interest
payments, Hurley wrote ''this has placed an even greater strain on
Ms. Steinberg's financial position.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliance is a New York casualty insurance and commercial
property holding company that has been the victim of falling prices
for both commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which once tried to take over Walt Disney Co. and
Chemical Bank, recently said it might file for bankruptcy. At the
stock market's close Friday, Reliance was trading for less than 25
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Steinberg's promissory note is dated Oct. 1, 1996, and
his brother's is dated Jan. 1, 1997, court papers say. Saul
Steinberg's $4.7 million debt includes $2.1 million from a May 1985
promissory note. The interest rate on both notes in 5.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Weiden, a spokesman for Reliance, said Saul Steinberg would
decline comment ''because it's a personal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Steinberg could not be reached at his home in
Bernardsville, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Teachers -- but not kids -- report to school amid teachers' strike  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Buffalo teachers reported to class Friday -
but their students didn't - as the teachers' illegal strike
continued to disrupt the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders asked the district's 3,800 teachers to go to work
for the day ''as a sign of good will'' following a pre-dawn
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Superintendent Marion Canedo had already told students to
stay home because of uncertainty over the teachers' plans.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, Buffalo Teachers Federation president
Philip Rumore told reporters that state mediator Adam Kaufman, from
the Public Employment Relations Board, had directed the sides to
bargain around-the-clock starting Saturday and to refrain from
speaking to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Kaufman) also requested that, effective now, that there be a
complete news blackout, that neither side discuss anything that's
going on,'' Rumore said.
</P>
<P>
   School board spokesman Andrew Maddigan, however, said the board
had not agreed to any such blackout. The board met from 5 to 7:30
p.m. Friday to review research on the union's latest counteroffer
and the impact it would have on the district.
</P>
<P>
   Maddigan said the talks have shifted from each side submitting a
new offer to be digested by the other side. Instead, the ''subtle
nuances'' of some of the key issues are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The sides will meet Saturday at an undisclosed time and place,
Maddigan said. If school is to be closed again Monday, the district
will let parents know Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly optimistic (that there will be agreement,''
Maddigan said.
</P>
<P>
   With no students in class Friday, teachers spent the day
preparing lesson plans and their classrooms, said Rumore.
</P>
<P>
   The state mediator, meanwhile, went back and forth between union
and Board of Education negotiators discussing the union's latest
contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore said the offer represented the union's ''bottom line''
and that teachers would not bend on their demand for pay raises of
3.5 percent in four out of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The district's latest offer contains across-the-board yearly
raises of 2 percent in three out of four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way the teachers would accept less than the board
gave to everyone else,'' Rumore said, citing agreements with other
unions in the district. ''Why would we do that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education scheduled a Friday evening meeting to
review the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully we'll be ready to make a response, if not tonight,
over the weekend,'' district spokesman Andrew Maddigan said.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers walked informational picket lines before heading
into school Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a teacher here who wouldn't rather be
inside teaching,'' said teacher Gordon Angevine. ''These are some
of the most dedicated professionals you're going to find. But
enough's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike violates the state's Taylor Law which forbids public
employees from striking. Teachers could face fines of two days' pay
for every day off the job.
</P>
<P>
   The union also face additional penalties for violating an order
issued Wednesday by state Supreme Court Justice Kevin Dillon
barring the union and four of its officers from engaging in a
strike or other illegal job actions.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore and the other union officers cited in the court order are
subject to jail terms of up to 30 days each and fines of up to
$1,000. A hearing is scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they were willing to negotiate through the
weekend and expressed hope that classes would resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're saying, as a token of good will, teachers are going to
report today.'' Rumore said Friday. ''Let's start today talking
about a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said chances were ''so slim you can't see them'' that
teachers would return without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was called less than an hour before Thursday's start
of school, forcing the cancellation of what would have been the
second day of classes for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of children and their parents were already headed to
school and work and parents were left scrambling to find child
care.
</P>
<P>
   In canceling Friday's classes, Canedo said she wanted to avoid
similar chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' latest contract expired in June 1999.

	   WHITESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A financially struggling commuter
airline must continue to offer service in central New York to give
officials time to look for a replacement, a federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation has ordered CommutAir to
remain at the Oneida County Airport until Oct. 19. DOT officials
said they will start looking for an airline to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   The air carrier, which operates as USAir Express, carried 8,200
passengers in 1999, 12,016 in 1998 and 13,272 in 1997. Three months
ago, it sought to discontinue its service to Oneida County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   CommutAir was not permitted to shut down its Oneida County
operations because the Utica area is classified as an essential air
service area, government officials said. The agency could issue
another order extending CommutAir's operation.
</P>
<P>
   If another company doesn't come forward in a reasonable time,
the DOT could offer to subsidize CommutAir's Oneida County service.
</P>
<P>
   CommutAir now offers four one-stop round trips to Newark each
weekday and some one-stop round trips each weekend.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Kitna Seen Playing Sunday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Seattle Seahawks quarterback Jon Kitna
practiced Friday, one day after having sore ribs, and was expected
to play Sunday against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna left Thursday afternoon's practice because of discomfort
on his left side, and his status for the game was unclear. But he
said he was pain-free Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it will be an issue at all on Sunday,'' Kitna
said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury was the latest turn in an ongoing quarterback
controversy for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, coach Mike Holmgren gave Kitna the starting
nod after he was pulled in the third quarter of a 23-0 loss to the
Miami Dolphins in the season opener. Second-year player Brock
Huard, whose only NFL experience came in last Sunday's game, is
Kitna's backup.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren said rookie wide receiver Darrell Jackson will replace
Derrick Mayes in the starting lineup Sunday, while Mack Strong will
replace Reggie Brown at fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Christian Fauria practiced Friday and is expected to
play against St. Louis, although Itula Mili will start.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie tackle Chris McIntosh, who was a roster exemption because
he missed all of training camp in a contract dispute, was activated
for Sunday's game. Holmgren said veteran Todd Weiner will start at
right tackle, but McIntosh is also scheduled to play.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game has been blacked out locally because it did not
sell out by Friday afternoon's deadline. About 4,000 tickets remain
at the 68,000-seat Husky Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 3, Tigers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Esteban Loaiza pitched a five-hitter for his
second career shutout, leading the Toronto Blue Jays over the
Detroit Tigers 3-0 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer and Jose Cruz Jr. each hit their 29th homers for
the Blue Jays, who won for just the third time in the last eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza (9-10) struck out a career-high 11 and walked one in his
first shutout since Sept. 13, 1996, for Pittsburgh against San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, 4-4 since Toronto acquired from Texas on July 19, got
his first complete game since a four-hitter at Toronto on July 30,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Juan Gonzalez missed his fourth straight game with the
flu. The Tigers have lost their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weaver (9-13) allowed all three runs -- two earned -- and
seven hits for his second complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto went ahead in the fifth when Mickey Morandini doubled,
advanced on right fielder's Rich Becker's throwing error and scored
on Shannon Stewart's single.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer homered in the sixth, and Cruz homered in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer's 92 RBIs are a Toronto record for a designated hitter,
one more than Dave Winfield had in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Loaiza also struck out 10 against Texas on April 16. ...
Gonzalez has missed a career-high 36 games this season. With 22
games left, Gonzalez has 62 RBIs. In each of the past four seasons,
he has had at least 128 RBIs. ... Fullmer has 15 home runs since
the All-Star break. ... Attendance was just 19,121. ... Dunedin,
Fla., will remain as the Blue Jays spring training home for an
additional 15 years. The Blue Jays and the city have reached an
agreement that will see major renovations to Dunedin Stadium.
Dunedin has been the Blue Jays' spring training home since the
inception of the franchise in 1977 and home to Toronto's team in
the Class-A Florida State League.

<HEADLINE> Lazio campaigns for death tax repeal, Clinton trumpets education  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. (AP) - Senate rivals Rick Lazio and Hillary
Clinton stuck to familiar campaign topics Friday: He in the
suburbs, urging the repeal of the estate tax, and she in New York
City, reciting education themes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're either for the elimination or you're against the
elimination of the death tax, I think it comes down to that,''
Lazio said after visiting Blakely's Tree Company, a family owned
business in Westchester County. He later visited the Rockland
Bakery in Nanuet, a business run by five brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was part of an unsuccessful Republican-led effort to
override President Clinton's veto of a bill to abolish inheritance
taxes. The House fell 14 votes short Thursday of the necessary
two-thirds margin to override the veto with 431 members voting.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the 10-year, $105 billion repeal bill was
''a huge tax cut for the most well-off Americans'' that threatened
the nation's economic health and critical government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The travesty of it is that the death tax, by forcing people to
pay this tax simply because people die and forcing people to sell
their assets overnight, it devalues the economy, it undermines our
tax base, it undermines our employment base and it's wrong and it's
bad,'' Lazio said. ''I'm disappointed that both the president
vetoed it and that Mrs. Clinton supports the veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said, ''Hillary
believes we should pass a responsible and targeted tax cut for the
estate tax, that gives real benefits more immediately to small
businesses and family farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also criticized the president for his impromptu handshake
with Cuban President Fidel Castro at the United Nations Millennium
Summit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not have shook Fidel Castro's hand,'' he said. ''I
think he stands for oppression, for lack of freedom. He is
undemocratic, I think he has been terrible on human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio then alluded to his opponent's notorious embrace last year
of the wife of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat while visiting the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what there is to shake his hand about to tell you
the truth,'' Lazio said ''I think we send the wrong message when we
embrace, whether its Mrs. Arafat or Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't comment on the handshake, saying, ''You'll have
to ask the president and the White House about that.''
</P>
<P>
   On her visits to elementary schools in Brooklyn and Staten
Island, Clinton was grilled by students and met with teachers to
discuss their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Brooklyn's P.S. 169, an overcrowded 85-year-old school
that still has a coal burning furnace, Clinton hammered Lazio on
his educational record saying, ''when it comes to standing up for
the children of New York he's been missing in action.''
</P>
<P>
   She criticized him for opposing bills that would add 100,000
federally funded teaching spots and give New York $2.4 billion in
federal funds for school construction and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been saying for more than a year that I want to fight for
New York state's fair share. Well, one of the places that we could
get more of our fair share is in school construction funding and in
new teachers, both of which he opposed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also visited P.S. 36 in the Annadale section of Staten
Island, a school that suffered millions of dollars in damage after
allegedly being torched by several teens earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-olds in Judy O'Donnell's fourth-grade class cheered
when Clinton told them her favorite American League team was the
New York Yankees and she scored points with Rubinnis Gutierrez, a
10-year-old fifth-grader in Sunset Park when she declared her
support for recess.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a college student told her some schools are trying
to cut out recess and physical education classes. ''I not only want
you to have good things inside your head but I want you to be
strong and have fun, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you, thank you,'' gushed the dimple-cheeked Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Clinton joined her husband and five Democratic
senators at a dinner that raised about $615,000 for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. Silicon Alley executives paid
$25,000 each to attend. Clinton promised to work to improve
education so Internet companies will be able to hire qualified
workers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Touching on an issue important to the dot-com community, she
said that as a short-term solution, she would seek visas so
qualified foreign workers can enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also admitted apprehension about her first debate with
Lazio next Wednesday because she has never debated. She joked that
anyone who has ever covered her knows ''how hard it is for me to
say anything in 90 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also was asked about the debate, and although he has
experience in debates while running for his House seat, ''to be
fair ... this is a different league and I think everybody
understands that.''

<HEADLINE> Teachers Go to Class Amid Strike  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- An arbiter Friday directed the school board
and its striking teachers to begin marathon negotiations to resolve
an empasse that has cancelled classes for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, teachers reported to class, but the 47,000 students did
not. The district had cancelled classes to avoid the chaos caused
Thursday when teachers started the strike in the early morning as
students were heading to school.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Teachers Federation president Philip Rumore said Friday
afternoon that a state mediator had directed both sides to bargain
around the clock starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   School board spokesman Andrew Maddigan, said the board met late
Friday afternoon to review the union's latest offer. He said the
board would have a response by Friday evening or the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly optimistic,'' Maddigan said.
</P>
<P>
   With no students in class Friday, teachers devoted their time to
preparing lesson plans and their classrooms, Rumore said. In a
pre-dawn meeting, union leaders had asked the district's 3,800
teachers to go to work for the day ''as a sign of good will.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a teacher here who wouldn't rather be
inside teaching,'' said teacher Gordon Angevine, who marched in a
picket line Friday before entering school. ''These are some of the
most dedicated professionals you're going to find. But enough's
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   If school is to be closed again Monday, the district will let
parents know Sunday, Maddigan said.
</P>
<P>
   The district's latest offer contains across-the-board yearly
raises of 2 percent in three out of four years. Rumore said that
teachers would not bend on their demand for pay raises of 3.5
percent in four out of five years. The teachers' latest contract
expired in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The strike violates the state's Taylor Law which forbids public
employees from striking, and teachers could face fines of two days'
pay for every day off the job.
</P>
<P>
   The union could face additional penalties for violating a
judge's order barring the union and four of its officers from
engaging in a strike or other illegal job actions. A hearing is
scheduled for Monday.

<HEADLINE> Four more sentenced in $35 million shoplifting operation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Four more members of a Utica-based
shoplifting and fencing ring that stole millions of dollars worth
of goods from upstate New York retail outlets were sentenced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank L. Ferraro, 58, received three to nine years in state
prison and Carl J. Mazza, 56, one to three years on their
convictions for enterprise corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Zogby, 75, was convicted of fourth-degree criminal
possession of stolen property and was sentenced to nine months in
county jail and fined $5,000. Tammy Smith, 41, was also convicted
of criminal possession of stolen property and got six months in
county jail and five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   That makes 27 - out of 28- defendants sentenced in connection
with the shoplifting ring that operated in 11 central New York
counties and stole more than $35 million in merchandise over eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were made in February.
</P>
<P>
   The ring worked in teams and targeted specific items that were
believed to be easy to resell, including videos, razor blades,
batteries, compact discs, video games, Texas calculators,
over-the-counter medications, film, disposable cameras, electric
razors, tools, compact radios and CD players.

<HEADLINE> Timor Militias Stage Show of Force  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATAMBUA, Indonesia (AP) -- Hundreds of gun-toting militiamen
staged a show of force Friday in a West Timor village where U.N.
officials fear the militants killed 20 people despite Indonesia's
promises to impose control in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of new slayings came as Indonesia's embattled president
tried to reassure world leaders at the United Nations about the
situation in West Timor, where U.N. workers said militiamen were
terrorizing the populace and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials in East Timor said there were reports that
militiamen went on a rampage in Betun village on Thursday that left
20 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of 20 dead could not be confirmed independently. All
U.N. workers fled West Timor after a militia-led mob stormed U.N.
offices in Atambua, 30 miles north of Betun, on Wednesday,
slaughtering three foreign relief workers and three other people.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian army officers said only that 11 people had died in a
clash between militiamen and villagers near Betun, 18 miles from
the border between West Timor and U.N.-administered East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council insisted Friday that Indonesia
immediately disarm and disband the militias who killed the U.N.
workers and bring those responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimously adopted resolution, the council condemned
Wednesday's attacks and said it was outraged at reports of further
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have ample evidence that the threat is increasing,'' U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said before the vote. ''We must face
facts. The Indonesian military, or to be more precise, elements
within the Indonesian military, are directly or indirectly
responsible for these outrages.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, President Abdurrahman Wahid said his government had
sent a battalion of troops to West Timor and that he had asked the
United Nations for funds to relocate militamen from the province to
other parts of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is under control,'' Wahid told a news conference
Friday on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit. ''The
situation now is going very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The militias are the same gangs that, with backing from elements
in the Indonesian military, wreaked destruction in East Timor after
residents there voted for independence in an August 1999
referendum. Militiamen were pushed into the western part of Timor
island when U.N. peacekeepers took control in the east.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, about 1,000 militiamen, some dressed in Indonesian
military uniforms and brandishing guns and machetes, gathered in
Betun for the funeral of one of their commanders killed earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Militia chiefs at the gathering demanded East Timorese leaders
allow the militiamen to return to East Timor or face all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is quite evident that Indonesian authorities are
not in control in West Timor,'' said Norwegian Col. Brynar Nymo,
spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers in the East Timorese capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
   On roads throughout the region, militiamen set up blockades,
extorting money and cigarettes from passing motorists and searching
cars for any remaining foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Bernard
Kerblat said West Timorese locals and refugees from the east were
living in fear in areas under militiamen's control.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 120,000 individuals in a hostage-like situation''
because of the militias, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 U.N. and other relief workers who had been caring for
East Timorese refugees have been evacuated from West Timor since
Wednesday's attack attack in Atambua, which the world body says was
the worst ever against its civilian staff.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the UNHCR said any return of relief operations is a
question of ''not when but if.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has blamed his domestic opponents of fueling the violence
in Timor and in other parts of the country in a bid to destabilize
his reformist government.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Friday that fighting the day before between
government troops and separatist rebels in Aceh, another
violence-plagued territory, had left eight dead. The deaths brought
to 84 the number of people killed in Aceh since early June.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Atlantic City Ambush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A man with an assault rifle opened
fire on a car stopped at a traffic light Friday, killing three of
the four people inside, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 shots were fired in the pre-dawn ambush on U.S. 30,
about two miles west of Atlantic City's Boardwalk casinos,
according to prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz.
</P>
<P>
   The victims probably knew the killer, who remained at large late
Friday, Blitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman began on the driver's side and then walked around the
car, firing through the windows and killing the two passengers on
the right side of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   One victim tried to flee but was shot to death as he ran down
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor, who was sitting in the left rear seat, was injured
by flying glass but was not shot, Blitz said. He was cooperating
with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Blitz declined to provide further details, but he ruled out road
rage as a motive. ''I have a particular interest that the suspect
or suspects not read about it until I'm prepared to make an
arrest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were identified as Lamont Wilson, 21, Richard White,
26, and Michael Demps, 20, all of Pleasantville, N.J. The fourth
man wasn't identified by authorities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Apologizes to N. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The State Department has apologized to North
Korea for the forced search of that country's U.N. delegation
members en route to the U.N. Millennium Summit, saying it did not
reflect U.S. policy, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The search in Frankfurt, Germany, was part of a security check
as the delegation led by Kim Yong Nam, head of the communist
country's parliament, was transferring to an American Airlines
flight for New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was to have met with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung two
months after a historic summit meeting in Pyongyang with North
Korea's paramount leader, Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration approves of the thaw and has been
stepping up its contacts with North Korea, even while keeping it
ineligible for all but humanitarian aid as a supporter of terrorism
and dismissing any suggestion of withdrawing some of the U.S.
troops who have guarded South Korea for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea filed a formal protest against the United States
last Friday after the Frankfurt search, calling the incident
humiliating, and the delegation called off its trip to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Nam would have been the highest-ranking North Korean
official to attend a U.N. meeting since the two Koreas joined the
United Nations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation members claimed the search was ordered by U.S.
security officials, and North Korea's vice foreign minister, Choe
Su Hon, told reporters at a news conference at Frankfurt airport
that North Korea had demanded an apology from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a rude and provocative act,'' Choe said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines issued a statement Tuesday apologizing for the
search, but denied that the diplomats were asked to strip. No U.S.
government agencies participated in the search, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Albright said the United States sent a message of
regret to the North Korean government, and ''they expressed
understanding this is not a position of the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   She said North Korea would send a high-level delegation to New
York next week for the special session of the U.N. General
Assembly. She is expected to meet with its head.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will put this behind us,'' she said. ''What happened in
Frankfurt is unfortunate.''

Clinton: Hillary Put Career on Hold
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton, helping raise money for Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign, said tonight he has felt guilty for 25 years that his
wife had to put her career on hold while he held office. ''Of all the things
that her adversaries sometimes say, the thing that stings me the most is that
she wouldn't be doing this if she weren't the first lady,'' Clinton said. ''But
I want you to know if she weren't the first lady, she'd have been in a position
to do this 25 years ago.'' Clinton spoke at a $25,000-a-person fund-raiser that
was expected to net $615,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,
which is helping pay for this wife's campaign. He spoke after attending a U.N.
summit that attracted 160 world leaders.

   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The Bush and Gore campaigns will meet with the

had been insisting on a schedule that would include only one
commission-sponsored presidential debate and two other less-formal TV
appearances. But some supporters had raised concerns that his stance was being
read by some voters as a reluctance to debate. Al Gore, the Democratic vice
president, has said he would consider other formats only after Bush agreed to
the widely telecast commission debates.

Feds Weigh In on Napster Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The federal government weighed in on the closely
watched case against Napster Inc. for the first time today, saying the
music-sharing service is not protected under a key copyright law, as the company
claims. In briefs to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for the U.S.
Copyright Office said Napster has ''no possible defense'' against claims by the
recording industry that it facilitates widespread copyright infringement. The
agency, whose position is not binding, sided with U.S. District Court Judge
Marylin Hall Patel, who in July ruled for the industry, finding that Napster is
contributing to widespread copyright infringement in violation of the 1992 Audio
Home Recording Act.

WHO Warns of Mass Arsenic Poisoning
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Bangladesh faces the ''largest mass poisoning of a population
in history'' because of arsenic contamination of its drinking water supplies, a
study by the World Health Organization said Friday. The research by Allan H.
Smith, professor of epidemiology at the University of California at Berkeley,
said that between 33 and 77 million of Bangladesh's 125 million people were at
risk. Smith predicted a big increase over the coming years in the number of
cases of disease caused by arsenic -- ranging from skin lesions to cancers of
the bladder, kidney, lung and skin and cardiovascular problems.

Indiana Probes Knight Again
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Indiana coach Bob Knight called an accusation that
he cursed at a student ''absolutely, totally untrue,'' saying he simply gave the
teen-ager a lecture about manners while holding his arm. Nonetheless, the school
is investigating the confrontation and considers the matter ''extraordinarily
serious,'' university spokesman Christopher Simpson said today. Knight has been
under scrutiny since he was accused of choking a player during a 1997 practice,
and he was told in May he would be fired if he didn't adhere to a ''zero
tolerance'' policy imposed by the university.

<HEADLINE> Study Criticizes IOC in Drug Fight  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Olympic culture infused with corporate
endorsements and lacking unified leadership makes athletes more
likely to turn to drugs in their quest for gold, according to a
White House-financed study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 107-page report, released one week before the start of the
Sydney Olympics, criticizes the International Olympic Committee and
other sports governing bodies for their ''crazy quilt of
jurisdictions'' and inconsistent policies for combating
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The aura of secrecy in which these bodies squirrel test
results invites public cynicism about the integrity and the meaning
of record-breaking Olympic performances,'' said Joseph A. Califano
Jr., president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University. The center conducted the
two-year, $1 million study of drug use in Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends creating an international organization,
independent of the IOC, that would be responsible for drug testing
and banning substances.
</P>
<P>
   The World Anti-Doping Agency, established after an IOC-sponsored
drug summit in 1999, is headed by Dick Pound, an IOC vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the immense amount of money poured
into the Olympics, conflicting priorities among the sports
federations and the lack of an effective policing system, ''create
an environment that encourages doing anything -- including doping --
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the prevalence of doping among Olympic athletes
vary widely, CASA Director Susan Foster said. While the IOC and
other sports organizations say fewer than 3 percent of athletes
test positive for banned substances, some coaches and athletes
place that proportion as high as 90 percent in sports like track
and field, swimming and weight lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, at Olympic meetings in Sydney, said no one connected with
the study had contacted either the IOC or the anti-doping agency
for comments or explanation. He said the figure of 90 percent of
athletes using drugs seemed ''wildly high.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's U.S. based, it's historical, it's way behind the times,''
Pound said Saturday (Friday night EDT). ''It seem to be unaware
that WADA exists and has been conducting out-of-competition tests,
that we've got an EPO test, that there is an independent agency.
... I don't know if it's hypocritical or uninformed or what.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scientifically, if only as a matter of courtesy, they probably
should have checked with somebody. As a matter of scientific
method, they definitely ought to have, unless they are just talking
about the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Rogge, vice chairman of IOC medical commission, said he
had not read the report but that disagreed that the committee was
soft on doping and said U.S. sports had to clean up their own drug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we are not perfect on the IOC. We're fighting hard,''
Rogge said. ''I believe before giving lessons you have to be
impeccable yourself. ... Unilaterally attacking the IOC, without
admitting their own errors and shortcomings, I think is not very
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug policy adviser, said
he doesn't believe most athletes use drugs and recent efforts to
keep the 2000 Olympics drug-free had been making progress.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the results of the stepped-up testing in Sydney. China
announced this week it cut 27 athletes from its squad, including a
number who had failed drug tests. Athletes from Canada and the
Czech Republic also were banned for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some claim these busts are a scandal. In fact, they are
exactly the right signal that the Olympics and the international
community mean business,'' said McCaffrey, whose office funded the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends an international research effort of
up to $100 million to develop better drug tests and ''doping
passports'' to document an athlete's testing history.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that scientists interviewed by the commission
said their attempts to develop tests for banned substances ''were
stymied by late decisions and a seeming lack of will at the highest
levels of the IOC.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton says first lady put her career on hold for him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - President Clinton, helping raise money for
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign, said Friday night he has
felt guilty for 25 years that his wife had to put her career on
hold while he ran for office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the things that her adversaries sometimes say, the
thing that steams me the most is that she wouldn't be doing this if
she weren't the first lady,'' Clinton said. ''But I want you to
know if she weren't the first lady, she'd have been in a position
to do this 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at a $25,000-a-person fund-raiser that was
expected to net $615,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, which is helping pay for this wife's campaign. He spoke
after attending a U.N. summit that attracted 160 world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Praising his wife, Clinton said, ''When we first met and fell in
love, I actually felt guilty about it because I thought I was
robbing her of the career that I thought she should have.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought she was better organized than me,'' he said. ''I
thought she understood things about public policy I didn't know. I
thought she had more talent as a public servant that anybody I ever
met.''

<HEADLINE> Idaho's Racist Image May Change  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Northern Idaho, predominantly white
and rural, has been home for nearly three decades to the racist
Aryan Nations. It has struggled with a reputation as a haven for
hate.
</P>
<P>
   But residents say a $6.3 million jury verdict returned Thursday
against Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler and three of his
followers for attacking two people near the sect's compound may be
the first step toward rehabilitating the region's image.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small step for human rights, one giant step for
Idaho,'' said Marshall Mend, a human rights activist whose home and
business were allegedly targeted for firebombings by Aryan Nations
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Kootenai County said, 'No more hate.' I see it
as being very, very positive,'' Mend said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center
in Montgomery, Ala., and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs,
said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the
Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name.
</P>
<P>
   He even suggested turning the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound
into a center for tolerance, teaching about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But putting a hate group out of business isn't easy: While Dees
has won significant civil judgments against the Ku Klux Klan and
the White Aryan Resistance, the groups have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Levin, a California State University professor who has
studied hate groups, said legal moves have damaged the groups but
their strong ideology has proved as vital as funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''What lawsuits can't do is cripple a movement,'' Levin said,
adding that racist organizations now focus on small cells of
individuals, rather than larger, organized groups such as Butler's.
</P>
<P>
   New technology, especially the Internet, also has allowed
extremists to reach a much larger audience at less cost. Some
organizations also have their own wealthy patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In Butler's case, Vincent Bertollini, a self-styled evangelist
in the anti-Semitic 11th Hour Remnant Messenger of Sandpoint,
offered to pick up the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bertollini reportedly made millions in California's Silicon
Valley before moving to northern Idaho to found his sect, which
pays for mass mailings of Christian Identity tracts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money is nothing. It's the idea,'' Bertollini said after
the verdict. ''What we are sending is a message. I can do it in any
city in the country. The message is separatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, in fact, appeared confident after the verdict. Outside
the courtroom, the 82-year-old Butler said Idaho's Panhandle would
continue to be a haven for racists.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he applied for a parade permit to march in downtown
Coeur d'Alene either Oct. 15 or Oct. 28, said Julia Aho, deputy
city clerk. The application will be reviewed by police, who will
consider security issues, and then turned over to city leaders for
possible approval.
</P>
<P>
   The group's parade in 1998 attracted about 100 followers and
many more counter-demonstrators. In 1999, fewer than two dozen
marched.
</P>
<P>
   Kootenai County has about 220 blacks in an estimated population
of more than 100,000, Mend said. He downplayed Butler's claims,
saying only about 100 Aryan Nations members lived in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While Butler has never been convicted of any crime, his group
has attracted neo-Nazis, supremacists and separatists to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Most notorious of these groups was The Order, a violent offshoot
that embarked on a nationwide crime spree in the 1980s, including
armored car robberies and the slaying of Jewish talk show host Alan
Berg in Denver. Most of the group's followers are in jail and its
leader was killed during a 1984 shoot-out with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's case, jurors found that Butler, his organization
and its corporate entity were negligent in the selecting and
overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Keenans were chased, shot at and assaulted after they
stopped to search for a dropped wallet near the entrance to the
Aryan Nations' compound. Jurors set $6 million as the punitive
award.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to bury the whole Aryan Nations,'' Judy Jacobson
said of her fellow jurors. The 45-year-old carpet layer said she
and two other jurors prevented the panel from awarding a much
higher judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to get the Aryan Nations out of the country,'' she
said. ''I'm not going to force this guy out of his property and his
home, just because you don't believe in his beliefs.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Urges Peru to Free Woman  </HEADLINE>
By CARMEN VALDIVIESO HULBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson appeared unexpectedly at
a luncheon for Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on Friday,
urging the leader to release an American woman who has spent nearly
five years in jail in Peru for treason.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the release of New York-native Lori Berenson would
help improve U.S. relations with Peru, which has been criticized
for a ragged human rights record and alleged irregularities in
Fujimori's recent election to a third straight term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met, meanwhile, with
Fujimori and urged him to implement a plan for democratic reform
proposed by the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   He responded that he intended to carry out the reforms, which
include restoring the country's disbanded constitutional court, a
senior U.S. official said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told reporters she raised the Berenson case with the
Peruvian president and that she was hopeful it would be resolved
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that somewhere the system can find the capacity to
forgive her and free her,'' said Jackson, who made his comments as
the Peruvian leader was taking questions from people at the
luncheon. ''Such a humane gesture would be of benefit to everyone
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori, who was one of about 150 leaders attending the
U.N. Millennium Summit in New York, responded it was Peru's
judiciary's job to decide her fate not his.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a delicate issue for Peruvians,'' Fujimori later told
reporters, referring to Peru's war against the Tupac Amaru and
Shining Path guerrillas, which left 25,000 dead and devastated the
economy since it began in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a veteran civil rights activist, said he planned to
visit Peru to make a ''mercy plea'' for her release, but that the
date of the trip had not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who showed up uninvited to the event, added that he
thought she did not receive a fair trial when a secret military
court sentenced her to life in prison in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, was convicted by a military tribunal for helping
leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels plan an attack on
Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's highest military court announced last week that it had
overturned that conviction, paving the way for a new trial in a
civilian court, a longtime demand of U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   But state prosecutors have predicted Berenson will likely
receive a minimum 20-year sentence in the civilian trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori largely stamped out the groups in the early 1990s using
tough tactics and summary military courts to imprison suspected
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not making any accusation against Lori Berenson, but she
was detained with a group that was going to assault congress,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for understanding from Americans he said: ''The United
States has known terrorism with the attacks on the World Trade
Center and in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Fujimori proposed to world leaders at the summit
that the bank accounts and other properties of drug traffickers be
seized and the money used to help ease extreme poverty in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that mechanisms be created to ''permit these evilly
obtained resources to be confiscated for the benefit of poor
countries,'' which he said are harmed most by drug production and
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world's cocaine is produced in Peru, which also
suffers from widespread poverty.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Drugs Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A British cyclist who tested positive for drugs was
barred from
racing for a year Friday, while a Canadian equestrian team member
was banned for life for cocaine use and another Olympian from
Canada lost her appeal of a positive steroid test.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Problems with athlete drug use continued to pop up in the final
days before the Sydney Olympics as a White House-financed study on
drug testing was released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommended establishing an agency independent of the
International Olympic Committee to take on the task of drug testing
and determining which substances to ban.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Canadian Equestrian Federation banned Eric Lamaze
from competition for life because he tested positive for cocaine
for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Lamaze, the 1995 Canadian show-jumping champion, was kicked off
the Olympic team when he tested positive Aug. 29. He asked that his
urine sample be retested, but the results of that test Thursday at
an accredited IOC lab also came up positive.
</P>
<P>
   Lamaze was to compete in the team and individual jumping events
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a sad day for all of us,'' federation executive director
Don Adams said. ''We are very sorry for what this means for Eric,
who was an outstanding athlete at the peak of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   A doping review panel from the Canadian Center for Ethics also
upheld the suspension of hammer thrower Robin Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, the Canadian national champion, tested positive for
norandrosterone, a metabolite of nandrolone, at the Olympic trials
in August.
</P>
<P>
   She can still appeal to an independent arbitrator who could rule
by the end of next week. Lyons, 23, of Edmonton, has denied taking
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not Ben Johnson,'' she said this week, referring to the
Canadian sprinter stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters at
the Seoul Olympics after testing positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In England, British cyclist Neil Campbell was found guilty of a
drug offense and banned from competition for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, 26, was included on the Olympic squad but had not been
selected for Britain's final team. Two tests showed Campbell had
higher concentrations of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) than
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was asked to account for the findings at a disciplinary
hearing Friday, after which he was found guilty of breaking British
Cycling Federation and international anti-doping rules.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University released a report that said
heavy corporate endorsement of the Olympics combined with the lack
of an effective drug policing system ''create an environment that
encourages doing anything -- including doping -- to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Anti-Doping Agency is run by Dick Pound, an IOC vice
president. The IOC set up the agency to coordinate a global system
of no-notice, out-of-competition testing, but the study said an
independent agency could do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, at Olympic meetings in Sydney, said no one connected with
the study had contacted either the IOC or the anti-doping agency
for comments or explanation.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 2, Mets 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Scott Rolen hit a two-run homer in the eighth
inning as the Philadelphia Phillies snapped an eight-game skid and
sent the New York Mets deeper into their September funk with a 2-0
win Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York has lost six of seven to open the month, dredging up
memories of late-season folds the past two seasons, and has fallen
behind Atlanta in the NL East race. The Mets still lead Arizona by
4&AMP;frac12; games in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Even a return home and a matchup with the worst team in the
majors couldn't help the Mets. Bruce Chen and four relievers shut
down the struggling New York offense, and Philadelphia finally
broke through against Mike Hampton with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (13-9) walked Doug Glanville on a 3-2 pitch before
running the count full to Rolen, who hit a shot into the left-field
bleachers for his 23rd homer. That gave Philadelphia only its
second lead in the past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   A disgusted Hampton left the game after walking Pat Burrell. He
threw his glove against the dugout wall, slapped a towel against
the bench and punched the water cooler with his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates sat and watched dumbfounded as Hampton stormed off
to the clubhouse, throwing his cap to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Phillies, who swept a key September series from
New York last year, have won five of seven against New York this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Chen matched zeros with a top starter for the second straight
start. After getting a no-decision in Philadelphia's 1-0, 10-inning
loss to Kevin Brown and Los Angeles last Saturday, Chen pitched 6
1-3 shutout innings to run his scoreless streak to 20 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed eight hits and one walk and pitched out of trouble a
few times, including getting Derek Bell to fly out with runners on
second and third to end the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Chen left with runners on first and second in the seventh, but
Vicente Padilla (4-5) got Benny Agbayani and Bell to ground out to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley came on with two on and two outs in the eighth and
got Jay Payton to pop out to end the threat. Brantley finished for
his 22nd save in 26 chances.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which has lost 14 of 16 games in September dating to
last season, has scored just 32 runs in the past 12 games. The Mets
stranded 11 runners.
</P>
<P>
   The fickle Mets fans, tired of watching their team's annual
September swoon, booed every failed rally. New York lost the final
five games of 1998 to miss the playoffs and dropped seven straight
late last season before rallying to win a wild card playoff at
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Chen is 0-1 with a 2.45 ERA in his last six starts. He has
been backed by only 10 runs in that span. ... Of the Mets' final 22
games, 16 are against Philadelphia, Montreal and Milwaukee -- who
entered the day playing a combined .418. The rest are against
first-place Atlanta. ... Many of the Mets hitters have gone into
slumps at the same time: Mike Piazza is 4-for-20; Todd Zeile
3-for-17; Edgardo Alfonzo 5-for-21; Robin Ventura 3-for-41; and
Payton 3-for-23. ... The Phillies, who have 18 runs in the last
nine games, had gone 68 straight innings without leading at the end
of a frame.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 4, Red Sox 0  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Roger Clemens kept winning, David Justice and
Derek Jeter kept hitting and the New York Yankees padded their
comfortable lead in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, unbeaten for three months, pitched five-hit ball for
eight innings Friday night to lead the Yankees over the Boston Red
Sox 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pitcher Bryce Florie was knocked out of the game in the
ninth inning by a liner off the bat of Ryan Thompson. The ball hit
Florie in the face, and was taken off the field on a cart with
blood on his face. Thompson was thrown out at first by third
baseman Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   Justice homered and drove in two runs, and Jeter added a two-run
single in the ninth as the Yankees won for the seventh time in nine
games and increased their AL East lead to a season-high seven games
over second-place Boston. Each team has 24 games left, including
the next three against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (12-6) struck out seven, walked two and outdueled rookie
Tomo Ohka (3-4), who left after allowing two runs and five hits --
three by Justice and two by Jose Canseco -- in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who hasn't lost in 17 starts since June 9 against the
New York Mets, lowered his ERA to 3.38, second in the AL behind
Boston's Pedro Martinez (1.66), who starts Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, Clemens and Martinez each threw eight scoreless
innings before Trot Nixon's two-run homer in the ninth gave Boston
a 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect ninth Friday. During Clemens'
streak, Clemens has left six games with leads his bullpen wasted.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fourth, Derek Jeter was hit by a pitch and
took second when Jose Offerman booted Paul O'Neill's grounder to
second for an error. Jeter advanced on Tino Martinez's flyout and
scored on Justice's single.
</P>
<P>
   Justice has 48 RBIs in 57 games since the Yankees acquired him
from Cleveland on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka, who benefited from three double plays in the first five
innings, weakened in the seventh when Justice led off with his 37th
homer of the year, his 16th with the Yankees. Justice also had a
two-run homer Thursday night in a 7-3 win at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka left after Canseco's one-out double, and Tim Wakefield
retired the next two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens struck out the leadoff batter in the first, second and
fourth, allowing only a single by Dante Bichette and a triple by
Merloni in that span.
</P>
<P>
   He fanned the last two batters in the fifth before Nixon led off
the sixth with a double. But Clemens retired the next three
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Boston threatened again in the seventh when a single by Bichette
and a walk to Jason Varitek put runners at first and second with
two outs. But Merloni struck out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Yankees CF Bernie Williams missed his fourth straight game
with a strained right ribcage. ... Boston 1B Brian Daubach was
0-for-12 in his career against Clemens before lining a single past
the pitcher in the fifth. ... Ohka has pitched at least five
innings in all eight starts this season. ... Canseco was hitless in
17 at-bats before going 2-for-2 with a walk against his former
team. ... Jeter reached base four times on two walks, a
hit-by-pitch and a single; he has reached safely in 33 consecutive
games. He also stole two bases. ... New York is 11-4 in its last 15
road games.

<HEADLINE> Putin Shows Taste for Diplomacy  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin turned
the U.N. Millennium Summit into a marathon meet-and-greet, aiming
to befriend as many world leaders as he could in just three days.
He then capped his first visit to the United States with a
television appearance on the Larry King Live Show, a must for any
media-savvy leader.
</P>
<P>
   His goal: to restore the global clout that Russia has lost since
the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   From his first appearance at the summit, when he got out of his
limousine shirt-sleeved and hastily put on his formal jacket, Putin
exuded briskness. He spent most of the summit's three days chatting
with a long string of leaders -- from Bill Clinton to Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Boris Yeltsin's Russia, which had a limited range of
partners, Putin seeks to expand their number by turning to leaders
from different parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's wry humor and stealthy style contrasted sharply with
Yeltsin's bear hugs and boisterous manner. Where Yeltsin relished
attracting attention with controversial statements and antics,
Putin prefers a subtle conversation.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance on King's program, Putin displayed a rare
agility in shooting down difficult questions ranging from the
ongoing controversy with the United States on missile defenses to
his own past as a KGB spy. His performance was even more surprising
given the fact that he mostly faces friendly questions and speaks
in carefully orchestrated television slots at home.
</P>
<P>
   Putin defended his handling of the Kursk submarine disaster,
though he was quick to admit that he had made a public relations
mistake by failing to quickly interrupt his vacation when the
disaster occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the allegations that his government was suppressing
media freedom, saying that the claim was being spread by media
tycoons who want to cover up their own flaws. Putin also promised
to look into the case of Edmund Pope, an American businessman
arrested on espionage charges in April, after a court makes a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed and speaking with ease, Putin offered an
unorthodox look at the issue, saying that ''intelligence can be
that harmful'' and then proudly spoke about his own KGB job, saying
it was ''interesting'' and gave him ''skills of dealing with
people, with information.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summit at the United Nations, he showed a talent for
flattery, finding nice words for every leader he met.
</P>
<P>
   He hailed Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides as ''one of the most
experienced European leaders,'' extolled the flamboyant Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez as ''one of the most dynamic leaders in Latin
America'' and praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for his
courage in Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed eager to joke. ''Congratulations on your
wonderful speech,'' Putin told British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
his only counterpart with whom he is on a first-name basis, after
both had spoken at the Security Council session Thursday. ''It
instantly woke me up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best compliment,'' Blair responded with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin doesn't speak English, he is fluent in German --
the language he spoke as a KGB intelligence officer in Eastern
Germany during the late 1980s. Putin had a chance to speak it when
he met with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   ''He spoke very, very well, I was astonished,'' said Germany's
ambassador to the United States, H. Juergen Chrobog.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's interlocutors were all eager to praise him. ''I have a
very good impression of him, he is a very professional
politician,'' Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The frenetic pace of Putin's meetings sometimes led to leaders
nearly colliding with each other at his doors. A South African
official who came to alert the Russians of the arrival of his
president, Thabo Mbeki, almost broke into the room where Putin was
still talking with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's visit was his first trip to the United States
since his election in March, he took in only a few side events in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   At one, he and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan went
to the Solomon Guggenheim Museum on Thursday to take part in the
opening of a Russian Avant Garde exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only kind of expansion by Russia which is possible in
the United States -- the cultural one,'' Putin said, winning loud
applause.
</P>
<P>
   He also attended the signing ceremony Friday for U.S. Eximbank
loan guarantees to Tyumen Oil Co., one of Russia's top four oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The executives who gathered at the Russian U.N. mission for that
ceremony had to wait for about half hour for Putin to complete his
talks with an exuberant Castro next door.

<HEADLINE> NBA:Timberwolves Violate Salary Cap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Charging the Minnesota Timberwolves, player Joe
Smith and agent Eric Fleisher violated salary cap rules, the NBA
started an arbitration proceeding Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agreement, which is set forth in writing, calls for future
payments to Smith of tens of millions of dollars, and was
deliberately hidden from the league,'' said Joel Litvin, the NBA's
executive vice president of legal and business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most serious salary cap offense that can be
committed by teams, players, or agents, and subjects the guilty
parties to substantial penalties under the CBA, in addition to
other potential liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor told The Associated Press that he
met with NBA commissioner David Stern on Friday and told him he
believes the team followed the proper procedures in reaching an
agreement with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him that I didn't think we did anything wrong because
everything we were agreeing to would have to be approved, and that
we had no side deals to show,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the Timberwolves reached an agreement with Smith
that would be submitted over a period of time ''that would conform
with the rules.'' He said the deal would ''pay him market'' based
on how the forward performs.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Fleisher for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA said that if the arbitrator confirms the existence of an
undisclosed agreement, the collective bargaining agreement
authorizes Stern to impose penalties that include multimillion
dollar fines, the forfeiture of draft picks, the voiding of player
contracts and the suspension of team personnel.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 5, Indians 4  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Just as they've done all season, the Chicago
White Sox took an early lead and the Cleveland Indians couldn't
catch them.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko made a diving stop at first with the bases loaded
in the seventh inning and hit a two-run homer Friday night as
Chicago moved a game closer to wrapping up the AL Central with a
5-4 victory over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Indians for the fourth straight time at Jacobs
Field, the White Sox increased it lead to 8&AMP;frac12; games over
second-place Cleveland. Chicago us 29 games over .500 for the first
time since the end of the 1983 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Mark Buehrle (4-1) pitched 1 2-3 innings for the win, and
Bob Howry got out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh with
Konerko's help as the White Sox improved to 8-3 against Cleveland
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke pitched the ninth for his 29th save in 34 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez had three RBIs for the Indians, who remained two
games ahead of the Boston Red Sox in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland might as well forget about winning the division it has
dominated since 1995, because it doesn't look like the White Sox
are going away.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin homered for Chicago, which has led the division
since April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 5-4, the Indians loaded the bases with one out in the
seventh on three walks, including two by reliever Kelly Wunsch, who
threw eight straight balls and was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But Howry got Roberto Alomar to pop out before Konerko dived to
his left to snag a line shot by Jim Thome that was headed to the
right-field corner. David Segui flied to right for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Steve Woodard (1-3) failed to get beyond the
fourth inning for the fourth time in his last five starts, allowing
five runs and seven hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko took a sarcastic swipe at the Indians on Thursday by
saying baseball should extend the season by 40 games to accommodate
all their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guess what?'' Konerko said. ''Everybody has injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Konerko to take another swing at the
Indians, hitting a two-run homer in the first off Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went up 3-1 in the third on Valentin's 22nd homer, and
Chicago added two more runs in the fourth on RBI singles from Chris
Singleton and Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez, who was on the disabled list the last time the
teams met, battled James Baldwin for 12 pitches before hitting an
RBI single in the fourth. Thome's RBI single then scored Ramirez,
cutting Chicago's lead to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians closed to 5-4 and chased Baldwin in the fifth on
Ramirez's third RBI hit. But with the tying run at third, Buehrle
got Thome to hit into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's single in the first scored Kenny Lofton to give the
Indians a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: At this point last season, the White Sox trailed the
Indians by 23 games. ... Indians SS Omar Vizquel made a running,
over-the-shoulder catch to rob Herbert Perry of a bloop single in
the sixth. ... Justin Speier's throwing error in the fifth was the
Indians first error in 82 innings. ... The Indians claimed LHP Eric
Dubose on waivers from the Oakland Athletics and optioned him to
Triple-A Buffalo. Dubose was a first-round draft pick in '97.

<HEADLINE> Galveston Marks Deadly Storm  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas (AP) -- The Sisters of Charity orphanage sat in
an idyllic location -- 93 boys and girls lived just a few strides
from Galveston Island's dunes and the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago Friday, the gulf ambushed the orphanage and the
city beyond. Ninety children and 10 nuns were among the 6,000 to
10,000 people who died when a surprise hurricane barreled ashore --
the nation's deadliest disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A day filled with solemn remembrances of the Great Storm began
Friday with a wreath-laying ceremony at the site of St. Mary's
Orphanage, now marked by a 17-foot sea wall that has protected
Galveston from the gulf's fury ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Murney's father was 13 when the hurricane flooded
Galveston on Sept. 8, 1900, and tore the orphanage apart, hurling
the boy into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''He especially recalled holding on to his younger brother,''
said Murney, 75, of Springfield, Mo. ''The roof collapsed and he
was hit on the hand by a timber. He had that scar on his hand all
of his life. He lost his brother, and never saw him again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour ceremony, 100 flowers -- 10 roses for the nuns,
other flowers for the children -- were laid at the historical
monument along the seawall. Members of the Sisters of Charity of
the Incarnate Word sang ''Queen of the Waves,'' the hymn their
predecessors had sung to calm the children a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   At a memorial service Friday night, prayers honored those who
didn't survive and praise for those who did. A 1,200-seat school
auditorium was packed with an overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Galveston didn't have to come back,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, a Galveston native. ''Who would have blamed Galveston
for saying, 'We tried, but it wasn't meant to be'?''
</P>
<P>
   Galveston in 1900 was the state's fourth-largest city, an gulf
port awash in wealth. Few took storms seriously.
</P>
<P>
   On a cloudy Saturday, rain turned into tidal floods and wind
accelerated to damaging levels. By midafternoon, the 3-mile-wide
island was battered by waves that tore apart structures near the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Around nightfall, the 15-foot storm surge moved ashore.
Inhabitants either went down with their homes or were ejected into
the torrent to fend for themselves. When the water subsided around
midnight, a wall of debris two stories high remained.
</P>
<P>
   While about one-sixth of the town's 38,000 residents perished,
the city refused to die. Man-made defenses such as the seawall have
held firm in hurricanes since.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, those who died will be commemorated by a 10-foot
bronze statue built at the seawall. It shows a man, a woman and a
child looking toward the islands.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Red Sox:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: CF Bernie Williams missed his fourth straight game
with a strained right rib cage, and is expected to sit out at least
two more. ... RHP David Cone, nursing a separated left shoulder,
was expected to rejoin the Yankees on Saturday in Boston. Manager
Joe Torre thinks Cone could return to the rotation next Friday
after missing just one start.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Dante Bichette, traded by Cincinnati to Boston on Aug.
31, improved his career batting against Roger Clemens to 8-for-18
with a second-inning single. Brian Daubach then flied out to fall
to 0-for-12 lifetime against Clemens. ... Jose Offerman's total of
three homers on Wednesday and Thursday marked the first time he has
connected in consecutive games since Aug. 5 and 6, 1998, when he
was with Kansas City.
White Sox-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: GM Ron Schueler said there's still a chance RHP Cal
Eldred could pitch again this season. Eldred had surgery Thursday
in which a screw was inserted near his right elbow because of a
stress fracture. Schueler said Eldred will play catch next week,
and if he shows enough improvement, Eldred will be sent to either
instructional league or Double-A Birmingham. ... The White Sox are
on pace to set franchise records in homers, runs, hits, total
bases, doubles and slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: After blowing Thursday night's game against Tampa
Bay, reliever Steve Karsay said it was difficult to control his
emotions once he got back into the clubhouse. ''I wasn't a happy
camper,'' said Karsay, who dressed in the shower and left before
talking to reporters. ''There's nothing to throw around in here.
Charlie got rid of the ping-pong table. We've still got the
big-screen TV, but I didn't want to spend $4,000.'' ... RHP Charles
Nagy pitched a simulated game and said he's ready to pitch next
Thursday against Boston, if that's what the Indians want. ''My
arm's OK,'' said Nagy, whose been on the DL since undergoing elbow
surgery in May. ''I didn't have the velocity I'd like to have. But
if they want me to pitch, I'll pitch.'' ... RHP Sean DePaula was
recalled from Triple-A Buffalo on Friday and placed on the 60-day
DL with tendinitis in his right elbow.
Tigers-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Juan Gonzalez missed his fourth straight game with the
flu. Gonzalez has missed a career-high 36 games this season. With
22 games left, Gonzalez has 62 RBIs. In each of the past four
seasons, he has had at least 128 RBIs. ... Todd Jones' next save
will break John Hiller's club record of 38. Hiller, a Toronto
native, did it in 1973. ... RHP Steve Sparks, the AL's player of
the month for August, will start Sunday instead of RHP Brian
Moehler. Sparks went 5-0 with a 1.69 ERA in August.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays entered the game batting an AL-worst .225
(50-for-222) batting average in September. ''When your not hitting
it looks like you're dead,'' Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said.
''Nothing is going on. You look flat.'' ... The Blue Jays reached
agreement Friday to keep their spring training home in Dunedin,
Fla., for another 15 years. Dunedin Stadium will undergo major
renovations, including new facilities that are to be ready for
March 1, 2002. ''The Blue Jays are pleased to extend a
long-established relationship with the City of Dunedin and the
County of Pinellas well in to the next decade,'' Blue Jays
president Gord Ash said.
Rangers-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers enter the three-game set with the Royals
without having won a series since late July. Since taking two of
three from the Anaheim Angels on July 24-26, the Rangers are 0-9-3
in series. ... The Rangers' 10-6 loss to the White Sox on Thursday
was the 39th time their opponents have come from behind for a
victory this season. Texas suffered only 30 such defeats all of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals will pass their attendance total from
last season with Friday night's crowd. With the 20,933 in
attendance for the final game of the Yankees series on Thursday,
the Royals passed the 1.5 million mark (1,500,369) after 69 dates.
The Royals drew 1,506,068 total in 1999.
Twins-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins, who went into Friday night's game 18 games
under .500 and in last place in the AL Central, have been outscored
by their opponents 754-652 this season. ... Minnesota has hit 24
home runs in their last 25 games, giving them 108 homers in 140
games. They hit 105 homers last season. ... Twins CEO Chris Clouser
attended Friday night's game. Manager Tom Kelly's contract is up at
the end of the season and he hasn't received a contract extension
from Clouser.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners have 10 one-run victories this season, the
fewest in the majors. They're 10-22 in one-run games. In 1998, the
Mariners set the major league record for fewest one-run wins in a
season at 20-20.
Orioles-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: When RHP Luis Rivera makes his Orioles debut, he will
be their 50th player of the year, a club high. He also will be
their 22nd pitcher of the season, which is tied for the second most
in Orioles history. ... Slugger Albert Belle was not in the
starting lineup Friday night and is listed as day-to-day with
inflammation in his right hip. He had missed the previous three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: With a 70-70 mark heading into Friday's game against
Baltimore, the Angels are 22 games ahead of their pace at the same
point last season and have equaled their win total of the entire
1999 season. ... Mo Vaughn was back at first base after being the
designated hitter in the two previous games because of a sore left
ankle. ... Three Anaheim pitchers who helped keep them in the
division race earlier in the season -- Jarrod Washburn, Brian Cooper
and Seth Etherton -- all are probably through for the season because
of injuries.
Devil Rays-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Seven of Tampa Bay's final 22 games are against
Oakland . . . Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild completed his
three-game suspension Friday for actions in the Aug. 29 brawl
against the Red Sox. Bench coach Bill Russell guided the team
Friday . . . Saturday's scheduled starting pitcher, Albie Lopez,
will make his 20th consecutive start after 152 straight relief
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's have five players with 20 or more home runs for
the third time since the franchise moved to Oakland in 1968 -- Jason
Giambi, Ben Grieve, Miguel Tejada, Matt Stairs and Eric Chavez. The
A's also accomplished this in 1996 and 1999 . . . Defense has been
one of the A's undoings. Prior to Friday's game, they were 39-22 in
games in which they did not make an error, but they were just 34-43
when committing one error in a game and 10-21 when they committed
two in a game . . . All four AL West teams are under .500 since the
All-Star break. Oakland's 25-27 mark prior to Friday's game was the
best.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Astros-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: OF Moises Alou had to leave Friday's game after three
innings with a strained right hamstring. His status was day-to-day.

   CHICAGO: The Cubs announced a change in their rotation. RHP Jon
Lieber will start Sunday in place of LHP Daniel Garibay. ... RHP
Kerry Wood did not appeal a three-game suspension issued by major
league baseball for intentionally throwing at a batter in the
Cubs-Dodgers game Aug. 27. Dodgers pitcher Ismael Valdes received a
six-game suspension and fine for intentionally throwing at a batter
after a warning had been issued. Wood, who started on Wednesday,
will not miss a start. ... RHP Jerry Spradlin, who was released by
Kansas City on Aug. 30, signed a contract for the remainder of the
season. Spradlin was 4-4 with a career-high seven saves and 5.52
ERA in 50 games with the Royals. He pitched the eighth, the 48th
player to appear in at least one game for the Cubs this season. ...
Rookie C Mike Mahoney came on as a defensive replacement in the
sixth, the 12th player to make his major league debut this year
with the Cubs.
Reds-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Reds SS Barry Larkin had arthroscopic surgery Friday
to remove left knee cartilage and is expected to miss the rest of
the season. He could return for the final week, but only if the
Reds have something to play for. C Eddie Taubensee also had
season-ending surgery to repair a ruptured disk in his back. ....
Going into Friday night's doubleheader, the Reds' 99-80 record in
Three Rivers Stadium was by far the best of any visiting NL team.
The only other longstanding NL visiting club with a winning record
there is Los Angeles (86-75). ... The Reds lost a game in the NL
Central standings to St. Louis despite winning 10 of 14 going into
Friday. ... Scott Williamson came off the DL (back spasms) to pitch
the first game of the doubleheader, his first start since Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates added RHP Brian Smith and OF Adam Hyzdu,
an 11-year minor league veteran, to their active roster. Hyzdu, who
has 188 homers in the minors, had his No. 16 retired at the end of
the season by Double-A Altoona. He had 55 homers and 184 RBIs in
233 games there the last two seasons. ... Hyzdu is wearing No. 27
in Pittsburgh. ... Smith is back on the 40-man roster after being
taken off in December to create a roster spot for OF Wil Cordero,
who was later traded to Cleveland. ... Kris Benson, who starts
Saturday, is 1-1 with a 1.13 ERA in two career starts against the
Reds. ... The Pirates haven't had a winning September since 1992
(21-8). ... Only one of the Pirates' top five farm clubs made the
playoffs, single-A Lynchburg.
Diamondbacks-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Manager Buck Showalter rejoined the club just before
Friday's game. Showalter left Atlanta shortly before the first

just three home runs in their last six games and nine in their last
16.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Manager John Boles returned to the dugout Friday after
missing two games to visit his 82-year-old father, who was
hospitalized in Chicago. Boles said his father was ''doing well.''
... With RHP Brad Penny making his first start Friday since
returning from the DL, Florida plans to use a six-man rotation for
the rest of the season. ... After the three-game series against
Arizona, the Marlins play the next 13 on the road, their longest
trip of the season: ''We're leaving as soon as the shirts are
ironed,'' said Boles, whose club just finished a six-game trip.
Phillies-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies, on an eight-game skid, led just once
during their six-game swing to Los Angeles and San Francisco and
never after any inning. Their last lead after an inning came Aug.
30, when they were up 4-1 after five against Colorado. ''Living
through it is tough,'' manager Terry Francona said. ''It's no fun
for anybody. We just have to do the best we can.'' ... C Mike
Lieberthal underwent tests in Los Angeles on his sore left ankle
and right elbow to determine whether he would need surgery. ... The
Phillies purchased the contract of LHP Thomas Jacquez from Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets returned home after a six-game road trip that
saw them hit .190 and score only 22 runs. ''Everybody has cooled
off at the same time,'' said Todd Zeile, who was 3-for-13 on the
trip. 3B Robin Ventura entered the day in a 3-for-38 slump; C Mike
Piazza 3-for-16; 2B Edgardo Alfonzo 3-for-17; and Mike Bordick
2-for-18. ... Of the Mets' final 23 games, 17 are against
Philadelphia, Montreal and Milwaukee -- who are a combined 173-241
(.418). The rest are against first-place Atlanta. ... SS Kurt
Abbott will rejoin the team Saturday after his wife gave birth
Thursday to the couple's second child: Kyle Thomas Abbott. ...
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, decked out in a Mets uniform,
threw out the first pitch from a full windup to Piazza. He threw a
strike.
Expos-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: 2B Jose Vidro, a late scratch against St. Louis on
Thursday, missed his second straight game after an MRI on Friday
revealed a partial tear of a ligament in his right elbow. Vidro
could possibly be available for Sunday's game in Atlanta and said
he will play the rest of the season and hopefully a winter of rest
will heal the injury. ... OF Milton Bradley left Thursday's game
with a strained left oblique muscle which he originally injured
Wednesday while making a throw. He's listed as day-to-day. ... 1B
Lee Stevens left Monday's game with a strained left big toe and
returned to his home in Grapevine, Texas. He will rejoin the team
on Wednesday in Montreal to be re-evaluated. ... The Expos and
their Triple-A Ottawa affiliate have renewed their player
development agreement for another two years. The Lynx have been the
Expos' top farm club since Ottawa entered the International League
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: OF B.J. Surhoff, who left Thursday night's game with a
pulled right quadriceps, will likely miss at least a week, the club
said. ... 1B Tim Unroe made his first appearance and start with the
Braves. Atlanta purchased Unroe's contract from Triple-A Richmond
on Monday. He hit .278 with 24 homers there in 121 games. He
previously played in the majors with Milwaukee (1995-97) and
Anaheim (1999) and had a career .233 batting average in 75 games.
Dodgers-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: RHP Chan Ho Park is 4-0 with a 0.84 ERA in his past
four starts. ... RHP Luke Prokopec will joining the Dodgers
rotation for the Arizona series which begins Monday. Prokopec made
his major league debut last Monday and threw three scoreless
innings against the Pirates. ... Although blowing eight of his
first 19 save opportunities, Los Angeles closer has converted 12
straight chances and has stranded all nine runners he has inherited
this season. ... The Dodgers were outscored 28-4 by Pittsburgh in
their last series at home. ... Los Angeles was five games in back
of NL-West-leading San Francisco on Aug. 29, but have dropped 10
game back by going 3-5 since. The Dodgers have scored more then
three runs once in their previous eight games. The team leads the
NL with 121 errors. ... OF Tom Goodwin has fanned 30 times in 34
games with the Dodgers. ... The 187 home runs is second most in
their stay in Los Angeles to 191 in 1977. The franchise record is
208 set in Brooklyn in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: RHP Pedro Astacio will start Sunday against the
Dodgers. Astacio hadn't been scheduled to start until next
Wednesday in San Diego after a line drive off the bat of Eric Young
of the Chicago Cubs hit him his right hand below the thumb on the
first pitch of Wednesday's game. Astacio threw without pain on
Friday. The move pushes RHP Brian Rose back to Tuesday, the first
game of the Padres series. ... OF Larry Walker underwent successful
surgery to remove a bone spur and a piece of cartilage from his
right elbow. The Rockies expect Walker to be ready for spring
training in February. ''Everything went well and he will begin his
rehab on Saturday,'' manager Buddy Bell said. ''The timing means he
will have time to heal and have a normal winter.'' ... 3B Jeff
Cirillo was given Friday and Saturday off. ... Colorado relievers
have not issued a walk in 13 innings.
Padres-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: 3B Phil Nevin, the Padres' top run producer, will be
out for at least two weeks because of an abdominal strain he
suffered Wednesday night. That's a blow to San Diego's hopes of
finishing at .500 or above. To get to the even point, the Padres
must go 13-8, and they have six games left against each San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Colorado and three against St. Louis,
all of which have winning records. ... Padres top prospect Sean
Burroughs had a pinch-hit homer for the USA Olympic Team in an 11-2
win over Italy in a pre-Olympic contest in Gold Coast, Australia on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: If Giants manager Dusty Baker had a vote for NL
MVP, it would go to 2B Jeff Kent. ''I look at his average, his RBIs
and his clutch hitting. Barry (Bonds) has been our home run man,
but Jeff is our RBI man. There are probably 10 or 12 guys who are
possibly in the running.'' When asked about the Cy Young Award, he
said, ''We have some Cy Youngs in the making here, but
realistically probably not this year. (Closer Robb) Nen is a
possibility, but he has the Fireman of the Year award. Starters
have the Cy Young.'' ... RF Ellis Burks wasn't in the starting
lineup Friday night just to give him a day off. Burks is .438
(28-for-64) with eight homers and 30 RBIs in his last 18 games.
''We want to keep him sharp,'' said Baker. ''This was the longest
stretch of games he's played, but the schedule was easier with so
many night games. We want him to be strong at the end.'' ... OF
Armando Rios will miss the next few days to join his family in
Puerto Rico following the death of his grandmother on Friday. He's
expected to rejoin the team on Monday in Houston. OF Felipe Crespo
started in right field in place of Burks. ... OF Barry Bonds is
scheduled for a day off on Saturday.
Cardinals-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire was activated before Friday night's
game. He struck out looking in the first inning and then was
replaced, as planned. ... Jim Edmonds needs one home run to become
the fourth different Cardinals player to hit 40 in a season.
McGwire (70 in 1998 and 65 in 1999), Johnny Mize (43 in 1940) and
Rogers Hornsby (42 in 1922) are the others. ... Pat Hentgen, the
starter on Saturday, has won four of his last five decisions and
will be trying to become the Cards' third 15-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: C Henry Blanco is out with a strained right shoulder
and could miss the three-game series against St. Louis. ... With
Friday night's game against the Cardinals, the Brewers begin a
stretch of playing 20 of their last 23 games against NL Central
opponents.

Colombia Passenger Plane Hijacked
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A man described as a leftist guerrilla prisoner
hijacked a plane carrying 21 people today, later freeing his captives unharmed
when the plane dropped him in rebel territory, police said. Three guards were
escorting the prisoner from Bogota to the southwest city of Florencia when he
managed to pull a handgun and commandeer the plane, police director Gen. Ernesto
Gilibert said. He said it wasn't clear how the hijacker got a hold of a weapon.
The hijacking occurred when the Dash 230 turboprop was making a refueling stop
at the airport in Neiva, a provincial city southwest of Bogota. It was on a
flight from Bogota to the city of Florencia.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton, helping raise money for Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign, said tonight he has felt guilty for 25 years that his
wife had to put her career on hold while he ran for office. ''Of all the things
that her adversaries sometimes say, the thing that steams me the most is that
she wouldn't be doing this if she weren't the first lady,'' Clinton said. ''But
I want you to know if she weren't the first lady, she'd have been in a position
to do this 25 years ago.'' Clinton spoke at a $25,000-a-person fund-raiser that
was expected to net $615,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,

had been insisting on a schedule that would include only one
commission-sponsored presidential debate and two other less-formal TV
appearances. But some supporters had raised concerns that his stance was being
read by some voters as a reluctance to debate. Al Gore, the Democratic vice
president, has said he would consider other formats only after Bush agreed to
the widely telecast commission debates.

criticizes the International Olympic Committee and other sports governing bodies

combating performance-enhancing drugs. The National Center on Addiction and

''extraordinarily serious,'' university spokesman Christopher Simpson said

<HEADLINE> Braves 3, Expos 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andy Ashby won for the first time in a month and
the Atlanta Braves, despite stranding 14 runners, beat the Montreal
Expos 3-2 Friday night for their fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan snapped a 1-for-15 skid with a go-ahead single in
the fifth inning and Chipper Jones went 2-for-2 with three walks
for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, coming off a three-game sweep of Arizona, extended
their NL East lead to 3&AMP;frac12; games over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (9-12), who was 0-4 with a 6.84 ERA in his last five
starts, gave up two runs and eight hits in seven innings. His last
win came on Aug. 8 in a 5-4 victory over Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker came on in the ninth to record his 20th save in 22
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Moore (1-5) failed to retire a batter in the fifth inning
as the Braves broke a 2-2 tie on Jordan's line-drive single to
left.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who scored twice and knocked in Atlanta's first run, led
off the fifth with a single. He took second when Javy Lopez reached
on third baseman Andy Tracy's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who entered the game with a NL-leading .443 average
against left-handers, followed with his RBI hit, knocking out
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Moore went four-plus innings and allowed seven hits, three runs
-- two earned -- walked five and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored an unearned run in the first when Expos right
fielder Vladimir Guerrero failed to catch leadoff hitter Rafael
Furcal's foul pop. Furcal then reached on an infield single, stole
second and scored on a single by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's other run came in the fourth on an RBI single by
Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, who have lost five of six and eight of 10, scored in
the opening inning on an RBI infield single by Guerrero, who went
3-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal added another run in the second on an RBI double by
Brian Schneider.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ashby's intentional walk to Guerrero in the fifth ended a
streak of 38 innings in which Atlanta pitchers had not issued a
base on balls. ... Ashby was 1-6 with a 5.60 ERA against the Expos
prior to Friday night. ... Montreal LHP Graeme Lloyd pitched off
the mound for five minutes prior to the game for the first time
since undergoing arthroscopic surgery May 5 on his left shoulder.
... Moore, recalled from the minors on Aug. 1, won his first start
that night and hasn't won since in his seven other starts. ...
Moore threw 102 pitches in his four-plus innings. On Thursday
night, Atlanta's Greg Maddux threw 90 pitches in a nine-inning 4-0
win over Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Greek Minister Opposes Free Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Greece's foreign minister rejected
the independence aspirations of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on
Friday, a day after meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not in favor of dividing people but uniting them within
a united Europe,'' Foreign Minister George Papandreou told
reporters in Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo formally remains part of Serbia, the largest Yugoslav
republic, even though it has been run by NATO and the United
Nations since NATO bombing last year forced Milosevic to pull out
his troops. But the nearly 2 million Albanians in Kosovo want
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, a NATO member with traditionally close ties to the
Serbs, maintains it is in a good position to help ease ethnic
hostility in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou was the first ranking Western official to visit
Yugoslavia after last year's air strikes to stop Milosevic's
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. He met Milosevic in
Belgrade on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to have a multicultural society and we are not
in favor of an ethnically cleansed society,'' Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed Western concerns about manipulation in Yugoslavia's
parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 24, in
which the Kosovo's minority serbs will be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials administering war-ravaged Kosovo fear a surge in
violence before the elections, which polls show strongman Milosevic
trailing the opposition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world will be watching (the elections) very closely,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has boosted its troop presence in Kosovo ahead of the
Yugoslav elections and municipal polls in the province itself next
month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Adrian P. Burke, a former New York Court of
Appeals judge who counted former Gov. Mario Cuomo among his clerks,
died Sunday. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was a judge on New York's highest court from 1955 to 1973.
His law clerks included Cuomo and Fabian Palomino, who later served
as special counsel to the Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   In his last opinion for the court, Burke wrote for the 4-3
majority that the wife of an Attica state prison employee should be
allowed to sue the state for her husband's death during the
retaking of the prison following the 1971 inmate riot.
</P>
<P>
   The state, claiming sovereign immunity, had argued that it
wasn't liable for the death of the accounting clerk who had been
taken hostage by inmates and then was shot to death by state
troopers retaking the prison.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, the clerk's wife was able to
establish that the state used excessive force and was awarded
damages for her husband's death.
Madeline Colliflower:
</P>
<P>
   HAYS, Mont. (AP) -- Madeline Colliflower, an American Indian
activist whose arrest for disobeying a tribal court order in 1963
spawned the Indian Civil Rights Act, died Thursday. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Colliflower, whose Indian name was Si-Siya, was one of the last
full-blooded members of the Gros Ventre tribe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, she was convicted for disobeying a tribal court order
to remove her cattle from land leased to another person.
</P>
<P>
   She sued, arguing her constitutional right to due process was
violated because the tribal judge also acted as prosecutor and
convicted her without allowing her to present any evidence or
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge W.J. Jameson originally declined to hear the
case, citing a lack of jurisdiction, but later ruled that
Colliflower's rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
   The decision led to the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, which,
among other things, guarantees defendants in tribal court the same
rights provided in the U.S. Constitution.
Robert Dewar:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Robert Dewar, who was responsible for changing
the name of S.S. Kresge to Kmart Corp. in 1977, died Thursday of
complications from colon cancer. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Dewar began his Kmart career in 1949 when the store was called
S.S. Kresge. As a lawyer, he started in the retailer's legal
department. Dewar eventually became president and chief
administrative officer in 1970. In 1972, he was appointed chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dewar's leadership, the Troy-based retail chain went
through a massive expansion. In 1971, the company opened 271 Kmart
stores -- a record single-year store launch for any retailer at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1988.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- George Lazarus, a widely known marketing

   EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (AP) -- Leonard J. Seyberth, credited with
developing the party permit system for deer hunting, died Aug. 31.
He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Seyberth served on the Wisconsin Conservation Commission, which
sought better ways of managing the deer herd, especially by
allowing hunters to kill does rather than the traditional bucks
only.
</P>
<P>
   Before the commission was created in 1953, there were
anterless-deer-only seasons and either-sex seasons. Under the party
permit system, a group of four hunters applied for an either-sex
deer permit. If successful, they received one permit.
</P>
<P>
   The system went into effect in 1956 and went on to be copied by
wildlife management agencies in many states.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Curt Siodmak, who wrote the science fiction
novel ''Donovan's Brain'' and created ''The Wolf Man'' for
Universal Pictures, died on Sept. 2 of heart failure. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   He was the writer or co-writer of more than 70 screenplays
between 1928 and 1979, including ''Her Jungle Love'' with Dorothy
Lamour in 1938 and ''The Invisible Man Returns'' with Vincent Price
in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   A series of ''Invisible Man'' pictures followed. His credits
also included ''The Wolf Man'' (1941), ''Frankenstein Meets the
Wolf Man'' (1943), ''Son of Dracula'' (1943), ''I Walked with a
Zombie'' (1943), ''The Beast with Five Fingers'' (1946) and ''Love
Slaves of the Amazon'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   His cult novel ''Donovan's Brain,'' first published in 1943, has
never been out of print. Siodmak's autobiography, ''Wolf Man's
Maker: Memoir of a Hollywood Writer,'' will be published by
Scarecrow Press in November.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Want Accord  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea assured
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday they want to move
from a cease-fire in their two-year border war to an overall
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was encouraged that both African governments wanted to
conclude the accord as quickly as possible, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said after Albright met separately with
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and President Isaias
Afwerki of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice will be in touch with
both sides to assist them, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is backing a 4,200-strong U.N. peacekeeping
mission to monitor the cease-fire but has said the troops could not
be a substitute for a comprehensive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, Zenawi and Afwerki were in New York attending the U.N.
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zenawi and Afwerki thank the United Nations for its help in
ending their two-year border war.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia was also supposed to address the Millennium Summit but
skipped the speech. No official explanation was given, but an
official at Ethiopia's mission said Zenawi had ''other
engagements.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenawi, however, did meet with Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Friday and told him Ethiopia wanted a peacekeeping force to be
quickly deployed along the contested border.
</P>
<P>
   Afwerki made a similar request in his separate meeting with
Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Statements issued by Annan's spokesman after the meetings said
both leaders reported that the cease-fire signed in June was
holding and both called for a swift deployment of peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations plans to dispatch 23 military observers each
to the capitals of both countries next week in line with a Security
Council resolution authorizing the deployment of up to 100 military
observers, according to the statements.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the General Assembly Friday, Afwerki expressed
gratitude for the United Nations and all those organizations and
states which helped end the war with Ethiopia, which killed tens of
thousands on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is gratifying to note that because of the efforts exerted
... the conflict has halted,'' Afwerki told the summit. ''This
unnecessary war has resulted in untold human suffering, the
destruction of life, property and infrastructure, deportations and
displacement of innocent civilians,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 6, Cardinals 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The mere sight of Mark McGwire in the lineup
wasn't quite enough to inspire the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire came off the disabled list and struck out in his only
at-bat since July 6, then watched the Milwaukee Brewers rally for
four runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat St. Louis 6-5
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was placed on the 15-day disabled list July 13,
retroactive to July 7, because of patella tendinitis in his right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa wanted McGwire to face live
pitching, so he batted McGwire second and listed him as the second
baseman. McGwire, who has hit 30 home runs in 70 games this season,
took a called third strike from Jeff D'Amico.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as planned, McGwire was pulled and replaced by Craig
Paquette. In the ninth, Paquette's two-out error on a grounder by
Ron Belliard allowed the winning run to score.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was more impressive in batting practice, when he crushed
at least 10 balls over the wall in left field as his teammates
stopped and watched. It's uncertain whether he would be able to
play full-time if the NL Central leaders reached the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Paquette was filling in at second base for Fernando Vina, who's
sidelined by bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers stopped a three-game losing streak, coming back from
a 5-2 deficit in the ninth against Dave Veres (2-4) and Mike
Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Loretta had an RBI groundout and Angel Echevarria's RBI
single made it 5-4. Timlin relieved and an infield hit by Jose
Hernandez loaded the bases with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz followed with another infield single that tied
it. Belliard hit a grounder up the middle that Paquette did not
field cleanly, letting the winning run score.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic (6-3) got the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ankiel stopped Milwaukee on one run and four hits for six
innings. He struck out five and walked two, and also hit an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals got to D'Amico for five runs and six hits in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Tatis and Edgar Renteria singled and one out later,
Ankiel blooped a single that made it 1-all. With two outs, Paquette
hit an RBI double, Jim Edmonds doubled home two runs and Will Clark
hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers took a 1-0 lead in the first when Geoff Jenkins was
hit by a pitch, stole second, advanced on a wild pitch and scored
on Hernandez's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz hit an RBI double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jenkins was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the third. He had
a bruised left forearm after being hit by Ankiel's pitch and was
listed as day-to-day. ... Vina missed his fifth straight game and
probably will sit out the next two against the Brewers. ... Brewers
catcher Henry Blanco is out with a strained right shoulder and
could miss the three-game series. ... Marquis Grissom had three
hits for Milwaukee.
