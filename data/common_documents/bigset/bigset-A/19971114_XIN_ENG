<HEADLINE> Kohl Opposes New EU Spendings on Job Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
made it clear today that Germany would oppose any European Union(EU)
project to boost state spending on job creation.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the parliament on outlining Germany's policy for
the November 20-21 European Union employment summit in Luxembourg,
Kohl reiterated that job creation is mainly a national issue, and
it is up to the EU's individual states to create political
conditions for job creation.
</P>
<P>
What should be achieved in the upcoming Luxembourg employment
summit is to coordinate job-creation policies among EU states and
to formulate employment guidelines, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of German opposition parties addressing the parliament
today, however, called for a concrete job-creation package in
Luxembourg and accused Kohl's government of trying to block the
common EU employment policy during the summit.

<HEADLINE> Russia Defends Position on Sanction Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia will continue opposing
any use of force against Iraq and any attempt at phasing out the
oil for humanitarian goods scheme, Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Tarasov said at a briefing today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the U.N. Security
Council Wednesday evening passed unanimously a resolution imposing
new sanctions on Iraq, including foreign travel restrictions on
the Iraqi officials obstructing the operation of the U.N. special
commission on Iraq's disarmament, set up by the council in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Russia has repeatedly called on the Iraqi
leaders to reconsider their decision, not to confront the Security
Council but to resume normal relations with the special
commission.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the Iraqi authorities were not prepared to do so.
This position was a disappointment to all Security Council member
nations," Tarasov noted.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.N. Security Council resolution on new sanctions
against Iraq "is aimed at having Baghdad resume unconditional
cooperation with the U.N. special commission" and Baghdad thus has
a chance to show a constructive approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said Russia will proceed on its line that the Security
Council should respond properly to positive changes in Iraq's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputies from the Popular Rule opposition
parliamentary group have proposed that the Russian State Duma
adopt a statement "on the dangerous escalation of tension
regarding Iraq."
</P>
<P>
They said "the formal pretext" for aggravating the situation
was "actions by the Iraqi leadership aimed to defend national
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
However, such actions were interpreted as Iraq's refusal to
cooperate with the United Nations for control over weapons of mass
destruction, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
The draft statement has not so far been put on the Duma's
agenda.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister Urges IMF to Avert Financial Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Finance Minister Paul
Martin has called for stronger efforts from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to preventive currency crises.
</P>
<P>
The issue is now at the heart of the agenda of G7, a group of
seven major industrial nations, Martin said in today's Globe and
Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The IMF set up an extensive early warning system following the
1994-95 Mexican peso crisis, including providing financial aid to
affected countries and closer scrutiny of their economies.
</P>
<P>
Yet, even that was not enough, Martin stressed in a speech to the
University of Toronto's G7 Research Group.
</P>
<P>
"What we were striving to prevent, in fact, occurred" when
Thailand was forced to devalue its currency in July," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What began as a Thai crisis had repercussions elsewhere in
Southeast Asia -- and, ultimately, as we saw last month, in all
the stock exchanges of the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this raises the issue squarely if what we did in the
wake of the peso crisis was, in fact, adequate," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
The G7 governments "must move from crisis management to crisis
avoidance" by making "further changes in the mandate and
operations of the IMF and other institutions," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wards off Fear over U.S. Embassy Threat Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Home
Minister Ong Ka Ting said today it was needless for the U.S.
embassy here to create an alarming situation as the credibility of
a death threat call it received could not be ascertained as yet.
</P>
<P>
"We will make sure every resident, visitor or citizen,
irrespective of which country they are from, will be protected,"
Ong told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy here said in a statement earlier today that it
had received a telephone call threatening to kill four American
citizens in Malaysia, but added "We are unable to assess the
credibility of these threats."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted Ong as saying
that the police had communicated with the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
He added that he had asked the U.S. embassy to submit a report
to the authorities about the death threat call,
</P>
<P>
"We guarantee that the police will investigate and take firm
action and ensure that anyone trying to undermine security and
create disorder will not get away. This is my guarantee on behalf
of the Home Ministry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ong also warned that individuals or parties taking the law into
their own hands would not be let to go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
"The government will never agree to anybody, any quarters to
take our law in their own hands," Ong said.
</P>
<P>
He did not comment on whether the call is related to issues
over a draft resolution proposed by some U.S. congressmen against
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and a U.S. plan to
investigate a Malaysian oil company's business dealings in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian cabinet Wednesday condemned the resolution
supported by 27 congressmen which urges Mahathir to apologize or
quit for alleged remarks about Jews which have drew criticism from
Jewish groups in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he had been misinterpreted over his remarks made
last month about Jewish involvement in speculative attacks against
Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also at odds with the United States over the
latter's plan to probe into its oil company Petronas under a
sanctions act that prohibits companies from investing in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia said it was prepared to receive U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State for Energy, Sanctions and Commodities William Ramsay who
is scheduled here next week, but added that it opposes any
investigation into Petronas and reiterated its position that the
U.S. Sanctions Act "does not apply to Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
Today, outside the U.S. embassy here, about 100 members of the
youth wings of the various component parities of the ruling
Malaysian National Front staged a peaceful protest against an
impending resolution in the U.S. Congress against Mahathir, and
also against the planned investigation into Petronas.
</P>
<P>
Ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO) Youth Chief
Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who led the protest gathering, handed over a
protest note to the embassy's Political Affairs Counselor Jeffrey
J. Lunstead.

LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu arrived in London early today for talks with British
leaders in an effort to revitalize the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During his brief stay in London, Netanyahu is expected to hold
separate talks with his British counterpart, Tony Blair, and
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to discuss his new proposals
for breaking the deadlock with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A British government official was quoted by the Reuters as
saying today, "We support the idea of a `time-out' in the building
of settlements. There is serious international concern at the
deterioration of the (Middle East) peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, the official stressed, "It is undesirable to establish
new facts on the ground to complicate the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace talks between the Israelis and the
Palestinians have run into serious difficulties since the Israeli
government decided to establish a Jewish settlement on the
outskirts of Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Americans Inspectors to Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced today its
decision to expel all Americans working for the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after a joint meeting of Iraq's
Revolutionary Command Council and the National Command of the
ruling Baath Party chaired by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
demanded the Americans to leave the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
This was Iraq's first reaction to the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1137 which was passed Wednesday. The resolution
condemned Iraq's non-cooperation with the U.N. arms inspection
teams, imposed a travel ban on senior Iraqi officials and warned
further measures unless Iraq withdraws its decision to expel
American arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"All Americans working for the UNSCOM have to leave Iraq
immediately until the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council
reconsider their irresponsible policy of dealing with Iraq and
resort to dialogue instead of intimidation and adopting unfair
resolutions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has decided to keep dealing with the UNSCOM and its
activities in Iraq and to accept new members of the commission
belonging to other countries than the U.S.," it added.
</P>
<P>
The current U.N.-Iraq crisis came after Iraq decided on October
29 to expel American weapons inspectors working for the UNSCOM on
charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors should verify that Iraq has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. can lift the crippling
economic sanctions on Iraq imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has turned back inspection teams that included
Americans nine times over the past 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's non-traditional exports increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's non-traditional
exports have increased four-fold in the last six years and
currently growing at 20 percent annually thanks to policy
measures the government put in place to stabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Finance Minister Ronald Penza here today
while opening a meeting of the central bank governors of the
Common Market for the Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Penza said a lot has been accomplished since the current
government took office for the first time in 1991 in the areas of
macro-economic stability after many years of stagnation and that
private sector-led growth has resumed after decades of
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
He said export development has become the dynamic feature of
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year the non-traditional exports earned the country 310
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is running a budget surplus this year as well as last
year through the dynamic economic policy, Penza noted.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion COMESA acting Secretary General Erostus
Mwencha said the major driving force for economic integration in
the region is not only by sharing some peculiar geographical
features, but due to the small national markets the African
nations have.
</P>
<P>
He said these small economies are disintegrated in terms of
transport and communication, production and trade and are not
viable entities in an increasingly integrated world.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is glad the financial market integration and
development harmonization program is on track, Mwencha said.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today assured U.S. citizens in Malaysia of their
safety after the U.S. Embassy here received a death threat call
against Americans.
</P>
<P>
He gave the assurance in Taiping, some 290 km north of the
capital, after the U.S. embassy here said it had received a

the embassy said it was unable to assess the credibility of the
threat.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe Malaysians will act violently against
Americans in the country," Mahathir was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama as telling reporters there.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said U.S. citizens in Malaysia need not to feel
intimidated by the threat because "Malaysians are not quarreling
with Americans."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting said here
today that it was needless for the embassy to create an alarming

could not be ascertained as yet.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's regional trade liberalization on Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia' regional
liberalization under the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) has progressed more rapidly than with the rest of
the world, Finance Minister Ronald Penza said here today.
</P>
<P>
The highest COMESA tariff rate is now 10 percent compared to
general tariff rate of 25 percent, he told the opening meeting of
the central bank governors of COMESA member countries.
</P>
<P>
Penza said the low tariffors rate under COMESA reflects the
government's strong commitment to regional integration through
reforming trade policies.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 tariff rates have come down from a high of 50
percent to 25 percent, further underlining the government policy
of opening up the economy and encouraging exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to further trade liberalization, and we will
be sure that we do not allow our real exchange rate to
appreciate, which would risk putting our new exporters at a
competitive disadvantage," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will maintain its liberalized exchange and payment
systems and would improve manufacturing under bond system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Penza said these will give exporters access to imported inputs
at world market prices which is vital for them to successfully
compete on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Promoting regional integration involves much more than
reducing tariffs as there is potential for increasing efficiency
and trade through a variety of other channels, he said.

<HEADLINE> London Gold Clearing Volumes Rise Sharply in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The average daily clearing
turnover for gold in London rose to 42 million ounces last month,
the highest level since statistics began a year ago, Financial
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the London Bullion Market Association, the
newspaper said that October's clearing volume was 22 percent above
the September daily average and 53 percent ahead of October last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, last month's daily turnover was also the highest
since October 1996 in value terms, which was at 13.6 billion US
dollars, compared with 11.1 billion in September and 10.5 billion
in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The association said that although gold's price fell to a
12-year low in October, the volume of the precious metal cleared
in London still hit record. The main reason lay in the fact that
producers rushed to hedge their output.

OTTAWA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's federal and provincial
governments have agreed to stabilize the country's greenhouse gas
emissions to 1990 levels by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Government officials agreed to "seek to reduce aggregate
greenhouse gas emissions in Canada to the 1990 levels by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The decision means Canada now has 13 years to meet the 1990
greenhouse gas emission target.
</P>
<P>
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, Canada said it
would reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
the consensus provides Canada's federal government with a
concrete position to bring to the Kyoto conference, where over 150
countries will try to forge an agreement on combating global
warming.
</P>
<P>
Canada's current greenhouse gas output is 13 percent higher
than the 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Natural Resources Minister Ralph Goodale said his
country will try to reach the new target by setting energy
efficiency standards, promoting technological advances and

TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
met here today with Daisaku Ikeda, honorary president of
Sokagakukai, a well-known non-governmental academic institution.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that under the leadership of Ikeda, Sokagakukai
has been advocating and backing the development of Sino-Japanese
friendship and has made great contributions to the normalization
and promotion of China-Japan ties.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Li said, the institution has played a positive
role in increasing exchanges between China and Japan in culture,
education and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the older generation of both China and Japan
have made arduous efforts in promoting the cause of Sino-Japanese
friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We bear the responsibility of carrying forward this cause and
nurturing more successors," Li added.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda noted that the five-point guidelines on Sino-Japanese
relations proposed by Premier Li Peng at a reception on Wednesday
summarized the historic experience in the last 25 years and
defined from a strategic view the direction for Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said it is important for Japan and China to steadily
increase cultural exchanges and contacts between young people of
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and Japan should make good use of their
advantages in increasing exchanges. He said the young people's
education should include correct historic views in order to
sustain Sino-Japanese friendship from generation to generation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- All the warring factions in
Afghanistan have agreed to a ceasefire "by accepting a peace
formula offered by the Organization of Islamic Conference," OIC
Special Envoy on Afghanistan Ibrahim Bakar said here today.
</P>
<P>
"All of them have accepted the OIC peace initiative," Bakar
told the press before his departure for Jiddah, a port city of
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Bakar, also OIC Assistant Secretary General, who flew in last
Sunday, held in-depth talks with representatives of both the
Afghan Islamic Taliban militia and the rival Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The cessation of hostilities will take place as soon as OIC
observers arrive in Afghanistan to monitor it, Bakar said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the observers will include contingents from
Malaysia, Bangladesh and Senegal, which have already agreed to
send their troops as OIC observers in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
And the OIC will also invite representatives of all Afghan
factions to Jiddah in December to sit at the table and find a
peaceful settlement without any outside interference, he said.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Jiddah, the OIC envoy said, the Afghan
representatives would discuss "formation of the representative
Government of all Afghan factions."
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the formation of a Shura Council for
making arrangements of general elections in Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked what made the Afghans accept a ceasefire now, Bakar
said that they all realized that they had no option because
fighting would bring more destruction.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Bakar met with Taliban envoy to Pakistan
Shabuddin Dilawar and representatives of Uzbek warlord Abdul Rasid
Dostum, former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and former
military chief Ahmad Masood, Hzeb-e-Wahadat and Jumbis-e-Milli,

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Renew Appeal for E. Timorese Leader's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will renew his appeal for the release of jailed
East Timorese activist Xanana Gusmao when Indonesian President
Soeharto visits the country next week, local media said today.
</P>
<P>
During a state visit to Indonesia in July, Mandela met Gusmao,
and on his return wrote to Soeharto, urging him to set free the
jailed separatist leader, and a reply is still awaited from the
Indonesian government, South African Press Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
At a media briefing today, South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo said he was hoping for a major breakthrough on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
He echoed Mandela's view that Gusmao would have an important
role to play in United Nations-sponsored efforts to resolve the
East Timorese question.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao's release would be a very important step to resolve the
conflict between the Indonesian government and Gusmao's Fretelin
Resistance Movement, as had been the position in South Africa
when Mandela was released from prison in 1990, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister repeated that South Africa was not
attempting to be a self-appointed mediator, but was merely
assisting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's efforts to find a
solution.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was occupied by
Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year as its 27th
province.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. does not recognize Indonesia's sovereignty over the
territory and still recognizes Portugal as its legitimate
administrator.
</P>
<P>
The world body is currently sponsoring talks between Portugal
and Indonesia in the hope of finding an internationally
acceptable solution to the question.
</P>
<P>
U.N.'s special envoy on East Timor Jashmeed Marker met Mandela
in August and briefed him on the ongoing efforts to secure East
Timor's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is scheduled to visit South Africa from November 20
to 22.

<HEADLINE> Levy Not to Attend Doha Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy is not to attend the fourth annual Middle East and
North Africa Economic Conference due to open in Doha on Sunday,
the Foreign Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said the Israeli delegation
to the Doha conference will be led by Industry and Trade Minister
Natan Sharansky and joined by other Israeli government trade
officials and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes that those countries boycotting the Doha
conference send their businessmen to Doha, he said. Most Arab
countries decided not to attend the gathering, blaming Israel for
the lack of progress in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy was earlier waiting for an informal invitation from his
Qatari counterpart and requesting a one-on-one meeting with him;
however, no reply has been received so far.
</P>
<P>
Levy's decision of not attending the Doha conference is a big
setback for the United States, which has been lobbying hard that
all Arab states and Israel should send their foreign ministers to
Doha.
</P>
<P>
Levy was evidently troubled by the boycott of most Arab
countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and especially by the
fact that those announcing their participation - Jordan, Kuwait,
Oman - are not sending their foreign ministers.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Aid Zimbabwe in Public Service Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will give more than
eight million Zimbabwe Dollars (640,000 U.S. Dollars) to Zimbabwe
this year in support of its second phase of public service reform
program, a Swedish embassy spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Counsellor at the embassy in Harare Jan Olsson said the money
which would be disbursed through the Swedish International
Development Agency would specifically support the performance
management component of the reform program.
</P>
<P>
Olsson said an additional amount of between 15 million
Zimbabwe Dollars (1.24 million U.S. Dollars) and 20 million
Zimbabwe Dollars (1.6 million U.S. Dollars) would be released as
soon as specific projects were identified under the program.
</P>
<P>
The program, expected to further reduce the size of the civil
service, would see the government sub-contracting some of its
non-core businesses such as laundry, catering and maintenance of
premises to the private sector to further reduce its expenditure.

<HEADLINE> France Judges Iraqi Decision to Expel Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- France judged as "unacceptable"
the decision made today by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
immediately expel Americans from the United Nations special
commission in charge of arms inspections in Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux recalled that
United Nations Security Council resolution 1137, adopted Wednesday
unanimously by council members, called on the Iraqi government to
"go back on immediately its decision of December 29" which
excluded Americans from the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said today in Vietnam, where he
is making a state visit, that Iraq made a mistake by refusing to
cooperate with the UNSCOM and that there is no way out in
confrontation and escalation of tension.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi authorities were wrong" by refusing to cooperate
with the UNSCOM, said Chirac at a press conference in Ho Chi-Minh
City.
</P>
<P>
France today also called on Iraq to resume cooperation with the
UNSCOM, which Paris said would allow Iraq to reintegrate into the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"It is not too late for the Iraqi authorities to go back on its
decision and announce clearly their will to cooperate once again
with the UNSCOM," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that a cancelation of the decision by Iraq to expel
Americans from the UNSCOM would allow the U.N. Security Council to
cancel its new sanctions and study the perspectives of disarmament
in Iraq as well as its reintegration into the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"Resolution 1137 is in our eyes a balanced text which is
proportioned to the reality of the facts in this case. It is
essential for the Security Council to show in this crisis that it
was united around one firm and clear text. We hope that this
signal without ambiguity will be understood by the Iraqis," said
the spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Alert for Leftist Rebels' Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Police
have been on high alert for any attacks by the rebel New People's
Army (NPA) after the government suspended peace talks Tuesday with
the NPA's political wing, a police spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Napoleon de los Santos, the National Police's
public information officer, said the suspension of peace talks
with the leftist National Democratic Front (NDF) signaled the
start of possible massive armed offensives by government forces
against the NPA.
</P>
<P>
De los Santos said that the country's police chief,
Director-General Recaredo Sarmiento, has issued a directive to all
police units nationwide to be alert and ready for any surprise
attacks by the NPA.
</P>
<P>
The order came after President Fidel Ramos this week repeated
his sharp criticism of the National Police for its failure to
prevent the NPA from staging surprise attacks on police
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the NPA raided two police stations, during
which one policeman was killed and two military officers were
abducted. Last week, five policemen and one civilian were killed
during an ambush by the NPA.
</P>
<P>
These attacks prompted the government to suspend on Tuesday its
scheduled peace talks with the NDF, a leftist alliance led by the
Communist Party of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The NDF was accused of trying to gain an advantage in the
forthcoming meeting by launching these assaults.
</P>
<P>
De los Santos said the military units stationed near the police
stations will swiftly help strengthen the local police in case
there are attacks by the NPA.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, established in the early 1970s, has fought the
government for more than two decades. Its military arm, the NPA,
has an estimated membership of less than 10,000.

<HEADLINE> France Categorically Denies Involvement in ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- France today "categorically"
denied that French secret agents were involved in the 1988
assassination of a representative of the African National Congress
(ANC) of South Africa in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"France denies categorically that the French services could be
implied in the assassination in 1988 of Madame Dulcie September,
representative of ANC in Paris," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The ANC asked Tuesday the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
which is in charge of investigating the crimes committed by the
former apartheid regime of South Africa, to investigate "in
details" the possible role played by French agents in the
assassination of Dulcie September on March 29, 1988.
</P>
<P>
A group of Dutch researchers who were involved in the
anti-Apartheid movement said Monday that secret agents of South
Africa's white apartheid regime assassinated Dulcie September
"with passive complicity of French secret services."
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are devoid of any ground. The French
services, and the French judicial police have, well to the
contrary, provided their active cooperation in the search for the
authors of this crime," said the spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Urban S. Africans Want Parliament to Stay in Cape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The majority of urban
South Africans want parliament to stay in Cape Town rather than
to be moved to Pretoria, a survey found.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey, conducted by the Institute for a
Democratic South Africa (Idasa), came only days before the ruling
African National Congress (ANC) is to discuss the possibility of
relocating the national legislature.
</P>
<P>
The policy-making National Executive Committee of the ANC will
receive recommendations this weekend from a three-person
committee set up to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
Idasa's survey, which polled 2,000 people in major
metropolitan areas, showed that 54 percent South Africans support
Cape Town as the site for parliament, while only 17 percent opt
for Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has three capital cities: Pretoria (executive),
Cape Town (legislative) and Bloemfontein (Judicial).
</P>
<P>
The survey also reported that among blacks polled 50 percent
wanted Cape Town and 20 percent Pretoria, while the corresponding
figures for whites are 65 percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even in Gauteng province, where Pretoria is located, 44
percent favored Cape Town compared with 26 percent who wanted a
move to Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Only in Bloemfontein was Cape Town not the majority choice --
they favored their home townein for the seat of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lots of time and money were wasted as government officials and
parliament members have to shuttle between the capitals.
</P>
<P>
But relocating the site of parliament is no easy job.
According to independent assessment, moving parliament from Cape
Town to Pretoria could cost 3.5 billion Rand or 745 million U.S.
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia "will continue
opposing any use of force against Iraq", Russian Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Gennady Tarasov said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at a news briefing that Russia has
repeatedly called on the Iraqi leaders to reconsider their
decision, not to confront the Security Council and to resume
normal relations with the special commission.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the Iraqi authorities were not prepared to do
so. This position was a disappointment to all Security Council
member nations," Tarasov noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday evening adopted
unanimously a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iraq, including
foreign travel restrictions on the Iraqi officials obstructing the
operation of the U.N. special commission on Iraq's disarmament,
set up by the council in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.N. Security Council resolution on new sanction
against Iraq "is aimed at having Baghdad resume unconditional
cooperation with the U.N. special commission", and Baghdad thus
has a chance to show a constructive approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said Russia will proceed on its line that the
Security Council should respond properly to positive changes in
Iraq's behavior.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputies from the Popular Rule opposition
parliamentary group have proposed that the Russian State Duma
adopt a statement "On the dangerous escalation of tension
regarding Iraq."
</P>
<P>
They said "the formal pretext" for aggravating the situation
was "actions by the Iraqi leadership aimed to defend national
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
However, such actions were interpreted as Iraq's refusal to
cooperate with the United Nations for control over weapons of
mass destruction, the draft said.
</P>
<P>
The draft statement has not so far been put on the Duma's
agenda.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Takes Measures to Cut Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
taken four major measures to reduce interest rates to cushion the
impact of the current currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
These measures include reducing reserve requirements against
deposits, depositing substitute liabilities of banks and providing
liquidity through the re-opening of the repurchase window.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also continue to implement financial reforms to
increase the efficiency of financial intermediation and encourage
competition among banks without sacrificing monetary and fiscal
stability.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos said the measures "need to be
balanced with the foreign exchange rate in order that the value of
the peso eventually stabilizes."
</P>
<P>
He said the sooner the peso will stabilize, the better for the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramos admitted that the currency crisis has made interest rates
volatile, but he reiterated that the Philippines' economic and
financial fundamentals are strong and sound.
</P>
<P>
The country's interest rates have fluctuated wildly since July
when they went up to as much as 30 percent. But they have now
fallen to 16 percent based on the benchmark 91-day treasury bill
rate and are continuing to fall.

WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
today that Iraq's decision to expel American weapons inspectors is
clearly unacceptable and a challenge to the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the statement after he held a meeting with his
national security team in the cabinet room after Iraq's
announcement of its decision.
</P>
<P>
He said the message delivered by a resolution unanimously
approved by the Security Council Wednesday was clear that Iraq
must comply with U.N. resolutions and permit weapons inspectors to
do their work.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to the safety of the world they continue their
work," he said. "I intend to pursue this matter in a very
determined way."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said Iraq's decision and Clinton's statement
heightened the possibility of a military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned
Iraq that it was "pushing this issue to the brink and there are
going to be some grave consequences."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry called Iraq's latest move
"totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
When asked if the U.S. had standing authority with the United
Nations to respond militarily, he said, "We have our
interpretation of the U.N. resolution, but I'm not going to share
that at this moment."

MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' total gold
production is expected to rise by a significant 10 percent to an
estimated 33,000 kilograms in 1998, a senior mineral official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin de Vera, chief of the Mineral Economics and Policy
Division of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, said the expected
upswing in gold production is due to the opening of new major gold
projects in various parts of the country next year.

De Vera said that with the conduct of major gold explorations
throughout the country, bright prospects await the gold industry
and the country is turning into one of the world's major gold
producers.
</P>
<P>
Gold production this year is projected to reach 30,400
kilograms, a slight increase over last year's total production of
29,900 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
According to de Vera, Philex Mines has emerged to be the

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel's Revenues Fall in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Revenues of Eurotunnel, the
Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator, fell to 132.2 million pounds
(224.7 million US dollars) in the third quarter of 1997 from 138.4
million pounds in the same period a year ago, the Financial Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly because of the impact of the big fire on a
freight shuttle wagon in the Channel tunnel last November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, revenues for the first nine months of this year fell
from 362.1 million pounds (615.6 million US dollars) to 301
million pounds (511.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the passenger shuttles carried a total of
726,395 cars, motorcycles and caravans in the third quarter,
compared with 757,434 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The number of lorries carried by the freight shuttles fell to
107,238, down from 153,536 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the performance of Eurostar was not bad as some 1.83
million passengers traveled on it in the third quarter, compared
with only 1.58 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Long distance rail freight services also improved, with cargo
tonnage lifted from 556,150 to 692,891.

Paralysis begins rapidly in one or two days and is permanent.
There is no treatment now. However, polio can be prevented
through immunization with oral polio vaccine. The World Health
Organization has plans to eradicate the disease throughout the

<HEADLINE> US Sends FBI Agents to Pakistan to Probe Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States has sent
a team of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents to Pakistan
to probe the killings of four American oil company employees, U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno said today.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to do everything we can to make sure that those
responsible for this tragedy are brought to justice and that we
work with Pakistani authorities in every way that is appropriate,"
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the important thing is that the FBI be available
to pursue any leads to make sure we understand exactly what
happened and what the motivation is," she said at her weekly
Justice Department news briefing.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman said the FBI team had been
dispatched to Pakistan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen in Karachi killed four American men and their Pakistani
driver Wednesday in an ambush attack.
</P>
<P>
The killings occurred after the U.S. State Department issued
warnings to Americans abroad following Monday's conviction of a
Pakistani, Mir Aimal Kasi, for murdering two Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) employees in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A jury in Fairfax, Virginia, found Kasi, 33, guilty of killing
two CIA workers and wounding three men outside CIA headquarters in
1993. The jury is considering whether to sentence Kasi to death.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department issued another warning to Americans
abroad Wednesday after the convictions of two men in the 1993
bombing of New York's World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, Americans in Karachi have been urged to stay
indoors since Wednesday's killings.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan Agree to Increase Exchanges Between Statesmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
and leaders of Japan's Diet (parliament) agreed today to further
promote exchanges between statesmen of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress and Japan's Diet have
reached great achievements in bilateral cooperation and exchanges
since formal contacts between them were established, Li said in
separate meetings with Japan's House of Representatives (lower
house) Speaker Soichiro Ito and House of Councillors (upper house)
President Juro Saito.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped that such cooperation and exchanges will be
continuously strengthened and expanded in the future.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Diet has played an important role in promoting the
Sino-Japanese friendship, Li said, adding that Many Japanese
lawmakers with foresight have made great contributions to the
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts of both sides, Li said, China and Japan
have seen remarkable progress in their relations since the two
countries normalized diplomatic ties 25 years ago. The two
countries should cherish the hard-earned relationship and make
efforts to carry a stable, good-neighborly Sino-Japanese relations
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Developing Sino-Japanese friendly relations conforms to the
world's trend of peace and development, Li said, adding that China
will uphold independent diplomacy with priority given to economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
China hopes Japan will follow the path of peaceful development
and make more contributions to world peace, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Saito said on the occasion that Japan and China have a long
history of exchanges, but with deplorable experiences. Japan must
face up to the history and strengthen Japan-China friendly
cooperative ties on the basis of repenting its history, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-China friendship is of importance to peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of visits by top leaders of the two countries are
conducive to the development of Japan-China friendly ties oriented
to the 21st century, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ito and Saito said the parliaments and parliamentary members of
both countries should strengthen exchanges and play a more active
role in promoting mutual trust and cooperation between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their cordial welcome to Li's visit and wished
Li's Japan tour a complete success.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> WFP Okeys $60m-Aid Plan to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
has passed a five-year plan valuing at 60 million U.S. Dollars to
Mozambique, a WFP official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Zejari, WFP's African regional director said that the
plan, passed last month, covers education, health, the
restoration of basic facilities, the security of food, along with
grain aid.
</P>
<P>
Zejari said, WFP's aid plan is aiming at strengthening the aid
for the country's development, considering that Mozambique has
just walked out of the emergency status of living on donated
food.
</P>
<P>
Of the 60 million Dollars aid, 11 million Dollars would be
spent on offering food for the 57,000 students at the country's
180 schools, and 12.3 million Dollars would be used to
rehabilitate 900 primary schools, repair or rehabilitate 2,700
flats for teachers, set up 240 health centers and build 600 flats
for medics.
</P>
<P>
Three million farmers are to enjoy primary health cares and
270,000 children are expected to go to school under the plan.
</P>
<P>
Zejari said that WFP put priority on food, and encourage
farmers to produce more grain.
</P>
<P>
WFP had, up to 1996, offered Mozambicans with 1.5 million tons
of food valuing at 570 million U.S. Dollars since the
organization started its operation in the country in 1975, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zejari arrived in Mozambique last Sunday for his week-long
visit.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Fights Back in Donation Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government,
troubled by a row over political donations in the past week, were
fighting back today by firing off a list of questions to the
opposition Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw wrote to Conservative leader William
Hague asking him how much foreign money his party had received to
fund its election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned past donations from Asil Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot
businessman who is a fugitive from British justice.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government has been accused by the local press and
the Conservative party of exempting Formula One motor racing from
a ban on tobacco sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
It later acknowledged to have received a donation of 1 million
pounds (1.7 million U.S. dollars) from Formula One boss Bernie
Ecclestone before the May 1 general election at which it was swept
to power. The party said it would return the money.
</P>
<P>
Straw asked Hague in his letter to say whether the
Conservatives would match Labor policy by agreeing to publish the
names of people who gave the party more than 5,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
"Do you agree that the Neill Committee should consider whether
the amounts of such donations should be published?" Straw asked.
</P>
<P>
He also asked what donations Ecclestone had made to the
Conservatives and when the opposition party would publish its
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised to reform the party
funding system and speed up separate legislation on banning
foreign donation and on making public the names of donors who
donate more than 5,000 pounds to political parties.
</P>
<P>
The reform is thought likely to hit hardest at the
Conservatives, who came under heavy Labor criticism when in
government for accepting large sums in secret from foreign
business interests.
</P>
<P>
The local press said today Blair's long honeymoon with the
British public has now ended because of the funding issue, making
it particularly vulnerable to criticism in the Formula One row.

<HEADLINE> Ticket Selling Services of UK Train Operators Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- There is much room left for
improvement in Britain's train operators' ticket selling services
as a great proportion of passengers are being given incorrect
information about fares and alternative services.
</P>
<P>
The message was given by the country's rail regulator John
Swift today in his first comprehensive survey of the reliability
of information provided by ticket offices and telephone inquiry
lines.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that one in 10 rail passengers was given the
wrong information, and that 33 percent were misinformed about
Sunday travel.
</P>
<P>
It also found that only one in five inquiries about advance
purchase tickets was correctly answered while one in five disabled
passengers was given incorrect information about their special
needs.
</P>
<P>
Swift ordered 25 train operators to produce plans for improving
the accuracy of their retailing by the end of January 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that he also intended to set targets for higher
performance and publish league tables. Those failing to achieve
the target will be fined.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Levy Hold Unexpected Political Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Amid increasing pressure
for national unity, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy took an
unexpected step today by holding a meeting with opposition Labor
leader Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
was on a visit to Britain. Levy and Barak denied discussing the
issue of forming a unity government at the meeting, saying they
addressed only political issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Barak said the unity
government was not on the agenda of their talks. He added that he
had not yet been approached by Netanyahu on the unity proposal.
</P>
<P>
Levy said they only discussed political issues and did not
address the possibility of cooperation or unification between his
Gesher party and the Barak-led Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Levy has not been on good terms with Netanyahu since last
year. Holding five seats in the Knesset (parliament), Levy's
Gesher party is able to bring down the Netanyahu government if it
opts to leaves the coalition with Likud.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Levy and Barak had indeed touched on the
issue of forming a national unity government in order to heal the
deepening internal division of the Israeli society and push
forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It remained to be seen if their meeting was a signal that Levy
would rebel against Netanyahu and collaborate with the Labor.
</P>
<P>
The left and right camps have escalated their war of words
recently upon the second anniversary of the assassination of
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is widely held partially responsible for
Rabin's murder, issued in his address to the Knesset memorial
ceremony Wednesday a call for realizing national reconciliation
with his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
The centralist Third Way party's leader and Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani was launching an initiative to establish
a national unity government by holding separate talks with
Netanyahu and Barak Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Arye Deri, leader of the third largest Shas party, also met
with Netanyahu on the unity government proposal. He said
Netanyahu agreed to meet Barak next week upon his return from
visit to Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu denied today that he intended to form a
unity government with the Labor party at this stage. Israel Radio
quoted him as telling reporters on his flight to London that he
was confident about the government stability and would rather
launch a national reconciliation drive than strive to form a unity
government.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials also cast doubt over the possibility of
forming a unity government with Netanyahu-led Likud party. Yossi
Beilin, a senior Labor lawmaker, said national unity is important
for the nation but Labor would not do so with Netanyahu, who he
described as "someone not fit to be premier."

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Independent Palestinian State in 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said today that he would
declare establishing an independent Palestinian state within in
two years.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statement during a joint news conference in
Gaza held with visiting Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy. The two had discussed the current situation of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The implementing of interim agreements is five years. Three
years have passed, and we are waiting for the next two years to
declare, at the end of the five-year period, our targets to
establish our independent state," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat briefed Axworthy on the stalemate in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Axworthy, currently on
a Middle East tour, had visited Egypt, Jordan and Israel before
coming to the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy called on the two sides to continue the Oslo peace
process by implementing the signed agreements. He reaffirmed
Canada's willingness to assist them in advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been opposed to the creation of an independent
Palestinian state, citing possible security threats that might be
posed by such a move.
</P>
<P>
The current hardline Likud government announced it would only
agree to allow the establishment of a Palestinian entity, in which
the Palestinians will only manage their daily life and will not
have an army. But the PNA has made clear that it would declare
independence at the end of the five-year interim period.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been bogged down by
Israel's continued expansion of settlements in disputed areas and
its refusal to carry out further troop redeployments in the West
Bank as stipulated under the Oslo accords.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Criticizes US Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) Political Department Farouk Kaddoumi
today criticized U.S. role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides, Kaddoumi urged the U.S. to make better efforts in
finding a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they (U.S.) might do better in the Cyprus problem, but
to the Palestinians, unfortunately, there is a big failure by the
U.S.."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current situation has shown that the U.S. is
unwilling or is unable to activate its role in Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We insist the U.N. should be involved in the Middle East
peace process, but the Israelis did not want the U.N. to play a
positive role," Kaddoumi added.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official underlined that both Cyprus and the
Palestinians have the similar problems of refugees and
partition. "We have to deal with them in a very sensible way and
be patient enough to solve such problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "Cyprus is a friendly country, it supports
our cause and the cause of peace, we are always keen to come to

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Last month was the busiest
October ever at the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), and
the second busiest month in the exchange's history, according to
the firm.
</P>
<P>
News from Iraq, volatility in equity markets and colder weather
in Europe combined to increase sharply traded volumes on all the
IPE's contracts.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of trade transacted on the market floor and on
the automated Energy Trading System used to trade Natural Gas
futures reached a total of 1,524,397 lots in October.
</P>
<P>
The volume is equivalent to about 1.4 billion barrels of oil
and 400 million therms of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The busiest day for the exchange as a whole was October 3 when
dramatic price swings saw volumes of trade soaring, particularly
for Brent Crude.
</P>
<P>
Almost 93,000 lots were traded that day on Brent Crude,
equivalent to 93 million barrels or about a third more than the
total world daily oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
The busiest day for Gas Oil futures was October 10 when more
than 25,000 lots were traded, equivalent to 2.5 million tons
(nearly 19 million barrels).
</P>
<P>
And Natural Gas futures also enjoyed high volumes, reaching a
maximum of 1795 lots (54 million therms) on October 28.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Aziz Says Iraq to Expel American Inspectors Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz said here today that American weapons
inspectors working with the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraq's chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons would be expelled immediately.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who has been at the U.N. headquarters since the beginning
of the week to explain his government's stance on the Iraq weapons
inspection crisis, made the statement after meeting with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"The time for their departure is today, the 13th of November,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraq deputy prime minister said that the UNSCOM
could continue its work in the country, but without Americans.
</P>
<P>
The statement made only one day after the U.N. Security Council
approved a resolution, condemning Iraq's order on October 29 to
expel the Americans in the U.N. arms inspection team in Baghdad.
Iraq has repeatedly alleged that the Americans are "spies" working
only for prolonging the U.N. sanctions against Iraq imposed after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Annan said that he had not expected the
immediate expulsion of the American inspectors although Iraq was
obviously rejecting the Security Council's resolution Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Reiterates Iraqi Decision to Expel Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz today reiterated his government's objection to
including the Americans in the U.N. Special Commission for arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Following his brief meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan this morning, Aziz said he informed Annan of the Iraqi
government's decision to expel the remaining Americans working
with the UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
scrapping Iraq's chemical, biological and missile stocks.
</P>
<P>
However, he told reporters, Iraq "is ready to continue
cooperation with the UNSCOM which could perform fully its duty
inside Iraq" with any other personnel the (UNSCOM) executive
chairman decides to send except the Americans.
</P>
<P>
"If the Executive Chairman decides to withdraw its personnel
from Baghdad and to hold the activities of UNSCOM, he will bear
the responsibilities of his decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not against the Americans for their nationality. The
Americans worked in Iraq for six and half years. But because of
the dominant role the Americans play in UNSCOM we requested the
Security Council to recompose the Special Commission so that it
becomes a real and genuine international organ, not an
American-led organ. That was our concern, that was our request, we
strongly believe that this is legitimate and in full conformity
with the U.N. business," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This organ should not be dominated by one nationality because
specially the American government has a special agenda against
Iraq and it is hostile against Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a
resolution requesting Iraq to rescind its decision of October 29
to ban all activities of the Americans in the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also decided that all U.N. member states prevent
the entry into or transit through their territories of all Iraqi
officials and members of the Iraqi armed forces who were
responsible for or participated in the instances of non-compliance
with UNSCOM activities.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends Aircraft Carrier to Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government
announced here this afternoon that it was planning to send its
aircraft carrier Invincible to the Mediterranean "as a
precautionary measure."
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson, who unveiled this
latest movement of the British aircraft carrier in a statement,
insisted that this should not be regarded as a decision to send
the British ship to the Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
"This should not be read as a decision to send HMS Invincible
to the Gulf; no such decision has been taken at this stage,"
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also pledged that Britain would take all
diplomatic measures to end the current crisis over Iraq's decision
to expel American members of a special UN commission on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, "In the meantime, we would not rule anything in or
out," Robertson added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the crisis between the United Nations and the Iraqi
government continued worsening when Iraq ordered early today all
American members of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM)
to leave the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement that
the London government is "determined that the UN special
commission should continue its work and we condemn Iraq's latest
act of obstruction."
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary also threatened to take "further
measures" if Iraq continued "to defy the will of the UN."

UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) would withdraw its staff in Baghdad
Friday, Richard Butler, chairman of the UNSCOM, announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Butler said he would continue to resist
Iraqi segregation of UNSCOM staff according to nationalities, and
with respect to the inspection, this illegal separation of
international staff could not be accepted.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNSCOM would start to withdraw its staff in Baghdad
Friday and leave a skeleton staff to sustain the facilities.
</P>
<P>
Butler said the goal was to keep open the possibility to
restart the inspection work as soon as possible when the
conditions were acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he had requested the Iraqi government to allow the
Americans to depart Friday on board of the UNSCOM aircraft with
the rest of the staff.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced this morning it had decided to expel American
arms inspectors working in the United Nations disarmament teams in

<HEADLINE> Secret Parts of Report on Rabin's Murder Publicized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government today
publicized classified parts of the investigation report on the
assassination of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, revealing
serious cracks in the security service operations.
</P>
<P>
The three classified parts, as attachments to the report
submitted by the Shamgar Committee for probing the Rabin murder,
revealed that former agent of the General Security Service (GSS)
Avishai Raviv played a role in Rabin's death on November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Raviv, a problematic rightist and close friend of Rabin's
assassin Yigal Amir, had been an informant on extremist rights
groups for GSS, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that Raviv was caught many times for illegal activities
of beating Arabs, damaging properties and inciting against Rabin
and his Labor government, and that Raviv's illegal activities were
encouraged by his GSS operators who promised legal immunity for
him.
</P>
<P>
The GSS discussed his role three months before Rabin was
murdered and concluded that his usefulness outweighted his
problematic behavior.
</P>
<P>
However, the real problem is he failed to inform the GSS
operators of Amir's repeated statements to kill Rabin.
</P>
<P>
The secret parts of the report also disclosed that the GSS had
passed on warnings of possible threats to Rabin's life, but Rabin
did not order a review of security measures for unknown
reasons. And the divisions for protecting VIPs were reportedly
confident that they could deal with all the dangers.
</P>
<P>
The Shamgar Committee, named after its head and former Supreme
Court President Meir Shamgar, cleared the cloud over GSS's
involvement in killing Rabin. However, GSS was held partially
responsible as it mishandled runaway agents like Raviv.
</P>
<P>
Some politicians quickly reacted to the new disclosures by
demanding Raviv and his GSS operators be brought to trials.
Communications Minister Limor Livnat said she did not rule out the
possibility to try GSS officials involved in employing Raviv.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Shaul Yahalon of the right-wing National Religious
Party said it was even possible to bring former GSS heads Yaakov
Perry and Karmi Gellon to trial for failing to stop Raviv from
inciting against political leaders and government.
</P>
<P>
But opposition Meretz's lawmaker Amnon Rubinstein opposed the
idea of prosecuting GSS officials, noting it is very difficult
for the GSS to penetrate the rightist groups except employing
problematic agents like Raviv.
</P>
<P>
The left-wingers have been fuming over the publication of the
secret sections, terming it as a rightist plot to shed its
responsibility for causing the murder of Rabin.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Reform its Army Recruitment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
planning to undertake a shake-up of the country's army recruitment
system in an effort to bring more people with modest social
origins into senior ranks.
</P>
<P>
For many years, a great majority of the country's senior armed
forces officers came from privately run "public schools" rather
than state schools, blocking the advancement of state school
students.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson promised in a speech
today that he wanted to ensure that advancement to the senior
ranks of the armed forces was based on merit rather than social
class.
</P>
<P>
"I am still concerned that, while four out of every five RAF
(royal air force) and navy officer recruits come from state
schools, only half of all army officer recruits come from the same
background," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined that the army officer corps should not be seen
as some `privileged elite' but instead as an extension of the
classless, meritocratic society we want to build in Britain," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In order to reform the recuitment system, Robertson said, "As
part of our broader recruitment drive, I can announce today that
we will be examining ways in which we can target state schools
more effectively and bring forward new and imaginative proposals
in this area."
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government, which won a landslide May election
victory, is conducting a Strategic Defence Review in a bid to set
the course of Britain's armed forces for the next century.

<HEADLINE> Link Between Cell Death and Tumor Growth Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- An intriguing link between
the natural process of programmed cell death and the propensity of
tumors to spread has been forged by Israels Weizman Institute
scientists, according to a report in the Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Adi Kimchi of the institutes molecular genetics
department demonstrated that a cell-suicide gene called DAP-kinase
can prevent metastasis - the spread of cancer cells through the
body from its original source.
</P>
<P>
This finding suggests that a loss or malfunction of these
genes allows metastasis to develop.
</P>
<P>
Working on mice, she and her colleagues found that lung cancer
clones, isolated from the rodents and characterized by highly
aggressive metastatic behavior, did not produce the DAP-kinase -
a recently isolated enzyme thought to be involved in apoptosis
(programmed cell death).
</P>
<P>
Restoring the enzyme in highly metastatic cancer cells
suppressed their ability to form metastases and delayed tumor
growth. "In our experiment, we have shown that introducing a
good copy of the DAP-kinase gene into metastatic cells
restores the ability of these cells to kill themselves," Kimchi
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important, however, to remember that this gene is only
one of many factors involve in the development of metastasis, so
that much research still needs to be conducted before we can find
molecular ways to block this life-threatening process," Kimchi
added.

<P>
PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- France today "categorically"
denied that French secret agents were involved in the 1988
assassination of a representative of the African National Congress
(ANC) of South Africa in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"France denies categorically that the French services could be
implied in the assassination in 1988 of Madame Dulcie September,
representative of ANC in Paris," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The ANC asked Tuesday the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
which is in charge of investigating the crimes committed by the
former apartheid regime of South Africa, to investigate "in
details" the possible role played by French agents in the
assassination of Dulcie September on March 29, 1988.
</P>
<P>
A group of Dutch researchers who were involved in the
anti-Apartheid movement said Monday that secret agents of South
Africa's white apartheid regime assassinated Dulcie September
"with passive complicity of French secret services."
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are devoid of any ground. The French
services, and the French judicial police have, well to the
contrary, provided their active cooperation in the search for the
authors of this crime," said the spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- West African countries have
adopted a sub-regional program on malaria prevention, management
and control, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement on Wednesday by the Federal
Ministry of Health of Nigeria as saying that the program was
adopted at the 26th ordinary meeting of the Assembly of Health
Ministers that just concluded in Banjul, Gambia.

</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that the program will be funded through
contributions by member states and in collaboration with the
World Health Organization and (WHO) other agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO statistics, malaria is now the number one
killing disease in Africa, with an annual toll of 2.5 million,
most of which are children under five.

JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African

than two million U.S. Dollars to eradicate cattle lung cancer
from the 14-member grouping.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, SADC Executive-secretary

He said the only solutions are a mass vaccination campaign in
the affected countries, limited killing with compensation to
owners and control of cross-border movement of cattle.
</P>
<P>
The SADC chief executive called on donor countries to provide
the money.
</P>
<P>
He said cattle lung cancer threatens about 25 million head of
cattle in some parts of Angola, Namibia, Zambia and almost the
whole of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Botswana last year killed about 300,000 heads of cattle to
prevent lung cancer from spreading to other parts of the country

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Resists Pressure to Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean army, which
seized power in the May 25 coup, will not disarm when it hands
over power to the ousted civilian government, a senior official
reaffirmed today.
</P>
<P>
"The Sierra Leonean army will not agree to be disarmed," said
Chief of Staff Col. Gabriel Mani, quoted by a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
This is a series of the opposition the junta has expressed to
the disarmament of the army since the end of a peace talk near
the capital Freetown on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A team of the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) led by
its Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu met the junta Major
Johnny Koroma in the past two days to work out modalities for the
implementation of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan, signed last month in Conakry, Guinea,
the junta is to hand over in April next year, and combatants
which "mean all people with guns" will be disarmed and
demobilized in December under the supervision of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone currently, people with guns include the
national army, the ex-rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) now
allied to the junta, hunter militias loyal to ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, staff of private securities firms, fighters
from Liberia's disbanded factions and ECOMOG troops, thousands of
which were deployed after the coup.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks, Malu said the two parties had agreed
on major issues including disarmament.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman of the junta's defense ministry slashed Malu's
announcement, claiming that the ECOMOG chief was providing
misinformation and making propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Major John Milton, assistant director of information of the
ministry said the two parties had not categorily decided which
combatants should be disarmed and insisted that disarmament
should not cover the Sierra Leonean army.
</P>
<P>
A junta minister was also quoted as saying that "nobody has
the right to disarm the national army as it is set up by the
constitution".
</P>
<P>
In Conakry, where Kabbah has been living since the coup, the
ousted president insisted on the same view as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"All of the regular army must be disarmed, it's a question of
discipline," Kabbah said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry for Children's Affairs said it is to
start a nationwide identification of all armed children next
Monday to make preparation for demobilization.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's President
Ketumile Masire has called on the departments concerned to speed
up the development of transportation and telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association today quoted Masire as
reporting that a 1,000 million Pula (270 million U.S. Dollars)
roads program would result in all but 1751 km of Botswana's 7,000
km network being paved.
</P>
<P>
He said airports in the capital of Gaborone and other major
cities would be upgraded and airfields would be built in some
major villages, Masire told Botswana parliament.
</P>
<P>
Cellular telephone networks had been opened to the private
sector, but fixed-line services would remain a monopoly of the
Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC) with service
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"A BTC performance contract to be monitored by the Botswana
Telecommunications Authority (BTA), will stipulate, among others,
agreed performance standards in terms of efficiency, reliability
and accessibility of services," Masire said.
</P>
<P>
A revised Botswanan industrial development policy would be
tabled during the current parliamentary session to reorientate
the manufacturing sector to tackle the development of the export
industry.
</P>
<P>
Masire urged those officials renegotiating the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) agreement to speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
The renegotiation was intended to balance the scales to allow
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland to further industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
Referring to agriculture, Masire said drought conditions must
not discourage Botswana from promoting diversified agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Agriculture is in the process of engaging
consultants to produce a long term comprehensive national master
plan for agricultural development," he said.
</P>
<P>
On education, Masire said that vocational education and
training would continue to be given priority in the governemnt's
work, with a budget of 200 Pulu (154 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Masire also expressed increasing concern over the HIV/AIDs
endemic in Botswana, with the age group 20 to 29 years showing a
prevalence of 41 percent.

NICOSIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' trade deficit in the
first six months of this year reached 633 million pounds (nearly
1.3 billion U.S. dollars), up 5.2 percent from the same period of
last year, a trade report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report issued by the Cypriot Department of

of 1997 fell by 9.5 percent to 305.6 million Cyprus pounds (around
611.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total imports reached 938.6 million pounds (nearly 1.9
billion dollars) in this period, a decrease of 700,000 pounds (1.4
million dollars) from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that 47 percent of the island's imports
came from European Union (EU) countries, down 1.5 percent compared
with the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus's exports to the EU countries stood at 55.3 million
pounds (around 110.6 million dollars) in the first six months of
1997, accounting for 51.9 percent of the island's exports in

<HEADLINE> Canada's Exports Forecast to Grow 5 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian exports will increase
5 percent in 1998, and grow at an average rate of 7 percent
annually until 2002, the country's Export Development Corporation
(EDC) predicted here today.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian exporters continue to expand their sales abroad, but
they are facing substantial competition in world markets," said
Jim Olts, EDC chief economist.
</P>
<P>
Canada's export growth will be strong in the
telecommunications, aerospace and textile industries, according to
EDC, a government corporation designed to promote exports through
financing.
</P>
<P>
Exports account for 40 percent of Canada's output and are a key
factor driving economic growth, job creation and prosperity. One
in every three Canadian jobs is tied to exports.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas markets have become more competitive for Canadian
exporters due, in part, to an appreciation of our dollar against
all major currencies, with the exception of the U.S. dollar and
British pound," Olts said.
</P>
<P>
"This currency appreciation has placed Canadian exporters at a
price disadvantage when they come head to head against Japanese
and key European competitors," Olts noted.
</P>
<P>
EDC expects Canada's exports to the U.S., its largest trading
partner, to grow 5.6 percent in 1998, down from 8 percent recorded
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports to Western Europe are expected to
increase 1.7 percent in 1998 after a decline of 4 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Indonesia to Sign Aviation, Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and
Indonesia are set to boost economic ties with the signing of two
agreements on aviation and trade, South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two accords will be signed when Indonesian President
Soeharto arrives in Cape Town next week for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
An air services agreement would facilitate direct air links
between the two countries, while a trade agreement would provide
for a joint economic commission, Foreign Ministry officials said
in a briefing.
</P>
<P>
From almost a zero base in the last five years, two-way trade
between the two countries has grown to 1.21 billion Rand (252
million U.S. dollars) with the balance in South Africa's favor.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations between the two countries, however, is
still being hampered by the absence of direct transport links and
a lack of formal agreements to facilitate economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
So far only one agreement on the avoidance of double taxation
has been signed.
</P>
<P>
While media interest is bound to focus on Mandela's bid to
have jailed East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao released, South
African government officials have stressed that bilateral and
multilateral issues will dominate the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said he hoped to receive a
briefing from his Indonesian counterpart, Ali Alatas, on regional
peace efforts in Cambodia and the recent currency damage suffered
by countries in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, as the next chair of the Non-Aligned Movement,
would discuss multilateral issues with Indonesia, a founding
member of the body who held its chair from 1992 till 1996.
</P>
<P>
On whether Indonesia was interested in buying arms from South
Africa, Nzo said he was not aware of any proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
However, he echoed Mandela's statement in Jakarta that under
certain circumstances South Africa could supply arms to Indonesia
for defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
Nzo defended South Africa's relations with Indonesia, saying
his country would have more influence on the question of East
Timor through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was annexed by
Indonesia in 1976.
</P>
<P>
But the United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's
sovereignty over the territory and still recognizes Portugal as
its legitimate administrator.
</P>
<P>
It is currently sponsoring talks between Portugal and
Indonesia in the hope of finding an internationally acceptable
solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
After his return from a state visit to Jakarta, Mandela wrote
to Soeharto calling for Gusmao's release, but received no reply.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to make the appeal personally when he meets
Soeharto, who is scheduled to visit South Africa from November 20
to 22.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Supports Gazprom's Deal With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia will side with Gazprom
if that gas giant-monopoly comes under attack by its participation
in international development of the Southern Pars field on the
Gulf shelf near the Iranian coast, Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov announced today.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov, also the energy minister, told journalists that it
does not matter whether Gazprom is criticized by the State
Department or Congress which has recently passed a D'Amato Act
calling for economic sanctions against companies' cooperation with
the oil and energy industries of Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to Nemtsov, the Southern Pars deal "is very lucrative
for both Gazprom and Russia."
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Iranian Oil Minister Namdar Zangene reached
an understanding at their talks in Moscow Thursday that much of
the gas recovery equipment for the field would be made in Russian
factories in the Volga area.
</P>
<P>
The equipment will be brought to Iran along the safe route of
the Volga and across the Caspian Sea, Nemtsov said.

<HEADLINE> No S. African Funding for Sri Lankan Rebels: Nzo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo said today that there was no evidence of
South African funding for the separatist Tamil guerrillas in Sri
Lanka, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela promised Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaika Kumaratunga last month that he would
personally look into whether the Tamil rebels were receiving
funding from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters at the end of the Commonwealth heads of
government meeting in Edingburg, Britain at the end of last month
that Nzo had already asked a Tamil parliament member to
investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said today that there was no evidence, as yet, that the
separatist guerrillas were receiving financial support from South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga had been informed of South Africa's position
during her bilateral talks with Mandela in Edingburg, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our preference would be for the Tamil Tigers and the
government of that county to meet and really sort this thing
out," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been fighting
for 14 years for a separate homeland for the minority Tamils in
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed
in the war, but the rebels claim that the toll is even higher.

<HEADLINE> US Weekly Jobless Benefits Decline Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- First-time claims for
jobless benefits in this country fell by 6,000 last week, the
Labor Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the department report, it was the 10th straight
week that claims totaled less than 320,000, a level that analysts
say is a sign of continuing payroll growth.
</P>
<P>
The department said that new applications for unemployment
insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 310,000, down from a
revised figure of 316,000 a week earlier. The prior week's total
initially was estimated to be 315,000.
</P>
<P>
The jobless claims level was the lowest since 299,000 during
the week ended October 25.
</P>
<P>
It also was the longest string of claims below 320,000 since a
26-week stretch ended in February 1989.
</P>
<P>
During the week ended November 1, 33 states and territories
nation-wide reported increases, 19 had declines and one was
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
States with the largest gains were Ohio, 3,546; California,
2,512; North Carolina, 1,924; Pennsylvania, 1,460, and Michigan,
1,363. Meanwhile, the biggest decreases were in Nevada, 756;
Oklahoma, 700; Florida, 667; Illinois, 616, and Idaho, 573.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Stresses United Stand with OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo said today his country was careful not to sow
division in Africa on issues that were capable of being decided
on by consensus in the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Africa's united stand had played a major role in boosting
international solidarity against apartheid, Nzo told reporters in
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said it would be good if Africa went to the UN as a united
body. He was referring to South Africa's position on reforming
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa agreed with the OAU decision that Africa
should be given two permanent seats and three non-permanent seats
on the Security Council, it had reservations about whether the
two permanent seats should rotate.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that South Africa was not lobbying for permanent
seat and that it preferred the decision to be taken by the OAU.
</P>
<P>
"If South Africa is offered the opportunity, we'll gladly
accept it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Workers Go on Strike for Payment Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese workers in public and
private sectors across the country went on strike today in protest
of the government and employers' delay in agreeing to their demand
for payment increases.
</P>
<P>
Ghanim Zoghbi, head of the General Labor Confederation (GLC),
told reporters that today's strike is successful and another
two-day strike will be followed on November 25 and 26 if no
progress can be achieved in next week's negotiations.
</P>
<P>
GLC, with a membership of 350,000 workers, or 20 percent of the
country's entire labor force, called for today's strike after its
negotiations with the government and the associations of bankers,
industrialists and merchants over the payment demand failed.
</P>
<P>
The GLC's demands include adjustment of salaries, increasing
the minimum monthly wage from 200 U.S. dollars to 300 dollars and
endorsing salary scales for the public sector.
</P>
<P>
GLC sources said about 60 to 75 percent of big factories and 50
percent of small factories across the country were shut today due
to the stoppage.
</P>
<P>
Private schools and universities also joined the strike.
Electrical and civil aviation departments, ports and oil companies
were closed for different hours.
</P>
<P>
However, Zoghbi ruled out any link between the strike and
politics, saying no political factor was involved in the action.

<HEADLINE> Plane with Sensors to Detect Landmines in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A European plane with built-in
sensors will be used to detect landmines in Angola from May next
year, the Angola News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Detecting landmines by the aerial means in Angola, the first
of its kind ever in the world, was originated from a company in
Luxemburg and has received support from the European Commission,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The plane will be equipped with six sensors, with four of them
below the fuselage and the other two on the back door of the
plane. The sensors will send data they gather to a giant data
tape system which will store the data.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the program, the plane will fly over
central Angola, central coast, northern Angola and Luanda
environs to detect landmines in the four areas. By low-altitude
flying at about 400 meters over land, the plane can detect
landmines with a diameter of 15 cm and within 50 cm deep in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
However, this technology cannot apply to rain seasons and the
program has to start from May next year when dry season falls.
The cost of the program is very high and will be shared by the
European Commission and the member states of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Angola has more than 10 million landmines buried underground
and it will take about 50 years to eradicate these mines if
conventional means for demining are used. The new technology will
speed up the pace of clearing landmines in Angola.

<HEADLINE> Moi Stands for Balanced, Constructive Journalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today called for balanced, fair and constructive journalism
in order to promote political, economic and moral development in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an opening dinner here tonight organized by a
two-day media forum, Moi noted that information must be used "to
build and not to destroy".
</P>
<P>
He urged participants at the forum to exchange ideas "on how
best to use information for the benefit of all mankind."
</P>
<P>
President Moi said that "we have become accustomed to seeing
negative images of ourselves on world television screens", adding
that "I have often wondered whether there is no good news coming
out of Africa."
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, he said, Kenya has made a lot of
efforts to alleviate the economic situation of the disadvantaged
people affected most adversely by the Structural Adjustment
Programs.
</P>
<P>
This is one area in which the media could have participated to
publicize the efforts made by Kenya, he said, urging the media to
make contributions to the development efforts made by African
countries and to the campaign for debt relief for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president said, there is a need for balanced
reporting to ensure that efforts by developing nations "to change
for the better are not frustrated".
</P>
<P>
In his view, a responsible press has an active and positive
role to play in the moral development of society.
</P>
<P>
In order to foster peace in society, Moi said that the media
must be "truthful, impartial and fair in their exercise of press
freedom".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the forthcoming General Election in Kenya, the
president urged the local and foreign press to be fair to all
parties so that the world could get a balanced view of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The topics to be discussed at the forum include "the media's
role in a changing African society" and "news tradition and
transitions" which have already been discussed in Australia,
London, Hong Kong and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi forum sponsored by an international foundation of
the Freedom Forum is the fifth in a series of global media forums
and the final forum will be held in New York next month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Views Relations with Mexico Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States believes
that its relationship with Mexico is vital to its long-term
prosperity and security, a senior U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo's
state visit to the U.S., Mack Mclarty, President Bill Clinton's
special envoy to the Americas stressed the importance of
U.S.-Mexican relations.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo will meet with President Clinton for the second time in
little more than six months. It's the third meeting the two
presidents have had since the state visit of President Zedillo
here in October of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I think that shows the importance of the relationship and the
continued engagement, as well," said Mclarty.
</P>
<P>
"The meetings, I think, will portray and reflect that, quite
simply, the U.S. relationship with Mexico is vital to the
long-term prosperity and security of our people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the U.S. shared an 1,800-mile border, and about 250
million legal crossings by citizens of both countries annually.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has surpassed Japan as the second-largest market for the
U.S. exports, the third-largest trading partner of the U.S., just
behind Canada, supporting 800,000 U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Mexico continues to be one of the U.S.'s
leading suppliers of foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
"We are jointly faced with the threats of narcotics
trafficking, the complicated issues of legal immigration, the
important issue of environmental degradation, and a host of other
issues which we are working cooperatively to address," Mclarty
said.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy also noted that Mexico in many ways is "the
prism which the people of our country traditionally view the rest
of Latin America, both in terms of opportunities to be seized and
challenges to be overcome."
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship with Mexico affect our relations with others
in the hemisphere in the minds of our public," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"So we must continue to nurture our relations in a thoughtful
and a constructive manner as one of the highest priorities in this
administration in order to ensure sustained support for our
opening to the hemisphere and their opening to us," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo, who arrived here today, will have a private dinner
with Clinton in the White House, and there will be an Oval Office
meeting Friday, followed by a larger meeting.
</P>
<P>
They will also sign the firearms convention at the headquarters
of the Organization of American States (OAS).

<HEADLINE> Urgent Action Needed To Cut CO2 Emissions: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) - Climate Change will critically
undermine efforts for sustainable development in the World,
according to a Greenpeace report published today.
</P>
<P>
It will add to existing problems of desertification, water
scarcity and food production, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Without any reductions of CO2 emissions, temperatures are
projected to rise by up to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 over many
inland areas and by over half of this over the many Mediterranean
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, annual rainfall is projected to decline
by 10 to 40 percent over much of Africa and south-eastern Spain,
with smaller - but potentially significant - changes elsewhere,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Climate Change and the Meditertanean
Region", said that rising CO2 emissions will also introduce new
threats to human health, ecosystems and national economies in the
basin.
</P>
<P>
As the world warms, global sea levels will rise as oceans
expand and glaciers melt. Around much of the Mediterranean, sea
levels could rise by close to 1 meter by 2100.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, some low-lying coastal areas would be lost
through flooding or erosion, while rivers and coastal aquifers
would become more salty, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected areas will be the Nile Delta in Egypt,
Venice in Italy and Thessaloniki in Greece where sea levels could
rise by at least one-and-a-half times as much as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out while industrial nations like the US are
refusing to radically cut CO2 emissions and risking an
international fiasco at the Climate conference in Kyoto next
month," said Lyn Goldsworthy, head of the Greenpeace International
climate campaign.
</P>
<P>
"A failure to agree on legally binding CO2 reductions in Kyoto
will seriously endanger the future of the peoples in the
Mediterranean region," he added.

<HEADLINE> AL Respects Members' Decision on Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said here today AL respects the
decision of a handful of Arab states to attend the Middle East and
North African Economic Conference slated for Sunday in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of any Arab country regarding attending Doha
conference is a sovereign one in which the Arab League cannot
interfere," the AL chief told a delegation of Arab economic
journalists at the Cairo-based AL headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League does not impose any opinion on any Arab state
in this respect," he said, adding that "the league respects the
view of any Arab country on whether to attend or not."
</P>
<P>
So far, 17 Arab countries out of the 22-member Arab League
decided to boycott the conference. Only Jordan, Kuwait, Oman,
Yemen and Tunisia preferred to show up.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Abdul-Meguid announced that the league will
boycott the three-day conference because the Middle East peace
process was facing difficulties under Israel's "provocative"
hardline policy against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have been split over whether to attend the
Doha conference at a time when the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
remained deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The annual MENA conference, which has been held in Morocco,
Jordan and Egypt, was initiated in 1991 with the aim to integrate
Israel into the regional economy of Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
approved the foreign aid bill in the fiscal year of 1998, but gave
President Bill Clinton none of the 900 million U.S. dollars he
proposed for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The House had approved the measure shortly after midnight by
333-76.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the U.N. cut was "utterly bone-headed" at
a time when the United Nations was trying to rally world support
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
By day's end, the lawmakers hoped to head home to tout the
year's accomplishments, chiefly, the budget-balancing and
tax-cutting laws of the first session of the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
Still pending was final agreement on a third measure providing
30 billion U.S. dollars for the departments of State, Commerce and
Justice for the new year.
</P>
<P>
These were the last of the 13 bills to fund the government for
fiscal 1998, which began Oct. 1. Congress has passed several
short-term spending measures to keep federal agencies with
unfinished budgets operating in the interim.
</P>
<P>
Republicans also were ready to block Clinton's call for 3.5
billion U.S. dollars for the International Monetary Fund's effort
to help ailing Southeast Asian currencies, plus his proposal for
more than 900 million U.S. dollars to pay overdue dues owed to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"This is a particularly ill timed move by Congress at a moment
when we are attempting to work with the United Nations to build an
international support for an appropriate response to provocations
by (Iraqi President)Saddam Hussein," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"It is utterly bone headed for Congress to fail to meet the
commitments that the United States has at the U.N. in terms of our
arrears," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who met Wednesday
evening with Gingrich, believed compromise with Republicans was
still possible to make available some of the U.N. and IMF money.
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers from both parties said they believed Clinton
would sign the foreign aid bill.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Seek U.N. Action against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday asked the U.N. Security Council to take action against
Iraq in response to its decision to expel American inspectors in
the U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador (Bill) Richardson will be seeking further action
in the Security Council today," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters. "That action will have a simple purpose --
to demonstrate to Saddam Hussein that his attempt to divide the
world has failed."
</P>
<P>
Rubin warned Iraq that there is only one way out: "To comply
with the United Nations, to let the inspectors do their work."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the next step the United States would take
to deal with Iraq, Rubin said: "As far as our next steps are
concerned all I can say is 'stay united'."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States has not ruled out any options to
make Iraq back down on its Oct. 29 decision to bar Americans
from taking part in U.N. weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Civil Rights Nomination in Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled
Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday rejected President Bill
Clinton's choice of Bill Lann Lee for the assistant U.S. attorney
for civil rights and sent the nomination back to the White House
without taking a vote.
</P>
<P>
Democratic senators immediately urged the president to send the
civil rights lawyer's name to the Senate again next year or to use
his authority to give Lee an interim appointment after Congress
adjourns this week.
</P>
<P>
"Our options are to see what we can do to try to move this to
the Senate floor," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
"We've allies and supporters of the nomination on the Hill, who
are looking into that."
</P>
<P>
Lee, 48, a California civil rights lawyer, won praise from both
parties at his confirmation hearing last month, but objections
were raised by conservative Republicans to his advocacy of
affirmative action to correct racial and sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Democrats last week blocked a committee vote to give Lee more
time to answer the charges and unsuccessfully sought a new
hearing.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, Mr Lee does not believe in equal opportunity
for all Americans but in equal results for groups," committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
If approved, Lee would be the administration's highest ranking
Asian American.
</P>
<P>
It was unlikely the full Senate would have debated and voted on
Lee's nomination before next year as Congress is expected to end
its work for the year this week.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson called the decision to
prevent the Lee nomination from going to the full Senate, "an
extremely polarizing, hostile act."

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels Sign Rules on Truce Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today signed an
agreement on guidelines and ground rules for implementing a truce
accord they forged earlier.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at the end of the eighth round
low-level peace talks between the two sides in Marawi City, the
southern province of Lanao de Sur.
</P>
<P>
The agreement specifically defined as prohibited hostile acts
kidnappings, attacks, bombings, robberies, raids, ambuscades and
other criminal atrocities.
</P>
<P>
It also laid down ground rules on the movement of the military
and the MILF forces, the conduct of inquiry by the Coordinating
Committees on Cessation of Hostilities, disposition of ceasefire
violations and security of both parties' peace panel members.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos described in a statement the signing of
the ground rules as a "significant milestone in the peace process"
and congratulated both panels for their efforts in coming out with
the rules.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, their complimentary efforts are clear manifestation
that we are one nation and one people who can work together toward
the attainment of a lasting peace and continuing economic
development in Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Orlando Soriano, chairman of the government negotiating panel,
said these ground rules will serve as instruments toward a more
profound partnership between the government and the MILF in the
attainment of a just and lasting peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their exploratory peace talks
in January this year and made a breakthrough in July by signing
the ceasefire agreement, but they have since failed to agree on
ground rules for carrying out the agreement.

<HEADLINE> German Central Banker Talks Seriously About Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president
Hans Tietmeyer has warned European Union states to get ready for
a big economic challenge posed by the introduction of a single
European currency and called for strict selection of its member
states next year, said German press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to economic reporters in Frankfurt Thursday evening,
Tietmeyer warned that the single currency Euro would not solve the
current structural problems of EU states, but would rather
intensify competition within the bloc.
</P>
<P>
With the start of the Euro in early 1999, there would no longer
be the variable exchange rate system which could be used to
balance out gaps in economic efficiency among the various European
regions, Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing system, weaker economies within the EU could
still choose to lower their currencies' exchange rate occasionally
so as to fence off foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
"It could be a bitter awakening when people realize that the
exchange rate system is no longer there," Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, individual countries would also be forced to achieve
a higher degree of flexibility on the job market in order to adapt
to the Euro, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that each country must think about whether it was
flexible enough to handle the single currency, Tietmeyer concluded
that what was decisive was the proper selection of Euro members.
</P>
<P>
The powerful German central banker on Thursday also expressed
worry about the current dispute over the leadership of the
European central bank, which came after the French government
announced earlier this month that it wanted the governor of the
Bank of France, Claude Trichet, to lead the bank.
</P>
<P>
Many, including Tietmeyer, had expected the head of the
European Monetary Institute, Wim Duisenberg, to take the post.
</P>
<P>
The premature personnel discussion had gone in the wrong
direction, Tietmeyer said, adding that the future European central
bank chief should take care of the interests of the whole area
covered by the Euro, not only that of his origin country.
</P>
<P>
He also made clear that he did not consider himself to be a
candidate to the job and also did not support any other German
candidates for it.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Up, Natural Gas Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices have been on
the rise in the New York market due to fears about shorter supply
while natural gas is falling on big stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
December crude oil rose 21 U.S. cents or 1 percent to 20.70
U.S. dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest weekly supply bulletin from the American Petroleum
Institute issued after markets closed Wednesday showed that
inventories of crude oil in the United States fell 2.29 million
barrels to 310.04 million barrels, twice the predicted drop.
</P>
<P>
Another factor to move the market up was believed to be the
tension around Iraq which decided on October 29 to expel the
Americans in the U.N. arms inspection teams in Iraq. Following a
U.N. resolution Wednesday to bar Iraqi officials and members of
Iraqi armed forces from traveling abroad, Iraq started to
implement its decision.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler decided to withdraw
most of arms inspectors from Iraq Friday and there are reports
about U.S. warships moving to the Persian Gulf. Fears about the
deterioration of the situation have induced speculation on shorter
oil supply.
</P>
<P>
However, oil prices are still below last year's level and
dealers say they are not likely to surge unless Iraq's oil exports
are stopped.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas showed its largest downturn in two weeks with
December delivery falling 22.6 cents or 6.5 percent to 3.251
dollars per every million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The American Gas Association said after trading Wednesday that
gas in storage rose 5 billion cubic feet or two-tenths of 1
percent to 2.814 trillion cubic feet during the weed ended last
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Wire Theft at New Airport in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A large quantity of
electrical wire has been stolen at Hong Kong's new airport, but
the theft won't delay the opening of the world-known project next
April, the local airport authority said today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release published here this evening, the Airport
Authority of Hong Kong confirmed that there had been thefts of
rolls of electrical wire awaiting installation and from cable
ducts at the passenger terminal building at the new airport being
built at Chek Pal Kok.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 meters of copper wire were stolen, sources close to
the airport disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The airport authority did not give any details of the theft,
but said that replacement wire is being flown to Hong Kong from
abroad and "the contractor has recalled resources and teams of
electricians are currently working extended hours to install new
wire."
</P>
<P>
Although installation work will be delayed by three to four
weeks, the airport will open as scheduled in April, the authority
said.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will enable Hong Kong to shut its inner-city
Kai
Tak airport. The new airport project includes leveling an island,
reclaiming huge tracts of sea, erecting one of the world's longest
road-and-rail bridges and drilling a third tunnel under Hong
Kong's harbor.
</P>
<P>
The police are cooperating closely with the Airport Authority
and contractors' security forces to prevent further damage and to
find those responsible for the theft, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Shares Finish The Week 1.5 Percent Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks finished
higher today for a second straight day, buoyed by the steady
easing of the interest rates and overnight gains on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 236.55 points, or 2.43
percent to close at 9,720.78 today, after edging up 1.17 percent
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Market turnover hit 11,407 million HK dollars (1,462 million
U.S. dollars), slightly down from Thursday's 11,575 million HK
dollars (1,484 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But, combining the week's five trading sessions together, the
local bourse still lost 1.5 percent with four trading sessions
ending below the 10,000-point mark.
</P>
<P>
After the previous week's loss of 4.9 percent, the market
opened weakly Monday with the key index closing 111.66 points
lower.
</P>
<P>
The market edged up a minor 11.29 points to close at 10,004.13
on Tuesday with selective bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday persistent interest rates worries sent the Hang
Seng Index plunging 396.22 points or 3.96 percent to finish at
9,607.91.
</P>
<P>
But the slump was partly erased on Thursday and Friday with the
market rebounding at the easing of Hong Kong Interbank Offered
Rate (HIBOR).
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Wednesday that it is
easing access to the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), in an
effort to bring down the interbank rates. LAF is a supplementary
source of Hong Kong dollars to which the HKMA had tightened
control to deny speculators ammunition to attack the Hong Kong
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate
(HIBOR) fell but still remain high at 9-11 percent, compared with
a range of 13-15 percent in mid-week.
</P>
<P>
A steadily stable easing of interbank interest rates is really
helping, said local brokers, who expected the market to improve
modestly next week with cautious trading.
</P>
<P>
But they ruled out a sharp rise in the wake of weeks of bearish
sentiment and continued weakness across Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong shares have shed over half of the market value,
compared with the high level in August when the Hang Seng Index
staying above the 16,000-point mark, since the Hong Kong dollar
became a target of speculators late October.
</P>
<P>
But the local authorities have repeatedly pledged to defend the
dollar, now the only regional currency which is pegged to the U.S.
dollar.

<HEADLINE> German Budget Deficit Misses Euro Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's budget deficit of 3.1
percent of its gross domestic product in 1997 is slightly above
the ceiling set by the European Union (EU) for membership in the
single European currency, a German government panel of independent
economists predicted today.
</P>
<P>
The new estimates made by the panel, known as the "five wise
men," came after Germany's six leading economic institutions
predicted in their joint economic report a few weeks ago that
Germany's 1997 budget deficit would average exactly 3.0 percent of
GDP.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU Maastricht Treaty, EU member states must run budget
deficits of no more than 3.0 percent of GDP in order to qualify for
membership in the single currency, the euro, which is scheduled to
be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its autumn economic report released today, the "five wise
men" also expected the German economy to grow at an annual rate of
2.5 percent in 1997 and 3.0 percent in 1998, corresponding to
earlier projections made by the government.
</P>
<P>
However, it also noted that the economic upswing would not
bring any relief to the job market. Unemployment in Germany will
continue to rise from an average rate of 11.4 percent this year to
11.6 percent in 1998, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
In order to correct the unfavorable trend, the panel called on
the government to achieve a long-term reduction of tax burdens and
for the private sectors to maintain moderate wage increases for
several years.

<HEADLINE> Hang Seng Bank Stands for Linked Exchange Rate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Bank, one of the
largest banks in Hong Kong, today described the linked exchange
rate system between HK and U.S. dollars as "optimal," warning that
any dislinking would worsen Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of the Hang Seng Economic Monthly, the bank
said the continued strong growth in the motherland would help
keeping the "growth momentum" of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"In view of Hong Kong's small and highly open economy, the
(14-year-old) linked exchange rate system is the optimal exchange
rate regime" for the SAR because it would promote the SAR's stable
economic growth, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Should the linked exchange rate system be abandoned, Hong
Kong's real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth could slow to 1.5
percent and inflation could soar to 11 percent in 1998, with the
prospect of a more volatile economy in the long run," it warned,
noting that it would be unwise to abandon this cornerstone of the
SAR's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It explained, for example, that "the price effect of any
depreciation of the HK dollar would have only a limited impact in
boosting external trade, 85 percent of which are re-exports."
</P>
<P>
"Exports of services would also be unlikely to gain much
benefit as over 60 percent of services exports are trade-related
and therefore directly linked to the volume of re-exports.
Meanwhile, the value of imports of goods and services would go up
sharply in HK dollar terms, pushing up internal prices," it added.
</P>
<P>
Under the linked exchange rate system, the SAR's high cost
structure would, in itself, result in an adjustment as Hong Kong's
goods and services would find it increasingly hard to compete in
the international market, the bank said, adding that the reduction
in demand would set off a deflationary process that would drive
down internal prices until the economy regained its
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its confidence in the SAR's future, the bank
emphasized that "it is therefore in the best interest of Hong Kong
to continue to adopt the linked exchange rate system."

<HEADLINE> Europe Urged to Help Develop Infrastructure in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Second Asia-Europe
Business Forum (AEBF II), which was closing here today, urged
European businessmen to provide assistance to help Asian countries
to develop their infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Infrastructure needs in Asia will be growing in the
foreseeable future whereas European private sectors have
technological know-how and expertise in this area," the forum said
in a chairman's statement today.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in infrastructure has become a flagship activity of
the AEBF process, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, representatives from 10 Asian nations and 15 European
nations at the two-day forum meeting stressed that some
pre-requisite factors for an increased participation of the
private sector in infrastructure should be considered.
</P>
<P>
The pre-requisites include sound and stable macro-economic
policy, robust financial infrastructures, and an institutional,
legal and regulatory framework which is transparent, consistent
and stable.
</P>
<P>
The forum proposed that Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) countries
should maintain a continuous dialogue on infrastructure issues
within the AEBF.
</P>
<P>
The forum also proposed that ASEM countries should encourage
necessary actions, such as macro-economic and institutional
measures including further development of domestic financial
markets, further strengthening of coordination of external funding
sources, and closer cooperation with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The actions will help the countries facilitate preparation of
economic and technical projects, execute contracts, and improve
risk-reducing mechanisms, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The forum downplayed the need to set up an infrastructure fund
within the ASEM, but stressed the need to increase the number of
sound and bankable projects in infrastructure, particularly those
which are developed at provincial and municipal levels with
private companies strongly involved.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 representatives from the public and private sectors
from 25 nations attended the forum to discuss future business
cooperation between Asia and Europe, mainly in five fields --
small and medium-sized enterprise, infrastructure, trade,
investment, and tourism.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Growing on Sound Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council reports
that the country's economic growth, with its moderate slowdown,
has seen some improvement in its quality, efficiency, and growth
mode.
</P>
<P>
The report came from the State Council's Research Center for
Economic, Technological and Social Development. It said that the
government's macro-economic controls since 1993 have been
effective in controlling the over-heated economy and inflation,
resulting in a moderate fall after a sharp rise. The country's
macro-economic operation succeeded in having a soft landing in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has various micro-economic readjustment
measures for lowering interest rates and for export tax rebates,
which created a better macro-economic environment for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The report says that, for the next step of economic
development, the country should adhere to a principle of moderate
growth and correctly deal with relations between annual economic
growth and sustained, rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
National economic growth in 1998 should be targeted at 8.5 to 9
percent, it says, and that China's economy has entered the most
advantageous period since the beginning of reforms and the
opening-up drive in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth will be boosted if there is headway in the
reform of state-owned enterprises and an improvement of product
mix, and if there are accelerated steps in the social security and
housing system reforms, the report says.
</P>
<P>
By regulating the market mechanism, the national economy will
not slow down the speed of operations, the report stressed.

<HEADLINE> L.A. County Supports Renaming Los Angeles Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors agreed today to name Los Angeles International
Airport after Jimmy Stewart, a Hollywood star who flew 20 combat
missions during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The idea to rename the airport was proposed by supervisor
Michael Antonovich, who said it would put Los Angeles "in line
with other major communities that have named airports after
notable citizens."
</P>
<P>
General Jimmy Stewart, a famous Hollywood star whose films
include "It's a Wonderful Life," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"
and "Vertigo," joined the U.S. Army Air Corps at age 32. He was
later assigned to command the 703rd Squadron in Britain where he
earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and became a colonel in the
Second Air Division.
</P>
<P>
All these, Antonovich believes, are the reasons to honor
Stewart, who died July 2 at age 89.
</P>
<P>
The renaming proposal, sources said, must get approval from Los
Angeles City Council, the mayor and the Airport Commission.
</P>
<P>
similar airports with celebrity names include Kennedy airport
in New York and John Wayne airport in Irvine.

and they will clash with Canada in the final on Saturday. Canada
reached their first final when they beat Egypt 2-1.
</P>
<P>
England's Simon Parke was the man of the hour, becoming the
first player to defeat newly-crowned world individual champion
Rodney Eyles. Parke won 9-3, 9-3 and 9-6 in only 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Chris Walker gave England a perfect start against
Craig Rowland, who threw away an 8-6 lead in the first game to
lose 8-10.
</P>
<P>
It proved to be a costly mistake and even though Rowland won
the second game 9-2, he lost the next two 1-9 and 5-9 to hand the
initiative back to England.
</P>
<P>
Del Harris finished the rout by defeating Brett Martin 9-2 and
9-2.
</P>
<P>

coming back from a first game deficit to stun Omar El Borolossy
4-9, 9-1, 9-2 and 9-0.
</P>
<P>
Amir Wagih had given Egypt the lead when he used his faster
court speed and delicate drop shots to beat Gary Waite 9-3, 9-6
and 9-6.
</P>
<P>
However, world third-seeded Jonathon Power was in awesome form
and brushed aside Ahmed Barada, the world no. 5, 9-4, 9-5 and 9-4
to level the scores. It was Power's easiest ever win over Barada.

<HEADLINE> BMW Still in the Running to Buy Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- German carmaker BMW today said
it was still in the competition to buy the British luxury carmaker
Rolls-Royce after the German press reported the deal would go to
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
The Munich-based car company said it was impossible for
Vickers, the Rolls-Royce parent company, to have made a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
After confirming VW's interest in Rolls-Royce, Vickers
noted: "It would be quite wrong to say that there are any
frontrunners. The sales process could take months rather than
weeks."
</P>
<P>
At headquarters in Wolfsburg, VW only confirmed its interest in
buying Rolls-Royce. "We can't say any more than that," said
Europe's largest car manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The comments came after the German business daily
"Handelsblatt" reported that the Rolls-Royce purchase deal would
go to VW, which offered a higher bid than BMW, General Motors or
the Japanese carmaker Toyota.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: LTTE Involves in Colombo Power Plant Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan authorities
this evening officially confirmed that a fire at Colombo's power
plant early today was due to bomb explosions set off by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Military Spokesman Ink Dewage said "a very small group of LTTE
terrorists had fixed automatic explosive devices on the fuel tanks
in the power plant."
</P>
<P>
Some of the explosive devices exploded around 5 am local time,
creating holes about 1.5 inches in diameter on the tanks, Dewage
said.
</P>
<P>
There are four fuel tanks at the power station, each of which
has a capacity of 13 million liters. When the fire broke out, the
tanks contained a total of 3 million liters of diesel.
</P>
<P>
Security forces and employees of the plant took prompt action
and put off the fire subsequent to the explosions within half an
hour.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the LTTE had failed in their attempt to
destroy the power plant, which was built in 1963 and expanded
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the government confirmed LTTE
involvement in the fire since the incident took place.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the authorities have denied reports that there were
explosions before the fire and said the fire was caused by a fuel
tank leakage.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there were bombs planted inside the power
plant in the morning, the Defense Ministry had answered in
negative.
</P>
<P>
The fire in the biggest thermal power station of Sri Lanka
caused no major damage to the plant, according to police.
</P>
<P>
Police had sealed off the power station and all roads around it
until situation returned to complete normalcy hours later. No one
was killed or injured in the incident, they said.
</P>
<P>
A usually reliable source in Colombo said he heard sounds of
explosions at the time of fire.
</P>
<P>
The incident coincided with the traditional Full Moon Day of
Sri Lanka, which led people to associate it with last month's bomb
blast in the center of the capital.
</P>
<P>
A truck bomb exploded in the Fort area of the city on October
15, also a Full Moon Day, killing 18 people and injuring over 100
others.
</P>
<P>
Last month's bombing attack was blamed on the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has been fighting for a separate
state of their own in the north and east of the country since
1983.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE destroyed a main oil storage facility in Colombo in
October,1995, killing 29 people.
</P>
<P>
So far the plant has restarted all turbines and it is in full
operation.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Threatens Zambia's Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Smuggling continues to be the
biggest threat to the survival of the manufacturing companies in
Zambia, Zambia News Agency ZANA reported today.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted Mark O'ionnell, Chairman of the Zambia Association
of Manufacturers (ZAM), as saying in his latest annual report
that smuggling is out of control and actions need to be taken to
stem the problem.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of all imports into Zambia are smuggled in
one way or another. They are either under-invoiced,
under-declared, over-packed or blatantly smuggled into the
country without documents at all, according to the ZAM chairman.
</P>
<P>
This, O'ionnell stressed, not only represents a loss of direct
revenue for the government, but it affects our businesses which
lose sales as a result of the problem, causing a further loss of
revenue to the government.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Zambia Revenue Authority has been active in
helping to clamp down on smuggling but they do not get all the
support they need.
</P>
<P>
In his report, O'ionnell attributed the tide of smuggling to
higher taxes that needed to be reduced to discourage tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that an anti-smuggling hot line and a tax amnesty
be introduced to curb and reduce smuggling in the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia Disappointed with NZ Decision on Frigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Defense Minister
Ian McLachlan today welcomed New Zealand's move to significantly
boost defense spending, but expressed regret at the decision not
to buy more Australian-built ANZAC frigates.
</P>
<P>
"The decision not to take up the option available to New
Zealand to acquire an additional two ANZAC frigates was clearly
disappointing," McLachlan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The decision not to purchase an additional two frigates was
contained in New Zealand's new Defense White Paper released
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
However the paper will result in a significant boost in defense
spending, a move strongly welcomed by McLachlan. The New Zealand
government announced yesterday a 511 million U.S. dollar increase
to military spending over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"The Government had made clear its deep concern at the
progressive erosion in the capabilities of the New Zealand Defense
Force in recent years and its implications for effective
collaboration with the Australian Defense Force," McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
"The program set out in the white paper, if fully implemented,
will help to arrest this erosion."
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the white paper revealed a strong similarity of
views with Australia on the security outlook in the Asia Pacific
and the role of defense forces in protecting and promoting
regional security.

<HEADLINE> Games Dominate Home Computers in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Only 300,000 people in
Australia accessed the Internet from home and it was the most
popular use for the home computers to play computer games, an
official survey revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
A survey titled Household Use of Information Technology 1996,
conducted by the Bureau of Statistics of Australia, showed that
2.2 million homes, or one-third of Australian homes, had a
computer and there were four million home computer users in the
country with a population of nearly 18 million.
</P>
<P>
That was high by world standards, but just 300,000 or 7.5
percent of home computer users were connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Only a quarter of the home computer users had a modem,
essential for accessing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
And it's likely to be a long time before Australians see the
end of the post office, or "snail mail" as it is sneeringly
referred to by Internet users, with just 200,000 home computer
users able to access electronic mails.
</P>
<P>
In a further indication of how computers are regarded in the
Australian homes, playing computer games was easily the most
popular use for home computers.
</P>
<P>
About 58 percent of home computer users said they played
computer games, compared with just 44.6 percent who said they used
the computer for studies and 24.6 percent who used it for
education.
</P>
<P>
The home computer also remains the domain of the young: the
highest proportion of home computer users were 5-17 year olds (41
percent) followed by 18-24 year olds (29 percent).
</P>
<P>
Only seven percent of over-55s used a home computer.
</P>
<P>
The PC computers which run Microsoft's Windows were dominant,
with only nine percent using the rival Apple Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
The major reasons cited for not having a computer in the home
were "no use" (40 percent) and "costs too high" (30 percent).

<HEADLINE> Reform A Key to China's Soccer: Top Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese sports offical
said here on Thursday that China's soccer will have a bright
future as long as the country continues and deepen the
professionalization-oriented reform on the vulnerable sport.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, Minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports
Commission, said the reform has been proved successful since it
was unveiled in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said some 8,000 footballers have registered in clubs across
the country, four times the number before the reform.
</P>
<P>
"The men's football has embarked on a track of self-reliance,"
Wu said. "It does not have to rely on the government's financial
help in development."
</P>
<P>
The national squad of the world's most populous country failed to
qualify for the World Cup finals for the fifth consecutive time
early this week in the just-ended Asian Zone Group A competition.
</P>
<P>
Wu admitted that China has not reached the standard to win a
berth for the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese team should be ranked fifth to seventh in
Asia. So it has yet to have the calibre to enter the top two in
Group A," said Wu, who was attending the annual Chinese Sports
Products Show in this capital city of Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu stressed: "I don't mean the national squad had no
chance in the qualifiers. Before the games, I had said they
should go all out even if the hope was slim."
</P>
<P>
But the sports minister said that head coach Qi Wusheng and the
players should not be blamed too much.
</P>
<P>
"The head coach should take some responsibility, but it's
unfair to impute the failure to himself. Everyone involved should
take their own responsibility."
</P>
<P>
He added that all the players had tried their best in the
field. "In the opener against Iran, seven of the 11 players
suffered cramp in the legs," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has never tasted World Cup Finals in the history. It
finished third in the World Cup Asian Zone Group A competition,
wherein Saudi Arabia advanced into France automatically by topping
the five-team group.
</P>
<P>
Iran finished second and will take on Japan, runner-up of Group
B, in a play-off for the third berth on Sunday, with the loser
fighting Australia on a home-and-away format on November 22 and
29 for another place.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Spooked by Falls in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares were
spooked in this afternoon by a slump in Japanese shares and
uncertainty over U.S. inflation data due out tonight local time.
</P>
<P>
"It went from down 10 points to down 28 points very, very
quickly," Reynolds &AMP; Co. senior dealer Peter Struk said.
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of selling that just came into the market ...
across the board," he said.
</P>
<P>
Struk said selling mostly came from local investors after the
Japanese benchmark share index was down almost two percent in
early-afternoon trading there.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries finished down 24.9 points to 2,479.1, having
traveled most of the afternoon session down 10 points and in the
early morning achieving a high of 2,530.7.
</P>
<P>
The Australian share market has increasingly shown concerns
over the direction of its Asian counterparts in recent months.
</P>
<P>
There are fears the domestic economy could be dragged down by
troubled Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
The all industrial index was down 37.4 points to 4,176.6, while
the all resources index slipped 15.5 points to 1,132.5.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the banks were mixed with the index slipping 33.4
points to 5,216.6.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank was down 33.5 cents to 20.46 Australian
dollars and Commonwealth fell 15 cents to 17.05 Australian
dollars. But ANZ increased nine cents to 10.09 Australian dollars
and Westpac lifted 3.2 cents to 8.71 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP was down 20 cents to 14.10 Australian
dollars and global diversified miner Rio Tinto dropped 24.5 to
16.71 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index inched down nine points to 999.8, after the
bullion price was little changed at 307.70 U.S. dollars an ounce
in late Sydney trading, from 307.75 U.S. dollars in Sydney late
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 328.4 million shares, worth 862.5 million
U.S. dollars, with falls of 492 outnumbering rises of 453.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
strengthened today but remained under pressure as regional equity
markets continued to sell off.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 69.90 U.S. cents, almost half a cent
higher from its previous close at 69.28 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar is really tracking the equity markets
and it will do so for the foreseeable future," a Sydney-based
trader with Macquarie Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The currency lifted in early session dealings after the U.S.
sharemarket gained ground during its session Thursday, but it fell
back over the remainder of the day as local and Japanese equity
markets weakened.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the outlook for the Australian dollar was
negative, with the Asian crisis outweighing more optimistic
domestic factors.
</P>
<P>
There are fears the domestic economy could be dragged down by
troubled Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said a fall in
the Australian dollar to 67 U.S. cents was not out of the question
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 87.84 yen, from 86.91, and at
1.2048 marks, from 1.1924.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets Yugoslav President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met here
today with visiting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his
party to China.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that you selected China as the first country to visit
following your election as president serves as a true indication
that you attach great importance to the development of the
friendly Sino-Yugoslavian cooperative relations," said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the visit by Milosevic will undoubtedly further
deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples
and propel bilateral ties into a new period.
</P>
<P>
Qiao noted that the traditional friendship between China and
Yugoslavia has enabled the two nations to learn from and help each
other in national construction efforts.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that friendly contacts and mutually beneficial
cooperation has witnessed continuous development in the political,
economic, scientific, technological, cultural, educational and
sports arenas.
</P>
<P>
Qiao recalled his last visit to Yugoslavia in 1978 and said the
friendly feelings that the Yugoslavian people have for the Chinese
people left him with a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with friendly cooperative ties
between the NPC and the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia. He said
the NPC pays great attention to further developing cooperation
with the assembly, and noted that strengthening contacts between
the two parliaments will be conducive to deepening friendship
between the two peoples and promoting friendly bilateral
cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the increasing exchange of visits between
parliamentary leaders from the two nations in recent years has
greatly enhance mutual understanding and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that special committees from the two
parliaments will expand high-level visits and contacts. We are
eager to join hands with the Yugoslav assembly to make unremitting
efforts to forge friendly cooperative relations geared to the 21st
century," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said the goal of his visit is to enhance
understanding and friendship between the two peoples and explore
new fields of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that good bilateral political relations offer an
excellent opportunity for cooperation in other fields.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that parliamentary cooperation is an
important component of friendly cooperative relations between the
two countries and expressed his hope that friendly cooperation be
furthered and reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception
Committee and minister of Posts and Telecommunications, and Srdja
Bozovic, chairman of the Chamber of Republics of the Federal
Assembly of Yugoslavia, also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> State-owned Chinese Coal Mines Begin To Show Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Sixty of China's 93 major
state-owned coal enterprises have begun to show a profit after a
period of losses in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The mines had 170 million yuan (21.2 million U.S.dollars) in
profits in the first nine months of 1997, according to an official
of the Ministry of Coal Industry, who said that, as the backbone
of China's coal industry, the state-owned sector produce over 45
percent of the total coal every year, which is mainly used for
electric power, metallurgy, and the building materials industry.
</P>
<P>
China's coal industry has had losses since the mid-1980s. In
1992, key state-owned enterprises had losses of as much as 5.7
billion yuan and they were still in trouble last year, with losses
of 600 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the face of such problems, the coal industry began a series
of reforms in 1993, dismissing redundant workers, increasing
efficiency, being responsible for losses, increasing efficiency
and output, and encouraging employees to find work in agriculture
and the service industry.
</P>
<P>
Even though the coal industry has managed to turn losses into
profit it still has a long way to go to get rid of bad management
practices and to further improve efficiency.

<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony marking the opening
of air cargo service linking Shenyang in northeast China's
Liaoning Province and Moscow was held by Russia's East Line
Company here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Russian Vice-Minister of Transport Vladmir Azopov said
at the ceremony that the volume of goods transport between Russia
and China is increasing along with the growth of bilateral
trade. The opening of Shenyang-Moscow air cargo service would
facilitate the further expansion of goods transport between the
two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the East Line Company has already opened
cargo service from Tianjin, a port city in north China, and other
Chinese cities to Russia, and the volume of goods transported
between China and Russia accounts for 60 to 65 per cent of the
company's total volume of 9000 tons each month.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Cabinet Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the new Thai
cabinet was officially announced here today after the approval by
Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
</P>
<P>
In the new line-up of the cabinet which consists of 48 members,
Democrat Party leader Chuan Leekpai assumes the posts of prime
minister and defense minister.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the Thai history that a civilian
assumes the post of defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Among other key members, Bhichai Rattakul, Supachai
Panitchpakdi, Panja Kesornthong and Suvit Khunkitti serve as
Deputy Prime Ministers. Supachai also concurrently hold the post
of commerce minister.
</P>
<P>
Sanan Khachornprasar, secretary-general of the Democrat Party,
takes the post of interior minister, while Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda,
is appointed as finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Chuan this time does not invite non-party experts to assume the
key posts, such as finance minister and commerce minister, to
manage the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Another feature is that many ruling party leaders, including
Banharn Silpa-Archa of the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party, Samak
Sundaravej of the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen) Party, and Montri
Pongpanich of the Social Action Party, do not take any post in the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chuan told reporters after the announcement of the formation of
the new government that his cabinet will be sworn in the front of
King Bhumibul on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will open its first meeting immediately after it is
sworn in to discuss its administrative outlines.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Somalis Face Food Shortage Due to Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 200,000 Somalis
whose personal food reserves and crops have been wiped out by
shocking floods and heavy rains over the last few weeks now face
severe food shortage, the World Food Program (WFP) warned today.
</P>
<P>
Such a hard time may last eight months until the next harvest
season, said a WFP report issued here, adding the expected
January harvest is to be a virtual failure in many areas of the
south due to the heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of families will not be able to plant again until
March when cultivating begins for Somalia's largest season, the
Gu, which is due to be harvested in July.
</P>
<P>
WFP estimated that southern Somalia's food deficit as a result
of the rains could be as high as 20,000-30,000 tons over the
coming months. It is hoped that much of the deficit will be made
up in commercial imports.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains which began pouring down in southern Somalia
in mid-October have caused the 600-kilometer-long Juba River, the
country's largest river, to burst its banks in several locations.
</P>
<P>
Flood waters have been quickly spreading throughout hundreds
of small communities along the river, leaving families stranded
on the tops of their homes, trees and nearby embankments.
</P>
<P>
Homes, roads, airstrips and badly needed crops were inundated
with several meters of muddy water.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 tons of underground food reserves have now
either been washed-away by flood waters or are completely
inedible due to severe water damage, according to the WFP report.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers are already worried that the long-term destruction
to the country's agricultural situation will be another looming
and more complex problem to handle.
</P>
<P>
"The rains have already destroyed more than 60,000 hectares of
crops mostly in irrigated farmland," said Renato Marai, an
agronomist working with WFP.
</P>
<P>
"Damage this extensive will have devastating consequences for
tens of thousands of Somalis and what's even more frightening is
that we probably don't even know the total extent of the damage
at this point," he noted.
</P>
<P>
International aid workers said over 500 Somalis died because
of the floods.
</P>
<P>
"Without any international food aid, their (the flood-affected
Somalis) chances of recovering from a natural disaster of this
magnitude is impossible," he said.

<HEADLINE> Unity Government Campaign in Israel Gaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The movement for creating a
unity government in Israel is gaining new momentum Friday as
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky joined the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing to foreign correspondents before
heading Israeli delegation to the Doha Middle East and North
Africa Economic Conference, Sharansky said "it is time of unity"
two years after the assassination of former Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, head of the powerful Russian immigrant Yisrael
Baaliya Party, said he was not embarrassed by the booing he
received when he addressed a peace rally held in Tel Aviv
last Saturday to mark Rabin's assassination. He said he instead
realized that he had taken the right decision to attend to
appeal for national unity.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he supported the much-talked-about idea of forming
a national unity government, Sharansky replied that only this
would achieve national consensus, calm down the political tension
and improve the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"The unity government is very important, and steps will
take place in the near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky explained the importance of forming such a
government, saying Israel is facing many big challenges ahead
which it could not possibly deal with without broad national
consensus. Those challenges included the conversion dispute between
Oxthodox Jews and Reform Jews, the impending final-status talks
with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the minister, also a member of the inner security
cabinet, refused to tell what actions he would take in the
near future to bring about a national unity government. He
indirectly criticized some other politicians for launching a
propaganda campaign "through the mass media" by pushing openly
for a unity government, adding he would do it quietly.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said he believed Israel and the Palestinian side
are approaching the final-status talks, and Israel has to make
"the most important decision since the founding of the state."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that both sides should conduct peace talks on the
basis of security, adding the Palestinians should lower their
expectations and be ready to make compromise in order to achieve
progress.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Arab boycott of the Doha conference,
Sharansky criticized the boycotting countries for using the
meeting as a way of political pressure to press for maximum
demands from Israel without making concession of their own. He
believed Israel's participation of the conference, which is
overshadowed by the stalemate in the peace process, would help
improve the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky's declared support for national unity added new
momentum to the move to form a unity government. The recent
days witnessed a flurry of political activities among parties
aimed at easing the increasing social division and political
tension.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he would
hold a meeting with leading opposition leader Ehud Barak of
Labor party next Wednesday upon his return from visits to
Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The centralist Third Way party leader Avigdor Kahalani, who
is spearheading the national unity campaign, have held separate
meetings Wednesday with both Netanyahu and Barak to bridge
their gap.
</P>
<P>
Arye Deri, leader of the powerful Shas party, also held
talks Wednesday with Netanyahu to discuss the unity issue. And
in an unexpected move, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy held
a meeting Thursday with Barak to discuss the current political
situation.
</P>
<P>
The initiative for national unity was launched at a time when
the public pressure for realizing national unity increased due to
the worry about further deepening of the internal division caused
by the escalating war of words between leftist and rightist camps
on the second anniversary of the assassination of former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is widely held for partially responsible for
Rabin's murder, issued a call Wednesday in his address to the
Knesset memorial ceremony for realizing national reconciliation with
his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the declared intentions and intensive
political maneuvering, the gap between the government and the
opposition remained wide.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied Thursday intending to form a unity
government with the Labor party, saying he was confident about
his government's stability and only preferred launching a national
reconciliation drive rather than striving to form a unity
government.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Refuses to Ban Textile Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 14 (Xinhua) --The Nigerian government has
turned down repeated calls from local businesses for a ban on
textile import.
</P>
<P>
In his message Thursday to this year's textile economic summit
here, Industries minister Mohammed Balarabe said: "With
increasing globalization and liberalization of the world economy,
it has become imperative to de-emphasise trade restrictive
measures."
</P>
<P>
In the past three decades, the Nigerian government has granted
tremendous protection, including import prohibition to the
textile industry, to enhance its performance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Now that the government has lifted the ban early this year, it
will not re-impose it as asked by some local textile
manufactures, the Guardian today quoted the minister as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
The only way out for local textile companies, Haladu said, is
to produce goods that are of high quality and internationally
competitive.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to take advantage of the country's
abundant human and material resources to develop the textile,
saying that with a population of 104 million, Nigeria has the
largest market in west Africa, which promises a profitable
business and an attraction to investors.
</P>
<P>
The minsiter asked the manufactures to embrace liberalization
and take advantage of the various global conventions that provide
preferential terms to developing countries in access to developed
markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Namibian officials are
set to meet their Botswanan counterparts for another round of
talks over the disputed island of Situngu, South African Press
Association quoted a Namibian newspaper as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The date for the new round of talks was expected to be set
today.
</P>
<P>
Caprivi regional Governor John Mabuka, who headed a Namibian
delegation to recent talks on the dispute, said he was optimistic
that the issue would be resolved at regional level.
</P>
<P>
The latest territorial dispute was triggered when a Botswana
Defense Force (BDF) unit allegedly trooped onto Situngu, using a
military helicopter, and allegedly ordered villagers farming on
the island to vacate their fields, accusing them of being on
Botswanan soil.
</P>
<P>
During recent talks the parties agreed that the villagers, who
had already tilled and planted their fields when the BDF soldiers
trooped in, should be left to continue tending their fields.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that no new plowing be allowed until the
issue was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana are already embroiled in a dispute over
Kasikili Island in the Chobe River. The matter is being heard by
the International Court of Justice in the Hague. Botswana is set
to make its final submission in the case on November 28.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Supports Uganda's Decentralization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Capital
Development Fund (UNCDF) has granted Uganda 12.4 million U.S.
dollars for a three-year decentralization program in four
districts, to be started from July next year.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Kayanja, media officer of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), was quoted today by the local press
as saying that Uganda qualifies for the grant because it is one
of the few countries that have rigorously carried out district
decentralization.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to provide services include primary
education, health and road maintenance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decentralization program (or system), a major
administrative reform measure was launched in October 1992, aimed
at making administration more effective and speeding up mass
participation in policy-making and national development.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, most of the administrative powers are
concentrated at the district levels, with the central government
in charge of policy-making, supervision and training.
</P>
<P>
The central government retains responsibility for national
planning, defense, foreign affairs, immigration, security and

<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- An incubation program,
designed to assist Hong Kong's technology startup companies to
grow, has begun to bear fruits after three years of cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Now there are 34 incubatees under the three-year program, which
provides management, marketing, financial, infrastructural and
technical support for technology companies in their initial stage
of development.
</P>
<P>
"Two of our incubatees have won the Hong Kong Awards for
Industry, and a graduated incubatee has won an award presented by
the Federation of Hong Kong Industries," said James Liu, Chief
Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Industrial Technology Center
Corporation (HKITCC), a statutory body responsible for the whole
program.
</P>
<P>
These young technology companies are trying to tap business
opportunities in such areas as multimedia and networking,
telecommunications, software and systems, and microelectronics and
components.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Liu told a press conference here today: "The program has
been developing so rapidly that the original Tech Center is short
of space for new comers. That's why we rented the first floor at
the Environment Building in order to accommodate more incubatees."
</P>
<P>
The extended Tech Center provides a total floor space of 1,115
square meters, and is able to accommodate nine companies. Liu
expected the number of incubatees will grow to 45 in the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The HKITCC is a statutory body founded in 1993 to promote
technological innovation and application in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China supports
Yugoslavia's accession to the United Nations and various other
international organizations at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks while calling on visiting Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said Qian's visit to Yugoslavia in 1995 is still
fresh on his mind. He said the purpose of his current visit is to
further promote friendly relations of cooperation between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that both friendly cooperation and the traditional
friendship between the two countries have improved greatly in
recent years and the two countries have identical or similar views
on a series of major international issues.

<P>
He stressed that China is fully prepared to work with
Yugoslavia to strengthen friendly and cooperative Sino-Yugoslav
relations geared to the 21st century.

<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese Government supports
Yugoslavia's efforts to safeguard its independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese Government supports Yugoslavia's return to
the international community at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>

foreign policy, and noted that the country has passed through the
most difficult period, despite continuing to face many
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation of Yugoslavia's active efforts and
achievements in expanding foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian addressed issues related to the former Yugoslav region,

He said Yugoslavia is a driving force for promoting peace and
stability in the region, and expressed his belief that the nation
will continue to contribute to peace and stability in the region.
</P>

relations with all former Yugoslav nations. He said China is fully
prepared to maintain and expand friendly cooperative relations
with said nations in all fields on the basis of mutual respect,
trust, equality and benefits.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: EU and Iran End Diplomatic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- With the return of European
ambassadors to Tehran this morning, the 15-nation European Union
(EU) put an end to its diplomatic crisis with Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between the EU and Iran
Thursday, the EU ambassadors returned to their posts in Tehran
with the exception of the German and French envoys, who will
come back to Iran within one week.
</P>
<P>
Observers here attributed the successful solution to the
EU-Iran crisis to the firm stance of the EU, particularly the
French government and companies, towards the U.S. sanctions
against Iran and the foreign policies of the new Iranian
government headed by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by the Berlin court verdict which
charged top Iranian leaders of sponsoring the assassination of
four Iranian anti-government Kurdish leaders in Berlin's Mykonos
restaurant in 1992. In a protest to Iran, the EU withdrew their
ambassadors in Tehran and announced to terminate its "critical
dialogue" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision was greatly welcomed by the United States,
which has announced a strict economic embargo on Iran and tried
to isolate the Islamic country in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Washington called on the EU countries to stop their "critical
dialogue" with Iran, saying that it was completely no use to hold
talks with Iran, which was labeled as sponsor of international
terrorism, a hurdle for the Middle East peace process, and a
country of seeking mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also warned to punish companies of third countries
which has more than 20 million dollars investment in Iran's oil
and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. threat was rejected by most of the
European countries and the French Total company concluded a
contract of investment in Iran's giant offshore oil fields in
the Persian Gulf, challenging the U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German government stressed the need for the
EU states to resume dialogues and talks with Iran in order
to solve the issue of the return of EU ambassadors to
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
After the Iranian new government of President Mohammad
Khatami was sworn in to office in August, Iranian officials
explained on different occasions that the Iranian government
follows a foreign policy of seeking peaceful and sincere
cooperation with the rest of world and supporting regional and
international peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian statements encouraged the EU countries to
continue their contacts with Iran and the EU dispatched a
special envoy in September to Tehran for talks.
</P>
<P>
During the visit of the EU special envoy, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced that Iran agreed to the
return of EU ambassadors to Tehran, but the German envoy
should be the last one to do so, a formula which was then
rejected by Germany.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
reiterated that the EU should resume talks with Iran over
its diplomatic crisis with Iran, a proposal was welcomed by
his Iranian counterpart Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Foreign Ministers of Luxembourg and France
have had consequent contacts with Iranian Foreign Minister
Kharrazi over the issue and finally the Luxembourg official
Jacques Poos proposed that the ambassadors of the European Union
(EU) would return to Tehran in two different phases, putting
German and French ambassadors as the last ones to come back.
</P>
<P>
The return of the EU ambassadors to Tehran opened a new
chapter for economic cooperation between the EU and Iran,
observers here noted, however, disputes and differences still
exist, particularly over the issues of Middle East peace process,
international terrorism and mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Although the EU opposes the U.S. mounting sanctions against
Iran, they said, it will only continue the "critical dialogue"
policy in the future.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Rejuvenates Castor-oil Plant Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Tianlin, a mountainous county
in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is
establishing a new 3,470-ha castor-oil plant production base.
</P>
<P>
The county calls for the establishment of 1,300 ha by the
end of this year, with the remainder scheduled for completion
during 1998. The base will have an annual output of 10,000 tons of
castor beans within three years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total nationwide acreage dedicated to
castor-oil plants dropped from 330,000 ha in the 1980s
to the present 200,000 ha, with the annual output for castor beans
falling below 20,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that caster bean output will fail to meet
domestic demand unless the total acreage dedicated to castor-oil
plants is raised to 670,000 hectares.

see the 'new' Hong Kong so they will become ambassadors for our
hometown and spread the massage," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has got support from the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA), the Travel Industry Council (TIC), the Hong
Kong Hotels Association (HKHA) and other industry bodies.
</P>
<P>
"Many travelers will have heard that Hong Kong is too
expensive. This offer will prove that Hong Kong is a top class
value-for-money destination," said Amy Chan, executive director of
the Hong Kong Tourist Association.
</P>
<P>
According to HKTA figures, the average visitor to Hong Kong
spent over 7,000 HK dollars (about 900 U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the booking period, if the Cathay Pacific Super Offer
succeeds in attracting its target of 20,000 visitors, the campaign
will inject over 140 million HK dollars (17.94 million U.S.
dollars) into the economy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
While there are significant short-term benefits, it is more
important to arouse continued interest in Hong Kong, stressed
Chen.
</P>
<P>
By taking the lead to help promote the Hong Kong tourism
industry, Cathay Pacific is fulfilling its role as the Hong Kong's
largest airline.
</P>
<P>
With 47 destinations on five continents, Cathay Pacific is
preparing to expand its services even further once Hong Kong's new
airport at Chek Lap Kok opens in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific believes that by taking a leading role in
helping to revive the Hong Kong the tourism industry, the airline
is living up to its commitment to Hong Kong and its people.

<HEADLINE> SKorea's LG Unveils World's First 64-Megabit Rambus DRAM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 14 (Xinhua) -- LG Semicon Co. of South Korea
announced Friday that it has firstly in the world developed a
64-megabit Rambus dynamic random access memory (RDRAM).
</P>
<P>
The 64-megabit chip is a second-generation RDRAM with a data
rate of 700 megabytes a second, about four times higher than that
of high-speed synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), the current mainstay of
the memory market.
</P>
<P>
The company said the new chip incorporates a new design
technology, which will be adopted for third-generation RDRAM,
called Direct Rambus DRAM.
</P>
<P>
Direct Rambus DRAM is based on the memory specifications set by
Intel for its next-generation central processing unit (CPU), the
P7, which will make its debut in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The new Intel microprocessor calls for a memory chip with a
data rate of 1.6 gigabytes per second to eliminate the speed gap
between it and the main memory. Currently, memory chips operate at
a slower speed than Intel microprocessors, retarding the pace of
performance improvement of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
With Intel's support, Direct Rambus DRAM is expected to emerge
as the main memory chip of choice beginning in 1999, replacing
synchronous DRAM.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to begin mass production of the 64-megabit
chip early next year.
</P>
<P>
LG Semicon said the 64-bit RDRAM chip will help it advance the
development of Direct Rambus DRAM by about a year as it has
already secured the key chip design technology.
</P>
<P>
LG's new chip will initially be used as a graphic memory for
workstations, servers, digital TV sets and ATM (asynchronous
transfer mode) exchanges which require high-capacity graphic
memory chips.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the main graphic memory chips are synchronous DRAM
and EDO (extended data out) DRAM. But LG Semicon believes its
RDRAM excels these chips.
</P>
<P>
The company will demonstrate its new chip at the '97 Comdex
Show which opens in Las Vegas November 17.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai University Fires Teacher for Plagiarism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Hu Liming, 34, a teacher at
the East China University of Science and Engineering in Shanghai,
has been fired for engaging in plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
The lead story on the frontpage of the latest edition of
Chinese Science News said that Hu was fired from posts as a
graduate student tutor, a leading member of the State Superfine
Powder Engineering Center and various other positions.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Wang Xingyu, president of the university,
as saying that plagiarism in the realm of higher education and
science must be eliminated to safeguard the dignity of the
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
Wang said an investigative team of five experts from the
university scoured Hu's doctorate thesis for 12 days and found
that he had plagiarized a large amount of data, models and
expressions from published articles. Hu earned a Ph.D. at the age
of 28.
</P>
<P>
Wand said the investigation was conducted after the university
officials received a number letters accusing Hu of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hu plagiarized the results of scientific
discoveries and fabricated the titles of two nonexisting
monographes.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the purpose of universities is to foster competent
personnel, and stressed that plagiarism is strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also called for a "crack down on counterfeit
goods" in the science sector.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Fuel Tank Leakage Causes Fire in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A fire broke out due to a fuel
tank leakage in Sri Lanka's biggest thermal power station early
this morning, but it caused no major damage to the plant, police
said today.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at around 5 o'clock this morning. Fire
fighters rushed to the scene and brought the fire under control
within about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the power station and all roads around it
until the situation returned to complete normalcy hours later. No
one was killed or injured in the incident, they said.
</P>
<P>
There are four fuel tanks at the power station, each of which
has a capacity of 13 million liters. When the fire broke out, the
tanks contained a total of 3 million liters of diesel. Local
reports said all the tanks were slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has confirmed the cause of the fire was a
fuel tank leakage. It asked the public to cooperate by keeping
away from the area until further notice.
</P>
<P>
There were reports saying bombs might be planted inside the
power plant, which is located on the outskirts of Colombo.
However, the security authorities have denied there was any LTTE
background behind the incident, saying the reports were false.
</P>
<P>
A usually reliable source in Colombo said he heard sounds of
explosions at the time of fire. The national news agency,
Lankapuvath, in a report quoted Military Spokesman Brigadier
Sarath Munasinghe as saying the incident was a pre-planned attack.
</P>
<P>
The incident coincided with the traditional Full Moon Day of
Sri Lanka, which easily led people to associate it with last
month's bomb blast in the center of the capital.
</P>
<P>
A truck bomb exploded in the Fort area of the city on October
15, also a Full Moon Day, killing 18 people and injuring over 100
others.
</P>
<P>
Last month's bombing attack was blamed on the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has been fighting for a separate
state of their own in the north and east of the country since
1983.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, police took in two sniffer dogs to detect
possible bombs inside the compound. Additional security personnel
were deployed around the station, which was built in 1963 and
expanded thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Another military spokesman, Ink Dewage, this afternoon said the
plant has restarted all turbines and it is in full operation at
present.
</P>
<P>
He said the security authorities assisted by officials of the
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) conducted a search operation in the
area to ensure safety of people and property of the plant.
</P>
<P>
Government analysts and CEB experts joined hands in probing
into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the fire has not caused any significant
damage to the power station and the employees were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Temporary suspension of movement of traffic and people in
Colombo has been completely relaxed while the situation was back
to complete normalcy, Dewage said.

<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy showed "deep concern" over
the crisis between the United Nations and Iraq, said the Italian
Foreign Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Italy was deeply concerned over Iraq's
decision to expel all U.S. members in the U.N. arms inspection
team from the country, and hoped that Iraq would "take back its
unacceptable decision immediately," the Italian news agency ANSA
reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government wished Iraq "to cooperate fully and
comprehensively with the United Nations," which "is the only way
to the lifting of the sanctions" imposed on the country after the
Gulf War ended in 1991, the report added.
</P>
<P>
On October 29, Iraq decided to kick out the Americans in the
U.N. arms inspection team. Extensive diplomatic efforts have been
made to refrain from putting into effect the decision over the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Security Council's resolution on Wednesday
to condemn Iraq for its non-compliance with the U.N. inspection
activities, Iraq ordered six Americans in the team to leave the
country immediately.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Inspectors of the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraqi mass destruction weapons
left Baghdad for Bahrain by air this morning in protest of
expulsion of U.S. members by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a source of the Iraqi National Supervision Authority,
the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported that the international
inspectors left Baghdad by air for Bahrein at 8 a.m. today by
orders from Richard Butler, Chairman of the Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
Butler announced yesterday that a U.N. aircraft would carry the
international inspectors Friday to Bahrain, the rear base of the
Special Commission, and that he would leave behind in the Baghdad
center a number of employees.

Six American inspectors left Baghdad by land last evening
following a decision taken by the Iraqi Revolution Command Council
in conjunction with the leadership of the Iraqi ruling Baath party
for the immediate expulsion of American inspectors from Iraqi
territory.
</P>
<P>
The decision was the first Iraqi reaction to the U.N. Security
Council resolution 1137 imposing travel sanctions on Iraqi
officials responsible for disrupting inspections, adopted on

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Badly Hits Mediterranean: greenpeace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Global warming weather will
critically undermine efforts for sustainable development in Lebanon
and other Mediterranean literal states, the Greenpeace
Mediterranean has said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Daily Star today quoted a report issued by Greenpeace
Mediterranean in Lebanon on Thursday entitled "Climate change and
the Mediterranean region" as saying that climate change will add
to existing problems of desertification, water scarcity, and food
production in the region.
</P>
<P>
As the world warms, global sea levels will rise as oceans
expand. The level of much of the Mediterranean could rise by
close to one meter by 2100, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the worst affected areas will be
the Nile Delta in Egypt, Venice in Italy and Thessaloniki in
Greece as a consequence of the expected rise in sea level.
</P>
<P>
It said that the first impact of climate change will be
felt in the Mediterranean water resource system. Reductions in
water availability would hit southern Mediterranean countries the
hardest.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Malta and
Lebanon, water availability is already near the 1,000 cubic
meters per person per year benchmark for water scarcity, and
the report warns that live-stock production would suffer as
rangeland deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
The 55-page report added that rising carbon dioxide (CO2) will
also introduce new threats to human health, ecosystems and
national economies.
</P>
<P>
As a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the frequency and
severity of drought could increase across the region.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures could rise by over four degrees centigrade by
2100 over many of the inland areas and by more than this
over the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The report called on all Mediterranean states to immediately
demand industrialized countries adopt legally-binding obligations at
the Kyoto Climate Conference in Japan next month to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent over 1990 levels by
2005.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels Extend Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have extended their
eighth round low-level peace talks on details of an earlier-signed
preliminary truce accord, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, starting Wednesday at a university in Marawi city,
capital of the southern province of Lanao del Sur, was supposed to
end Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But it was extended so that the two sides can further refine
the drafted ground rules for implementing the agreement on the
general cessation of hostilities in entire Mindanao, Ghadzali
Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar also expressed optimism that an accord on the guidelines
for carrying out the truce is expected to be signed later today.
</P>
<P>
But he said if both sides fail to arrive at a compromise today,
the accord may be signed at the next meeting.
</P>
<P>
The government peace panel was led by newly-installed chief
negotiator Orlando Soriano and Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno,
commander of the Army's Fourth Infantry Division based in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
And the rebel negotiating team was headed by Uztads Abduladiz
Mimbantas, MILF vice chairman for internal affairs, who replaced
Jaafar as the chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their exploratory peace talks
in January this year and made a breakthrough in July by signing
the preliminary general truce accord. But they have since failed
to agree on ground rules for carrying out the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), has fought the government for more than
two decades for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government force with an
estimated 12,000 fighters. The MNLF signed a peace accord with
Manila last year.

<HEADLINE> Yitzhak Rabin's Son Receives Death Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Yuval Rabin, son of the late
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, has received a life threat
call apparently from a right-wing extremist, today's The
Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Oren Yehi-Shalom, spokesman of Israeli peace
group Dor Shalom, as saying that Yuval Rabin, who is one of the
heads of the group, received the death phone call as he was on his
way Wednesday to a memorial ceremony in Jerusalem marking the
second anniversary of his father's assassination.
</P>
<P>
Yehi-Shlom said a male voice with a heavy Russian accent left
his message on Yuval Rabin's cell phone: "If you continue in your
father's path, you will follow in his footsteps."
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Rabin, slain by a right-wing Jewish gunman at a peace
rally on November 4, 1995, was branded by the right extremists as
a traitor for handing to the Palestinians West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
Yuval Rabin, who filed a complaint with the police, refused to
comment on the threat and his fellow activists in Dor Shalom said
he remained unfazed.
</P>
<P>
Yehi-Shalom noted that this was one of a growing number of
threats and attacks on the peace movement's activists from
extremist right groups. Just two weeks ago, a Dor Shalom office in
Jerusalem that also serves as a play center for needy children was
burned down.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly I am a little concerned. Anyone could walk into our
office. I hope we do not reach a stage in which we are afraid to
work here," said Yehi-Shalom.
</P>
<P>
He said Dor Shalom had its eye on a number of radical groups
and, together with the police, which has set up a special
investigation team, traced the threats to a Jerusalem-based group
of extreme right wing immigrants from the Russia.
</P>
<P>
"They know we are following their steps and we assume they are
after us," Yehi-Shalom said. "We urge the security forces to
take note that there are people who still advocate violence and
may act in violent ways."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, U.S. to Sign Agreements on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United
States will sign three agreements on bilateral cooperation during
the two-day visit of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
which begins here on Sunday, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Wide range of issues including Kashmir and Afghanistan would
come under discussion during Albright's meetings with Pakistani
leaders, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, they added, would help to further strengthen the
bilateral cooperation and understanding on various regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The sources said primarily the Albright's visit to Pakistan
will be part of high level engagements between the leaders of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, Pakistan will use this opportunity to
apprise the U.S. leader on the current status of Pakistan-Indian
talks with special focus on the Kashmir problem, the situation in
Afghanistan, bilateral relations, economic and trade ties and more
importantly the issue of F-16s.
</P>
<P>
Another key element of Albright's 48-hour trip to Pakistan is
to finalize preparations for President Bill Clinton's visit, the
date which is yet to be decided, they said, adding Clinton is
likely to visit Pakistan in the first quarter of next year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tries to Get World Bank Funds to Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
negotiating with the World Bank to speed up the release of
delayed funds for the energy sector in a bid to bridge the
existing gap between the power supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The delay in disbursement of the funds had further slowed the
implementation of the revised Least Cost Electric Power plan,
Crispus Mutitu, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Energy,
was quoted by today's Daily Natmon as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages a total electric generation capacity of at
least 320 megawatt by 2010 for the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The power projects in Kipevu, Sondu Miriu and Olkaria
Geothermal stations, which are part of the plan, has been delayed
due to lack of funding, Crispus Mutitu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fast track unit with a power generation capacity
of between 100 to 200 megawatt will be needed to bridge the gap
if the country wants to avoid reverting to power rationing next
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank postponed the issue of funds in August partly
as a means to pressure the Kenyan government to privatize the
energy sector to improve energy management.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Kenyan government has recently allowed two
private companies, named Iberafrica and Westmont, to be involved
in power generation. They are expected to provide about 88
megawatt to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
Last w3ek, the parliament passed the Electric Power Bill which
will end the monopoly of power generation and distribution in the
eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 percent of Kenyans have access to power supply,
according to the Energy Ministry data.

<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today that China is prepated to join Yugoslavia in
improving bilateral cooperation in various fields on the basis of
mutual trust, equality and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark during a morning meeting with visiting
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that consolidating and strengthening Sino-Yugoslav
friendship and cooperation accords with the fundamental interests
of the two countries and their people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu welcomed Milosevic on behalf of the Chinese government
and Premier Li Peng, and expressed pleasure at having the
opportunity to meet the Yugoslav president who is a well-known
statesman and old friend of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that China and Yugoslavia are friendly nations, and
that the traditional friendship between the two peoples has
withstood the test of a rapidly changing international situation.
</P>
<P>
Frequent exchanges between leaders of the two sides in recent
years have promoted the all-round development of bilateral
friendship and cooperation, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to friendship and cooperation with Yugoslavia, respects the
choices of the Yugoslav people, supports Yugoslavian independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, appreciates the nation's
independent domestic and foreign policies, and admires the
indomitable spirit of its people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that the Chinese government pays great
attention to economic and trade ties with Yugoslavia, and
encourages and supports Chinese enterprises and localities
conducting various forms of economic and trade cooperation with
their Yugoslav counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Wide-ranging agreements the two countries have signed on
economy and trade, investment protection and the avoidance of
double taxation have laid a legal foundation for smooth economic
and trade cooperation between the two sides, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has been delighted with the annual increase
in trade volume between the two sides in recent years, as well as
with the diversified development of bilateral economic and trade
ties, and expanding spheres of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu specifically mentioned mutually beneficial progress made in
bilateral petroleum and chemical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Full implementation of the agreements signed between the two
sides will facilitate bilateral cooperation in other fields, he
said, adding that increased exchange of visits between businessmen
from the two sides, and the activities of the Sino-Yugoslav
economic and trade committee will play a major role in related
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhu pointed out that joint efforts will raise
bilateral economic and trade cooperation to a new plateau.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that China's rapid economic growth constitutes a
major contribution to the world and mankind.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia, a reliable friend of China, is dedicated to
promoting bilateral economic and trade cooperation. He pointed out
that Yugoslavia is an important communications center in Europe,
and noted that Sino-Yugoslav cooperation will also promote the
growth of economic and trade relations between China and other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said banks from the two countries are currently
discussing opportunities for cooperation and that bilateral
industrial cooperation can also be strengthened. Milosevic pledged
that Yugoslavia will extend great efforts in all related areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The British investors are
planning to come in a bigger way to exploit opportunities
including the gas and oil sector of Bangladesh, the independent
United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are also interested to do trade and business in other
fields in your country," David Brown, Bangladesh desk officer of
the Department of Trade and Industry, London, was quoted as saying
in Dhaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade volume rose substantially with Bangladesh
exporting three times more than its imports from the United
Kingdom, Brown stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exported goods valued at 152.9 million pounds to
Britain while its imports totaled 57.5 million pounds during the
first eight months of the current calendar year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
About the prospect of gas in Bangladesh, a British High
Commission official in Dhaka said Bangladesh could open up a new
era through efficient exploration of gas, and it would ensure a
sustainable growth for the country.
</P>
<P>
With speedy development of the gas resources, Bangladesh will
get sufficient gas to meet its present and future domestic
requirement, the official said, adding besides, the country can
fetch over 500 million US dollars by exporting gas every year.
</P>
<P>
Shell and Cairn, two UK companies, have submitted the most
extensive bids in the on-going round of bidding in the
(Bangladesh's) gas sector, he disclosed, adding the bids envisage
an investment of 200 million US dollars from January 1998 for
exploration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Supporting Reforms in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
continue supporting the economic and political reforms in
Mongolia, a U.S. senior official said here.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Susan Shirk, who was on a visit to Mongolia
between November 12-14, made the remarks while meeting with
Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and Prime Minister
Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan.
</P>
<P>
She said that the United States was satisfied with the
development of relations and cooperation with Mongolia during the
past ten years after the two countries set up diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is also willing to cooperate with Mongolia in the
field of environmental protection, Susan added. She also revealed
that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would probably visit
the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan was grateful to the U.S. support for his country's
reforms and considered Susan's visit as a good beginning for the
U.S. delegation afterward.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the U.S. government attached
great importance to the strategic status of Mongolia, which led to
rapid development of the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
So far, Mongolia has received more than 70 million U.S. dollars
of economic and technological aid from the United States, and the
two sides had signed an agreement on military exchange and
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sees Surging Remittances from Overseas Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has expected remittances sent home from overseas
Filipino workers to surge to 5.7 billion U.S. dollars by the end
of this year, or 36 percent higher than the year-ago level of 4.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The higher inflow is seen to further strengthen the value of
the Philippine peso against the dollar and boost the country's
foreign reserves, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted
today as saying by local televisions.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the healthy stream of foreign exchange from
overseas workers as reported by local banks has been evident
especially during the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Central Bank's 5.7-billion-dollar estimate was
even more "conservative" than the projections of some banks, which
expected remittances to hit as much as 7 billion dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the peso is cited as a major incentive for
overseas workers to remit more funds to the country, Singson
explained.
</P>
<P>
Overseas workers are encouraged to send home more of their
dollar earnings because these would command higher purchasing
power when the peso is depreciating, he added.
</P>
<P>
Remittances from overseas workers usually peak during the last
quarter due to the onset of the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, the Philippines has more than
4.2 million contracted overseas workers and tens of thousands of
illegal workers. Most Filipino overseas workers are working in
North America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> SADC Urged to Set up Closer Security Liaison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has urged the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) to set up closer security liaison.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Thursday at the ministerial meeting of the
Inter-State Defense and Security Committee (ISDSC) that the SADC
intelligence community should set up "elaborate liaison networks"
to help forecast developments in the region that impinge on
security, Zambia's leading independent newspaper, The Post,
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba wondered how effective the intelligence system is as
an early warning mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Unless the intelligence community can come up with some
arrangements where serious developments threatening individual
member countries or the region as a whole are critically analyzed
and predicted, it will have abdicated its function and duty, said
the president.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting attended by defense ministers and
security officers from SADC members, Chiluba pointed out that
cross-border crimes, drug trafficking, syndicated car thefts,
money laundering and smuggling of weapons are still a source of
concern and pose a serious threat to stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also told the conference, which will close today, that
his government is in firm control of the country's situation
after last mndh's abortive military coup aiming at overthrowing
the elected government.

<HEADLINE> Blood Donations Decline in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Blood
Transfusion Service (NBTS) said blood collections in
the country declined by three percent this year.
</P>
<P>
NBTS Committee Chairman Justice George Smith Thursday told the annual
meeting in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, that the
service collected 74,269 units of blood this year compared with
77,269 units in 1996.
</P>
<P>
While more than 60 percent of the collections came from school
children, Smith said, the target group was shrinking as the age
at which children reached senior forms was dropping steadily.
</P>
<P>
"Recruiting new adult safe donors has been made difficult by
the AIDS pandemic which has greatly affected the adult
population," he said.
</P>
<P>
The service would launch a major public relations exercise next
year to recruit more adult donors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said the service managed to reduce HIV positivity rate
among donors from 1.55 percent the previous year to 1.18 percent
this year through careful donor selection and rigorous
pre-donation screening.

NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Smog from Indonesian
forest fires is spreading across the bay of Bengal and heading
towards India's southern coast, according to local press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this in Colombo on Thursday, the Sri Lankan
Meteorological Department also confirmed that the thin layer of
smoke reported over Colombo and other parts of the country for the
past few days was actually the smog from the Indonesian forest
fires.

The smoke could persist for some time, an official of the
department said, adding that the smog could have come from massive
forest fires reported in Indonesia a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, meteorological observers in Chennai, Tamil Nadu of

the fire broke out in the Indonesian forests in the end of

<HEADLINE> Security Council Rebukes Iraq's Uncompliance Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council tonight issued a presidential statement,
condemning Iraq again for its decision to expel American members
in U.N. arms inspection team in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Security Council "demands the immediate
and unequivocal revocation of this action which has prevented the
Special Commission from discharging its responsibilities under the
relevant resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The council voiced its support for the Special Commission and
the International Atomic Energy (IAEA) and stressed the importance
of ensuring the implementation of all aspects of their mandates.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has full responsibility for ensuring the safety and
security of the personnel and equipment of the Special Commission
and its inspection team, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed two sessions of Security Council
consultations which began this afternoon at the request of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to kick out the Americans in the
U.N. arms inspection team. Extensive diplomatic efforts have been
made to refrain from putting into effect the decision over the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Security Council's resolution on Wednesday
to condemn Iraq for its non-compliance with U.N. inspection
activities, Iraq ordered six Americans in the U.N. inspection
team to leave the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler announced today that
UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, will withdraw most of its arms
inspectors from Iraq on Friday.

<HEADLINE> European Ambassadors Back in Tehran, Ending Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors from 13 countries
of the European Union (EU) except ambassadors of Germany and
France returned here early this morning, putting an end to
the diplomatic crisis between Iran and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors arrived at 04:00 local times (GMT 00:30) after
the elapse of more than six months, but reporters here were not
allowed to interview them.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that the German and French envoys would
return to Tehran in a week, according to an agreement between
Iran and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Thursday announced that
Iran had agreed to the return of EU ambassadors to Tehran after
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos proposed that the
ambassadors of the European Union (EU) would return to Tehran in
two different phases, and German and French ambassadors return
after the arrival of the other European ambassadors to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU countries recalled their ambassadors last April in a
protest against Iran which had been charged by the Berlin court
that Iranian leaders had been involved in political assassinations
Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran later announced that the EU ambassadors could return to
Tehran on a condition that the German envoy must be the last to
do so, a formula which was rejected by Germany.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel made
a proposal for resuming talks between the EU countries and
Iran, which his Iranian counterpart Kharrazi gave an immediate
positive response.
</P>
<P>
The return of the EU ambassadors to Tehran was seen here as a
symbol of the EU's refusal to U.S. mounting sanctions against Iran
and it is believed that the EU countries would continue their
"critical dialogue" policy with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Bar Council Condemns US Extra-territorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Bar Council
said today Malaysia should rightly resist the United States'
proposal to investigate its company Petronas' business dealings as
the US has no extra-territorial jurisdiction to do so.
</P>
<P>
It is an established principle in international law that the
domestic legislation of a nation state could not have
extra-territorial jurisdiction to investigate, punish or sanction
persons who are not its nationals or corporations which are not
operating within its borders, its President Cyril Das said in a
statement today.
</P>
<P>
"The US government's proposal to probe Petronas is therefore a
negation of this rule of international law and should rightly be
resisted by our government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The probe is without basis or justification in international
law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Petronas together with Russia's Gazprom and France's Total SA
are involved in a 2 billion US dollar joint venture deal with Iran
to develop part of the country's giant South Pars gas field.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-EU Meeting Delayed over Myanmar Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Europe
Union (EU) has been postponed due to their differences over the
Myanmar issue, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the joint ASEAN-EU Cooperation Committee, which
is scheduled for next week in Bangkok, has been set to be
postponed due to the EU's insistence on refusal of Myanmar's
participation in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Saroj Chavanaviraj
Thursday said that the EU had informed Thailand of its stance
earlier this week, but ASEAN will uphold the principle of
non-discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently serves as the Asian side's coordinator with
the EU on the Asia-Europe cooperation within the framework of the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), which opened its first meeting in
Bangkok last year embracing the seven ASEAN member then plus
China, Japan, and South Korea as well as the 15 EU members.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, together with Laos, was admitted into ASEAN in July
this year, making ASEAN become a nine-member grouping, but the EU
has been pressing ASEAN not to allow Myanmar to participate in the
Asia-Europe conference due to Myanmar' domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
The EU reportedly has expressed regrets over the cancellation
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, senior ASEAN officials are likely to meet during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting to be held in Vancouver,
Canada later this month to discuss the matter, according to Wiboon
Kusakul, director of the Press Division under the Thai Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee could reopen in February next year if the
two sides bridge the gap, he added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Requests Return of U.S. Troops-Occupied Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean newspaper "Oriental
Daily News" Thursday issued an editorial, urging the Uninted
States to return its land occupied by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, issued as U.S. troops promised to return a
military exercise field in the north part of South Korea, said
U.S. troops' land occupation had caused great losses to local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Due to the South Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement sign
between Seoul and Washington in 1966, the residents failed to
receive any proper compensation although they had kept appealing
to competent authorities, complained the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, only the U.S. troops have the power to
make decision on the issue of whether and when to return the
occupied land.
</P>
<P>
U.S troops have withdrawn completely from their military bases
in the Philippines in 1992 and Japan has carried out head-to-head
bargains with the United States over the same issue, the editorial
pointed out. South Korea, however, has not worked out measures to
resolve such issues.
</P>
<P>
Despite many times of negotiations, a military base within the
capital city of Seoul has not yet been reverted to South Korea,
the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
The land occupied by U.S. troops totals 140 million
square meters, valued at more than 10 trillion won (about 10.5
billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> India Agrees to Remove Restrictions on Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- India has averted a
potentially damaging trade row in the World Trade Organization
(WTO) with the European Union (EU) by agreeing on a mutually
acceptable timetable for phasing out its quantitative restrictions
on imports.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, the agreement was
reached on Wednesday in Geneva in WTO consultations.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, India will eliminate its so-called
quantitative restrictions on imports over six years in phases of
three, two and one years.
</P>
<P>
Some products of interest to the EU have been advanced from
later phases to an earlier period. However, sensitive agricultural
and textile products and bulk imports of industrial products are
to remain in the last one-year phase.
</P>
<P>
Indian Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah has expressed
satisfaction at the conclusion of these negotiations, saying that
"both sides have shown necessary flexibility and both sides have
benefited."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for trade
issues, has said that "the settlement confirms the strength of
EU-India relations and the ability of the WTO to find satisfactory
solutions to trade disputes."
</P>
<P>
The EU, with some trading partners, had requested formal
consultations over India's removal of quantitative restrictions on
imports under the WTO dispute settlement procedure on July 18.
</P>
<P>
The EU is India's main trading partner. It is estimated that
the EU absorbs more than a quarter of India's exports and supplies
approximately the same proportion of its imports.

<HEADLINE> World Diabetes Day Observed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Diabetes Day, which
falls on today, is observed in Bangladesh aimed at sharpening
people's awareness to curb diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The official number of registered diabetic patients in the
country now stands at nearly 250,000, but the actual number is
estimated at about 2.40 million, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The observance program charted by the Diabetic Association of
Bangladesh included a rally, a seminar, and performing of
operations and free treatment to the patients by the specialist
doctors in one area.
</P>
<P>
The estimated prevalence of diabetes in Bangladesh is around
four percent which is similar to the average prevalence in many
other countries, according the organizers of the observance
activities.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) in
Bangladesh varies between 7.5 percent and 13 percent depending on
urban and rural backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
However, the organizers observed that 84 percent of the
country's 120 million people are ignorant about diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The rapid urbanization, habit of taking rich food and
environmental pollution are also the causes of increasing
diabetes, the organizers said.

SHANGHAI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- An antique-model sightseeing
bus developed by a Shanghai car manufacturer has proved to be a
success.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Shanghai Passenger Bus Manufacturing Factory has
received orders for over 100 of the old-style buses.

The company introduced two of the vehicles on a trial basis in
October 1996, offering customers free trips to tour Shanghai.

When a Hong Kong advertising company saw the bus by chance, it
was immediately interested in using the vehicle as an advertising

Chengdu.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges APEC to Discuss Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
urged the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to discuss the
current financial crisis in Asia at its meeting to be held in
Vancouver, Canada, later this month.
</P>
<P>
United States Coordinator for APEC John S. Wolf told a press
conference here that deliberation on the crisis is one of six
goals Washington is pursuing in the run-up to the APEC leaders'
meeting in the west Canadian city.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled for November 24-25, will be the fifth
since the organization was set up in 1989. It now groups 18
countries and regions including the United States.
</P>
<P>
The situation has changed for APEC this year because of the
financial crisis which hit Thailand and several other Asian
countries, Wolf noted.
</P>
<P>
"This year, if we are to continue building the kind of Pacific
community envisioned at Blake Island, APEC leaders in Vancouver
will have to deal with today's immediate issues -- issues related
to how the region's economies can adjust to their recent economic
difficulties, pursue necessary reform, and get back on the path to
strong, sustainable economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blake Island was the site of the first APEC leaders' meeting in
1993, where a shared desire was expressed for regional economic
and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wolf rebuffed an allegation that the United States and
developed countries actually welcome the current financial crisis
in Asia. "Nothing could be more wrong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of U.S. companies are involved in the region and
millions of American jobs depend on Asia's well-being, he said.
"When Asia hurts, we hurt too."
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, the East Asian and Pacific region has
surpassed Western Europe to become the largest regional trading
partner of the United States, both as a supplier of U.S. imports
and as a market for its exports. According to figures from the
State Department lately, U.S. trade with the region amounted to
roughly 68 percent of U.S. trade with the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Japanese proposal to set up an Asian fund,
the U.S. official believed that proper and sound policies were
more important than resources.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese proposal was echoed positively by some regional
countries, but Washington so far is reluctant to throw its weight
behind it.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it is pushing for identifying sectors for Early
Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization, clearing the trade underbrush,
building support for President Bill Clinton's Electronic Commerce
initiative, dealing with climate change and the environment and
enforcing individual action plans.
</P>
<P>
Wolf said President Clinton will attend the Vancouver leaders'
meeting and make clear the U.S. policies. However, it is still
unclear what and how the world's largest developed country will
contribute to solving the current Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Washington was involved in support of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) program for Indonesia, but the policy came
under criticism at the Capitol Hill, with some congressmen trying
to add political color to it.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the leaders' meeting, senior officials representing
the 18 APEC economies will gather together to discuss relevant
problems. Ministerial meetings will also be held on November 21 to
22 to work on the agenda for the leaders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official hoped concrete outcomes would be achieved
through the APEC events. But he warned against the illusion that
all the regional problems could be settled at a single meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The rapid expansion of China's
foreign trade provides good opportunities for China and Yugoslavia
to engage in economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Sino-Yugoslav business seminar held here today,
Cui Yushan, vice-president of the China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade, said that bilateral economic and trade
relations have developed rapidly in recent years, but trade volume
between the two countries is still small -- a condition which is
out of sync with sound bilateral political ties.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that businesses in the two countries will have
more chances to cooperate on an even wider scope. He also briefed
Yugoslav businessmen on China's foreign trade situation.
</P>
<P>
The two business circles will further cooperate in the areas of
common investment, technology transfer and joint production, said
Milivoje Miletic, general manager of Yugoslavia's Viskoza Textile
company and a representative of Yugoslav businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, who is accompanying
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on a state visit to China,
together with Chinese Minister of Chemical Industry Gu Xiulian,
attended the signing ceremony of five cooperative agreements
between companies in the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Tank Leakage Causes Power Plant Fire in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Defense
Ministry has confirmed that a fire at a thermal power plant in
Colombo this morning was caused by a fuel tank leakage.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a news release that the fire broke out at
around 5 o'clock local time due to a fuel tank leakage. It said
the fire was brought under complete control within about 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The ministry asked the public to cooperate by keeping away from
the area until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Though the military denied there was any LTTE background behind
the incident, speculations are still high that the fire was a
sabotage action by the rebel organization.
</P>
<P>
A usually reliable source in Colombo said he heard sounds of
explosions at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire at the biggest thermal power plant of Sri Lanka
coincided with the traditional Full Moon Day of the country, which
easily led people to associate it with a bomb blast in the
business center of Colombo on October 15, also a Full Moon Day.
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack, which was blamed on the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), killed 18 people and injured more than 100
others.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the power plant was not available yet.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Thursday completed the last piece of the federal
budget with its approval of more than 32 billion dollars to keep
the Commerce, Justice and State departments running.
</P>
<P>
The Senate earlier Thursday took advance action to "deem" that
bill approved upon the House's approval, enabling senators to beat
their House colleagues out of the Capitol to begin a two-month
congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
The House's 282-110 vote on the spending bill capped a drive by
Congress, including a rare weekend session, to resolve partisan
disputes that have defied resolution for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
Congress members began the week after a weekend fight lasting
several hours before daybreak Monday over President Bill Clinton's
fast-track trade bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill's failure delivered a political blow to Clinton and
setting Republican and Democrats to a renewed round of squabbling.
</P>
<P>
After a brief respite for Veterans Day, congressional leaders
set about cutting the deals necessary to finish the budget, using
the promise of a two-month recess to secure cooperation and quick
solutions to previously intractable disagreements.
</P>
<P>
The House's vote Thursday completed the last of the 13 spending
bills which was actually due on October 1, when the new fiscal
year began.

<HEADLINE> Mafia Superboss Responsible for 1978 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Mafia superboss, Gaetano
(Tano) Badalamenti, now serving 45 years in a United States jail,
has been named as the murderer of an Italian leftwing activist 20
years ago by Palermo prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
After Giuseppe Impastato was found blown to bits on a rail line
on May 9, 1978, suspicion soon fell on Badalamenti, who had been
the victim of a campaign on Impastato's leftwing radio talkshow in
Badalamenti's fiefdom of Cinisi, near Palermo.
</P>
<P>
Though a relative of Badalamenti's, Impastato showed little or
no respect for the don, making fun of him as "Tano Seduto", a play
on Toro Seduto which means sitting bull.
</P>
<P>
Investigating magistrates had suspected that the activist had
been murdered and then placed on top of the bomb to make it look
as if he had been engaged in a terrorist activity. But lack of
evidence forced the case to be closed with no conclusion.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the new wave of Mafia informants, Salvatore
Palazzolo, came forward two years ago with testimony which enabled
investigators to re-open the case.
</P>
<P>
A warrant has been issued for the Mafia superboss in connection
with the murder, and it will served to him in his New Jersey jail
cell.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old don was arrested in Madrid in 1984.

ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy is actively working to help
bring Croatia closer to the European Union (EU), Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini told his Croatian counterpart, Mate Granic,
today.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Zagreb must be fully aware that becoming a working
member of the EU will mean adopting a host of European rules and
standards.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of a series of agreements on social and
migratory questions has bolstered bilateral relations, while Italy
continues to pay great attention to "questions which still need to
be resolved regarding schooling for the Italian minority" in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The agreements signed include an accord which abolishes the
need for Croatians to produce passports when entering Italy, and a
treaty for protecting minorities.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stressed the need to ratify a friendship and
cooperation treaty between Italy and Croatia which will solve
problems inherited from the past.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the peace process in Bosnia, and said all
efforts must be made to fully apply the Dayton peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Launch Plan to Boost Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A plan to revitalize the rural
economy, injecting about 20 billion taka (446.43 million U.S.
dollars), is likely to be launched next month, a local newspaper
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The plan will have two broad components -- a traditional
agricultural credit and a new non-crop sector credit -- with an
ultimate aim to increase income of the rural poor, The Day Star
quoted sources from the Finance Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank -- Bangladesh Bank -- has already sanctioned
10 billion taka (22.32 million dollars) from its re-discount
window for non-crop income generation projects for the rural poor
to be disbursed through the Bangladesh Krishi Bank and the
Rajshahi Krishi Unnyan Bank, according to the sources. Meanwhile,
another 10 billion taka (22.32 million dollars) will be given for
the traditional agriculture credit program.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been taken at the initiative of Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, and the first meeting on the plan was held in Dhaka
Wednesday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we gave about 7.5 billion taka (167.41 million
dollars), and this year it will be increased to 10 billion taka in
line with the government's policy to support agricultural growth,"
the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Study Says Arctic is Warmest in 400 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures in the Arctic
this century have climbed to their highest levels in 400 years,
U.S. and Canadian scientists said today.
</P>
<P>
Between 1840 and 1950, the Arctic warmed an average of 1.5
degrees Celsius because of natural forces and the accumulation of
heat-trapping pollution in the atmosphere, the scientists said in
a study published in this week's issue of Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
The temperature change is higher than experienced by the
northern hemisphere as a whole, and has been enough to lead to
melting glaciers and sea ice and thawing permafrost, said the
study.
</P>
<P>
The five-year effort to study the Arctic's climate, funded by
the National Science Foundation and with support from Canada, was
the first to attempt a multi-century analysis.
</P>
<P>
Half of the post-1840 warming took place by 1920, before the
carbon gas buildup, and was likely to have been caused by natural
variations such as increased solar irradiance and decreased
volcanic activity, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
After 1920, the gas concentration might have played a dominant
role, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures peaked in 1945, then cooled somewhat from 1950 to
1970 by the effects of aerosol products which were eventually
phased out because they also depleted the Earth's protective ozone
later.
</P>
<P>
The concentration of carbon gases is projected more than
double, from the pre-industrial age's 270 parts per million to 600
parts per million, by the middle of next century.
</P>
<P>
Scientists fear that serious consequences will follow and
ecosystems will be severely damaged by this change.
</P>
<P>
World leaders will meet in Japan later this year to sign a
treaty to combat the emissions of greenhouse gases which cause the
planet to warm.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Resists Pact on Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will not support a
plan by the United States to liberalize the electronic commerce
sector by July 1 next year, according to the Business Economic
Department.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would make its position clear at the APEC leaders'
meeting to be held in Vancouver, Canada later this month, the
department's Director-General Karun Kittisataporn was quoted today
by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Washington has called on APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation) economies to support the plan before it is forwarded
to the World Trade Organization for approval.
</P>
<P>
It has pushed for freer trade in electronic commerce, including
financial aspects such as customs duties and taxation.
</P>
<P>
The United States says electronic commerce, which is being
driven by the Internet revolution, is going to be the new trade
model for the 21st century. Electronic trade is expanding
dramatically both indirectly (ordering tangible goods such as
electrical appliances through the Internet) and directly (on-line
delivery of intangible goods such as movies).
</P>
<P>
Karun said electronic commerce was a new and complicated sector
which developing countries would require more time to study.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Employees Backbone of Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese employees have become
the backbone of many foreign companies in China, with some
occupying high-ranking posts.
</P>
<P>
All of the employees in the Sodexim Sino-Belgian Trade Beijing
office are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Belgium provided government loans to China at the end of the
1970 -- the first country in the world to do so.
</P>
<P>
The first group of foreign investors came to China nearly two
decades ago when the country launched its reform and opening
up. At that time they only hired Chinese to be translators or
secretaries, and as business expanded, Chinese accountants and
managers were employed.
</P>
<P>
When Mobil Oil Company came to China it brought foreigners
along. However, the company is now sending more and more Chinese
abroad to work and study in its branches in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Siemens Ltd. China said they will increase their volume of
business to 10 billion US dollars, with employees surpassing
30,000 at the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
To do so, the company will lure large numbers of talented
Chinese and train them to meet the demands of the company.
</P>
<P>
Liu Tianjian, vice-president of the Foreign Enterprise Service
Corp. Beijing (FESC), said that the foreign companies want their
employees not only master a foreign language as a required skill,
but also to specialize in some areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, FESC has provided 4,000 foreign companies with 20,000
Chinese employees, many of whom are acting as the company's chief
representatives, senior engineers, consultants and managers.
</P>
<P>
Along with their companies, the Chinese employees participated
in some major projects in China, including the construction of the
Xichang Satellite-Launching Center and the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
The foreign companies have opened training classes for their
Chinese employees. Universities in China have also offered new
courses including foreign languages, computer science, and
driver's education to increase the students' competitiveness in
the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, north China, has had a satisfactory grain harvest despite
a severe drought that could occur once every 40 years,.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices in Australia rose
only marginally at auctions this week, the Australian Council of
Wool Exporters said in its weekly wool market review.
</P>
<P>
"Auction prices effectively remained unchanged on average sales
in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle this week, giving the smallest
variation in week to week prices since the start of the season in
late July," the council said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The WI Eastern Market Indicator rose two Australian cents to
finish the week at 708 Australian cents (488 US cents) per kg
clean, while the Western Market Indicator gained one Australian
cent to close at 649 Australian cents (447 US cents) per kg
clean," the council said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100,964 bales were offered with 10 percent passed
in.
</P>
<P>
With three consecutive weeks of offerings close to, or in
excess of, 100,000 bales, prices have held up well under
prevailing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"With only 50,000 bales rostered for next week, it might be
assumed that there could be some upward pressure on prices," said
the council.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,793 bales were sold from the wool stockpile,
taking total sales so far this season to 176,253 bales and
reducing the stockpile to 1,389,888 bales.

JAKARTA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta Stock Exchange
composite price index fell by 11.693 points to the critical level
of 437.947 Thursday amid the liquidation process of some
commercial banks, brokers said today.
</P>
<P>
Share prices raced to lower due to reports that listed
companies were also seriously affected by the liquidated banks.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen insolvent private banks were closed by the government
on November 1 as part of the reform package which is supported by
23 billion US dollars in standby loans from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank
and other sources.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said that stock prices in the Jakarta Stock Exchange
had been very low after they had fallen by almost 40 percent since
early July.
</P>
<P>
As stock prices lost ground, the rupiah (the national currency)
weakened slightly in late trading Thursday despite earlier
intervention by the central bank, currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah was quoted at 3,400/3,430 against the US dollar
compared to an opening of 3,395/3,405 in the morning session.
</P>
<P>
The intervention, the amount of which was described by dealers
as "moderate", had helped strengthen the rupiah and stopped it
from breaching the psychological barrier of 3,400 in early
trading.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped by about 40 percent against
the American dollar this year after it was hit by the monetary
crisis in Southeast Asian region since early July.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Accused of Violating Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine opposition is
planning to file charges against the ruling Lakas-NUCD party for
holding a premature nominating convention to select its
presidential candidate in violation of the country's election law.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Struggle of Patriotic Filipino Masses
(SPFM) is studying the case it will file against the Lakas before
the Commission on Election (Comelec), Senate President and SPFM
Chairman Ernesto Maceda was quoted today by the local newspaper
Today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maceda said the so-called party consultations by the Lakas last
Sunday were already the start of the Lakas convention for
nominating presidential bet for the May 1998 general polls.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, he said, no political convention or
meeting for the nomination or selection of the official candidates
of any political party for president, vice president and senators
shall be held earlier than 165 days before the day of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Maceda said, nomination conventions could be held on
November 27 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The Lakas party, led by President Fidel Ramos, held the first
of its two-part consultation meetings on November 9 and will hold
the next one on November 16.
</P>
<P>
The result of the Lakas "consultations", however, will be known
only to Ramos, who will use this as a guide in choosing his
successor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But Senator Juan Flavier, a member of the administration
party's electoral committee, insisted that the November 9 and 16
party meetings could not be considered a convention.
</P>
<P>
Maceda's party decided earlier to defer its scheduled
nomination convention from November 27 to December or early
January next year to monitor the maneuvers of the ruling party and
learn from its mistakes in nominating candidates.

Recently the government has put goods from storage onto the

</P>
<P>
During the October presidential elections, the government paid
large amounts of overdue wages, raising fears of high inflation.

But economic officials ruled out this possibility, citing
promising economic prospects and the bumper harvest in Yugoslavia
this year.

<HEADLINE> Peugeot Leaves Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Peugeot recently backed out
of its joint automobile project in this port city in southern
China after 12 years of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The changing partner message of Guangzhou Automobile Group has
drawn the attention of many leading auto makers of the world. The
new partner will be named soon.
</P>
<P>
Peugeot set foot in China in 1985 when the joint venture,
Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company, was set up.
</P>
<P>
Locally-made Peugeots were once very popular in China, the
company's largest annual outpout reached 20,000.
</P>
<P>
The downturn came in 1994, and by 1996 the annual production of
Peugeots was only 2,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, similar projects in other parts of China were
booming. For instance, Shanghai Santana, a Volkswagon investment,
had gained an annual production capacity of 300,000 Santanas, with
yearly output reaching 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the failure of Guangzhou Peugeot to the
short-sightedness of the Chinese and French partners.
</P>
<P>
The 22 percent share Peugeot had in the business was only in
the form of technological transfer rather than capital
investment. The car models it provided were developed in the
1970s, and were no long on assembly lines elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the huge Chinese auto market, Guangzhou Peugeot
had a very small production ability, turning out only 90,000 cars
in the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two partners on the future of the
joint venture started five years ago without reaching agreement.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation of the new project is expected to conclude
soon.

ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Former NBA star Dominique Wilkins
paced Group D favourite TeamSystem Bologna for a nailbiting win of
77-75 over Cibona Zagreb in the men's basketball EuroLeague on

leaving the Croats one point adrift with 32 seconds left.

MEXICO CITY, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's private foreign

</P>
<P>
Of the total foreign debt, 64.1 percent is owed by public
sectors and 29.5 percent by the private sector.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Limit Car Parts Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
impose restrictions on imports by the country's car assemblers and
dealers in a bid to slow down the slump in the local auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
In a report published today, the country's Board of Investments
(BOI) said the new rule is designed to soften the impact of the
regional currency crisis and of increasing production costs and
dropping demand on cars.
</P>
<P>
The BOI said it will require local auto assemblers to
"voluntarily" refrain from importing auto components that can be
produced by local parts makers.
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions were approved recently by the BOI
governing board as part of its action agenda to arrest the auto
industry's fall.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car sales have been on a downtrend since early this
year but the slump became worse after the July 11 de facto
devaluation of the Philippine peso, followed by surging interest
rates which have slackened the demand for cars.
</P>
<P>
According to the local car industry, sales went down by 10.7
percent in the first 10 months of the year. For October alone, car
sales slumped nearly 40 percent from the year-ago level.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan fire fighters have
put off a fire at Colombo's Kalanitissa Thermal Power Station, and
no one was killed or injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
Four ambulances have left the scene while police took in two
sniffer dogs to detect possible bombs inside the compound.
Additional security personnel were deployed around the station,
the biggest thermal power station in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Police had sealed off several roads around the power station
and later opened one major road from Colombo to Kandy in the
central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
They said there were no casualties as this fire raged the
station at around 5:00 this morning. Other reports said an oil
tank caught fire at about 4:30 am.
</P>
<P>
The incident coincided with the traditional Full Moon Day of
Sri Lanka, which easily led people to associate it with last
month's bomb blast in the center of the capital.
</P>
<P>
A truck bomb exploded in the Fort area of the city on October
15, also a Full Moon Day, killing 18 people and injuring over 100
others.
</P>
<P>
An officer at the Operational Headquarters of the Defense
Ministry said security forces are doing search and clear
operations at the station.
</P>
<P>
He said the possible cause of the fire was a tank leakage and
denied there was any LTTE background behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
Last month's bombing attack was blamed on the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has been fighting for a separate
state of their own in the north and east of the country since
1983.

<HEADLINE> China Clearing Up Foreign-Funded Retail Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting an
official check-up of all non-experimental commercial businesses
involving foreign investment, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The action comes at a time when China tries to ensure better
results of the official experiment in foreign-funding and better
open the sector to the outside world, said a government official.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has issued a circular on clearing and
reorganizing non-experimental commercial businesses with foreign
investments for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the State Council issued an urgent notice to
local governments to immediately stop examinations and approvals
for establishing foreign-funded commercial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The check-up covers all department, chain and warehouse stores;
commodity distribution centers and postal sales businesses that
involve foreign investment in various forms, for example, joint
ventures, co-operation, solely foreign funds, entrust management,
leasing, contracting or other flexing means of management that
were approved by local government before the notice was issued.
</P>
<P>
The check-up also involves branch shops of experimental
foreign-funded enterprises that have been set up without the
approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that the check-up should be conducted in line
with the State Council's 1992 decision on the issue of using
foreign investment in the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
The clear-up is examining on all parties to share-holdings,
contract clauses, business scope, management methods,
technological transfer and present technical deduction percentage,
the current status of businesses and annual official industrial
and commercial inspection records.
</P>
<P>
Those foreign-funded commercial enterprises that are not
included in the list of the State's experimental scheme and are
found to have resorted to deception will be closed and the people
involved, including concerned leaders will be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
The clearing up drive, to be implemented by the end of this
year, will not affect those foreign-funded experimental commercial
enterprises approved by the State Council.

</P>
<P>
Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets, who was named the Most
Valuable Player of the 1997 NBA All-Star Game after leading the
East to a 132-120 win over the West, is one of seven former
All-Star Game MVPs on this year's ballot.
</P>
<P>
He is joined by Chicago's Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen,
Sacramento's Mitch Richmond, Houston's Charles Barkley, Utah's
Karl Malone and John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
Three rookies are on the 1998 All-Star ballot. They are Tim
Duncan of San Antonio, Keith Van Horn of New Jersey and Antonio
Daniels of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"The NBA All-Star Game is one of the premier events on the
world's sports calender," said NBA commissioner David Stern, "We
are delighted that millions of fans around the world will have the
opportunity to select their favorite players for the starting
lineups."
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 players, 50 each from the Eastern and Western
Conferences, are listed on the 1998 NBA All-Star ballot, with 20
guards, 20 forwards and 10 centers from each conference. The
ballots were selected by a panel of media experts who regularly
cover the NBA.
</P>
<P>

After the fan voting is completed and the starters are
announced, the head coaches in each conference will vote to
determine the remaining All-Stars for their respective conferences.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 NBA All-Star voting program broke the record for

total of 8,879,330 ballots surpassed the 6,466,259 ballots cast
for the 1996 NBA All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Michael Jordan became the first player in NBA history
to receive more than 2,000,000 votes in one season and led all

GUANGZHOU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital of
south China's Guangdong province, has established organic food
bases and is working out effective measures to develop markets at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The food is produced under strict national hygiene
standards. Fine-quality lotus root, soya bean, sweet corn, and
banana bases have been set up on the city's outskirts, and many
vegetables and foods like litchis are sold on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The exports of organic food have improved the city's
agriculture and have become a new means of helping the rural
economy. The city had 13.94 billion yuan (1.74 billion
U.S. dollars) in agricultural output in 1996 and built ten large
flower, fowl, cow, and pig bases.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it used 300 million U.S. dollars in foreign
investment last year alone and began 120 projects for the "three
high" agriculture program (high-yield, high-quality,
high-efficiency). The city then added organic food to its
"vegetable basket" and "three high" projects.

<P>
CARACAS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- About 80,000 Venezuelan oil
workers staged a 12-hour strike starting from 06:00 a.m. today in
demand of a collective bargaining contract.
</P>
<P>
The strikers are mainly from to the state company Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) and its surrogate companies.
</P>
<P>
They launched the strike because negotiations between the union
and PDVSA were suspended after PDVSA representatives failed to
answer a series of controversial clauses, including those on
minimum salary, retirement, overtime payment and house building,
sources from the strikers said.
</P>
<P>
However, PDVSA president Luis Giusti, considering the strike
illegal, said it was unacceptable and contradictory for the oil
workers to take to the street for 12 hours in the middle of the
negotiations to cause serious damage to the country's economy.

CHANGSHA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China's restructuring of its
industry and increasing state-owned enterprise reforms have meant
an increasing number of redundant women workers.
</P>
<P>
To help these people get new jobs, the government has increased
efforts to help them with job selections and has provided training
in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xuezheng, 33, who lost her job at a tin plant in China's

sq.m. hotel with more than 125,000 US dollars in assets.
</P>
<P>
When Tang lost her job she took to selling clothing and working
in hotels, and said her success is the result of strenuous efforts
but also some support from the government, which has helped
surplus workers like her get licenses, and water and electricity
for their businesses.
</P>

A story in the magazine 'Chinese Women' that told of a
redundant woman worker getting better off through her own efforts
helped Peng Jianying who had been jobless for several years. She

<HEADLINE> Beijing Completing Census on Migrant Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The first census of migrants
in Beijing is finishing up over the weekend as planned, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The official one-by-one count of those who are not permanent
city residents is the first of its kind in China. Started on
November 1st, it ended on last.
</P>
<P>
Results of the census, including the total number,
distribution, education and working conditions of the transient
population, will be made public by the end of this year, said Gu
Yanzhou, vice-director of the migrant census office, who is also
vice-director of Beijing Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The outcome will offer a Scientific basis for revising policies
on Beijing's transient population next year. The new regulations
promise stricter control and better service, Gu disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicates that approximately 40 percent of the
out-of-town workers are engaged in construction. The rest of them
are serving as security guards, baby sitters and
vendors. One-third of retail sales are conducted by non-Beijing
natives.
</P>
<P>
Stories have been seen in local newspapers about the transient
workers who have done a lot of urban construction and facilitated
people's lives. Complaints have also been received about migrants
cramming the already crowded city and contributing to the crime
rate.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has witnessed an increasing army of migrant workers
since the 1980s, when China's peasants were becoming less firmly
tied to the land and many felt they didn't have that much farming
work due to mechanization.

<HEADLINE> More Funds Given to Children in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- School children in poor and
remote areas of China are to get additional help for their studies
in primary and middle schools, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and the State Education Commission
(SEC) have decided to allocate 130 million yuan ($ 15.6 million)
to spread compulsory education in poverty-stricken areas in the
next few years, SEC announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The allocation will be made to the 592 poor counties in
poverty-stricken and ethnic-minority areas listed by the State in
1996 as key targets for the spread of compulsory education over
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used mainly to aid hard-up students pay
tuition fees and buy textbooks. Students who live far away and
board in schools can also obtain subsidies, said an SEC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
This central allocation is expected to help more than 600,000
school drop-outs return to their classrooms, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The SEC and the Ministry of Finance have also jointly issued a
regulation to help ensure an efficient use of the allocation.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, school authorities are required to
publish the name of students who get help from the funds and the
sum of money received. This aims to ensure a fair funding system
under public supervision.
</P>
<P>
About one million children in poor and remote areas have had to
quit school over the past few years due to lack of finances.
</P>
<P>
Some poor children cannot even start school as they are unable
to afford tuition and other study charges.
</P>
<P>
The State initiated a project to spread compulsory education in
late 1995, targeting 592 poor counties across the country.
</P>
<P>
The project has cost more than 10 billion yuan ($ 1.2 billion),
the largest educational program expenditure of government money
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

<HEADLINE> Helsinki, Lillehammer May Join Hands in Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish capital Helsinki and
Norway's Lillehammer are considering a joint bid for the 2006
Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Helsinki deeply wants to bring the games home while Lillehammer
can hardly host one more Olympics alone after staging it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
There comes a proposal for a joint bid. "Basically, everything
is ready and we have great cooperation between two real winter
sports countries," Tapani Ilkka, president of Finland's National
Olympic Committee, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal upset some in Sweden, which lies between Norway
and Finland and is eager too to have its own Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The geographic distance between Finland and Lillehammer makes
this a bad proposal," said Jens Nilsen, mayor of Oestersund,
Sweden, which has bid for the Winter Games nine times.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Charter allows for the Winter Games to be held in
more than one country, an idea that has been encouraged by IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
Possible candidates for the 2006 Olympics include Oestersund;
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Zakopane, Poland; Jaca, Spain; Sion,
Switzerland; Salzburg or Kitzbuehel, Austria; and a bid linking
the Carinthia region of Austria with the Italian regions of Friuli
and Veneto.

The more fancied American was overwhelmed by the sixth-ranked
Russian 6-3, 6-0 in less than one hour and must now beat Swede
Jonas Bjorkman for a place in the semifinals.

<P>
The tournament attracts the top eight players in the world,
split into two groups. The top two from each group reach the

Chang and Bjorkman are both 1-1 and will battle it out Friday
for the second semifinal spot from their White Group.
</P>
<P>
Greg Rusedski, ranked fifth in the world, pulled out of the
event because of a right hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, the first British player to qualify for the
season-ending event, will be replaced by alternate Thomas Muster.
</P>
<P>
The Briton had lost his first two matches in the Red Group,
which also comprises top-ranked Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter,
both of whom had a day off Thursday.
</P>

KUNMING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China attracted 31.5 billion
U.S. dollars in overseas funds in the first nine months of the
year, up 6.35 percent from the same period of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno began a preliminary investigation into allegations against
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt Thursday, a move that could lead
to the appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
The 90-day investigation will focus on whether Babbitt denied a
casino license to three Wisconsin Indian tribes for political
reasons. At the end of the investigation, Reno must either drop
the case for lack of evidence, ask a three-judge panel for an
extension or ask the panel to appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
In a brief filing with the judges' panel today, Reno said, "I
hereby notify the Special Division of the Court that on this date
I commenced a preliminary investigation...involving Secretary of
the Interior Bruce Edward Babbitt."
</P>
<P>
The panel gave Reno permission to make the investigation
public.
</P>
<P>
The task force is looking into allegations that Babbitt refused
to let the Wisconsin tribes apply for casino rights, despite a
recommendation from the Bureau of Indian Affairs that he do so,
because rival tribes in Minnesota had contributed large sums to
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Three other ongoing preliminary investigations under the
independent counsel statute are set to end December 2, including
probes into White House phone calls made by President Bill Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether calls made from federal property to
contributors elsewhere violates a ban on raising campaign funds on
federal property.

ATHENS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek scientists warned today
that there would be nationwide desertification unless water
wastage was curtailed and reservoirs were built to collect
rainwater.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the northern Greek port city
of Thessaloniki ahead of a hydro-geological conference to be held
on Friday, professor George Soulios said that scientists were
worried over Greece's dwindling subterranean water resources.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of Greece's water sources had either dried up
or fallen below the half-way mark, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the long-term, he said, this could lead to land corrosion in
extensive geographic regions throughout the country.

BONN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament today
passed a bill to close a legal loophole under which Nazi war
criminals have been able to draw pension benefits for injuries
sustained in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, former members of the notorious elite corps
of the German Nazi party, known as the SS, can be stripped of
their pensions for war injures if they have been proved to have
joined the SS voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The new law came after international protests over allegations
that pensions of up to 2,000 U.S. dollars a month was still being
paid to former SS members who had been accused and convicted of
war atrocities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Rate Shoots Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Productivity at U.S.
workplaces shot up in the third quarter at the fastest pace in
five years, easing fears that labor shortages could lead to
renewed inflation, the Labor Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Productivity surged at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the
three months from July through September, helping to push unit
labor costs down 0.3 percent, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The growth in nonfarm productivity, output per number of hours
worked, was the fastest since a 5.9 percent jump during the final
three months of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Productivity is considered the key to Americans' standard of
living since greater efficiency means businesses can increase
wages without raising prices as workers produce more with the same
amount of work.
</P>
<P>
The drop in labor costs, typically two-thirds of the price of a
product, was the first since April-June 1994.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that huge investments in computers and other
high-tech equipment have put the economy on the threshold of what
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said would be a "once
or twice in a century" leap in productivity.
</P>
<P>
Others, however, contend much of the price containment is due
to temporary factors, such as a strong dollar that holds down the
cost of imported goods and depressed benefit costs from the switch
to managed health-care plans.

CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Cairo has launched a campaign to
refurbish its historic kinship with other African states and
reassert its commitment to the continent.
</P>
<P>
A number of decisions toward this aim were made by the Egyptian
Cabinet at its meeting today under Prime Minister Kamal el

It will help the Rwanda Republic and Democratic Congo Republic
(Zaire) in the fields of mining, technical assistance, building
and construction, and food and in projects of electrical linkage.

<P>
To promote inter-African trade, Egypt will set up centers of
assembly industries in some African countries to complete
semi-manufactured Egyptian goods such as medicines, aluminium,
clothes and leather products to re-export them to other countries
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
It also intends to reduce the expense of shipping Egyptian
goods to African countries so that they may reach African
consumers at reasonable prices.

to, and increasing the number of scholarships for, African
students in all Egyptian colleges and faculties.
</P>
<P>

technical and technological advise to African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet will continue to discuss the issue of strengthening
Egyptian-African relations at its coming meetings in order to
adopt necessary decisions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, situated in the northeast of the Africa continent, has
commonly associated with the Middle East region and identified
itself with the Arab world.

Addressing a meeting of British Members of Parliament this

Iran would become self-sufficient and would be able to create those
missiles on its own."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed if the Russians stopped providing the
technology, then the Iranian missile program would be set back by
many years.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that Russia receives appeals from all
members of the international community because we are all at risk,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Expels Americans on UN Inspection Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq carried out today its
decision to expel the six Americans working for the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
The Americans, five weapons inspectors and a logistics fellow,
left Iraq for Jordan by car before 11 p.m. local time (1900 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told local
television that the Revolutionary Command Council of Iraq decided
this afternoon to implement the expulsion order, and demanded that
the Americans leave Iraq before 11 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
He said the execution of the order is Iraq's response to the
Resolution 1134 adopted by the U.N. Security Council Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to kick out the Americans on the
U.N. arms inspection teams. It refrained from putting into effect
the order pending extensive diplomatic efforts over the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of controlling the U.N. inspection mission
and deliberately finding faults with Iraq in order to prolong the
crushing U.N. sanctions imposed on it since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf stressed that it is this fact that prompts Iraq to
expel the Americans - five weapons inspectors and a logistics.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq has the right to determine the nationality of
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the UNSCOM Richard Butler has decided to withdraw
all the U.N. arms inspectors from Iraq Friday. The U.N. personnel
will not return to Baghdad until the current crisis is defused.
</P>
<P>
Butler had requested Iraq to postpone its expulsion order until
Friday for the Americans to leave on board the same plane with the
other inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM oversees the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction and will certify Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions before the sanctions can be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Says Confident in Doha Meeting's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Qatari official said
here today that his country has confidence in achieving success in
the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference due to begin
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdulla al-Mahmoud, Qatari minister of state for foreign
affairs, made the remark at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far eight Arab countries, including Kuwait,
Oman, Yemen, Jordan, Tunisia, Sudan, Mauritania and Comoros, have
decided to participate in the three-day conference.
</P>
<P>
He expected the number of Arab countries to be present at the
meeting to reach 10, even 12 eventually.
</P>
<P>
At present, 850 participants from 61 countries are to take part
in the conference, and this figure has already outnumbered Qatar's
expectations, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
About 35 Israeli government officials and 33 businessmen will
turn up at the conference, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The November 16-18 controversial conference in Doha, capital of
Qatar, has split the Arab world. Previous reports indicated 17 out
of the 22 members of the Arab League decided to boycott the
gathering for lack of tangible progress in the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks came to a standstill since
Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The annual conference, which has been held in Morocco, Jordan
and Egypt, was initiated in 1991 with the aim of integrating
Israel into the regional economy.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Promises Campaign Finance Bill Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of
the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday promised to have
votes on campaign finance reform on the House floor by next March.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, joined at a news conference by a dozen House
Republicans, said the final shape of that legislation is unclear,
but "We are committed to reviewing all the aspects of the election
process."
</P>
<P>
Democrats have been demanding all year a vote on legislation to
overhaul campaign finance law, but Republicans said that the first
priority was to investigate past violations of the law,
concentrating on Democratic practices during the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans have listed nine principles that they say must
go into campaign finance legislation, including that unions no
longer be able to deduct from workers' paychecks for political
donations without their approval.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have objected to the Republican targeting of unions,
and Gingrich said there was a question whether Democratic leaders
"have the nerve to buck the labor unions."
</P>
<P>
Also listed are how to stop illegal foreign payments, how to
deal with unregulated "soft" money donations from corporations and
unions; spending by "issue advocacy" groups for specific
candidates; and attempts by millionaire candidates to buy
elections.

<HEADLINE> Iran Agrees to Return of European Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has agreed to the return
of ambassadors of the European countries to Tehran after an
elapse of more than six months, a senior Iranian official
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying that Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi has given Iran's consent to the proposal
of Luxembourg about the arrangement for the return of the European
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that the European envoys, except
German and French ambassadors, would arrive in Tehran on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran's decision was in response to the
efforts of many European countries to resolve the issue and the
positive developments in the positions of those countries towards
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister of Luxembourg Jacques Poos has reportedly
proposed that the ambassadors of the European Union (EU) return to
Tehran in two phases, and German and French ambassadors return
after the arrival of all other European ambassadors to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Poos, whose country is holding the rotating presidency of the
European Union, made the proposal to Kharrazi through telephone,
IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine had told Kharrazi that
the French and German ambassadors together would be the last to be
back in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen EU countries called back their ambassadors from Tehran
last April in protest after a Berlin court ruled that Iranian
leaders were involved in a political assassination of Kurdish
opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran later announced that the EU ambassadors could return to
Tehran but the German envoy must be the last to do so, a formula
seen by Bonn as an attempt to undermine EU's solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel made
a proposal for resuming talks between the EU countries and Iran,
to which Kharrazi gave a prompt positive response.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted the recent decision of the French oil
company Total to cooperate with Iran in defiance of U.S. pressure
contributed to Iran's quick consent to the return of the European
ambassadors to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Differences still exist between Iran and the EU over a number
of issues, such as Iran's alleged support for international
terrorism, its opposition to the Middle East peace process and its
arms development programs, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, they believe that the EU countries would continue
their "critical dialogues" with Iran with the return their
ambassadors.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says U.S. Should Support Asian Rescue Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today the Southeast Asian financial
chaos would have only a "modest" impact on the U.S. economy, but
the U.S. must help international rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Both Greenspan and U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers told the House Banking Committee today the United States
must do its part to support international rescue packages to
stabilize Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said it is in America's own self-interest to prevent
the Asian "contagion effect" from roiling financial markets around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Although the two officials agreed that the financial crisis in
Asia have small impact on the U.S. economy so far, both officials
cited the depressing effect on U.S. exports to the region as the
biggest likely impact.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted that U.S. exports to Thailand, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Malaysia, the four countries initially affected,
total about 4 percent of U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
He said that an additional 12 percent of U.S. exports last year
went to Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, where
markets also have been roiled in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The United States has announced it would provide 3 billion U.S.
dollars in back-up financing to support a 23 billion dollar rescue
effort by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Two months
earlier, the administration had refused to participate in a 17.5
billion dollars rescue package for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan and Summers said the United States is exploring ways
to provide temporary financial assistance, but Summers said the
Clinton administration believed that any support must be
controlled by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Both the Fed Chief and the Deputy Treasury Secretary believed
that the exposure of U.S. financial institutions in Thailand,
Indonesia and several other Asian countries is relatively small.
</P>
<P>
Summers said, "Our financial system is sufficiently robust, and
the total exposure of American financial institutions sufficiently
small, that we do not foresee significant risk to United States
financial institutions or to domestic financial stability."
</P>
<P>
However, Summers warned that continued U.S. economic health
"will depend heavily on stability being restored as soon as
possible" so as "to limit the risk of further contagion across
Asia and across other emerging markets."

<HEADLINE> Al-Assad: Syria Welcomes EU Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad said today that his country welcomed the role played by
the European Union (EU) in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while meeting with visiting Foreign Minister
of Luxembourg Jacques Poos, who is heading an European Union (EU)
delegation on a four-day Mideast tour starting on November 10.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Assad and Poos, whose country currently
holds the rotating presidency of the EU, discussed regional issues
and other topics of common concern, according to a spokesman of
the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Poos said that the EU hoped that peace can be
realized in the Middle East on the basis of the Madrid conference
and the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa
this afternoon, the Luxembourg foreign minister said that EU
believed a comprehensive and lasting peace cannot be achieved
unless Israel withdraws its troops from the occupied Golan Heights
in accordance with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Golan, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967
Mideast War, was the key issue to be tackled in Syrian-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation arrived here this afternoon after visit to
Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
