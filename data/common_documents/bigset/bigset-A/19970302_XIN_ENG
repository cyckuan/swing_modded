<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls For Faster Development in Central, Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today calls
for accelerating development in central and western China during
his meeting today with legislators from Gansu province and Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region, both in northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, Jiang came to join NPC
deputies from remote Gansu and Ningxia in their panel discussions
on the government work report, and on how to bridge the gap
between eastern and western China to achieve common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The deputies spoke highly of Premier Li Peng's government work
report, which they termed as a realistic and inspiring report
permeated with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Fifth and Sixth
Plenum of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these deputies aired views and suggested ways and
means on narrowing the gap between the eastern and western
regions, retooling of state-owned enterprises and ethnical unity.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the speeches of Ningxia deputies, Jiang said Ningxia
has made notable progress in economic development, because local
officials and the masses of people have kept taking as the
guidance Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
charac implemente the central authorities' political line,
principles and policies, and defined a road of development in
confmity with Ningia's conditions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the regional Party committees and
governments have always paid attention to correctly handling the
relations between reform, development and stability, and,
proceeding from the characteristics of local ethnic regions, made
special efforts in promoting ethnic unity and social stability,
which created a good social and political environment for leading
multi-ethnical people in all-out effort for economic development.
</P>
<P>
There do exist fairly big gaps between coastal areas in eastern
China and central and western regions, Jiang noted. With a vast
territory and varied conditions nationwide, China cannot achieve
synchronous development and prosperity in different regions.

<HEADLINE> 24th Arab Labor Conference Opens in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The 24th Arab Labor conference
opened here today at the Arab League (AL) headquarters, calling
for common strategy in tapping human resources to achieve social
development and stability in the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
Arab labor ministers, employers and employees from all the
Arab countries attended the week-long conference, held under the
auspices of Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
In the opening speech, al-Ganzouri underlined the importance
of Arab integration and cooperation in order to unify stances in
face of various challenges and social problems.
</P>
<P>
Calling labor and peace two cornerstones for realizing
development and stability, he also urged the Arab countries to
draw up mechanisms to develop Arab human resources.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating the conference, Esmat Abdul-Meguid,
secretary general of the 22-member AL, hailed the envisaged Arab
free trade zone as a first step on the road to realizing Arab
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The AL's economic council ratified last week the executive
program of the regional free trade zone which is to be
established in 1998. The exact boundary of the zone is yet to be
defined.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the link between development and labor in
pushing forward comprehensive development efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Human resources are one of the pillars of economic
development, which requires good preparation and adjustment in
order to cope with economic development needs," said the AL chief.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the conference, Director General of the Arab
Labor Organization Bakr Mahmoud Rasoul also stressed the
importance of establishing the Arab common market to boost Arab
solidarity and integration.
</P>
<P>
He said the current session is held at a time when the Arab
world is going through the "most critical stage" in light of
ongoing globalization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Rasoul said he will submit a report for deliberations at the
session on development, economic conditions in the Arab world,
development barriers and ways to upgrade vocational training and
create more jobs to the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank's estimates, Arab labor force has
reached around 80 million workers out of the region's total
population of over 200 million, with an unemployment rate of 14
percent. The Arab Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exceeded 502
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Faster Development in Central, Western China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some regions with better conditions may enjoy faster
development, which will in turn help the country to accumulate
funds and increase its economic strength, and help areas with
poorer conditions to speed up their development gradually, and
eventually to achieve common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Practice has shown that this strategist decision made Comrade
Deng Xiaoping is totally correct, which not only comply with the
law of economic development, but also fully reflect the
fundamental requirements of socialism, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that common prosperity for all the regions across
China cannot be achieved overnight, and it requires a process and
the joint efforts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its wide-ranged exchanges and cooperation with
Shanghai municipality, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi
provinces, Ningxia has achieved positive results.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the autonomous region will continue
such cooperations and promote common development and prosperity
through further opening-up by both sides and still closer
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is one of the five autonomous regions with ethnic
groups in China, he said, and it is of utmost importance to
enhance ethnic unity, safeguard social stability to promote
development in the national minorities region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that governments in ethnic regions must pay
much attention to doing a good job in handling the religious
issue. The Party's policies concerning religious affairs fully
respect and protect ethnic peoples' freedom for religious belief.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, religious activities must be conducted within
the limits as provided by the constitution and laws, and
administration of religious affairs should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
During its meeting the Gansu delegation, Jiang said Gansu has
scored new successes in reform and construction, in view of the
province's economic growth rate topping for the first time the
national average in 1996 and the accomplishment of its second-step
strategic goals.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Groups Withdraw from Key Zairean Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The first group of 26
international humanitarian groups working in Kisangani, the
capital of Upper Zaire which has served as the basis of
humanitarian aid for Rwandan refugees since late last year,
arrived here today on a plane.
</P>
<P>
The members of humanitarian aid groups said that all the Hutu
refugees have fled the refugee camp of Tingi-Tingi near the city,
as the rebel forces led by Laurent-Desire Kabila are reportedly
approaching the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairean government today denied the claim by the
rebels that Kindu, the capital of the Maniema province south of
Kisangani, has fallen and said that it is always controlled by the
government forces, the FAZ.
</P>
<P>
A communique of the Zairean Defense Ministry also denied that
Kisangani is under the threat of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
It said that the FAZ is reinforcing necessary forces to move
toward Kalima, a town 50 to 60 kilometers northwest of Kindu which
has fallen to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the FAZ has taken prisoner 50 Ugandans,
Rwandans and Zaireans in Bafwasende, some 200 kilometers east of
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
The rebel forces claimed that they are within 100 kilometers of
Kisangani.

<P>
Fairly big progress has been made in the work of pooling
efforts to help the needy to become better off and provide 1.22
million locals in Gansu with enough to eat and wear, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"The facts have once again proved that even if the existing
conditions were unfavorabvldevelopment will still be accelerated
provided that we adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and are guided by the
Party's basic lines, conscientiously carry out the central
authorities' principles and policies, and have formulated a
correct development strategy by combining the theory and basic
line with specific conditions in the region,"Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Gansu's agricultural basis is still weak,
and the livelihoods of its 3.75 million people are still below the
poverty line; quite a number of state-owned enterprises face
problems in operation; governments at various levels are still in
financial difficulties; and the infrastructure is relatively
backward.
</P>
<P>
He called for a high degree of attention paid to these
difficulties and problems, which should merit the attention from
all sectors so as to enhance people's confidence for further
progress.
</P>
<P>
The central government has set for the relevant policies in
support of central and western China, and will continue to its
aid.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang urged provincial and local governments to
further emancipate their mind, dare to explore, and work in a
down-to-earth way, so as to open up a new situation for Gansu's
development.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate economic development, the central and western
regions should deal with problem of lagging-behind infrastructure,
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He called on provincial and local governments to do overall
planning with emphasis to be placed on major issues to improve the
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Jiang voiced his wish that both cadres and the people in
Ningxia and Gansu will do a still better job of reform and
opening, and modernization, and greet the convocation of the 15th
CPC National Congress with concrete deeds and new achievements.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's FUNCINPEC Deplores CPP's Boycott to United Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phnom Penh, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's FUNCINPEC Party said
today that it felt regretful for the boycott by the Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) to the political platform of the newly formed
National United Front (NUF).
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued to the press, the FUNCINPEC Party said
it was "very regretful for the total rejection by the CPP to the
NUF platform which covers a lot of vital issues such as the state
of law, the neutrality of the administration, the national
sovereignty and integrity and illegal immigration."
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the FUNCINPEC also regretted for the
CPP's misunderstanding and confusion of an interview given by
First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who is also leader
of the FUNCINPEC and president of the NUF.
</P>
<P>
The communique came after the CPP, that formed an uneasy
coalition government with FUNCINPEC following the U.N.-run
elections in 1993, issued a statement earlier today to respond an
interview by Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
During the interview Ranariddh said he did not invite the CPP
to the NUF's inaugural congress because he heard that CPP's Vice
Chairman Hun Sen had declared rejection to join the NUF.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh added he would choose appropriate time to meet CPP
Chairman Chea Sim and hand over the NUF platform.
</P>
<P>
The CPP's statement reiterated its stance to boycott the NUF,
saying it had no need to examine the NUF's political platform.
</P>
<P>
The FUNCINPEC communique said Ranariddh, in the interview,
showed his respect for Chea Sim and regarded the CPP as his ally,
but the CPP has confused this with an evil intent.
</P>
<P>
The communique also rejected CPP's accusation against
FUNCINPEC's alliance with opposition party, saying that was its
full right to choose partners as it did not request the opposition
party to work in the current government.
</P>
<P>
The communique chided the CPP for provoking problems and
"causing political instability."
</P>
<P>
The NUF, a political alliance which was officially launched on
February 27, brings together the FUNCINPEC Party, the Khmer Nation
party and the Khmer Neutral Party and a faction of the divided
Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party led by Son Sann.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus to Hold Referendums on Reunification: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko have agreed in principle
to hold referendums in the two countries on their reunification,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will announce the plan next Thursday in his address to
parliament, Interfax news agency quoted Kremlin sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Yeltsin, in a January letter to
Lukashenko, proposed holding simultaneous national referendums, or
something like it, on closer integration between the two ex-Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, an ardent supporter of reunification with
Russia, reportedly agreed to the proposal, adding that
"supranational power" should be given to the committee in charge
of integration.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders signed a deal last April to create a
"community" with closer political and economic links, and to set
up supranational governing bodies.
</P>
<P>
The move, if successfully carried out, would combine the two
countries into a new state with one central government, one
currency and one budget, their economic systems fully merged.
</P>
<P>
The report said Yeltsin has been impatient with the slow paces
towards a union and called for more resolute actions, saying a
reunification would benefit both countries significantly.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the timing of the move is linked to the upcoming
NATO summit in July, when the alliance is expected to name the
first wave of eastern and central European countries to be
admitted in it.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been bitterly opposed to NATO's eastward expansion to
its borders, viewing it as a grave threat to its national security.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, split from Russia in 1991 when former Soviet Union
dissolved, has remained the stanchest ally of Russia among all the
ex-Soviet republics.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Hospital chiefs were furious Friday
night after they were involved in a mock airline disaster without
being told.
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital went on alert after its
switchboard was flooded with "relatives" asking about victims of a
major air crash, British media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Medical teams and paramedics were contacted by the hospital,
which was on the point of canceling routine operations to make way
for the air victims.
</P>
<P>
When health officials eventually discovered the truth, they
branded the exercise by AirUK as "extremely irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
Louise Zucchi, spokeswoman for the hospital, said, "We were not
told about it and our casualty staff had no way of knowing it was
an exercise when the calls started coming in."
</P>
<P>
"They were obviously concerned they were facing a major
incident and took it seriously," she added.
</P>
<P>
The emergency exercise was organized for AirUK by former
reporter Jeremy Hands, whose company specializes in "crisis
management" training.
</P>
<P>
He recruited more than 30 students from a journalism college to
help.
</P>
<P>
"Like the AirUK personnel involved, they were put under
realistic pressure within the boundaries of the exercise," Hands
said.

<HEADLINE> Top PLA Officer on Army Building (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The key to advancing the great
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated
by Deng Xiaoping is to uphold his theory in this regard and never
waver in adhering to the Party's basic line, said a top Chinese
military leader today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
made the remark at a group discussion attended by Army deputies to
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) now in session in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said, "No matter how many obstacles lie ahead, the PLA must
unswervingly advance along the road pointed out by Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, expressed his approval for Premier Li Peng's
government work report.
</P>
<P>
On army building, Liu said the Chinese People's Liberation Army
will quicken the pace of improving its own quality, noting that
quality improvement has become a basic defence policy for all
major countries in the world since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
To meet changes in the form of war and the pattern of strategy,
the PLA decided quality improvement for the army as an important
guiding principle when formulating its plan for army building
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), he said.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Party Central Committee and the State
Council, new strides have been made in this regard and the PLA has
remarkably improved its quality and defence combat capability,
he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Outlines Plans for Early Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Labor Party
today outlined plans for a post election "welfare-to-work" budget,
pledging to eradicate the nightmare of young people facing a
lifetime without work.
</P>
<P>
In a speech detailing Labor's early spending plans should it
win the coming election, its leader Tony Blair said that
unemployed people would not be allowed to turn down all jobs and
keep benefit.
</P>
<P>
The Budget would introduce a windfall utilities tax and give
firms a 75 pounds (120 US dollars) per week tax rebate for taking
on someone unemployed long term, he told a conference.
</P>
<P>
"For today's school leavers there will be no lifetime on the
dole under Labor," Blair said. "We simply cannot continue with a
situation where today unemployment costs the country more than
education."
</P>

"It is Mickey Mouse arithmetic," Clarke told Sky News. "It is a

the effect of driving up industrial costs," the Chancellor added.

try every possible means to step up army building.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is impossible for the Central Government to
increase defence budget by a large margin, we can still accomplish
a great deal as long as we make meticulous plans and spend the
limited amount of money in key areas with emphasis placed on
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"It is a pressing and long-term task for the PLA to strengthen
the army through scientific and technological progresses. We
should work in this direction now and in the 21st century. We
should never waver in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"For quality improvement, the PLA must pursue a policy of
maintaining a proper size with great combat readiness, optimize
its organizational structure, give strategic importance to
education and drilling, develop high-tech weapons, develop new
combat theories, and strengthen discipline and administration."
</P>

Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun told legislators from east China's
Shandong Province that the central government attached great
importance to agriculture, when Premier Li Peng said in his
government work report that agriculture will continue to be the
top priority in the country's economic work.
</P>
<P>
Although China has achieved good harvests for two consecutive
years and marked increase made in the farmers' incomes, he said,
the people should by no means feel contented and overestimate the
country's agricultural productivity.
</P>
<P>
"Since the founding of New China in 1949, we have suffered
several major setbacks in grain production. One major reason lies
in a blind optimism and letup following harvests," he recalled.

<P>
During discussions with legislators from north China's Hebei
Province, Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee, stressed the importance of education and science and

science and education is a correct strategy for China's economic
development.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army
(PLA) will unswervingly obey the orders of the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made today by Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission, in a group discussion at the on-going
session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The general said the PLA must enhance their political
awareness, observe disciplines and have the overall situation in
mind to carry work forward at the behest of Deng Xiaoping,
unswervingly safeguard the authority of Communist Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core to advance the great cause
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by
Deng Xiaoping and push ahead with reform, opening up and the
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics put forward by Deng Xiaoping is Marxism in
present-day China. It also represents an inheritance and
development of Mao Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
"Under all circumstances, we should arm ourselves with the
theory and use it to understand and deal with contradictions and
problems arising in the modernization drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PLA must do its work with the overall situation in mind.
"This is an important component of Deng Xiaoping's theory on army
building in the new period," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations refugee agency
UNHCR today appealed for parties involved in the eastern Zairean
crisis to allow unimpeded humanitarian access to refugees caught
in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to continue to deliver much needed relief to
the refugees. Unfortunately, we will not be able to do so unless
humanitarian workers are allowed to operate in safety," said
UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata in a statement reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to today's forced evacuation of 57 aid
workers of UNHCR, other U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organizations from Kisangani, a logistics hub of humanitarian
operations for several hundred thousand refugees in eastern and
central Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation followed reports of the capture of the key
garrison town of Kindu in central Zaire by the rebels of the
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire
led by Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"I am distressed that our workers have to leave at a time when
we have just completed arrangements to fly out of the encampments
of the first group of orphaned refugees in Zaire to Rwanda," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the breakout of the rebel war last October in eastern
Zaire which borders Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, more than half of
the 1.2 million Rwandan refugees have returned home with the help
of UNHCR and other international aid agencies operating in the
region.
</P>
<P>
But their aid operations have been suspended time and again
due to the threat of incessant fightings. So far several
international aid workers have sacrificed their lives in the
Great Lakes region.

responsibility and urgency.
</P>
<P>
"We should gradually build our troops into a modernized and

scale, and scientific set-up, improve arms and equipment,
competent personnel, a strong logistics guarantee, advanced
military strategy and tactics, and the ability to win any regional
warfare fought with modern military skills, especially with high

contributions in safeguarding national security and stability, and
ensuring the smooth development of reforms, opening up and
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
NPC Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that more efforts should be
made to strengthen the comprehensive building of the army with
concrete measures.
</P>
<P>
"We should seriously carry out Deng Xiaoping's concepts for

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today called on
the rebels and government troops in Zaire to suspend hostilities
during their peace talks in Pretoria, the administrative capital
of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the South African government called on Zairean
rebels headed by Laurent Kabila and the Zairean government to
"refrain from military operation in the days to come."
</P>
<P>
"Continued hostilities would only serve to undermine the
initial steps now underway to find a peaceful solution to the
present crisis in eastern Zaire," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and Honore Ngbanda, envoy of Zairean President Mobuto
Sese Seko left South Africa on Friday after attending peace talks
mediated by President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Kabila will consult members of his alliance on the four days
of discussions while Ngbanda returned to Kinshasa, capital of
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels launched an offensive last October in a bid to
topple Mobutu's 31-year-rule after the government tried to expel
ethnic Tutsis who had been there in the last two centuries, from
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, while the rebel
leaders were ready for direct peace negotiations, the Zairean
government said it would not hold face-to-face talks until
"foreign troops" -- allegedly from Rwanda and Uganda -- withdraw
from Zaire.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today strongly rejected
the U.S. State Department claim that Cyprus is a high risk area
for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency quoted Governor of the Cyprus Central
Bank Afxentis Afxentiou as saying that Cyprus has already taken
many measures against money laundering and is making them
effective.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the annual International Narcotics Control
report of the U.S. State Department which shifts Cyprus from a
medium-high to a high priority country, in the money laundering
section.
</P>
<P>
The bank chief encouraged any person in the know on money
laundering in his country to speak, "so that we can take specific
measures."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus approved in 1996 a new law to combat money laundering,
Afxentiou said, adding his bank has already begun implementing it.
</P>
<P>
Afxentiou added that local banks have been instructed to be
more strict in the identification of prospective customers,
before they open an account or transfer money through accounts.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Cyprus has already set up a financial
intelligence unit comprising a representative from the Attorney
General's office, the Customs department and the police, to
enforce the law.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Stops Funding For Sheep Cloning Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Agriculture Ministry
decided today to cut off funding for the project that produced
Dolly, the first cloned sheep in the world, according to the
scientists involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
The team that made the breakthrough at the Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh is said to be "despondent".
</P>
<P>
Ministers, newspapers and even prominent scientists such as
Nobel Peace Prize winner Joseph Rotblat have raised the specter of
mad scientists using the Roslin technology to create carbon copies
of dictators, film stars or millionaires.
</P>
<P>
It is announced that the government funding -- currently
252,000 pounds (403,000 US dollars) -- will be halved next month
and withdrawn in April next year.
</P>
<P>
With money short, there are fears of redundancies which could
mean scientists being poached by rival teams abroad who are trying
to catch up.
</P>
<P>
"We had the formal letter on February 27," said Grahame
Bulfield, director of the institute. "At the moment 65 percent of
the work in Ian Wilmut's lab is supported by MAFF (the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food)," he added. "It's a major
problem."
</P>
<P>
One of the scientist in the team speculated that the ministry
had been made so uncomfortable by the debate on the possibility of
cloning humans that it decided to axe much of the biotechnology
research it sponsors at Roslin.
</P>
<P>
A  spokesman for the ministry said: "If they have researched
what they were supposed to have researched, then that's it...The
funding will come to an end."
</P>
<P>
The Roslin Institute has a close partnership with biotechnology
company PPL Therapeutids Plc, which holds licences for some of the
work being done there -- the genetic engineering of animals to
produce human proteins for use in medicines.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has argued that backing should come from industry
but Prof Bulofied said that there were long term applications of
the technology in animal breeding, which is of direct concern to
the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Council Calls for General Strike Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Council (PC)
today called for a general strike Monday across the Palestinian
territories in protest against Israel's decision to build a new
Jewish settlement in Jebel Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The 88-member Palestinian legislature met in an emergency
session in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss how to react
to the new settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs
decided to approve the construction of a new settlement in Har
Homa with 6,500 housing units. The decision triggered off
furious reaction from the Palestinians and also aroused a
worldwide condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa issue was taken up at a joint meeting of
the Palestinian National Authority and PLO Executive Committee in
Gaza Friday night. An open letter, issued at the end of the
meeting, warned that the new settlement drive will destroy the
Middle East peace process and Israel should bear responsibility
for any violence resulting from the construction.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat today traveled to Cairo to
hold consultations with President Hisni Mubarak and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on Israel's settlement policy and the new
settlement plan in particular.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who also had a lengthy telephone discussion with King
Hussein of Jordan Friday, is scheduled to fly to Washington next
week to meet President Bill Clinton and senior government
officials. The settlement issue is expected to be high on agenda.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of left-wing Israelis and Palestinians this
afternoon marched from Beit Sahur to Har Homa settlement site
in protest against the construction.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by Gush Shalom (the Peace
Bloc) and other peace groups alongside various Palestinian
political and social groups. A number of Palestinian ministers
and PC members also participated in the protest march.
</P>
<P>
Gush Shalom said in a press statement that the demonstration is
intended to underline the determination of all participants,
Israeli as well as Palestinian, to block the Government of
Israel's provocative action which seriously threatens the future
of peace between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, meanwhile, several hundred Palestinians took to
the street against Israeli occupation. During the demonstration,
organized by the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine,
participants burned pictures of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Malawi TV Staff to Be Trained in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian Private TV
station has promised to train staff members of Malawi's
state-owned television station, slated for opening this June, to
sharpen their skills here.
</P>
<P>
An official from The Guardian Ltd. told this correspondent
here today that Mengi, Executive Chairman of the IPP, a local
industries and media group, made the promise during talks on
Friday with a Malawi TV delegation visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the delegation toured the
Independent Television Station (ITV) and Radio One studios as
well as the news room of newspapers run by the Guardian Lt. at
the Mikocheni area in the city on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Benson Tembo led the Malawi delegation, representing his
country's Information Minister, Brown Mpinganjira.
</P>
<P>
IPP chief Mengi told the Malawi delegation that television
crew from Malawi are welcome to learn from the ITV before
launching their national television station in June.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the staff training program, ITV is ready to provide
a recorder to the new station to facilitate capturing of ITV
signals at home, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tembo, the project coordinator for the Malawi national
television station, thanked the IPP chief for the helpful gesture
on his part, assuring him that the Malawi authorities would
closely collaborate with the IPP media in the coming period.
</P>
<P>
He said about 200 public television centers were being planned
after the launching of the state-owned station in Blantyre, to
make television accessible to the ordinary people, adding that
Malawi did not previously have any television station.
</P>
<P>
ITV is one of the four private television stations in
Tanzania. The only national television station, which was
launched two years ago, is still under construction.

ABU DHABI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates(UAE)
today called for Russian efforts to stop Israel's housing policy
and maintain the peace process in the Middle East, UAE's official
Wam news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's Minister of state of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan
bin Zayed Al Nahyan called Russia to "assume its responsibilities
to the housing policy taken by the Israeli government on the
Palestinian lands, especially in the eastern Jerusalem as Russia
is one of the guardians for the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
The minister made his remarks during his meeting with visiting
Russian Deputy Premier Vitaly Ignatenko, who headed a delegation
to the UAE to attend the first meeting of the UAE-Russian Joint
Committee which was set up in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Israel`s housing policy destroyed peace
and undermined security and stability in the Middle East region
and it is necessary to make Israel stop this policy and commit
itself to agreements signed by the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel approved the construction of 6,500 new Jewish homes in
the now undeveloped Har Homa area on the Southern edge of East
Jerusalem on February 26 and the move has sparked world
criticism.

NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Tanzania have succeeded
in controlling a rinderpest outbreak hitting Kajiado district of
Kenya and adjacent parts of Tanzania since last November,
according to a Kenya News Agency report today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kenyan veterinary officer Cleophas Kogo as
saying that a quarantine effected in January this year to
restrict movement of cattle in and out of Kajiado district might
be lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the vaccination against the disease in two weeks
time, he noted, a total of 400,000 head of cattle will have been
vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
Kogo pointed out that without the cooperation between the two
countries, the campaign would have been hampered by migrations of
Kenya's livestock to areas for greener pastures in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Most cattle from the Kenyan side crossing the border in search
of greener pasture have been vaccinated by Tanzanian veterinary
officials, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Following the rinderpest outbreak originated from wildlife in
Tsavo West and Nairobi National Parks, vaccination teams were
mobilized last November to trail pastoralists to the dry season
grazing areas in a bid to get all animals vaccinated.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Encourages Privatization in Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
encouraged privatization in livestock services since 1991 as part
of economic liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Second Annual General Meeting of the Kenya
Livestock Breeders which opened today in Nakuru, about 165 km
northwest of capital Nairobi, Agricultural Minister Darious Mbela
said the government had identified services that needed to be
privatized and those to remain in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government had handed over the management of
cattle dips to dip management committees in 1991 and provided
free acaricides with the aim of having the dip committees build a
revolving fund.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister added, the program collapsed as a result
of depreciation of the Kenyan currency of Shillings in 1993 which
eroded their accounts.
</P>
<P>
Before 1993, there were more than 6,000 dips throughout the
country owned by farmers and communities, out of which 4,100 were
run by dip management committees.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced the revival of dip services following
the signing of a contract for the supply of acaricides and
training of dip management committees by the government,
according to a Kenya News Agency report today.
</P>
<P>
The government has since 1991 been stressing the privatization
of the veterinary clinical services in high livestock production
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 300 clinical centers are in operation in the east
African country while 164 private veterinarians have been
assisted to enter into private practice.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Veterinary Project is being expanded to attract
unemployed and retired veterinarians to start clinics in major
dairy production areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that artificial insemination carried out by
private practitioners increased from 8,248 in 1992 to 100,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
The government will gradually withdraw artificial insemination
services from well served areas by the private sector and moved
to promote the same in other areas.

<HEADLINE> Quebec's Unilateral Secession Illegal, Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The province of Quebec has no right
under domestic or international law to secede unilaterally from
the confederation, the federal government has argued before the
Supreme Court of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The government said that Quebecers have a right to separate if
they choose. But the only way to ensure a lawful, orderly and
peaceful divorce would be by negotiating a constitutional
amendment approved by the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Without the rule of law, there is a high risk of uncertainty,
instability and arbitrariness in the exercise of governmental
power," the government was quoted as saying by today's reports.
</P>
<P>
The factum presented before the court Friday is believed to be
the first step by the federal government to ensure that Quebec
never again sets all the rules for a referendum or subsequently
separation process.
</P>
<P>
It sets out the most detailed arguments from the government
since it decided last September to ask the Supreme Court of Canada
to rule on the legality of unilateral separation.
</P>
<P>
A full hearing on the case is not expected before this Autumn
and a decision by the court seems unlikely before the next federal
election, which is widely anticipated to take place as early as
June.
</P>
<P>
Quebec has indicated that it will not participate in the court
hearings, arguing that the question of independence will be
settled not by judges, but by the people through vote in a
referendum.

<P>
PARIS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- France's main Jewish organization,
the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions (CRIF), today
denounced the president of the far-right National Front Jean-Marie
Le Pen for continuously spreading anti-Semitist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen said in an interview published lately by two French
journalists that French President Jacques Chirac was "taken
hostage by Jewish organizations," mainly the famous B'nai B'rith
free-mason group which was set up by German Jews in the early 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
Henri Hajdenberg, president of CRIF, said that "the
anti-Semitist fantasy of Jean-Marie Le Pen is continuing to cause
delirium."
</P>
<P>
"Obsessed by the `Jewish conspiracy,' Jean-Marie Le Pen picks
up the classic themes of the pre-war anti-Semitist
extreme-right," said Hajdenberg in a communique.
</P>
<P>
He said that CRIF will not "fall in the trap" prepared by Le
Pen, who he said always produces a media scandal and then claims
himself the victim of it.
</P>
<P>
Hajdenberg also said that he is "determined to see the justice
condemn Jean-Marie Le Pen for his anti-Semitist declarations on
the Jewish conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
In an interview contained in the book "The Novel of a
President," written by journalists Nicolas Domenach and Maurice
Szafran, Le Pen said that "Chirac and the ruling RPR have made
commitment to the B'nai B'rith and other foreign organizations
that they will never ally with the National Front, even though
they need it to form a majority."

BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz will meet with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York
and discuss with him issues Iraq is extremely concerned with,
an Iraqi official told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The source from the Ministry of Culture and Information said,
on condition of anonymity, that Aziz will meet Annan within two
weeks and their discussion will focus on three issues.
</P>
<P>
Aziz will ask the U.N. secretary general to increase Iraq's
limited oil sales under the oil-for-food deal and to speed up
the implementation under U.N. Resolution 986, the source said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the relations between Iraq and the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq will also be
discussed during the meeting.

<P>
Under the U.N. resolution, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to finance purchases
of food, medicine and other basic necessities for the sanction-hit
people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has so far submitted 190 trade contracts to the sanctions

<HEADLINE> Anti-FN Protest Held in Strasbourg, France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred people, led by the
Socialist mayor of Strasbourg Catherine Trautmann, today staged a
street protest against a plan by the far-right National Front (FN)
party to hold a congress in the eastern French city.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the demonstrators
gathered in the center of the city at the call of a local anti-FN
group, "Citizens' Front," to sign a petition against the holding
of FN congress.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Francois Guichard, vice-president of "Citizen's
Front," as saying that 15,000 signatures were obtained, including
those from Mayor Trautmann and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie
Wiesel, artists, sportsman and political figures.
</P>
<P>
Trautmann also signed a "charter of foreign residents" to
call on the public to mobilize against FN, which she said is "a
party that advocates racism, xenophobia, and social disorder."
</P>
<P>
"Your mobilization will be a civil and civic expression in the
respect of a national and European conscience for the democratic
values and against a party which advocates civil war," she said.

<HEADLINE> China's State Firms Expected to Bottom Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's state firms are expected
to bottom out this year but their difficult situation is not
likely to improve significantly in the near future,
</P>
<P>
There will be a trend of overall improving economic performance
for state-owned enterprises this year and, expectedly, such a
tendency will get stronger in the next few years, said deputies to
the on-going fifth session of the Eighth National People's
Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is justified by a recent national survey by the
State Statistical Bureau, which said that this year sales will
increase or remain the same as last year for most state firms.
</P>
<P>
But the deputies also warned that the current situation where
state enterprises are plagued by various difficulties will not
improve considerably.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government should promote the development of
state firms by accelerating the pace of reforming the economic
system.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties of China's state firms have worsened in recent
years and peaked last year, when over 40 percent of them were in
the red by year-end.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Huang Da, an economist, said that the state firms' weak
competitiveness due to vestiges of a planned economy is the main
factor accounting for their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Other factors include too much administrative intervention, too
much debt, outdated equipment and technology, and poor management.
</P>
<P>
Joining the delegation from Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said Saturday that over
40 percent of the financially-independent state enterprises
lost money in the first quarter of last year but made money in the
second quarter, with profits growing in later months.
</P>
<P>
"Our state firms have passed their most difficult year," Wu
said. "This demonstrates that their ability to adapt to macro
economic reforms and to the market has improved."
</P>
<P>
As more reform measures will be unveiled and implemented, the
performance of state-owned enterprises will further improve, the
Vice-Premier said.
</P>
<P>
Gu Yongde, a deputy from the old industrial base of Liaoning
Province, said that measures taken to reform state firms since
1995 have begun to show results.
</P>
<P>
Shi Jiwen, a deputy from Shenyang Air-Blower Plant, said that
more and more state-owned enterprises are turning to the market
for a way out and are striving to improve their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Such endeavors will be effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to reforms in economic operation and to industrial
restructuring, the textile industry in Shanghai has gone out of
losses in the past two years and begun to make money.
</P>
<P>
Ye Gongqi, chairman of the Standing Committee of Shanghai
Municipal People's Congress, predicted that reforms in state firms
will score greater achievements this year.
</P>
<P>
Economist Huang Da echoed Ye, saying that "reforms in China's
state firms have embarked on a right track and all problems and
difficulties will be resolved ultimately."

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Chairman Voices Opposition to Dalai's Schemes to Split China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A top Tibetan official voiced his
strong opposition to Dalai Lama for his activities to split China
today.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional
Government, made the remark at the on-going session of the
National People's Congress, China's legislature, in response to
reports of a planned visit by Dalai Lama to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai clique has engaged in activities to split the
motherland and advocate the so-called independence of Tibet in the
world. It has also colluded with the Taiwan authorities, worked
hand in glove and publicly wallowed in the mire with each other.
</P>
<P>
The facts show that the Dalai clique has gone farther on the
road of splitting the motherland, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan chairman, who is a deputy to the Eighth NPC, noted
that with the support of the people of the entire country, Tibet
has entered a new period of development in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said Tibet achieved an economic growth rate of more than 10
percent in 1995 and 1996. The region's GDP reached 6.453 billion
yuan last year while price rises fell from 17 percent in 1995 to
eight percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The loving attention of the central authorities and support
rendered by the people throughout the country have filled the
Tibetan people with enthusiasm and confidence for united efforts
to accelerate the development.

Its population of the most needy also decreased from 480,000 to
330,000. The region reaped another good harvest for the ninth
successive years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the central government has
invested more than 40 billion yuan since the peaceful liberation
of Tibet in 1951. Another 62 major projects have been built over
recent years with several dozen billion yuan in support from
various parts of China.
</P>
<P>
"With the support of the central government and from people of
the rest parts of China, the Tibetan people have become
increasingly aware of the importantance of safeguarding the
country's ethical unity to the promotion of progress, stability
and reform and opening up in Tibet," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Western hostile forces are reluctant to see a strong and
developed China and so is the Dalai clique to see a new socialist
Tibet marked by unity, happiness and great ethical progress," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai clique will never abandon their attempts to undermine
the economic growth and social advances in Tibet and they will
create disturbances to internationalize the so-called "the issue
of Tibet" in a vain attempt to make Tibet a breach to westernize
and split up China, he said.

HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Although playing with half of
its reserve, the visiting Brazilian First Division side of
Athletico Mineiro won 2-0 over Golden, one of Hong Kong's leading
club, in the Satchi Cup soccer tournament on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Clone Monkeys from Embryos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have produced
two monkeys from cloned embryos in the use of a technique similar
to the one that Scottish researchers cloned an adult sheep, The
Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two monkeys, born in August, were cloned from cells taken
from embryos so they are not genetically identical to any adult
monkey -- a crucial difference between them and Dolly, the sheep
cloned by the Scottish researchers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Leader researcher Don Wolf, a senior scientist at the Oregon
Regional Primate Research Center and director of a human in vitro
fertilization laboratory, said researchers do not plan to produce
clones from adult monkeys.
</P>
<P>
"This is really an effort to see if we can create generically
identical monkeys for research," the Post quoted the researcher as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the success in Oregon, the first time a species so
closely related to humans has been cloned, adds to a growing body
of evidence that there are no insurmountable biological barriers
to create multiple copies of a human being.
</P>
<P>
"Last week we knew sheep could be cloned, this week we got the
news about monkey, then how about next week? human being?" a talk
show host warned in his radio program this morning.
</P>
<P>
The two monkeys are not identical to each other because they
were from different embryos. But researchers said the technique
could be used to create eight or more identical monkeys from a
single embryo, and that further advances could lead to the ability
to make clones of adult monkeys as well.
</P>
<P>
The monkeys were created in a two-step technique. First,
researchers created several monkey embryos using a standard in
vitrorch fertilization method of mixing eggs from a single female
with sperm. Once the embryos had divided into eight cells, Wolf
and his colleagues teased apart the cells.
</P>
<P>
In the second step, the scientists took one full set of
chromosomes from each embryo cell and inserted each batch into a
fresh egg cell whose DNA had been removed. Each of those cells
then had the potential to become a new embryos.
</P>
<P>
Then the successfully developed embryos would be implanted into
female monkeys. Using this method , scientists made three monkeys
become pregnant, two of them successfully bore baby monkey.

<HEADLINE> Legislators on Steel Output (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- When Premier Li Peng announced in
his government work report that China's steel output last year
exceeded 100 million tons, Wang Peizhou felt a surging pride.
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of painstaking efforts by several
generations of people," said Wang, vice-chairman of the board of
the Baosteel Group in east China's Shanghai, and a deputy to the
Eighth National People's Congress, China's legislature, which is
having its fifth session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wang's feeling was shared by many other legislators, who
believed that the 1996 steel output is an important milestone in
China's industrialization process as well as an indication that
the country's comprehensive economic strength has ascended to a
new height.
</P>
<P>
China's iron and steel industry started in 1890, but its annual
steel output in 1949 was merely 158,000 tons. After the founding
of New China, steel output rose steadily and reached 5.35 million
tons in 1957.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the central government decided to make steel
production a top industrial priority, and set the objective
of beating Britain and the United States in steel output. This led
to a fanatic steelmaking campaign nationwide, which caused huge
losses and ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Shi Mingyang, a senior engineering from China's
largest iron and steel enterprise -- the Anshan Steel Company in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, noted that although the
"steelmaking campaign" was against law of economic development, it
also reflected Chinese leaders' special interest in developing the
steel industry.
</P>
<P>
"The late Chairman Mao Zedong once pointed out that grain and
steel are the two things most important for China's development," he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Since reform and opening up started in 1978, China's iron
and steel industry has enjoyed rapid progress, with a steel
output of over 60 million tons in 1989.

<P>
In 1990, however, Deng Xiaoping said: "Only when the output
reaches 100 to 120 million tons will China have enough steel to
use. This is a problem concerning the strategy of development."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China produced 101.1 million tons of steel, and
became the world's No.1 steel manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's iron and steel industry has kept on
improving its internal structure and product quality, and has been
able to produce most kinds of steel needed in various sectors of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"To date, we have succeeded in developing and supplying a lot
of key metals for the defense industry and some top technologies,"
claimed Shi, adding that this reflects the continuous improvement
of China's national strength.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Wu Renbao, a farmer from the Huaxi Village in east
China's Jiangsu Province, described grain and steel as "two
pillars" of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Grain production in the agricultural sector and steel output
in the industrial sector are two important material bases for
national development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As one of the managers of the country's most modernized steel
enterprise, Wang Peizhou held that China still has a long way to
go before it can be called a steel giant.
</P>
<P>
"We have caught up with other countries in steel output, but
still fall far behind international big names in terms of product
structure and quality," he explained.
</P>
<P>
His view echoed a plan set forth by the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industry for a further development of the iron and
steel industry.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the ministry said that while trying to maintain an
adequate growth of output, China's steel industry in future will
focus on upgrading technologies and equipment, restructuring
enterprises and the product mix, reducing energy consumption, and
raising efficiency.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the fifth session of
the Eighth National People's Congress, China's legislature, said
that they firmly support the Chinese government's stance of
opposing "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion of Premier Li Peng's government work
report delivered to the current NPC session on Saturday, Lin
Liyun, an NPC deputy representing Taiwan, noted that Premier Li
Peng quoted in his report President Jiang Zemin's "Eight Points"
proposal on developing relations across the Taiwan Strait and
promoting peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"This fully demonstrates the sincerity of the Chinese
Government in properly resolving the Taiwan issue," said Lin, who
is a member of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government will resume the exercise of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong this summer under the guideline of "one
country, two systems" and is confident in maintaining prosperity
and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's smooth return to the motherland and prosperity
will make the masses of compatriots in Taiwan believe that 'one
country, two systems' is practical and feasible," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"In regard with whether relations across the Strait can be
developed," she said, the crux of the matter hinges on the
attitude of the Taiwan authorities," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ansheng, an NPC deputy of Taiwan origin from eastern Anhui
Province, said that Premier Li Peng's report stresses on a focal
point of perseverence in unity, opposition to separation, and
urges the Taiwan authorities to adopt the stance of following the
historical trend and safeguarding the interests of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, many NPC deputies have voiced their
position to prompt the Taiwan authorities to give up as early as
possible the stance of preventing "three direct links", namely,
the direct mail, trade and shipping services across the Taiwan
Strait.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will pass a
privatization law during the current National Assembly's
four-year legislative term which started last October, Kuwaiti
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Nasser Al-Rudhan said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan made the remarks following the inauguration of a
two-day seminar here on legal issues in privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization has been fully studied by law and
finance experts of the parliament and the government as well,
adding that a blueprint of privatization law had already been
devised.
</P>
<P>
In his inauguration speech, Al-Ruhdan said Kuwaiti
privatization was aimed at increasing citizens' role in national
investments, boosting the private sector and encouraging
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait initiated the privatization program in 1994, so far it
has sold more than 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of shares of
state-owned enterprises to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti government officials have expressed the hope that the
parliament would soon pass a privatization law to help kick off
a plan to shed state involvement in some public utilities and
services during 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, participants will discuss the legal
aspects of privatization of public services and utilities in the
country. They will examine several matters related to the legal
aspects of turning government-run projects to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan said that in recent years, Kuwaiti private sector
began to grow and show eagerness to compete with the government
in taking on gigantic projects.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji called on
China's economic circles today to grasp and follow the rich and
profound economic theories of Deng Xiaoping to advance the
country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the call at a group meeting discussing Premier Li
Peng's government work report. The meeting was attended by members
hailing from economic circles of the National Committee of the

</P>
<P>
Li Peng delivered the report at the Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress on March 1. Members of the top
advisory body attended the session in a non-deputy capacity.
</P>

calling for uniting more closely around the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at its core, Zhu said the scientific
contents and gist of Deng's economic theories must be
comprehensively and accurately grasped.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping put forward a series of important ideas,
strategies and decisions for economic work, which profoundly
reflect the law of China's socialist economic construction and
development, and have become an important component of his theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Zhu said.

living standard, especially farmers', steadily bettered, he said.
</P>
<P>
These achievements have laid a solid foundation for the smooth
return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland, the
convening of the 15th Party Congress, and the accomplishment of
the ninth five-year national plan in an all-round fashion, the
vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's economic work has a clear orientation with
concrete measures. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- Greater attention to be paid to reforming the state sector,
to economic restructuring, and to changing the mode of growth.
</P>
<P>
-- Continued priority to be given to developing agriculture as
the economic base. The grain circulation system should be further
reformed with a view to encouraging farmers to produce more.
</P>
<P>
-- Continued appropriately tight financial and monetary
policies to be pursued. Budgets must be observed rigorously, more
efforts should be made to increase revenue and cut spending,
reform of the financial system should be deepened, and supervision
over financial institutions should be intensified.
</P>
<P>
Twelve National Committee members of the CPPCC spoke at
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Chairman of China's Top Advisory Body Highlights Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of China's top advisory
body today urged its members to cherish the hard-won stability
China now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
"We must conscientiously follow Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, cherish to the
utmost extent the current situation of unity and stability and
solve problems effectively," Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China,
said when he attended a group discussion, part of the activities
of the ongoing fifth session of the Eighth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
How to make people rich and the country prosperous is an
issue that many socialist countries have failed to resolve
properly, said Li, who is also chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Our Party scored great achievements but also suffered many
setbacks in this regard and has paid a cost that is not small,
such as the miserable cost of the 'Cultural Revolution'," he said.
</P>
<P>
The big issue was not resolved fundamentally in China until the
third plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, when Comrade Deng
Xiaoping initiated the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Without Deng Xiaoping's theory, there would not have been such
a prosperous situation in China or a bright and broad future," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
It's the broadest public will and opinion in China to carry
forward this theory and all the comrades that are concerned about
people's interests and about the long-term stability of the
nation, especially leading officials at all levels, must
conscientiously follow Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the third generation of the central collective
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core is united, the whole Party
is united, people of the entire nation are united, and the
country's social and political situation is stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fundamental guarantee for us to carry forward our
cause," he said. "Without this, nothing can be achieved."
</P>
<P>
In its history of the past 100 years, China focused on economic
construction only in the last 18 years, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
"We must cherish to the utmost extent and meticulously
safeguard the current situation of unity and stability," he urged.
"We should not say or do anything harmful to unity and to stability."
</P>
<P>
China is hopeful so long as there is a united and stable
situation and Deng Xiaoping's theory is followed, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive
have scored achievements recognized by all.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that China is also facing some difficult
problems that must be solved.
</P>
<P>
"First I want to say that it is normal there will be some
difficulties and problems in a process such as establishing a
socialist market economic system," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"And second, earnest effort must be made to solve the
difficulties and problems, or there will be great repercussions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li called on the members to offer realistic ideas and ways to
solve the difficulties and problems.

<HEADLINE> Disaster-Relief Work in Quake-stricken Part of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Rescue and disaster-relief work has
begun in Jiashi County of Kashgar, in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, which was hit by an earthquake measuring
6.0 on the Richter Scale at 14:04 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This was the most recent of a series of shocks that have hit
Jiashi County since early this year, and the third that registered
above 6.0 on the Richter Scale in the county within a year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the quake has claimed one life, and wounded six
people. It also killed 738 head of cattle and destroyed about
4,000 homes and seven mosques.
</P>
<P>
Li Donghui, vice-chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, visited the county soon after the earthquake happened to
coordinate rescue and disaster relief work, and other high-ranking
officials have gone to the area to help with the work.
</P>
<P>
The local government of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
are having 1,000 tons of coal shipped to the county and local
officials are helping people rebuild their lives and prepare for
spring planting.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Regional Seismological Bureau earlier predicted
that strong aftershocks might occur in the county, and told local
government and residents to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
Quake experts believe that an aftershock measuring more than
5.0 on the Richter Scale may still happen within a week. The two
previous strong earthquakes claimed 36 lives and injured 170
people.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's DP Declines to Join Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Demoratic Party
(DP) today declined an offer by President Nelson Mandela to join the
government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
DP leader Tony Leon told a press conference that conditions
proposed by Mandela for the DP's participation in the cabinet
would have made it impossible for the party to continue
effectively as an opposition party.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the president's proposal, debate and discusssion on
key policy issues would have had to take place behind closed doors
and away from public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"The DP would have been bound by cabinet decisions and collective
cabinet responsibility and thus be unable to play the role of a
vigorous, probing critical opposition," Leon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Leon made the remarks after a two-day meeting of the party's
Federal Council in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the DP's future role, Leon said his party would
continue to put forward proposals on key issues such as economic
growth, job creation, crime prevention, the promotion of fundamental
human rights and the protection of the constitituion.
</P>
<P>
Leon said during recent discusssions with Mandela he
indciated that the DP would continue to promote constructive,
positive and practical solutions to problems facing South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Premier Urges Better Application of Science, Technology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng called for
promoting the application of science and technology to better
benefit economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
"Every year sees the emergence of tens of thousands of
scientific and technological research results in our country, but
those that are genuinely applied in production and converted to a
productive force are a few in number," he said. "That is why, in
future, we must give priority to applying research results in
national economic development."
</P>
<P>
The premier made the call here today at a panel discussion
attended by members of the Eighth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who
hail from science and technology circles. The CPPCC National
Committee has been in session since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping set forth at the National Science Conference in
1978 the scientific thesis that 'science and technology is the
No.1 productive force,'" Li said. "This is a component part of his
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We must carry work forward at the behest of Comrade
Deng Xiaoping, unite around the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at core, and implement Deng Xiaoping's
thinking on 'science and technology being the No.1 productive
force.'"
</P>
<P>
Citing that Deng Xiaoping as a founder of China's principles
and policies on science and technology, as well as a teacher and
friend of Chinese scientific and technological personnel, Li said
that Deng's tremendous contributions and immortal feats in the
country's socialist modernization drive will be always remembered.
</P>
<P>
Li called on scientists and technicians to implement in an
all-round-way the strategy of relying on science and education to
build up the country, scale the height of science and technology
and go all out to strengthen the work in this regard.
</P>
<P>
An important way to further improve the quality of economic
growth is to rely on scientific and technological progresses, the
premier said.

Li Peng emphasized that special attention should be attached to
the application and commercialization of new and high
technologies.
</P>
<P>
"This should be included in economic development plans and
plans for the development of science and technology and given
priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for doing a good job in building state high and new
technology development zones and bringing into full play the
initiative of all social quarters, especially industrial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of China's science and technology management
system, the premier held that remarkable results have been made.
</P>
<P>
The orientation for reform in this regard, he said, is "to
gradually move the main force of scientific research and
technological development to enterprises, away from research
institutes, or let research and development proceed simultaneously
in enterprises and research institutes."
</P>
<P>
Li expressed approval for the suggestion that funds for
scientific research and technological development make up 1.5
percent of China's GDP by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"However," he added, "we must change the way investment in this
regard is made. Resources should be used in major areas."
</P>
<P>
The major areas he mentioned are basic research, research for
new and high technologies, and research on key, crucial issues
that have a bearing on natinal economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The premier thanked Chinese scientists and experts for their
contributions to the country and expressed the hope that they
would air their views freely on his government work report he made
Saturday at the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
During the panel discussion, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also spoke
on the domestic and world markets and a number of other issues of
concern to the members of the CPPCC National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Bee Hatch "Golden Egg" for Farmers Rather Than Honey (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- When people in China talk about
the future development for agriculture, "economy of scale" and
"ecological protection" are, among others, their favorite terms.
</P>
<P>
For Professor Gong Yifei from east China's Fujian province, his
favorite topic is how bees can contribute to the human efforts to
build eco-agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"When bees are busy making honey, their contribution to farm
production is often neglected," ethused the veteran specialist on
apiculture from the Fujian University of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Since bees are the only insect that can be artificially raised,
Gong said, it can be used in helping boost farm production by both
pollinating the flowers and making money.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Gong added, modern agriculture usually
features the use of large amount of chemical pesticides and
insecticides, which results in the killing of beneficial insects
like bees.
</P>
<P>
When the system of fixing farm output quotas on a household
basis was first introduced in China's rural areas, farmers vied
each other to spray pesticides to boost higher yields on a
short-term basis, but they were soon disappointed as a result of
excessive use chemicals.
</P>
<P>
To his delight, farmers across the country have learned to use
bees they borrowed from bee raisers to work on flowering crops or
fruit trees during the blossom season, which will led to
substantial, high yields.
</P>
<P>
So Prof. Gong warned farmers not to use pesticides during the
blossom season," said Gong.
</P>
<P>
In Professor Gong's hometown of Zhangzhou, a leading Litchi
producer in Fujian province, local governments have in the past
three years issued notices to advise local farmers against the use
of pesticides during blossom seasons since the bees they
introduced can help pollinate the Litchi flowers.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, local farmers have had Litchi harvests for three
consecutive years," said Professor Gong.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhangzhou is not a sole case in point. on large farms in the
western Xinjiang, and in apple tree orchards of the northernmost
province of Heilongjiang, hundreds of millions of bees are used to
raise crop yields.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Gong, there is no such practice as
borrowing of bees during the period of petty-scale peasant
economy. Since-scale farming was done in many areas, farmers have
become increasingly aware of the aid of bees in the process of
building eco agriculture."
</P>
<P>
And China today has a developed bee keeping business. With some
seven million of bee raising cases, China is the world's top bee
keeping nation.
</P>
<P>
Of tens of millions bee-raising households, a wise and harding
working couple are able to raise 70 or 80 cases of bees, and earn
30,000 to 50,000 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
"But they have to work hard, and often go deep admist the
forests in mountain areas and hilly regions," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
He himself was a part-time bee keeper some 50 years ago to earn
money for go on schooling.
</P>
<P>
China's first department on apiculture sciences was established
in Fujian Agriculture University in 1960. Professor Gong has be
the dean of this department for decades, and helped to train some
30 bee-keeping specialists every year.
</P>
<P>
After retirement, Gong still works hard and dedicates himself
mainly to bee keeping.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old man is rosy cheecked and healthy. When people
asked about his secret, he would said with pride and humorously,
 "I owe my health to bee products and physical exercises as a
bee-keeper."

<HEADLINE> Non-communist Leaders Favor Multi-Party Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Three non-communist party leaders
expressed their intention of further consolidating multi-party
cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) to contribute to China's reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
The three newly elected non-Communist party chairpersons
are: He Luli, chairperson of the Revolutionary Committee of
the Chinese Kuomintang, Ding Shisun, chairman of China Democratic
League and Chen Siwei, chairman of China Democratic National
Construction Association.
</P>
<P>
The three chairpersons said the system of multi-party
cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party is a basic
political system in China and conforms to Chinese realities. Under
the system, they said, the CPC is the ruling party holding the
leading position in multi-party cooperation while the
non-Communist parties participate in the running of state affairs
under the leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisun said his party, most of whose members come from
educational circles, pays great attention to education. "Basic
education is the foundation for improving the quality of the
Chinese nation," he said. "Basic education must free itself from
the blind alley of rigid examinations."
</P>
<P>
Ding, who used to be president of China's elite Beijing
University, said higher education plays a dominant role in all
education. In light of the rapid progress in global science and
technology, attention should be paid to strengthening the study of
basic theories and basic training, instead of specialized
training, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ding said his party will carry forward the tradition of
adhering to CPC's leadership and cooperating with the CPC to
contribute more to China's socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, in response to a question on the impact of Hong Kong's
return to China on relations between both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, said that Hong Kong's return is an important step forward
toward the reunification of the motherland and, as such, will
surely exert a positive and far-reaching impact on the
international community as well as among Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Madame He pointed out that reunification of the country and
reinvigoration of the Chinese nation is the common wish of all
Chinese people, those in Taiwan included. She expressed her
confidence in an early realization of China's reunification.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Rules of Procedure working
group under the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has started to
formulate a set of rules guiding the operation of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member ad hoc group held a closed-door meeting today in

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Parties Not to Function in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's non-Communist party
organizations will neither establish branches, nor admit new
members, nor establish ties with political organizations of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in Hong Kong after
its return to China, said three top non-Communist party leaders
today.
</P>
<P>
The three newly elected non-Communist party chairpersons made
known the policy in response to a question from a Hong Kong
reporter at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Siwei, chairman of China Democratic National Construction
Association, said the multi-party cooperation system under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China is the political party
system and part of the political system in China.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese government resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, Hong Kong will not practice a
socialist system and the political party system in the interior
will not be introduced into Hong Kong in line with the Basic Law
of HKSAR, he said.

<HEADLINE> Asia Targets Healthcare Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 surgeons from the
Asian region gathered here today to share their insights into how
to cope with increasing costs and expectations in healthcare in a
modern society.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Congress of the Asian Surgical Association opened
today in Hong Kong, a city which hosted the first biennial meeting
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the congress, Hong Kong
government Secretary of Health and Welfare Mrs. Katherine Fok said
that the rise of aging population and the development of
expensive medical devices have led to a fast-growing healthcare
bill, which has become a serious concern to policy makers and
healthcare professionals in many countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
That was why the current congress focused on how to achieve a
balance between growing needs of patients and growing prices of
healthcare services.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Fok said: "To cope with rising costs, ways have to be
identified to increase the cost-effectiveness of services to be
provided without sacrificing quality."
</P>
<P>
In addition to surgeons from Asia, many distinguished figures
from Australia, Europe and the United States took part in the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> African Social Sector Remains Under Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Africa's social sector has remained
under great pressure in the 1990s mainly due to cutbacks of public
expenditure on education and health care.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of ''Africa Recovery'' said that the introduction
of user fees for schooling and social services, previously offered
free of charge, has left the poor often without health care and access
to schooling.
</P>
<P>
The publication said the public expenditure in the health sector
rarely exceeded an average of five percent of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), or 10 US Dollars per capita a year.
</P>
<P>
In many African countries more than 50 percent of the population
has no access to modern health facilities, and 54 percent has no
access to safe drinking water and 66 percent lacks sanitation
services.
</P>
<P>
The impact of poor preventive health care is more severe on
African children, who continue to fall ill or die often from
preventable or treatable afflictions like acute respiratory
infections, diarrhoea, malaria and measles in addition to
protein-energy and micronutrient malnutrition, said the publication.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian people today
celebrated the 101st anniversary of the Adwa victory over the
Italian invaders.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Addis Ababa, the day was marked at the
Menelik Square in the presence of patriots of the anti-colonial
resistance and thousands of residents of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Dawit Yohannes, Speaker of the House of People's
Representatives, laid a wreath on the Menelik Monument.
</P>
<P>
A 106-year-old patriot, Ferede Zerfu, said that Ethiopian
sovereignity and independence was preserved thanks to the sacrifice
of the dear sons and daughters of the nation. The present generation
has the responsibility to preserving that legacy, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the day was also observed
throughout the nation including northern town of Adwa.
</P>
<P>
On March 1, 1896, Ethiopian soldiers led by Emperor Menelik ii
defeated 15,000 well-equipped Italian invaders at Adwa in northern
Ethiopia. The famous battle of Adwa forced the Italian aggressors
to recognize Ethiopia as a sovereign independent state. Ethiopia
celebrates the adwa victory day every year on March 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kaduna International Trade Fair
Complex, the site for the Seventh All-Africa Trade Fair scheduled
for March 29, has nearly been completed, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Dauda Dau, chairman of the technical committee of the
organizing committee, said construction workers are currently
busy with roofing, cladding and internal partition and so on.
</P>
<P>
A contractor said they are "almost through with utilities like
water, electricity and telecommunications."
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Trust Fund of Nigeria, which financed the trade
fair complex expansion work, had set February 28 as the deadline for
the construction work, but there have been some delays due to
financial and other problems.
</P>
<P>
There would be no fear that the trade fair, jointly organized
by the Organization of African Unity and African Economic
Community, would be cancelled, postponed or have its venue
changed, said Nigeria's official newspaper, the New Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
It added that exhibitors are already rushing to secure spaces
for "the biggest commercial exhibition in Africa in the 20th
century."
</P>
<P>
Dau said 10,000 square meters of indoor exhibition space and
40,000 square meters of outdoor space would be available at the
fair ground.
</P>
<P>
The complex would be thrown open later this week for
businesses to set up their pavilions, which must be ready on or
before March 26.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Establishment of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
today called for the establishment of a Palestinian state in the
Middle East region, the UAE's official news agency WAM reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the Visiting former U.S. senator George
Mitcheele this morning, the UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh
Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan underlined the necessity to give the
Palestinians legal rights and called for the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state on the Palestinian land, WAM said.
</P>
<P>
The call comes after a decision by the Israeli government on
February 26 to build thousands of new Jewish homes in the now
undeveloped Har Homa area on the southern edge of East Jerusalem,
which has sparked world criticism.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister reiterated his country's condemnation
against the Israeli settlement policy, saying the policy did not
serve peace in the Middle East region and Israel should stop such
policy and abide by the peace agreements signed between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan
bin Zayed Al Nahyan also blasted the Israeli policy on Saturday,
Saying it "is destroying peace opportunities and disturbing the
security and stability in the Middle East region".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East peace process, the deputy prime
minister told Mitcheele that more international efforts should be
made for the achievement of a comprehensive and just peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts should focus on imposing more pressure on
Israel until it returns to the peace track for the stability
in the region, WAM said.
</P>
<P>
Mitcheele, who has been the advisor of the U.S. President Bill
Clinton for the Northern Ireland Affairs, is paying a
two-day Private visit to the UAE and he will leave here Monday, an
official from the U.S. embassy in the UAE said.

<HEADLINE> Mass Rally for Ex-Gurkhas' Welfare Demands Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Around 10,000 people gathered
here today in a mass rally to show their support for retired
British Gurkha soldiers in Nepal, who have been pressing for
welfare benefits from the British government.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of major political parties in the country attended the
mass rally in an open-air theater in downtown Kathmandu, which was
organized by the Ex-Gurkha Servicemen's Organization.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants of the rally were thousands of
ex-Gurkhas soldiers, who had served in the British Army's Gurkha
Brigade, and their families from across the country.
</P>
<P>
Retired Gurkha soldiers in Nepal started a movement three years
ago to demand equal pensions and facilities as those for their
British counterparts from the British government.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Gurkha Servicemen's Organization here last year
submitted a memorandum to British Prime Minister John Major
demanding for increased pensions, employment opportunities for
their children and rights to live in Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, the British authorities so far has not given a clear
reply to the welfare demands of the ex-Gurkha soldiers, sources of
the organization said.
</P>
<P>
The British government last month announced a one-million-pound
package program to pay serving Gurkha soldiers same salaries as
their British counterparts and allow their families to accompany
them.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the new measures on serving Gurkhas' treatment,
ex-Gurkha servicemen here urged the British government to make
similar arrangements to solve their welfare problems.
</P>
<P>
There are about 25,000 ex-Gurkhas throughout Nepal, who are
receiving monthly pensions ranging from 30 to 130 US dollars,
according to the British Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
The Gurkha Brigade of the British Army has a 183-year-old
history since Britain began recruiting Nepali youths for its
British Indian Army in early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Nepali soldiers, mostly from northern
Nepal's mountainous areas, had served in the British Army since
then and about 15,000 of them lost their lives during World War I
and II.

<HEADLINE> China's Ping'an Second Only to People's Insurance in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Recent data show that China's
Ping'an Insurance Company has become the country's second largest
insurer, after the state-owned People's Insurance Company of
China, and has 14 percent of the total shares of the domestic
insurance market.
</P>
<P>
According to the company's annual report, it surpassed
Shanghai's Pacific Ocean Insurance Company last year in overall
business and was in second place among the three giant insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
The company has drawn up an ambitious plan to increase sales to
20 billion yuan this year, with business income in life insurance
expected to hit 13 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company was established in Shenzhen in 1988 and is the
youngest among the three giants, having witnessed the rapid growth
in the business throughout China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The company's profits last year topped 10.5 billion
yuan. Profits from life insurance alone saw a sharp increase last
year over 1995, reaching 7.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China's insurance industry will expand quickly
since both of the country's economy and people's annual incomes
have been increasing. Life insurance will be a big slice of
China's insurance pie in coming years, about 100 billion yuan of
which will be generated by profits by the year 2000, experts say.
</P>
<P>
All insurance companies in China have started competing for a
larger share of the market in the country's major cities.
</P>
<P>
In the Beijing Insurance market, Ping'an has controlled 50
percent of the local market for two successive years, generating
one billion yuan in profits last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Non-Oil Exports Rise Slightly in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's non-oil exports rose
slightly in 1996, "Guardian", a major Nigerian newspaper,
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted privisional figures provided by the Federal
Produce Inspection Service (FPIS) as saying that a total of
362,233.8 tons of various agricutlural products were exported
last year, 4.9 percent up from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's agricultural exports include cocoa beans, palm
kernal cake, sesane seed, rubber, cashew nuts, coffee, ginger,
palm oil, streanuts, kolanuts and others, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa continued to be the leading non-oil export of Nigeria,
accounting for 46 percent of the total, or 25 percent up from the
1995 figure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It, however, noted that the performance of most of the other export
commodities is not so impressive.
</P>
<P>
For example, cashew nuts, the country's next most important
non-oil export after cocoa, recorded a slump of 19 percent from the
18,124 tons of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The export of palm kernel cake rose by 0.1 percent in 1996 to
124,113 tons, but the export of rubber dropped by 49 percent from
1995's 30,600 tons.
</P>
<P>
Other exports such as coffee, ginger and groundnuts all improved
slightly from their respective figures in 1995, but the export of
palm oil, reading three tons in 1995, decreased to none last year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It has been the goal of the Nigerian government to promote the
export of its non-oil products, but to date, oil still accounts for 97
percent of the country's export and 83 percent of the government's
budgetary revenue.

<HEADLINE> Ethical, Moral Education among Migrating Workers Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nine members of China's advisory
body have made an official proposal to bolster ethical and moral
education among migrating workers from China's vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Led by Xu Weicheng, a Standing Committee member of the Eighth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), which in its fifth session here, the nine
consultative advisors said that in some cities the relevant
departments have failed to include the ethical and moral education
of migrating workers in their work agenda because they are not
permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
"This is a weak link in building up socialist ethical and
cultural civilization," the members share the view in the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the members recently show that there are
80 million migrating workers across China and 80 percent of them
are rural men and women aged from 18 to 35, with 70 percent only
having a primary or junior middle school education.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them are busy making money, without knowing much about
major national issues and and relevant laws, and some criminals on
the run often sneak into among them," the proposal said.
</P>
<P>
"It is of overriding significance for China to increase ethical
and moral education among this group of people in an effort to
promote socialist ethical and cultural progress," the members said
in the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Easier access to books, newspapers, and radio and television
broadcasting, and other essential conditions should be provided
for these rural-sourced migrating workers, and their children
should be given an opportunity for schooling, the members
suggested.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Image of Monkey King Found in China's Dunhuang Grottos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A fragment of a wall painting in
the Dunhuang Grottos in northwest China's Gansu Province just may
be the earliest image of a well-known figure from an ancient
legend about the Monkey King helping a senior monk bring Buddhist
classics from India.
</P>
<P>
In the painting, the Monk Xuanzang is depicted as putting his
palms together to greet Samantabhadra, the Bodhisattva of
Universal Benevolence, while the Monkey King leads a white horse
behind him by the sea.
</P>
<P>
The painting, which was made some 800 years ago, has finely
depicted hairs on the Monkey King's face, according to Duan
Wenjie, an artist and director of the Institute of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Grottos, which include the Mogao Grottos, the
Yulin Grottos, and the Ten-thousand Buddha Caves, were built from
the 6th to the 14th century. There are some 2,000 colored statues
and over 40,000 sq.m. of wall paintings there and they are on the
World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
According to Duan, there are six pictures in the Grottos
depicting the legend, partly because a popular story has it that
local officials helped the monk go westward instead of detaining
him in accordance with imperial verdict when Xuanzang passed the
area in 629.
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that it took 10 years for
Xuanzang to walk the distance that it took him to get the Buddhist
classics in India.
</P>
<P>
The first image of the monkey King helping Xuanzang get the
Buddhist classics, according to historical documents, was in
murals at the Shouning Temple in Yangzhou city in 1036, 300 years
earlier than the novel "The Journey to the West" which made the
legend even more popular.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the temple was destroyed and no copies of the
image remain, so "Thus the wall painting in Dunhuang is probably
the oldest extant," Duan said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Fertilizer of Poorest Quality: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Fertilizer used in Nigeria is of the
poorest quality in terms of nutrients content in the west African
sub-region, a recent study shows.
</P>
<P>
The research carried out by the International Fertilizer
Development Center-Africa, based in Lome, said that this is likely a
result of poor process control and poorly size-matched raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
The research analyzed fertilizer samples from Benin, Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Togo, and found that 43
percent of them are nutrient deficient.
</P>
<P>
"The percentage of nutrient deficient samples was highest in
Nigeria while it was zero in Benin and Ghana," the report said.
</P>
<P>

serious problems in the sub-region. As high as 58 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Rural Medical Care Emphasized by CPPCC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- College graduates should be
encouraged today to work in rural medical care institutions
to improve medical conditions in China's vast countryside.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion is raised in a proposal submitted to the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in session now in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by CPPCC National Committee members from
the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, one of the
eight non-communist parties, whose members come mainly from
medical, scientific and educational circles.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided that rural China is the
focus of development for medical care, the proposal says.
</P>
<P>
The proposal says preferential policies should be formulated to
encourage more graduates from colleges and secondary vocational
schools to work in rural medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
More fund should be pooled for use to improve medical
conditions in poverty-stricken areas, the proposal says. It also
calls for people to donate for these areas for the improvement of
medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to the members, poor medical care in the countryside
is a striking problem in today's China. Close to 80 percent of the
Chinese population live in the countryside. Many rural residents
cannot afford to see doctors and some have been stricken by
poverty owing to illness.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Leaves Cairo for Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat left Cairo this morning for the
U.S. after a two-day visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the latest developments of conditions in the occupied
Palestinian territories, including the effects of Israel's recent
decision to set up a new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem on the
peace process.
DPA177PAB067I02TEQU19:4919:501213
</P>
<P>
Arafat also attended a emergency meeting of the Arab League
Council held here yesterday evening at the permanent
representatives level to discuss Israeli settlement in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency of Egypt today quoted diplomatic
sources in Washington as saying that the talks Chairman Arafat
is going to have with American President Bill Clinton will focus
on ways of tackling the Israeli government's decision to construct
a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. hopes Arafat's upcoming visit to Washington, due to
start today, will lead to overcoming that serious problem
obstructing the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that among the other issues that to be
dealt by Arafat's talks in the U.S. is the international
economic assistance to the PNA, as well as ways of putting
pressure on Israel to go ahead with constructing an
airport and a seaport in Gaza City, to open the security
pass between Gaza Strip and the West Bank and to reaffirm its
commitment to the withdrawals scheduled in accordance with the
recent Hebron accord.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Still to Boom: British Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A British newspaper said today that
China's economic prospects are still good after the death of
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sign anywhere in the collective leadership that
anything will be done to disturb or change the broad thrust of
economic policy begun by Deng," said an article carried in the
Sunday Business.
</P>
<P>
"This will be comforting to the 2,000 or so British companies
who are now doing business in Hong Kong or on the Chinese
mainland, said the article written by Tony Hunt.
</P>
<P>
"Twelve years ago, Beijing had only one five-star hotel and a
lot of rural tenements deep within the city. Today the city has
between 30 and 40 internationally recognized five-star hotels and
the city rocks to a building program that goes on day and night as
the capital struggles to keep pace with a national economic growth
rate of over 9 percent."
</P>
<P>
Hunt suggested that "If you are in business, China is the least
sleep-inducing place on earth."
</P>
<P>
The article also quoted Anthony Russell, a banking analyst at
James Capel, as saying that "Over the last several years China has
jumped from 25th to 10th place in terms of world trade. That is
very significant. But even more significant is China's
determination to expand its share of world trade by one-third,
about 100 billion U.S. dollars, over the next four years. Every
British company should be interested in that."
</P>
<P>
Russell believes more direct investment will have to come from
Europe. "Long-term direct investment will increase Europe's share
of this expansion," he said.

units in efforts to strengthen security in the Isles.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Papers Highlight Chinese Government Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- All Hong Kong's major newspapers
today highlighted the government work report delivered by Chinese
Premier Li Peng on Saturday at the opening ceremony of the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po frontpaged a red banner reading "China carries
forward Deng's cause to make steady progress," and a vertical
headline "Li Peng says the future of Hong Kong will be even
brighter." Its commentary said that this year's government work
report shows that China will continue to push forward the great
cause of reform and open-up, launched by Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping, who passed away 10 days before the start of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily comments that "to make
advancement in a steady way" is the fundamental tone throughout
the government work report, and will be the leading aim of China's
economic development this year.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that "stability", which is the prerequisite
for "growth", is essential to the two great affairs to take place
in 1997, namely the return of Hong Kong to China and the 15th
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Daily News said Hong Kong people are becoming more
and more confident in the future when they hear that Chinese
leaders stress once and again that the principle of "one country,
two systems" will by no means change.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao said the concept of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong People governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy will ensure a better future for Hong Kong after July 1,
1997. The Chinese daily also commented on the reform of the
state-owned enterprises, which will top the agenda of economic
restructuring this year. "It shows that the Chinese government has
made great determination to solve the problems concerning
state-owned business," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Daily's commentary said that smooth development is
conducive to the economic and social construction in
China.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies on Rural Labor Flow (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Legislators attending the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing
agreed that the government has scored marked progress in
controlling the huge population flow caused by the influx of
job-seeking farmers into cities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter half of the 1980s, a large number of rural
surplus laborers from central and western China have poured into
the country's prosperous coastal area to find jobs and make money.
</P>
<P>
This kind of labor flow involves over 80 million people a year.
While helping promote economic prosperity, it has also added
pressure on urban traffic and posed difficulties for city
management.
</P>
<P>
The issue of migrant workers repeatedly appeared in bills
submitted to the past NPC sessions, but this year it is no longer
a hop topic among the legislators.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the efforts of governments at all levels, the
situation has changed remarkably with a more orderly outflow of
migrant workers from our province," said Deputy Xie Shijie, Party
secretary of southeast China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
As China's most populous province, Sichuan is the country's
number one source of migrant workers, whose number exceeded 6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
Xie, also an expert of agriculture, pointed out that the
problem of migrant population usually turns worst during the
traditional Spring Festival period, when migrant workers going
home for a family reunion exert high pressure on the country's
underdeveloped transportation system.
</P>
<P>
"This year we cooperated with other provinces, and persuaded 60
percent of the migrant workers from Sichuan to stay where they
were during the Spring Festival," Xie said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies on Rural Labor Flow (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputies from Guangdong Province in southeast China and
Shanghai in east China said that the local governments have taken
effective measures to ensure the orderly flow of migrant workers,
who have contributed greatly to their local economies.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province, which has a migrant population of over 10
million, in recent years has made every effort to improve its
labor market, and established more than 1,000 employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ye Gongqi, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of
the Municipal People's Congress of Shanghai, said that with over
one million temporary workers from elsewhere, Shanghai has adopted
a series of measures, such as issuance of local work permits and
regular release of employment information, to strengthen the
management of migrant population.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the local people's congress last year passed
regulations on the management of migrant population, in order to
protect their legal rights and interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
A dozen provinces and municipalities that are major sources of
migrant workers also set up offices in Shanghai to handle labor
affairs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered at the opening ceremony
of the current NPC session, Premier Li Peng pointed out that a
reasonable and orderly flow of some surplus rural labor to
cities and economically developed regions is the need of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the government encourages those farmers
who have become skillful in various fields and who have
gained managerial experience to return to their hometowns to
start new businesses there and to assist in the endeavor to
shake off poverty and become prosperous.
</P>
<P>
While agreeing to the premier's ideas, some deputies said that
the fundamental way to solve the problem of population flow is to
strengthen the economic development in those sources of migrant
workers, especially in poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Peng Fusheng, a local legislator of Chongqing City, pointed out
that it is still an arduous task to achieve a completely
reasonable and orderly flow of rural surplus labor.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the Chinese population live in
vast rural areas, and official statistics put the size of rural
surplus labor at 130 million. The figure is estimated to rise to
around 200 million by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> Former Liberian Warlords Resign for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Three former Liberian rival warlords,
Charles Taylor, Alhaji Kromah and George Boley, have resigned from the
ruling Council of State, Liberia's interim government, to contest for
the presidency in the general elections scheduled for May this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, all the three resigned the
post of vice-chairman in the council late on Friday before a February
28 midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
Their resignation went in compliance with the terms of the peace
accord signed last August in the Nigerian capital of Abuja that
government officials aiming to contest the May 30 polls should quit
their positions.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord was signed by the former rival warring factions to
end the seven-year-old civil war in the West African country, during
which more than 150,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Taylor announced his resignation at a press conference, while
Kromah and Boley made theirs in separate statements on national radio,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor named former Information Minister Victoria Reffell as his
replacement, while Boley and Kromah appointed Weade Wureh and Vamba
Kanneh as respective successors in the Interim Council of State.
</P>
<P>
Until their appointments late on Friday, Kanneh served as Minister
of Health and Social Welfare, while Wureh headed the the Liberia
Repatriation and Resettlement Commission, a government repatriation
agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators and government
advisors maintained that the future of Hong Kong will be more
splendid.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the motherland has been a hot topic
among deputies to the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC) and members of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, both
of which are in session here.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong will wash off the disgrace of the
Chinese nation that lasted 100 years and is a successful
application of the principle of "one country, two systems"
initiated by Deng Xiaoping, the deputies and members said.
</P>
<P>
They said that they are fully confident in Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Ling Qing, vice-chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of
the CPPCC National Committee, expressed his excitedness about Hong
Kong's return in some 120 days in a poem in praise of the return
of Hong Kong, which shakes off China's national shame as the
country has taken off.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Sze-man, an 83-year-old CPPCC member from Hong Kong, said
that many Hong Kong residents, who left to reside overseas
earlier, have returned, and this epitomized the people's
confidence in the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He Guoqiang, a NPC deputy and acting governor of eastern Fujian
Province, said that Hong Kong's return will consolidate its
economic links with the interior area.
</P>
<P>
Leading Chinese officials also talked of the Hong Kong issue
extensively in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Joining CPPCC members representing Hong Kong and Macao,
President Jiang Zemin said that one big event this year is China's
resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong and
bringing Hong Kong to a more prosperous and stable future in
accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems", "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
"We must carry forward at the behest of Deng Xiaoping and do a
good job with matters related to Hong Kong and Macao," Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
When he was delivering a work report Saturday, Premier Li Peng
used the word "will" three times to pledge the resolve of his
government to ensure a smooth transfer of Hong Kong and to
maintain the prosperity and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of 'one country, two systems' will be crowned with
success, and Hong Kong will maintain long-term prosperity and
stability and its future will surely be even brighter," he said.
</P>
<P>
A fairly lengthy part of the CPPCC National Committee's work
report also covers the issue of Hong Kong's return, saying that
one major task of the advisory body this year is to "actively
support and assist the Central Government in the work concerning
the transfer of government in Hong Kong and the celebration of the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland".
</P>
<P>
Since the first chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region and the Provisional Legislative Council have
been elected and the leading officials of the government of the
Hong Kong SAR have been appointed by the Central Government,
people have every reason to believe that Hong Kong's future is
bright and its tomorrow will be more splendid.

LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major's attempt to steady Tory
nerves suffered a huge setback on Saturday when it emerged that
several ministers are to defy the government's policy on a single
currency in their election addresses.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Diana, Princess of Wales, is to receive 75,000 pounds (about
123,000 U.S. dollars) in libel damages from the Express on Sunday
after the paper admitted it was hoaxed into claiming that she
would profit by more than one million pounds (about 1.64 million

The Observer:
</P>

-- Carrot and stick plans to keep Britain's unemployed youth
out of mischief will be announced by the Cabinet this week. One is

<HEADLINE> Thousands Demonstrate Over Nazi Army Exhibit in Munich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 German rightwing
extremists today took to the streets in the southern city of
Munich to protest against an exhibition on atrocities committed by
the German army during World War II, reports said here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 7,000 left-wing activists held a demonstration
to support the exhibition, which challenges the notion that the
German army had nothing to do with Nazi crimes during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 20 right-wing extremists were detained
for portraying outlawed Nazi symbols and three left-wing activists
were seized when trying to attack their opponents.
</P>
<P>
Rallies for and against the exhibition were called after the
exhibition had evoked widespread controversy and emotions in
Munich since the show opened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition used photographs, diaries and letters from
soldiers themselves to back up its theme that the regular army, as
well as the SS units -- the elite corps of the Nazi party usually
blamed for war crimes, participated in mass killings of Jews and
other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Some German conservatives said the show was considerably biased
as the German army, called the Wehrmacht in the Nazi era, simply
fulfilled its duty and did not play any role in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
An arch-conservative newspaper accused the exhibit of
"stripping millions of Germans of their honor".
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the exhibition, however, insisted that the
Wehrmacht was involved in war crimes, including the Holocaust,
even though not every ordinary soldier was a criminal.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the show on Monday, Munich's left-wing Social
Democratic (SPD) mayor, Christian Ude, also stressed that Germany
must not have any taboos on historical research and public debate.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 120,000 people from Germany and neighboring
Austria has visited the exhibition.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation for
the term "large and all-inclusive, small and all-inclusive"
mentioned in Chinese Premier Li Peng's government work report to
the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Under China's planned economic system in the past, all
localities blindly sought to build an industrial structure that
is inclusive of all products, and all businesses sought to have
the capability to perform all social functions.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this practice, much investment was put into
similar projects and facilities unnecessarily, resulting in a
serious waste of resources and funds.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report, Premier Li Peng suggested that
greater efforts be made to adjust the industrial structure to
solve this long-standing problem.

<HEADLINE> Price Hikes No Longer a Major Concern for Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Price hikes, which used to be a
major concern for Chinese legislators, have stopped being a hot
topic at the ongoing session of the Chinese legislature.
</P>
<P>
This is evident either when legislators spoke at group
discussions or when they expressed views individually in
interviews.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) are here
attending the fifth session of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Price hikes were a hot topic in the past few years. Inflation
stood at 13 percent in 1993 and rose to 21.7 percent in 1994
before coming down to 14.8 percent in 1995. Last year it dropped
to 6.1 percent, while the economy continued to surge, to result in
what people call a "successful soft landing."
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisheng, an NPC deputy from northeast China's Jilin
Province, said price control used to be a difficult issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is no easy feat for the government to drive down inflation
without choking economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China maintained a growth rate of 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Huang Enyuan from Liaoning Province attributed China's
successful economic soft landing to scientific decision-making by
the central government as well as a series of macroeconomic
control and tight financial and monetary policies implemented over
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, however, continues to be a major concern for the
Chinese premier, Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report he delivered at the opening
meeting of the NPC session, Li listed a series of measures to
contain price rises. It is a long-term task to rationalize price
relations, requiring both a positive altitude and a reliable
approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should by no means relax control over price rises, as
pressure from inflation still exists and our agriculture is
still weak," said the Chinese premier, who called for continued
implementation of a tight financial and monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Accepts Partially UN Resolution on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has promised to the United States that the
UN Resolution 242 would be partially applicable to the Golan
Heights, a newspaper report said today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the promise at the personal request by U.S.
President Bill Clinton during their White House summit last
month, the English daily The Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu added a proviso to his concession: Israel
must retain its traditional interpretation of Resolution 242,
which calls for Israel's pullout from lands it seized in the
1967 War.
</P>
<P>
Israel's interpretations of the resolution means relinquishing
some but not necessarily all of the territory. In other words,
Netanyahu appeared to be agreeing to the idea of territorial
compromise on the Golan Heights, but not full withdrawal, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Washington last month, Netanyahu said he
would seek a "bridging formula" as a basis for resuming
talks with Syria, but has failed to disclosed what it was
since he returned from the trip.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Netanyahu's position has been that talks with
Syria should begin "without preconditions." The ruling Likud
party has consistently refused to say that Resolution 242
applies directly to the Golan Heights, which Israel captured
from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been demanding the talks be resumed from where
they left off last year: Israel should reconfirm the
commitments made by the previous Labor government to the full
withdrawal from Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government led by the slain Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin reportedly agreed to the full pullout from Golan
on condition that adequate security arrangements would be made
to ensure Israel's safety.
</P>
<P>
But the Netanyahu government has turned down Syria's request,
saying it would never recognize the informal understandings
reached between the Labor government and Syria. And former
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher supported the Israeli
position, saying that unsigned statements were not legally
binding.

<HEADLINE> Neolithic Tribe Site Found in Reservoir Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A tribe site with a group of tombs
dating back 5,000 years have been found in the construction area
of a reservoir on the Yellow River in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have unearthed 56 of the tombs including
one for a young man wearing a big ivory ring. The tomb, four m by
five m, is the largest neolithic tomb ever found in the country.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that the burial articles found in the tombs
suggest a male-dominating tribe making unique pottery.
</P>
<P>
The buried pottery include tri-pots, jars with a long neck and
pots with a big mouth.
</P>
<P>
To the north of the tomb group located the residential area,
storages and stone tool-making workshops.
</P>
<P>
The site, Zhouli in Mianchi county, is quite different from
nearby sites from the same period in terms of social structure,
the experts say.
</P>
<P>
For instance, they say, people enjoyed more equal social status
in the Xishan city, China's earliest city site ever found.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was the uniqueness that made the discovery of the
Zhouli site among China's Top Ten Archaeological Finds last year.
</P>
<P>
The Zhouli site is just one of some 100 tribal sites and tombs
groups from the Late Stone Age (10,000-3,000 years ago) that were
found in the construction area of Xiaolangdi Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The area, extending some 100 km, will be submerged when the
reservoir is formed. Archaeologists are racing against time to dig
up relics dating from as early as the Peiligang Culture some
7,000-8,000 years ago to the early 1900s in the area to be
submerged.

increase the supply of housing in cities and towns, promote
housing reform, and realize the goal of providing eight sq m of
housing floor space for each urban resident on average by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to the project, 150 million sq m of housing will be
built to solve the housing problem for medium- and low-income
families between 1995 and 2000, and a housing supply system will
be gradually established.
</P>
<P>
The project is being carried out in more than 80 cities across
China. By October of 1996, the state had invested 37.5 billion
yuan in the project, building 43.59 million sq m of housing.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation of the
system of provincial governors assuming responsibility for the
"rice bag," a term mentioned in Chinese Premier Li Peng's
government work report to the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
To ensure stable market supply of grain, the central government
requires that the government heads of provinces, autonomous
regions and centrally-administered municipalities assume the
responsibility of maintaining grain supplies for their respective
areas.
</P>
<P>
In detail, a governor must see to it that his province:
</P>
<P>
- Keeps a stable area of grain fields and a grain reserve level
meeting demand and increase grain yield;
</P>
<P>
- Fulfils the grain purchase target, and grain and oil reserve
plan set by the central government, and local grain purchase
plans;
</P>
<P>
- Establishes a local risk fund for grain reserve;
</P>
<P>
- Meets the target for inter-province grain flow target set by
the central government if the province is a major grain producer,
or fulfils the target of importing grain or buying grain from
other provinces if the province is not self-sufficient in grain
supply.

the "Vegetable Basket" (19)
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation for
the system of city mayors assuming responsibility for the
"vegetable basket," a term mentioned in Chinese Premier Li Peng's
government work report delivered at the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
To ease strains on the supply of vegetables and foodstuffs in
the country, China's Ministry of Agriculture initiated the
so-called "vegetable basket project" in 1988, which aims to:
improve production and marketing of vegetables and foodstuffs,
develop and utilize land resources rationally, adjust the
structure of supply and demand of such products, popularize
production techniques, and improve basic facilities, all for the
purpose of increasing the supplies of vegetables and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The central government requires that mayors shoulder the
responsibility of properly filling residents' baskets with
vegetables and foodstuffs, to make a success of the project.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1996, the output of meat, dairy products, eggs,
aquatic products, fruits and vegetables increased remarkably,
helping better the quality of urban people's life.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average amount of meat, aquatic products,
vegetables and the average number of eggs available for each
Chinese reached or exceeded the world's average.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Moderates to Form New Political Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of moderate liberals
in Kuwait are in their final stages to form a new political
movement in the small Gulf state, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
English daily Arab Times, citing a reliable source, reported
the move, but it did not say when the new political group would be
set up.
</P>
<P>
The source, whose name was not given, said that the new
movement would consist of prominent Kuwaiti businessmen and
intellectuals, and it is currently in the final stage of
"shaping" itself.
</P>
<P>
He said all those aligned to the movement believed that
"the time is right for such a movement to come out and
represent the moderates" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Political parties are banned in Kuwait which has been ruled
by the Sabah Royal family. But more than half a dozen of
political groups representing different walks of life exist and
they are in the forms of various movements and societies.
</P>
<P>
The source said that once the new movement comes into
existence, "it will attract a lot of Kuwaitis who have been
unable to find representation in any of the existing movements
in Kuwait, especially because this movement adheres to
liberalizing the attitude and a free market economy."
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Gulf War in 1991 when Kuwait was
liberated from the Iraqi occupation, Islamists have dominated the
country's political scene, occupying the majority of Parliamentary
seats in two general elections, the last of which was conducted
last October.
</P>
<P>
The source stressed that the objective of the moderates'
movement was aimed at a representation for those who still
have not found their place in Kuwait's democratic process.
</P>
<P>
He also said the movement did not mean to confront anyone
or anything.
</P>
<P>
However, various fundamentalist Islamic groups in the country
have been a strong opposition force against democratic reform
process, calling for restoration to a thorough implementation of
the Islamic Sharia (law) in various fields of the society.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Transfer Payment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation to
transfer payment, a term mentioned in Premier Li Peng's government
work report to the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
China's central government was able to transfer part of its
fiscal revenue to grass-root governments following considerable
changes in distribution of fiscal revenues between the central
government and local governments after China introduced the
revenue-sharing system in 1994, hence transfer payment in China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's transfer payment includes mainly tax returns
and special fiscal allocations to the grass-root. The new system
is significant in guaranteeing the basic expenditure need of local
governments and in optimizing the distribution of social
resources, improving the industrial structure and ensuring
balanced economic development among all regions.
</P>
<P>
As the central treasury is still plagued by a fairly large
deficit and debt burden, the Chinese government is fiscally
restrained in transferring payments at present.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation to a
policy term on turning fiscal allocations into loans mentioned in
Chinese Premier Li Peng's government work report to the Fifth

</P>
<P>
Qualified Chinese enterprises in some selected areas were
allowed to turn the outstanding principle and interest of loans
for budgeted basic constructions, which are turned from fiscal
allocations between 1979 and 1988, into capital funds, according
to a three-ministry decision approved by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The policy was limited to two enterprises of cities selected to
improve the capital structure on a trial basis, to cities selected
for experiment with comprehensive reforms, to cities designated by
the State Council to establish a modern enterprise system, and to
the leading enterprises of some designated conglomerates and their
subsidiaries or stake-controlling enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Tight Fiscal &AMP; Monetary Policies (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation to the
relatively-tight fiscal and monetary policies mentioned in Chinese
Premier Li Peng's government work report to the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
China began to implement a relatively-tight fiscal and monetary
policy as of the later half of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-1995) to curb excessive growth in fiscal expenditures and
total credits and to eventually alleviate inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Under the relatively-tight fiscal policy, a strict control is
slapped on fixed-asset investment and consumption funds to cut
fiscal deficits. The relatively-tight monetary policy imposes a
squeeze on total credits to reduce the rise in the money supply
below the combination of China's economic growth and inflation
rates.
</P>
<P>
The tight policies have played a significant role in ensuring a
sustained, rapid and healthy development of the Chinese economy,
helping bring down the retail price index to 6.1 percent last year
from 21.7 percent in 1994.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation to
China's tax rebate policy, which was mentioned today by Chinese
Premier Li Peng in his government work report to the Fifth Session
of the Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
China first began to pay tax rebates to exporters on a full
scale in April 1985. The policy was fine-tuned in 1988 and 1994,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's tax rebates to exports
have grown rapidly over the past years, from 1.98 billion yuan in
1985 to 11.3 billion yuan in 1988 and 82.6 billion yuan last year,
which was up 50.5 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The tax rebate policy has significantly helped to boost China's
foreign trade, which reached 289.9 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxation said last month that China
will not make any major changes to its policy on tax rebates this
year.

<HEADLINE> EU Team To Inspect Mwanza Fish Processing Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A team of experts from the
European Union (EU) is expected to arrive in Tanzania this month to
inspect fish fillet plants in the Lake Victoria Zone, the local
paper "Sunday Observer" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said some members of the EU recently imposed a
partial ban on exports of fish fillet from Uganda, as the EU
mission had already inspected 21 fish fillet plants in Uganda,
disqualifying 19 of them from the business.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the 19 fish processing plants, which were said
to produce fish fillets detrimental to human health, had created
fear in the EU market, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The EU mission would undertake the same task in Kagera, Mara
and Mwanza regions of Tanzania and present its findings to relevant
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza has eight fish fillet plants so far.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Spain, Greece and Italy, all EU members countries,
had imposed a ban on imports of fish fillet from Tanzania
allegedly because they were a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
Reports further said Spain had conducted laboratory examinations
and found that fish fillet produced in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya
were a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, Tanzania is losing 2,000 million Tanzania
Shillings (about 3.33 million USD) a month from exports of 1,250
tonnes of fish fillet.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: "One Country, Two Systems" (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is a brief explanation
for the term "one country, two systems" mentioned in Premier Li
Peng's government work report delivered at the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress:
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" was first put forth
by Deng Xiaoping. Since the 3rd plenum of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), it has gradually
come to maturity and become a fundamental national policy of
China.
</P>
<P>
It was first proposed for the solution of the Taiwan question.
At a meeting with American visitors in February of 1984, Deng
Xiaoping for the first time used the term "one China, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
He said: "The way we've proposed for the reunification of
Taiwan and the mainland is reasonable. After the reunification,
Taiwan can continue to practice its capitalism, while the mainland
maintains the socialist system. But there must be only one unified
China. This principle can also be applied to the Hong Kong
problem."
</P>
<P>
The report on the work of the government passed by the Second
Session of the Sixth National People's Congress (NPC) in May,
1984, formally used the term "one China, two systems" to summarize
the CPC's principle for the solution of the Taiwan and Hong Kong
questions and the motherland's reunification. Later, the
expression was changed to "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of the People's Republic of China enacted in
1982 stipulates that, if necessary, the state can set up special
administrative regions, whose social systems would be decided by
the NPC through legislation according to specific circumstances.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1992, Jiang Zemin, general-secretary of the CPC
Central Committee, reaffirmed that the principle of "one country,
two systems" is not an expedient measure, but a long-term national
policy that will be unswervingly pursued.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Commitment System for Public Services (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng mentioned the
commitment system for public service sector in his government work
report to the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress. Hereby is a brief introduction of this system:
</P>
<P>
Under such a commitment system, institutions with public
service functions should set strict criteria for the content,
standards, and procedures of their service, as well as the
deadline for completing the service and the liabilities.
</P>
<P>
It is also required that the institution set up a supervisory
agency, open a complaint hotline, and punish any employee failing
to fulfill the commitment.
</P>
<P>
The system was first adopted by the construction sector in
Yantai, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Province in June,
1994. After being proved to be very successful, it was introduced
by the Ministry of Construction to the water supply, gas supply,
and public transportation sectors in 36 major cities across the
country in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1996, the Publicity Department of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the State Council,
China's cabinet, co-hosted a forum participated by eight principal
ministries and state commissions to promote this system.
</P>
<P>
In November this year, the Ministry of Internal Trade and many
other units in the service sector across the country followed the
example of Yantai and the Ministry of Construction to adopt the
commitment system.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following is a brief explanation
for the term "nationwide fitness campaign" mentioned by Premier Li
Peng in his government work report to the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress:
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched in 1995 according to a nationwide
physical health enhancement plan formulated by the State Physical
Culture and Sports Commission in 1993 and approved by Premier Li
Peng in June, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which targets the entire people with an emphasis on
youth and children, is intended to effect a marked improvement for
the general health of the people, and create better conditions for
physical exercises and sports activities of the masses.
</P>
<P>
The "nationwide fitness campaign" is divided into two phases,
and will cover a time span of 15 years (1995-2010).
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have included the "nationwide fitness
plan" in the country's overall plan for national economic
development and social progress.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: "To Grasp with Both Hands And with Equal Emphasis"(8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- In his government work report to
the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress,
Premier Li Peng used the expression of "to grasp with both hands
and with equal emphasis." Following is a brief explanation of the
expression.
</P>
<P>
"To grasp with both hands" means to seize two links at the same
time. One is the material progress, the other is the ethical and
cultural progress. "To grasp with equal emphasis" refers to
attaching equal emphasis to the promotion of the socialist
material progress and of the socialist ethical and cultural
progress, and that the material progress should not be pursued at
the expense of the ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the material progress refers to the
improvement of the people's material life, while the ethical and
cultural progress relies on the advancement of people's wisdom and
morality.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping once said: "The socialist ethical and cultural
progress not only refers to education, science, and culture, but
also includes the Communist ideology, ideals, beliefs, morality,
and discipline, the revolutionary stand and principles, and the
comradeship between the people."

<P>
"Hong Kong needs the backing of Guangdong and the interior area
in science and technology, while Guangdong needs Hong Kong's
capital and managerial experience," he noted. "That's what I
called 'a new prospect of mutual complementarity and benefits'for
common development."
</P>
<P>
He said that the provincial government of Guangdong will
encourage industrial and commercial sectors of both sides to
strengthen exchange and cooperation that are mutually beneficial,
and will offer various kinds of easy accesses, especially in the
field of public facilities.
</P>
<P>
He went on to list three major advantages of his province in
developing economy.
</P>
<P>
"The Guangdong's gross domestic product accounts for more than
9 percent of the country's total, and the province is adjacent to
Hong Kong and Macao, and also radiative to Southeast Asia," he
said, adding that Guangdong is the ancestry home of approximately
20 million overseas Chinese, who have all been showing attention
to the province's development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, Guangdong's gross national product reached
some 610 billion yuan, 11 percent up from 1995. "Even by
conservative estimate, the economic growth rate for this year will
be maintained at around 10 percent," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
This year, he added, Guangdong will take the concept of
"seeking steady progress and pursuing effective growth" as
guideline, continue to advance a sustained, rapid and sound
development of economy and comprehensive social progress, and
further improve the people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in 1996, retail sales of social consumer
goods in Guangdong totalled 270 billion yuan, while average
per-capital annual incomes for urban and rural residents reached
7,488 and 3,183 yuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the inflation rate in Guangdong was 4.4 percent,
lower than the country's average, and 400,000 most needy in the
province are decently fed and clothed. Net assets of state-owned
enterprises in the province exceeded 260 billion yuan, more than
any other province or municipality in China.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- After its return to the embrace of
the motherland on July 1 this year, Hong Kong will have still

transit port for 80 percent of Guangdong's imports and exports
last year, which totalled 110 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 80 percent of the investment Guangdong obtained from
overseas since the beginning of reform and opening up in 1979 came
directly or indirectly from Hong Kong, and nearly 80 percent of
the province's overseas-funded enterprises were set up by Hong
Kong businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the Hong Kong brothers are returning home soon, our
cooperation will develop more smoothly," claimed Lu, who has long
beeen engaged in economic work.
</P>
<P>
Since Guangdong is the ancestral home of most Hong Kong
residents, he explained, people of the two places have similar
customs and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"Besides water supply, Guangdong also provides a considerable
volume of vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, and meat for Hong Kong
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong will retain its
capitalist system and lifestyle after 1997, different from the
socialist system practised in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the central government, however, Hong
Kong and Guangdong will not only maintain their existing economic
ties, but also create still better environment and favorable
conditions to promote such ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Guangdong, which is in a period of economic
readjustment, is willing to provide Hong Kong, which is making a
shift in the mode of economic growth, with an opportunity to
transfer its labor-intensive industries to the interior area.

<HEADLINE> Passport Leaking Worries Zambian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian passports are the most
prominent and marketable on the South African black market.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa in an
interview with ''Sunday Times of Zambia".
</P>
<P>
''We are aware about our passports selling on the black market in
South Africa and we have been in touch with our colleagues in that
country who have promissed to help us track the culprits,'' Sampa
said.
</P>
<P>
Zambians are involved in the racket in which a passport is
believed to be fetching about 460 US Dollars, according to Sampa.
</P>
<P>
Because of the seriousness of the problem, the Zambian High
Commissioner's Office in Pretoria has stopped issuing passports to
Zambians claiming they have lost their passports.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Deputy Minister Peter Muunga said he was shocked that
passports had continued leaking to foreigners even when officials
from the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Office of the President
were present at the passports offices.
</P>
<P>
Muunga said that some might be leaking from the passports offices
while some Zambians visiting South Africa were selling their
passports and later claiming they had lost them.
</P>
<P>
Last year in Lusaka alone, 59 foreigners of various nationalities
were arrested and prosecuted for illegal possession of Zambian
passports, according to Immigration Public Relations Officer
Catherine Poso, who also said many more had been arrested throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer at the passports office said that some of the
passports which were illegally issued had no records at the passports
office. enditem

TOKYO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Ai Sugiyama upset France's Mary
Pierce 7-5, 6-7 (7-9), 6-4 Sunday and pulled one point back for
Japan, keeping her team's Federation Cup hopes still alive.
</P>
<P>
France led 2-1 with two matches remaining. France's Nathalie
Tauziat will face Naoko Sawamatsu in another singles and then a
doubles match.
</P>
<P>
France had taken a 2-0 lead Saturday with victories by Pierce
over Sawamatsu and Tauziat over Sugiyama.
</P>
<P>
Sugiyama, ranked 29th on the WTA tour, ran up to a 5-1 lead and
then blundered through three games in which she won only two
points.
</P>
<P>
But with No. 12 Pierce serving at 4-5 to stay in the match,
Sugiyama scored her seventh break of the three-hour ten-minute
battle, cashing in her fifth match point when Pierce hit a
backhand wide.
</P>
<P>
Sugiyama took limelight at the Atlanta Olympic Games, beating
world top 10 players including Jana Novotna and Anke Huber and
Martina Hingis.
</P>

The two presidents also discussed issues of signing a free
trade agreement as early as possible and strengthening cultural
cooperation between the two countries.

Stoyanov also met with Hungarian Prime Minister Horn Gyula, who
said that Hungary would support Bulgaria in efforts to join the

<HEADLINE> Russia Barters Anti-missile Work for Larger NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to co-develop
theater missile defense capabilities with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) as a condition for agreeing to the
alliance's expansion plan, a U.S. news report said.
</P>
<P>
The collaboration on some of the alliance's sophisticated
weaponry would be part of "a quid pro quo for Russian
acquiescence" to NATO's enlargement, according to the March 3-9
issue of the weekly magazine Defense News.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was among a list of ideas in four documents
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov presented to NATO during
his private meeting early this week in Brussels with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted NATO and Russian diplomats as saying that
Moscow is looking for political and economic payoffs for agreeing
to NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Russian officials informally raised the prospect of
cooperating on theater missile defense in private conversations
with NATO officials last summer, and stepped up back-channel
discussions in recent weeks," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation military bloc and Russia are negotiating a
charter on their relationship after the alliance expanded into
Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has seen U.S.-led NATO as a threat to its
security after the dissolution of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in
1991 and therefore is strongly opposed to the expansion plan,
argues that the future NATO-Russia document should be legally
binding, providing it national security.
</P>
<P>
The charter could include an agreement on industrial
cooperation but is unlikely to address specifically theater
missiles defense, a senior NATO official was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Californian Airport Evacuates Passagers Scared by Toy Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 travelers were
evacuated and at least 20 flights were delayed today at the San
Jose International Airport, California, scared by a toy handgun,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Rosemary O'Kane, the airport spokeswoman, said, the evacuation
was caused after airport security reported a handgun in a backpack
brought in the airport.
</P>
<P>
Flights at the San Jose airport, located about 40 miles (64 km)
south of San Francisco, were put on hold for nearly three hours as
airport security searched for the weapon.
</P>
<P>
At last, security officials found that the alleged handgun
was a toy packed in a young boy's carry-on backpack.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused the postponement of at least 20 flights,
interfering with the travel plans of an estimated 4,000
passengers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reiterates Opposition to NATO's Expansion Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry stated
today that NATO's eastward expansion would create new dividing
lines in Europe and affect its stability and security.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
just-concluded Europe tour, the ministry said that the minister
had meetings and talks in London with British Prime Minister John
Major and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to mostly discuss NATO
expansion to the East and relations between Russia and NATO, as
well as a binding document between them.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in London, the last leg of the Russian
foreign minister's week-long trip, Primakov expressed satisfaction
with his trip to four European countries, describing it as
"positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Primakov meanwhile reiterated Moscow's opposition to NATO's
eastward enlargement plans and warned that "there were some things
to which Russia cannot agree, including the movement of NATO's
military infrastructure to the Russian border."
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted diplomatic sources in the
Russian delegation as saying that if NATO disagreed with
compromise on issues concerning Russian's security, Moscow may
have to sever its relations with the alliance, shift its foreign
policy focus to bilateral ties and change its diplomatic
priorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, Russia will exert all its efforts to
make NATO compromise on the new European security architecture.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Make Joint Efforts in Seeking Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has urged Southeast Asian countries to work as a group to
increase their bargaining power in fund seeking and strengthen
their muscles in crisis prevention.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus
when finance ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) held their first meeting in southern Thailand's
Phuket province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus wanted to see ASEAN members to form a group with its
own financial scheme to help some members solve their financial
problems before resorting to the IMF, according to local
newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus cited the example of the Mexico financial crisis
where the IMF was able to extend assistance because the other two
members of the North America Free Trade Agreement -- the United
States and Canada -- had extended help.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should create a mechanism similar to the IMF's new
arrangement to borrow scheme in which emergency credit of up to 48
billion US dollars has been available to its 25 members to
overcome financial problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
After succeeding in creating a free trade area, Camdessus said,
ASEAN countries should embark on a new area of cooperation by
making contributions to help member countries fight financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
For instance, ASEAN countries might agree not to withdraw the
fund from a particular country which is facing financial turmoil
for a certain period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chatu Mongol Sonakul, permanent secretary of the Thai Finance
Ministry, said that just one ASEAN member would be quite difficult
to obtain any financial assistance from the IMF since the approval
is subject to the representatives of 180 members.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Further Deficit Cut: Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China this year will continue to
follow an appropriately tight fiscal policy and take further
measures to reduce its deficit, according to Minister of Finance
Liu Zhongli.
</P>
<P>
"We should... continue to follow a relatively stringent
financial policy, promote readjustment and optimization of the
economic structure, tighten the collection and administration of
taxation in an all-round way," Liu said in a report to the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, China's
legislature that opened its annual meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liu proclaimed success in cutting deficit to 61 billion yuan by
the end of last year, which was 442 million yuan less than the
budgeted figure.
</P>
<P>
This year efforts will be made to ensure rapid growth in
revenue, control total expenditures and keep the increase in
expenditures below that in revenue, in order to further cut the
deficit and control the debt scale, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's state revenue this year is budgeted at 839.794 billion
yuan, up 14 percent over the actual figure for 1996, while total
expenditures are expected to grow 13.3 percent from the actual
figure for 1996 to 896.794 billion yuan, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
He said that revenue in the central budget is planned at
475.384 billion yuan, 50.0158 billion yuan more than the actual
figure for 1996, or an increase of 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures in the central budget will total 532.384 billion
yuan in 1997, 46.158 billion yuan more than the actual figure for
last year, or a rise of 9.5 percent, Liu told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"When the revenue and expenditures in the central budget are
compared, there will leave a deficit of 57 billion yuan, four
billion yuan less than the actual figure for 1996," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that expenditures in the central budget will rise
by four billion yuan as China needs to increase grain and cotton
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Another 2.5 billion yuan is needed to increase funding for
poverty relief and for transfer payment to areas inhabited by
ethnic groups and poverty-stricken areas, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong's return to the motherland and a
planned wage rise for employees of administrative departments and
institutions will also increase expenditures in the central
finance.
</P>
<P>
"Even under these circumstances, the central budget deficit is
expected to reduce by four billion yuan as compared with the
figure for 1996," Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese government's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), China will have basically eradicated fiscal deficit
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that China plans to issue 248.596
billion yuan in treasury bonds this year.

<HEADLINE> New Commercial Banks to Build More Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's new commercial banks will
create more branches in 1997 to further expand their business in
prosperous regions and major economic centers.
</P>
<P>
Their major battlefields will be in the areas such as the
Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, and big cities like
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, reported China Daily's Business
Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, whose business was originally
limited to the provinces along the Yangtze River, received
approval to build a Beijing branch last year. Now it is preparing
for a Chongqing branch.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Development Bank, which had focused its business
in Shenzhen, set up a branch in Hainan Province and several more
in other cities in Guangdong Province. A Beijing branch is planned
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 new commercial banks, including the expanding
regional banks and others designed to be national lending
institutions.
</P>
<P>
They were created after 1986 to compete with China's four
State-owned specialized banks -- the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China, the China construction Bank, Bank of China, and the
Agricultural Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
China's all-round financial reform required the "Big Four" to
transform into genuine commercial banks after 1994, putting the
four old-timers on the same performing stage with their fresh
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the new banks coincided with the four big
banks' withdrawal from areas in which business was slow.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Dai Xianglong said about 1,000 affiliates
of the "Big Four" were closed during the past year and officials
of the four banks said the move will continue in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Farmers Urged to Boost Paddy Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General Than
Shwe today urged farmers in the country to strive for boosting
production of paddy and other crops for both local sufficiency and
export.
</P>
<P>
In his message marking the 1997 Myanmar Peasants' Day which
falls on today, Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC), stressed the government is giving
priority to the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>

hectares with the aims for local sufficiency of rice keeping with
population growth of the country and boosting export of paddy.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that during the previous four-year plan period
(from 1992-93 to 1995-96), the annual paddy output was recorded at
17 million tons, the maximum, and 14 million tons, the minimum.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is implementing plans for expansion of
cultivation areas and boosting per-hectare yield and multiple
cropping to realize the targeted paddy output.
</P>
<P>
The government is also carrying out plans for local sufficiency
of edible oil within three years starting from the 1995-96 fiscal
year and making efforts for expansion of edible oil crop
cultivation area and boosting per-hectare yield, he said.
</P>
<P>
Encouragement and support are also being provided for extensive
cultivation of beans for export and industrial crops such as
cotton, sugar-cane, jute, rubber, coffee and mulberry, he added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that 75 dams have been built since 1988 when the
SLORC came to power, irrigating over 405,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The Senior-General called for mechanization systems for the
progress of agriculture and use of fertilizers to boost the output
of crops.

Saturday in Phuket, southern Thailand, according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to provide preparations for the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) which will take effect in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The results of the discussions will be submitted to an ASEAN
leaders conference that will be held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reaffirmed commitment to further liberalization
of financial service sectors as part of the deregulation and

<P>
ASEAN finance ministers agreed to meet on an annual basis and

The cooperation is expected to facilitate trade and investment
among the region, said Amnuay.

<HEADLINE> U.S. "Decertification" Not Affecting Economy, Says Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's economy has
not been affected by the U.S. "certification" denial of the
country's efforts against drugs, the National Exporters
Association of Colombia (Analdex) said today.
</P>
<P>
Analdex said during the first 11 months of 1996 the export
volume in the country reached 3.7 billion U.S. dollars, a 26
percent increase over 1995, while imports hit 4.803 billion
dollars, up 3.9 percent over the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
On March 1 last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton suspended
most U.S. aid to Colombia after concluding that the Colombian
government had failed to cooperate with the U.S. in the war on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
There were no losses of tariff preferences and no increase in
customs taxes, it said. Credits to the country continued to be
granted, though the pace of investments did not quicken, Analdex

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
stormed back from a set down to beat unseeded Dutch qualifier
Sjeng Schalken 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 Saturday and gained a berth in the
final of the 589,250-U.S.-Dollar Advanta ATP tournament in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Australian Open champion struggled but finally
won his 19th match in a row by overpowering his 20-year-old
88th-ranked opponent Schalken.
</P>
<P>
Schalken showed his power at the beginning and needed only 31
minutes to take the opening set, breaking Sampras three times.
</P>
<P>
But the top-seeded American took advantage of a long
cross-court backhand return by Schalken for a break in the 11th
game of the second set. Then he took the control and held the
match into a third set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras will now play Australian Davis Cup hero Pat Rafter in
the final. The 60th-ranked, 24-year-old Australian defeated South
Africa's Grant Stafford 6-3, 6-4 in the other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
It will be Rafter's first appearance in an ATP singles final in
three years. His last appearance in a final came in Manchester in
1994. He also reached the Hong Kong final earlier that year but
lost to Michael Chang.

Sampras will be bidding for a third victory in the Philadelphia
event on Sunday. He will also be seeking his third title of 1997
and the 47th of his career.

BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will urge Phnom Penh to
relax its ban on timer exports, according to a Thai National
Security Council (NSC) source.
</P>
<P>
The NSC Saturday agreed to the Thai Foreign Ministry holding
talks with the Cambodian side in an effort to find ways to help
Thai log importers affected by the ban, the source was quoted
today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
It will suggest that both countries draw up measures to allow
legal log trading in future, as well as to tighten inspections to
make sure that such logs were legally cut.
</P>
<P>
The source said this was designed to counter criticisms that
Thailand supported illegal logging and log smuggling, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia banned timber exports on December 31, 1996.

<P>
Entrusted by the State Council, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge
of the State Planning Commission, made a report on the
implementation of the 1996 Plan for National Economic and Social
Development and on the Draft 1997 Plan for National Economic and
Social Development, and Liu Zhongli, minister of finance, made a

</P>
<P>
Party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi,

meeting of the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
In his report on Implementation of the 1996 Plan for National
Economic and Social Development and on the Draft 1997 Plan for
National Economic and Social development, Chen Jinhua said China
achieved its goal for macroeconomic control and met the main
targets for national economy and social development in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The national economy scored a sustained and rapid growth last
year, while inflation was effectively curbed, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China met the goal that price rise should be
lower than the economic growth rate in the first year of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the retail prices nationwides rose 6.1 percent
last year, remarkably lower the initial target of some 10 percent
and eight percentage points lower than the increase last year; the
GDP reached 6779.5 billion yuan, an increase of 9.7 percent.

appropriate industrial growth; vigorously working to optimize the
investment structure; scaling down price rises; making better use
of overseas funds; maintaining financial stability; developing
science, technology and education; continuing to improve the
living standards of the people.

<HEADLINE> Effective Measures Needed to Cut Farmers' Burden: Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Chinese
legislature, the National People's Congress, are call for
effective measures to reduce the financial burden of farmers.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to cut the financial burden of farmers and
effective measures should be taken, deputies from central China's
Hubei Province said at a group discussion reviewing a government
work report Premier Li Peng delivered at the Fifth Session of the
Eighth NPC Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Zeng Shimin, an official with the agriculture office of
the Hubei provincial government, said that the issue of farmers'
burden can be resolved so long as measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
He said Hubei has established a responsibility system
obliging officials to take measures to reduce farmers' burden.
</P>
<P>
Hubei has taken resolute measures to eliminate unreasonable fees
and return to farmers money collected unreasonably, he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 900 kinds of charges have been eliminated
and over 60 million yuan in illegal fee collections returned to
farmers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Law and rule violations have also been investigated, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that measures have been taken to wipe out
rampant fund raising and forced buying of insurance.
</P>
<P>
"The once runaway situation of raising fund illegally and
collecting fees arbitrarily has been brought under control," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhijie, secretary of Hubei provincial Party committee, said
that whenever the enthusiasm of farmers is hurt, agriculture will
be affected.
</P>
<P>
He contributed Hubei's record grain output last year, at 24.844
million tons, partly to the effort to protect farmers' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
"The work to reduce farmers' burden should never be slackened,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Only when agricultural production grows steadily can there be
a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the entire
provincial economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Government Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government led by
Prime Minister Aleksander Mexsi resigned today, as the political
crisis intrigued by the failure of a nation-wide savings scheme
in January worsened.
</P>
<P>
President Sali Berisha accepted Mexsi's resignation after
emergency talks with leaders of the parties in the coalition
government and the country's largest opposition -- the Socialist
Party.
</P>
<P>
Berisha told the state television that the leaders of the
political parties came to conclusion that the Meksi government
must resign in the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Berisha asked Meksi to stay on as caretaker until a
new prime minister is named following consultations with other
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, which holds almost all the seats in
parliament after polls last year, would still be in the central
position of the new cabinet, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Democratic Party must consult other political
forces in the formation of the new government, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Berisha also proposed to set up a committee
made up of experts from all political parties, to investigate into
the collapse of the savings scheme.
</P>
<P>
The committee would propose to the new government on how to
solve the economic problems of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been racked by anti-government protests since
controversial "get-rich-quick" pyramid investment schemes began to
collapse in January.
</P>
<P>
Protests and Violences swepted through the country since
January, which was highlighted by an armed clash in the southern
port city of Vlore at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
At least nine persons were killed and 20 others injured during
the clash.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Makers to Reshuffle into Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's top 20 auto makers will
reshuffle into three or four enterprise groups by the turn of the
century to meet overseas competition.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Business Weekly", several of China's top auto
makers are poised to acquire smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
One-hundred-sixteen car-makers are registered with the Ministry
of Machine-Building Industry which oversees the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
The urgency to develop competitive groups is mounting as China
begins new negotiations to enter the World Trade Organization
(WTO). Automobiles are expected to be among the key issues in the
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the reshuffling process, the ministry will
consider pressuring 30 small, money-losing plants to seek help
from big enterprises or file bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
China has taken effective measures for a better industrial mix
for the past six years. Seventy-eight per cent of the 59 billion
yuan investment in 1991-95 went to top 33 auto plants.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the top 10 enterprise groups produced 80 per cent
of China's automotive output last year, or 1.49 million vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Investment for 1996-2000, expected to be 146.7 billion yuan, is
mostly for big, promising enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Most world auto makers are engaged in ambitious globalization
programs, making the world's production capacity exceed demand by
10 million vehicles. By 2000, the glut will amplify to 20 million,
the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Frei Returns From US Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei,
who returned home on Saturday from the United States, said here
today that his five-day U.S. visit opened a new chapter in
bilateral commercial and political ties.
</P>
<P>
"The trip has been tremendously important for Chile," he told
the press, saying he was quite satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Chile wants to enter the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), which has been operating among the United States, Mexico,
and Canada since January, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The president said he presented the reality of Chile "without
hiding anything, showing our small advances and shortcomings."
</P>
<P>
President Frei reiterated that Chile did not go to ask anything
from the U.S. people, but rather to present the country's attitude
about political and economic themes, which were discussed during
the visit.
</P>
<P>
He said President Bill Clinton's administration would request,
as a result of the visit, U.S. Congress authorization to negotiate
"on the fast track" the insertion of Chile into the NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
Frei told the United States during his visit that White House
lack of consensus with the U.S. Congress to define the terms of a
free trade agreement with his country would force Chile to seek
forging accords with Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean president made it clear that Chile opposes to the
Helms-Burton law, imposed by the U.S. last year aiming to blockade
Cuba, and any restricting conditions for free trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that delays in the implementation of free trade in
Latin America mean "the weakening of many democracies, the rebirth
of captive markets, the consolidation of hunger and migrations."
</P>
<P>
Frei and Clinton also discussed matters of common interest,
such as the second Summit of the Americas to be held here next
March.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed three agreements during Frei's visit,
including one about new airline schedules between Chile and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Under another of the agreements, a new bilateral commission
will be created for educational communications and cooperation
between the National Library of Chile and the U.S. Congress
migrations."
</P>
<P>
"El Mercurio," the Chilean daily with the biggest circulation
in the country, described today Frei's U.S. trip as "a sober and
eloquent presentation in a visit that had a great stature and
dignity."
</P>
<P>
Among his 130 entourage were Jose Miguel Insulza, Minister of
Foreign Relations, Alvaro Garcia, Minister of Economy as well as
top business executives.
</P>
<P>
The United States is Chile's biggest trade partner, with a
bilateral commercial exchange that surpassed 6 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, and the first source of foreign investments
in Chile, with a total of 8,579.7 million dollars invested between
1974 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> China's Budgets Well Implemented: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli
said here today that China's moderately tight fiscal policy was
successful last year and that both the central and local budgets
were well implemented.
</P>
<P>
State revenue outgrew expenditures by 18 percent to 16 percent
last year and the fiscal deficit was below the budgeted figure,
Liu told the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress, which opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The growth of China's state revenue exceeded that of
expenditures for the first time in 1994, by a margin of one
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Last year state revenue came to 736.661 billion yuan, 107.2
percent of the budgeted figure, or up 18 percent over the 1995
figure, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Total state expenditures reached 791.438 billion yuan in 1996,
105.7 percent of the budgeted figure, or an increase of 16 percent
over 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, China's revenue in the central budget
amounted to 425.226 billion yuan in 1996, or 101.7 percent of the
budgeted figure.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditures in the central budget reached 486.226
billion yuan in 1996, or 101.4 percent of the budgeted figure.
</P>
<P>
"Central expenditures exceeded revenues by 61 billion yuan, 442
million yuan less than the budgeted amount," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, fiscal revenue increased by a big margin, and the
trend of its proportional shrinkage in the gross domestic product
was brought under control, he noted. Also brought under control
were total expenditures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have attained our objective of reducing deficit in the
central budget," he said. "This shows that the relatively
stringent financial policy was carried out fairly satisfactorily."
</P>
<P>
However, financial difficulties and potential risks still
exist, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deficit is still large, the central finance
still relies too much on debts, tax losses are still great,
financial and economic disorder is not yet rectified
fundamentally, and the unauthorized establishment of funds and the
collection of arbitrary charges are still common.

HUHHOT, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Han Dan, a pretty 14-year-old,
didn't hesitate when asked to recite a classical poem by Li Bai,
the great Chinese romantic poet, for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Han was one of an unusual group of retarded students in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, whose IQs were raised to nearly
45 from their original 0 just four years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics, the autonomous regions has 17
schools for local children with disabilities, and 60 special
classes in ordinary primary schools for the same type of
children. Of 14,000 children who have serious eyesight, hearing,
language, or learning disabilities, more than 7,900 are enrolled
in schools, where they not only get a basic education similar to
that of ordinary students, but also learn practical skills like
knitting, planting, music, and arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
Paintings by local blind children have been exhibited in the
China Art Gallery in Beijing, and some woodcuts produced by
children with speech and hearing impediments have even been shown
in Japan and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, problems still exist in education because of a
shortage of funds and qualified teachers. So, the autonomous
region is calling for support from local authorities and from
individuals.

BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Els Callens and Sabine Appelmans
upset Spain with two singles victories and gave Belgium a
surprising 2-0 lead on Saturday at the Federation Cup tennis in
Sprimont, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Callens, a late replacement for the injured Dominique Van
Roost, steadily rode a single break of serve to upset
fourth-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
Appelmans, ranked 19th in the world, struggled against Maria

down the 18-year-old Spanish new face in the Cup.
</P>
<P>
Reverse singles and a concluding doubles are set for Sunday in
the World Group 1 first-round matchup, but Belgium only needs one
win to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
Both Spain and Belgium were spoiled by injuries to their No. 2
players.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Conchita Martinez, ranked fifth in the world, did not
even make the trip to Belgium while Van Roost pulled out of her

<HEADLINE> Russia Reiterates Opposition to NATO's Expansion Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry stated
today that NATO's eastward expansion would create new dividing
lines in Europe and affect its stability and security.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
just-concluded Europe tour, the ministry said that the minister
had meetings and talks in London with British Prime Minister John
Major and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to mostly discuss NATO
expansion to the East and relations between Russia and NATO, as
well as a binding document between them.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in London, the last leg of the Russian
Premier's week-long trip, Primakov expressed satisfaction with his
trip to four European countries, describing it as "positive and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
Primakov meanwhile reiterated Moscow's opposition to NATO's
eastward enlargement plans and warned that "there were some things
to which Russia cannot agree, including the movement of NATO's
military infrastructure to the Russian border."
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted diplomatic sources in the
Russian delegation as saying that if NATO disagreed with
compromise on issues concerning Russian's security, Moscow may
have to sever its relations with the alliance, shift its foreign
policy focus to bilateral ties and change its diplomatic
priorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, Russia will exert all its efforts to
make NATO compromise on the new European security architecture.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Expressway Co Ltd in
Guangdong Province will issue 650 million H shares in mid-March to
build an expressway linking Shenzhen Airport and He'ao, according
to today's "Business Weekly."
</P>
<P>
The company hoped to raise 1.2-1.4 billion yuan (144 to 168
million dollars) for the 44.3 km expressway which is expected to
be completed in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Expressway is the second highway enterprise listed
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchanges. Anhui Expressway Co Ltd in Hong
Kong was listed at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The stock market will become a new source for foreign
investment to alleviate the fund shortage and facilitate the
building of the nation's highways, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Hu-Ning (Shanghai-Nanjing) Expressway Co Ltd, Hu-Hang-Yong
(Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Expressway Co Ltd, and the Cheng-Yu
(Chengdu-Chongqing) Expressway Co Ltd are expected to be listed in
Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
Another two enterprises -- Hanna Expressway Co Ltd and the
Ganbei Expressway Co in Jiangxi Province -- will be approved to
float B Shares at an appropriate time by the securities
authorities, it said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build 6,500 kilometers of highways during the
1996-2000 period, needing some 65 billion U.S. dollars, 15-24 per

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Market stronger than Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- After experiencing a technical
correction the previous week, the Shenzhen market performed
stronger than Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A report, published by China Daily's Business Weekly today,
concludes that the Shenzhen market has outshined Shanghai over the
past week after comparing the ups and downs in the two markets.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai market continued to climb last week with the index
rising 23.14 points to close at 1,040.27, while the index of the
Shenzhen market climbed 187.34 to end the week at 3,769.55, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai market dropped moderately on Monday when some
investors began to sell shares to profit from the continuous rise
the last three days of the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The market gradually picked up the next two days as investors
believed the market would stand above 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Transaction value was 32 billion yuan (3.8 billion US dollars),
two billion yuan (361.4 million US dollars) less than the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai B-share index continued to rise the first three
days of last week because of institutional speculation in selected
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment improved after a securities official on
Thursday said he was confident of the B-share market development.
Most investors believe the market will receive more government
support.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied on thursday and Friday, closing last week at
67.15 points, 1.58 higher than the previous week's ending.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's A-share market extended the previous Friday's gains
to the first three days last week, with the index rising 179
points.
</P>
<P>
After dipping 1.84 points on Thursday, the market rose again on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was stable, reflecting investors' confidence
in China's future after veteran Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's
death.
</P>
<P>
Most investors showed optimism over the market's medium-term
outlook, given the stability of China's economic and political
environment, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
Some brokers said shares faced a moderate correction on
anticipation of profit-taking after their recent steady rises.
They said technical charts showed signs of over-buying.
</P>
<P>
But they said there was a slim chance of a sharp decline soon.
</P>
<P>
Transaction value was 42 billion yuan (five billion US
dollars), three billion yuan (361.4 million US dollars) more than
the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's B-share index closed slightly lower on Monday on a
technical correction after continuous rises the past few trading
days.
</P>
<P>
But the market rose again the next four days to close at
1,344.57 points, 33.84 higher than the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Good Economic Performance for 1996  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of
the State Planning Commission, said China's 1996 plan was carried
out satisfactorily, marking a good beginning in implementing the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Chen made the announcement when he made a report on the
implementation of the 1996 Plan for National Economic and Social
Development and on the Draft 1997 Plan for National Economic and
Social Development at the ongoing fifth session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), which opened on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Chen said, China achieved a sustained, rapid economic
growth and the government successfully curbed inflation.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices rose by 6.1 percent, much lower than the 10
percent or so projected in the state plan and a drop of more than
eight percentage points from the previous year; gross domestic
product reached 6,779.5 billion yuan, an increase of 9.7 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"This means China has kept the rate of price rises lower than
the rate of economic growth in accordance with the Ninth Five-Year
Plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The production of most major manufactured products reached or
exceeded targets set in the state plan. Among them, national
primary energy production reached 1.26 billion tons of standard
coal, 106.2 percent of the planned figure; electricity, 1,075
billion kwh, 100.5 percent of the planned figure; steel, 101.1
million tons, 105.3 percent of the planned figure.
</P>
<P>
Other major statistics he mentioned include: ethylene, 3.01
million tons, 118 percent of the planned figure; chemical
fertilizers (calculated on the basis of active ingredients), 26.6
million tons, 108.8 percent of the planned figure; chemical
fibres, 3.08 million tons, 106.2 percent of the planned figure;
digitalized telephone switches, 19.34 million lines, 101.8 percent
of the planned figure.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China's total grain output exceeded 480 billion kg,
an increase of more than 13.4 billion kg over the previous year.
It was a historical record. Outputs of oil-bearing crops and
cotton went down slightly. They were 22 million tons and 4.2
million tons respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said investment in fixed assets continued to grow
and the construction of key state projects was strengthened.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,366 billion yuan was invested in fixed assets in
1996, an increase of 18.2 percent over 1995 and representing an
investment rate of 34.9 percent.

Efforts to restructure investment were intensified, with the
growth rate of investment in agriculture, forestry, water
conservancy, energy, transportation, communications and the
electronics industry higher than the overall investment growth
rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China also accelerated construction of key state
capital construction projects and major technological upgrading
projects. The number of large and medium-sized capital
construction projects completed and put into operation totaled
134, exceeding the target of 97 planned at the beginning of 1996
and hitting an all-time high in this regard in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, China's national revenue grew
rapidly and the financial situation remained stable. In 1996,
national revenue (excluding revenue arising from loans) totaled
736.6 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent over the previous
year, and expenditures (excluding repayment of loans), 791.4
billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent, leaving a deficit of 54.8
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the Central Government was 61 billion yuan,
which was smaller than the budgeted figure, while local
governments had a surplus of 6.2 billion yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pace of reform of state enterprises was quickened and
supporting reforms continued to deepen. The experiment to
establish a modern enterprise system is in full swing. The number
of cities optimizing the capital structure on a trial basis
increased from 18 to 58.
</P>
<P>
There was a sustained growth in foreign trade and more foreign
capital was used. In 1996 imports and exports totaled 289.9
billion US dollars, an increase of 3.2 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
To break up, exports were valued at 151.1 billion US dollars,
an increase of 1.5 percent, and imports, 138.8 billion US dollars,
up 5.1 percent, leaving a trade surplus of 12.3 billion US
dollars. Foreign investment amounted to 42.35 billion US dollars,
an increase of 12.2 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Fresh progress was registered in science, technology and
education and all social undertakings. In 1996 the average per
capita net income of rural people reached 1,926 yuan, representing
an actual increase of nine percent over the previous year. Urban
dwellers' per capita income available for living expenses amounted
to 4,377 yuan, an actual rise of 3.3 percent, Chen said.

for National Economic and Social Development, Chen said China will
continue to strictly control the startup of new projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government will also screen projects which

</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government will strive to solve
such economic problems as having enterprises, whether large or
small, operating as self-contained units, and reckless and
redundant construction.

new economic growth areas.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government will accelerate the
development of industries and products which are in great demand
in the market, call for a high degree of association among
industries, are technologically advanced and show good economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
Industries using high and new technologies such as
electronically-transmitted information and urban housing
construction could be important growth areas for the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, China will should work vigorously to
explore the rural market and promote the development of related
industries.
</P>
<P>
In his report, he considered electronics and information
industries a new area of economic growth and an important means
for transforming traditional industries and improving and
upgrading the industrial structure.

<HEADLINE> Fujian's Forest Coverage Top of List in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The forest coverage rate of east
China's Fujian Province has reached 57.3 percent, the highest in
China, according to provincial government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Province used to boast the highest forest coverage rate
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The change took place after a province-wide afforestation
project was launched in Fujian in 1989. In 1992 trees were planted
on almost all the mountains where trees could survive.
</P>
<P>
At present there are some 6.6 million ha of forests in the
province, with a timber reserve of 400 million cu m.
</P>
<P>
The province is often hit by typhoons so the coastal forest
shelterbelt system is an important prerequisite for economic
development in the coastal areas, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
So far, a 3,300-km green belt has taken shape along the
coastline of the province, and the forest coverage rate in the 27
coastal cities and counties has reached 43 percent. In addition,
the afforestation rate of 185 coastal townships has grown from
eight percent in 1988 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Urban greening has been put on the agendas of all local
governments. Last year over 400 ha of green land was added to the
cities in the province, bringing the urban afforestation rate up
to 28.4 percent. This capital city of the province spent more than
22 million yuan improving afforestation along traffic arteries
last year.

PRAGUE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Ludek Bukac, head coach of the
Czech national ice hockey team, annouced Friday that he had quit
after series of poor performances of his squad this season.
</P>
<P>
His retirement was just 56 days ahead of the upcoming World
Championships slated for Finland.
</P>
<P>
Bukac, 62, took charge of the former Czech and Slovakia
national team from 1981. The team claimed the world title in two
straight years, in 1985 and 1986, as well as three world
runner-ups and one bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
However, the fortune seemed no longer at their side from this
year. In the total 18 outings, the team only scored three wins
against 13 defeats and two draws.

<HEADLINE> Schwarz Leads in First Day of Safari Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- German Armin Schwarz leads on
points having lost time of three hours 17 minutes 40 seconds at
the end of today, an accident-filled first day of the three-day
Safari Rally, round three of the world championship.
</P>
<P>
It's the first time for Schwarz, the 1996 European Rally
Champion, to take part in the African rally regarded widely as the
toughest event on the world championship calendar.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz was followed closely by Britain Richard Burns and Colin
McRae.
</P>
<P>
Finn Tommi Makinen, who won the event last year, was fourth and
Kenyan driver Ian Duncan fifth.
</P>
<P>
World Championship leader Spanish Carlos Sainz and Swedish
Kenneth Eriksson, the winner of the latest round in Sweden, were
forced out of the race due to mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
Owing to strong winds over the drought-hit plains south of
Nairobi, dust-blindness in overtaking situations has not been a
major factor. Instead, rocks have been the big problem for the
leading cars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sand and deep, choking dust have afflicted the
lower-powered 2WD cars and back-markers.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's rally route, the longest leg, covers more than 1,000
kilometers including five competitive sections. It's third
section is smooth, twisty over narrow road and the famous 21
hairpins of the Fluospar climb.

<HEADLINE> Man Removed of Huge Facial Angioma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Yang Yunguang, a man of the Hani
ethnic group in Hani-Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Honghe in Yunnan
Province, has become an ordinary-looking man again after removing
a huge tumor (angioma) from his face in the prefectural hospital.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a farmer, also suffered from epilepsy. The tumor covered
two thirds of his face. Shunned by others, he stayed at home as
much as possible.
</P>
<P>
Yang was spotted in late 1996 by Zhu Peisuo, deputy head of the
prefectural hospital, who had gone to Honghe to spread knowledge
of health care.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the prefecture's science and technology
commission, nationalities affairs commission and public health
bureau, the Honghe Prefectural Hospital decided to perform surgery
on Yang, with the Honghe County government and the hospital
sharing the charges.
</P>
<P>
The operation lasted nearly 20 hours, and Yang's face was
restored to normal by plastic surgery in January this year.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Becoming Chin's Winter Tourist Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The unique tropical island scenery
of south China's Hainan Province has helped make it China's
tourist resort in winter when northern parts of the country are
battered by icy winds and blizzards.
</P>
<P>
The island province has summer year-round. After several years
of construction work, Hainan now has better quality tourism
facilities with tropical characteristics in the cities of Haikou
and Sanya, attracting many tourists from different parts of China.
</P>
<P>
From February 1 to 15, the traditional Spring Festival holiday
period, the airport at Haikou, the provincial capital, handled
180,000 passengers, a rise of 65,000 people or 23 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The province had 4.86 million tourists in 1996, an increase of
34.6 percent over the previous year, according to local officials,
who say that the province will increase efforts to create new
tourist programs and improve tourist facilities, and will try to
have five million tourists this year.

<HEADLINE> Documentary in Yi Language Celebrates Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- "We miss Deng Xiaoping and will
remember his words and smiles forever," said a farmer of the Yi
nationality with tears in his eyes in Sichuan province. This was
the first time for him to understand what Deng said totally by
watching the TV documentary "Deng Xiaoping" dubbed in his own
language.
</P>
<P>
The province recently translated the TV series "Deng Xiaoping"
into the Yi language to mark the death of the senior Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
Local culture departments overcame the difficulty of having no
script, and only spent a few days completing the language
translation work for the first part of the documentary.
</P>
<P>
There are more than one million Yi people in the
province. Local farmers, who are leading better lives today,
expressed their heartfelt thanks for the reform and opening-up
policies initiated by Deng.

<HEADLINE> Germany Faces Massive Anti-Nuclear Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 anti-nuclear protesters
gathered in the northern German city of Lueneberg today to protest
against a cross-country transportation of nuclear wastes to a
nearby storage depot at Gorleben.
</P>
<P>
A special train loaded with 750-ton nuclear wastes gathered
from two nuclear power plants in southern Germany and from France
will start from the west German town of Walheim on Monday, and
arrive at Gorleben, some 70 kilometer east of Lueneberg, for
storage on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cross-country shipping has triggered off massive protests
in Germany over the past week and has invoked the biggest postwar
police mobilization in the country in which 30,000 policemen were
involved.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the coal power plant at Walheim, where the nuclear
wastes were loaded on the train and await transportation, were
guarded by thousands of policemen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local government at Lueneberg also declared a
ban on demonstrations in close vicinity to the railway lines.
</P>
<P>
However, German media still expect massive resistance by
anti-nuclear activists in coming days.
</P>
<P>
Saturday also saw protesting farmers from the Gorleben area
block the Lueneberg city centre with over 100 tractors. The
protest was however peaceful and demonstrators backed down from an
initial call to stage a sit-in on the railway tracks.
</P>
<P>
Protesters on Saturday also occupied two gymnastics halls near
Gorleben which are to be used as accommodation for police. They
were later forcibly dispersed by policemen.
</P>
<P>
German authorities said the security costs for the
transportation would run up to some 100 million German marks, or
about 60 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Much of the traditional anti-nuclear protest in Germany has
taken the form of peaceful demonstrations or sit-ins on railway
lines.
</P>
<P>
But there has also been a growing violent trend with extremists
tearing out railway tracks and sabotaging overhead railway power
lines.
</P>
<P>
Police said they expect to encounter about 1,000 violent
protesters in the Gorleben region next week, local media reported.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rallies Arab Support to Defend Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today urged a united Arab front to
defend Jerusalem, which is under threat from Israel's settlement
expansion in the holy city of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an ongoing emergency meeting of the Arab League
(AL) Council on the repercussions of the Israeli housing plan,
Arafat called it "nothing but an attempt to undermine the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs endorsed
an agreement Wednesday on establishing 6,500 housing units for the
Jewish settlers in Gabal Abu Ghoneim, known to Israel as Har Homa,
a tree-covered hill taken by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
"There is no peace without Jerusalem," he said, adding that
the measure is aimed at dividing the West Bank into northern and
southern parts and building a new Bethlehem. The new homes will
be built between East Jerusalem and the PNA-ruled Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision has sparked criticism from its key ally the
United States and Palestinian warnings that it could unleash
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called upon the Arab leaders to side with the
Palestinian people and defend the holy Jerusalem. He urged them
"not to leave the Palestinian people alone in the face of the
monstrous Israeli settlement."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in his speech that the envisaged housing project
flagrantly violates international resolutions and the Oslo
agreements, signed between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and
stumbles the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreement, Israelis and the Palestinians are to
settle the status of Jerusalem and other sensitive issues in the
peace negotiations set for March to determine the final status of
the territories occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the meetings, AL Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid denounced Israel's settlement activities in the
occupied Arab lands and continued confiscation of Palestinian
lands.
</P>
<P>
He said that the action aimed at confronting
settlement-building and resisting campaigns to Judaize Jerusalem
has a basis in international law and agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Arabs will never relinquish their rights," the AL chief vowed
at the emergency session.
</P>
<P>
Fiercely attacked by Arabs, the European Union and the
U.S. alike, the construction plan is regarded as an attempt to
cement Israel's hold over Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want
to have as the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have warned flare-ups of anti-Israeli
violence in the West Bank and Gaza reminiscent of clashes that
erupted last September when Israel opened a new entrance to an
archaeological tunnel near Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here early today, also discussed the
Jewish settlement in Jerusalem with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. He will fly to Washington on Sunday for talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeline
Albright.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ankara-Tehran Diplomatic Ties in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ankara-Tehran diplomatic
relations are experiencing hard times as the two governments have
decided to kick out each other's top envoys in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
But both sides have shown positive signs to save the
relationship from aggravating into a real crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry announced today that Turkish
Ambassador Osman Koruturk and Consul General Ufuk Ozsancak should
leave Iran in a tit-for-tat move against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish consul general in Iran's northwestern city of
Orumieh was declared by the Iranian government as persona
non-grata for his involvement in activities inconsistent with
diplomatic norms.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Ankara Mohammad Reza Baqeri and Consul
General to Istanbul Mohammad Reza Rashedi were expelled from
Turkey last week for their statement about Islam and
fundamentalism. Then came the expulsion order Friday to Saeed
Zare, Iranian Consul General to Erzurum, who was called a persona
non grata by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The latest tension between Ankara and Tehran stems from
February 1 address given by Baqeri.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish press accused Baqeri of having overstepped the
bounds of his diplomatic duties for openly speaking in favor of
an Islamic rule in the secular Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Attending the anti-Israeli Quds (Jerusalem) International Day
ceremonies in Sincan, an Turkish city district, Baqeri asked his
Turkish audience if they would like to support the rule of Islam.
</P>
<P>
After Baqeri's lecture was publicized, the Turkish media and
secular politicians charged that the Iranian ambassador had
intervened in the domestic affairs of Turkey by promoting Islamic
rule.
</P>
<P>
But, no sooner had Tehran and Ankara announced their orders to
expel each other's diplomats than they showed their willingness
for saving the relationship from turning really sour for the good
of their countries' security and economy, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Javad Larijani, Vice-Chairman of the Iranian
Parliament Foreign Policy Commission, said at a press conference
held here today that "I have no sense of worry about future of our
ties. Our ties with Turkey is very firm and will be expanding in
the future."
</P>
<P>
In Ankara today, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel sent out a
special envoy carrying a good-will message to Iranian President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani calling for improving the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said in his message that Turkey and Iran should protect
their mutual security interests.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also trying to boost their economic
links. Rafsanjani signed seven memoranda of understanding with
Turkey during his four-day visit to Ankara last December.
</P>
<P>
Among cooperative projects is a multi-billion-dollar gas energy
agreement to provide energy-starved Turkey with Iran's abundant
gas reserves for the next 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Tries to Enter EU in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller said today that Turkey is trying to enter the European
Union in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also deputy prime minister, told the Turkish
determination to the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi today whey she had
telephone talks with them.
</P>
<P>
She told the U.S. and Italian officials that one of Turkey's main
objectives for 1997 would be put on the list of nations vying for
early full membership into the EU.
</P>
<P>
She later told reporters that "Turkey will take its place among
the big nations".
</P>
<P>
A statement issued early this morning by the Turkish Foreign
Ministry said that the National Security Council, which held a
nine-hour meeting Friday, had recommended that Turkey's early
accession onto the EU's membership list should be made a priority
for the present government.
</P>
<P>
"This means that Turkey's drive for full membership has been
underscored at the highest organ of the country as a state
policy," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added, "Turkey will maintain its determined efforts aimed
at integration with the EU in line with this policy."
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that Ciller will continue to hold a
series of such talks with other western colleagues in the coming
days in a bid to gain support for Turkey's entry into the EU.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Assist Mexico in Combating Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today, praising Mexican government's efforts in combating drug
smuggling, pledged to do whatever possible to help the neighboring
country success against powerful drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton also said that he will
continue to pressure Mexico for "tough action" to keep drugs out
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came a day after he recertified Mexico in its
anti-drug program despite opposition from lawmakers, who attacked
Mexico on corruption in the anti-drug program.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Clinton praised Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo's efforts in battling Mexican drug cartels seeking to
corrupt the country's law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
"President Zedillo has taken brave action, firing more than
1,200 tainted officials, extraditing criminals for the first time,
passing tough laws and arresting in his own drug czar for
corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must do whatever we can to give (Mexico) the means to
succeed. Stamping out the drug trade is a long-term battle.... We
will continue to press our Mexican partners to take tough action
that will protect all our people from drugs," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Mexico has a serious drug problem, but
"Mexico's leaders recognize that problem, and they have the will
to fight it."

<HEADLINE> AL Denounces Israeli Housing Plan in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Council today
issued a strong-worded denouncement against Israel's decision to
build new settlements in Gabal Abu Ghoneim in Eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli new construction project violates the bases on
which the Mideast peace process is founded, all signed peace
agreements with the Palestinians and the letters of guarantee
offered by the U.S. to the Arab parties in Madrid," said the
statement, issued by the Arab League emergency session tonight.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting was held in the wake of Israel's
endorsement Wednesday of establishing 6,500 housing units for the
Jewish settlers in Gabal Abu Ghoneim, known to Israel as Har Homa,
a tree-covered hill taken by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The council warned that the Israeli decision and previous
settlement practices would threaten the peace march and thrust the
area into a quagmire of conflicts and instability.
</P>
<P>
It expressed its support for resolutions issued during past
Arab summits, the last of which was held in Cairo last June.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo summit reiterated the Arabs commitment to the
realization of a just and all-out peace based on international
legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle stressing the fact
that peace is the only strategic option.
</P>
<P>
The statement also pledges support to the Palestinians in
confronting the Israeli settlement schemes and calls for halt of
assistance to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, while
addressing the session, urged a united Arab front to defend
Jerusalem, which is under threat from Israel's settlement
expansion in the third holiest city of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Fiercely attacked by Arabs, EU and the U.S. alike, the
envisaged project is regarded by Arabs as an attempt to cement
Israel's hold over Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want to have
as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision has sparked Palestinian warnings that it
could unleash bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreement, Israel and the Palestinians are to
settle the status of Jerusalem and other sensitive issues in the
peace negotiations set for March to determine the final status of
Occupied Territories.
