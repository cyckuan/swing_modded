<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Sink Two Rebel Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
have sank two Tamil Tiger rebel boats outside a strategic naval
base in the island's northeast, the navy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Navy gunboats Friday night opened fire at a flotilla of attack
boats of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) outside the port
of Trincomalee, a naval statement said.
</P>
<P>
"During the confrontation one enemy log craft and one attack
craft was destroyed," the statement said, adding that the rebels
brought in more boats as reinforcements but these were
successfully beaten back.
</P>
<P>
However, military officials said some fishing boats may also
have been caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released from its London office on Saturday, the
LTTE said that at least seven fishermen were killed and 17 others
were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels control most of Sri Lanka's northeast coastline,
with their headquarters Mullaitivu being located some 280 km
northeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983, have on several occasions
infiltrated the Trincomalee port to stage attacks.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Armed Forces in Exercises to Mark War Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's armed forces have
launched a series of military exercises to celebrate the "Sacred
Defense Week", which started Thursday to mark the 20th anniversary
of the outbreak of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Different branches of the armed forces, including the regular
army, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, and the Basij (voluntary
force), are all participating in the maneuvers, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRGC) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the naval forces of the IRGC launched
the first stage of the "Shahamat 79" maneuver in the Persian Gulf
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tens of missile launching vessels, ferry boats, frigates,
personnel carriers, and hundreds of guerrillas, marines, and
frogmen are taking part in the war game, spokesman for the
maneuvers Ali Razmjoo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the goal behind the five-day maneuvers is to raise the
combat readiness of the forces in defending the country's
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another military exercise, code-named "Meraj-79" was
also launched Sunday in the northern reaches of the Persian Gulf
over an area of some 1,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the maneuvers Rear Admiral Hussein Dasbooshehri
said the military exercise involved air units, missile launchers,
marines, guerrillas and special task force.
</P>
<P>
Most sophisticated equipment and weapons were also deployed in
the maneuvers, which is to last four days, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's regular army also entered the main stage of an exercise
code-named "Zolfaqar-3" on Sunday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, started Friday in Kurdestan Province near the
border with Iraq, is said to be the largest in scale.
</P>
<P>
In the exercise on Sunday, jet fighters of the army's air force,
the artillery and missile units launched strikes on the target and
the infantry units launched an offensive under support of Iranian-
made 206 choppers.
</P>
<P>
The choppers, on which rocket launchers had been installed,
successfully carried out missions with high capability, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 29 battalions of the Basij forces have also been involved
in a war game since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The war game, code-named "Nasr-8" (Victory-8), is to continue
for one month in the province of Kurdestan.
</P>
<P>
There are about 146,000 Basij forces in Kurdestan Province.
Mostly voluntary students and young people, the Basij is under the
commander of the elite IRGC.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Forming New OPEC Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) stressed on Sunday the need for the OPEC summit which will
open on Wednesday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas to adopt a
new strategy, especially on dialogue between oil producers and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir, UAE minister of petroleum and mineral
resources, said in a press conference that he feels the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should formulate a
new strategy to deal with global economic changes, including
developments in the different energy fields.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark before his departure for Rabat, Morocco, to
join the UAE delegation to the Caracas summit, the first such event
of the organization since its 1975 summit in the Algerian capital
of Algiers and the second summit in the bloc's 40-year history.
</P>
<P>
In early 1980s, OPEC contemplated a long-term strategy and even
named a committee for drafting it, but the project was scrapped due
to the collapse of oil prices in mid-1980s and the emergence of
political and economic rivalries within the organization at that
time.
</P>
<P>
Al Nasir said the forthcoming summit will not be "very
significant" unless it can provide an opportunity for member
countries to reiterate the organization's important role in world
economy and to boost their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied that the issue of increasing oil output has
been put on the agenda of the summit, saying that OPEC already has
a mechanism to pump in 500,000 additional barrels per day (bpd) if
the price hovers over 28 U.S. dollars for 20 days.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the recent soaring price in world oil market, the
organization has raised output for three times at a rate more than
what was decided by the mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC has already proved that it is not responsible for the
recent rocketing prices and people in consumer countries are
convinced that their governments are responsible as they levy heavy
taxes on petroleum products, the official WAM news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Algeria, S. Africa Sign Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, September 24 (Xinhua)-- Algeria and South Africa inked
here on Sunday several agreements on trade, economic partnership,
mutual protection of investments, and cooperation in
communications.
</P>
<P>
The documents were signed by Algerian President Abdul-Aziz
Bouteflika and his South African counterpart Thabo Mbeki at the
conclusion of the Higher Joint Committee on Bilateral Cooperation
(HJCBC).
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days the two sides signed other documents such
as the foundation agreement of the HJCBC, "the first such
agreement," according to Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is the only African country to have such a document with
South Africa, which provides for preferential treatment between the
two nations in the areas of investment and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Algeria and South Africa falls short
of their great economic potentials, as it has hardly reached 15
million U.S. dollars due to lack of legal framework, bilateral
agreements and protection of investment. Thereby, the first meeting
of the HJCBC is a cornerstone in the process of
institutionalization of future cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of the HJCBC, Bouteflika and
Mbeki underscored the importance of bilateral cooperation and vowed
to push along the implementation of the recently-reached documents
and push the bilateral ties to an ideal level.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and his party arrived here on September 22 to take part
in the three-day HJCBC session.

<HEADLINE> Results of EgyptAir Crash Investigations Expected in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The results of the
investigations by Egypt and the United States into the crash of
EgyptAir Flight 990 are expected be announced in November, the
airline's president, Mohammed Fahim Rayan, said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and a team of
Egyptian aviation experts are working hard to try to determine the
cause of the crash, Rayan was quoted by the official Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said he met recently with officials from Boeing, the ill-
fated plane's manufacturer, to discuss possible problems with the
plane's elevator system as well as the possible impact of
electromagnetic waves on the aircraft controls.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has pledged to answer EgyptAir's questions which "reflect
Egypt's points of view on what really happened to the aircraft," he
added.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic shortly after
taking off from New York airport on October 31, 1999, killing all
217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir has called for further studies into whether there was a
malfunction of the mechanisms that control the plane's ascent and
descent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an article published on September 21 by the New York
Review of Books said that electromagnetic interferences by military
radars in the area over which the plane was flying may have played
a role in causing the sudden shutdown of its computerized auto
pilot, the elevators and engines.

against Hassan Moradi, from the central Arak constituency, and 87
voted in favor him while 35 abstained, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moradi got a seat in the parliamentary runoff election in June
in Arak only after the conservative-controlled supervisory body,
the Guardian Council (GC), overturned the initial results in which
a pro-reform candidate obtained the required number of votes.
</P>
<P>
The GC nullified the votes of 31 ballot boxes in the
constituency, citing election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Besides the case in Arak, the GC also annulled the first-round
and runoff votes in a number of other constituencies where
reformers close to President Mohammad Khatami had been declared
winners.
</P>
<P>
Despite the conservative pressure, the 290-member sixth Majlis
started work on May 27 with reformers taking the majority of the
seats.
</P>
<P>
According to related laws, each lawmaker has to be endorsed by
more than half of his peers before the legislator can formally take
a seat in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis has to date approved the credentials of 271 elected
deputies. The credentials of three winners, all belonging to the
conservative camp, have reportedly been decisively annulled.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Israeli Positive Response to Palestinian Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt hopes that Israel will
respond positively to Palestinian demands in their final-status
negotiations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami is expected to
visit Egypt on Monday and deliver a message to President Hosni
Mubarak from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would also hold lengthy talks with Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to hear a positive response from Israel," Moussa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami's visit comes as part of the intensive contacts that
Egypt has been holding to help find lasting solutions since the
failure of the Palestinian-Israeli summit at the Camp David of the
United States in July.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will continue contacts with the Palestinians on the
peacemaking drive, Moussa said, adding that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat is expected to visit Egypt next week for
consultations with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in
the 1967 Mideast War, as the capital of their future independent
state. But Israel insists that the whole of the holy city is its "
eternal and undivided capital," a claim not recognized
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, is the
main mediator in the Middle East between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Receives Letter on Iraqi-Indian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
met here Sunday with Indian Minister of State for External Affairs
Ajit Kumar Panja, who delivered to him a letter from Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Vajpayee expressed New Delhi's wish to strengthen
and bolster economic, political and cultural relations with Iraq,
the official INA said.
</P>
<P>
Panja said India opposes to the continuation of the United
Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
and calls for the total lifting of the 10-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Saddam hailed the bilateral ties and expressed the hope to
further develop relations with India in all fields, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Indian state minister, heading a 35-member delegation of
officials and businessmen, arrived in the Iraqi capital on Friday
for a three-day visit to explore trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
India, one of Iraq's important trade partners, has been making
efforts to gain a slice of Iraq's lucrative market within the
framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell crude to finance vital imports
of food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies to help offset
the crippling impact of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Voted to IMF Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been voted to the
International Monetary and Financial Committee of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released here on Sunday, Zambian
Finance Minister Katele Kalumba will be representing the country
to take part in the committee.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown,
the committee is a surveillance authority of the fund on global
monetary and financial movements including issues of debt, debt
relief, capital markets and the design of the global financial
architecture.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba on Saturday called for a review of the conditionalities
attached to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief
at a press conference organized by the IMF in Prague.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF/World Bank HIPC framework should focus on the
quality of reforms that countries had undertaken and not on how
many years they had been reforming.
</P>
<P>
The demand for a three-year track record on the IMF program was
unnecessary, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister rejected the calls from some western
parliamentarians for IMF to get out of the issue of poverty
reduction and out of Africa, saying Africa needed "the IMF at this
time precisely because of the challenges of poverty that the IMF
reforms have been linked to."
</P>
<P>
He also called for a global solidarity to address the impact of
the new oil prices which, he said was threatening the delicate
growth efforts of countries like Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Mauritania to Withdraw From ECOWAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The membership of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will drop to 15 in
November when Mauritania's one-year notice to leave expires,
according to Minister of Cooperation and Integration in Africa
Chief Dapo Sarumi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media forum in the capital Abuja at the weekend,
Sarumi said Mauritania, the 16th member of the ECOWAS, was hinging
its exit on its objection to the creation of a common monetary
zone in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to Sarumi, Mauritania felt that the adoption of a
common currency in the sub-region was not in its interest and that
its interest would be better served by its membership of the
Maghreb, a regional group of the Arabic-speaking countries in
northern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania signified its intention to leave ECOWAS last
November, but it had to abide by the protocol of the organization,
which requires that any member must give a notice of one year
before it could withdraw from the community.
</P>
<P>
The proposed single monetary zone, which is expected to be
created by 2003, will finally launch a common currency by 2004.

of the population in a nationwide referendum Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The move to curb the number of foreigners was voted down by 63
percent, with 37 percent in favor. This is the seventh time that

The "no" vote has been welcomed by the government and big
businesses. Speaking for the government, Swiss Justice Minister
Ruth Metzler welcomed the result. She said that it was a signal to
the international community that Switzerland was willing to adhere
to its commitments.
</P>
<P>
Leading party politicians and business figures welcomed the
outcome, saying that reason had prevailed over emotion. The head
of the main employers' organization, Peter Hasler, echoed the
sentiment. He said the Swiss people had not wanted to jeopardize
the country's humanitarian tradition or Switzerland's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that foreign residents in Switzerland account
for more than 19 percent of the country's population of about 7.1
million.

<HEADLINE> Epidemic Fever Kills 24 in Southern Saudi Arabia: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The epidemic Rift Valley
Fever (RVF), which broke out in the southern Saudi city of Jizan
two weeks ago, has already killed 24 people, the Saudi Health
Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of people infected with the disease has reached
113, of whom 23 are Yemenis, the ministry said in a report issued
through the official Saudi Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The report said the area of Jizan is most affected as 98 cases
were registered there, although neighboring areas have also
reported 15 cases.
</P>
<P>
As there is no medicine against the disease, which starts with
various symptoms such as high fever, diarrhea and vomiting, Saudi
authorities are stepping up joint preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Saudi government has allocated some 24 million Saudi riyals (6.4
million U.S. dollars) to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
Special teams armed with planes and helicopters have been sent
to Jizan to spray insecticides against mosquitoes, which carry the
virus from infected animals to humans.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Health Osama Abdul-Majid Shobakshi, who
started a tour in Jizan on Saturday, said the government was also
contacting the World Health Organization (WHO) to follow the
developments of the disease and control it.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent the disease from spreading to other parts of
the country, Saudi authorities have also heightened the level of
alert in the neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
Health officials in the capital Riyadh area are checking
passengers by road and air from the southern areas of Jizan, Bisha
and Najran.

<HEADLINE> Troops Closing in on Abductors: Philippine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
are reportedly closing Sunday on a group of Abu Sayyaf rebels who
were seen fleeing with their American hostage in the southern
island of Jolo, Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
The group of rebels led by Abu Sabaya were trying to get to a
beach to escape from Jolo, the ABS-CBN news channel reported,
quoting Sulu Vice Governor Munib Estino.
</P>
<P>
Estino disclosed that pursuit operations resumed after local
officials in the town of Lu-uk failed to convince the rebels to
release the American, Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 troops, backed by howitzers artillery and attack
helicopters, are said to be pursuing the group of some 500 rebels.
</P>
<P>
Another group of the Abu Sayyaf rebels led by Ghalib Andang are
reportedly holding 16 hostages, including three Malaysians and 13
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The military launched attacks against the rebels on Saturday
last week to rescue the 19 hostages held by the group. Two French
journalists were recovered last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports said four children were wounded
Sunday after an air force plane dropped three bombs in the town of
Talipao in Jolo, and that a wounded farmer lost his wife and two
of his neighbors after they were accidentally shot by soldiers
chasing a suspected Abu Sayyaf rebel.
</P>
<P>
The military insisted that only two civilians have been killed
and four others wounded so far in the ongoing operations which
have already displaced more than 4,800 families in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight rebels have been kille while the government lost
three soldiers since the launching of the operations, according to

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China on Sunday urged the
developed nations to strengthen their policy coordination to
narrow the range of movement among their currency exchange rates
and create favorable condition for global economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the second meeting of the International Monetary
and Financial Committee of the International Monetary Fond (IMF),
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, urged the
major developed countries to abolish their trade protection
measures, especially those in the fields of agricultural produce,
textiles, and services.

<P>
"As part of the surveillance of the developed countries, we
support the IMF in its close monitoring of the progress made by
these countries in reducing their trade protection measures," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Dai suggested that the IMF focus on research in the macro-
economy, exchange rates and other policy issues related to capital
flows, as mandated in its Articles of Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the IMF to make efforts in crisis prevention
by strengthening its surveillance and provide timely and effective
financial support for its member states facing difficulties in
balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dai urged the IMF to discuss China's request for an

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Import and Export Bank of
China will continue to encourage Chinese enterprises to invest
overseas through issuing export loans, a bank official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Mu Linlin, vice general manager of the Business Development
Department with the bank made the remark at a Machinery and
Electrical Equipment Expo.
</P>
<P>
The bank will support overseas investment by Chinese
enterprises, including setting up processing businesses with
imported materials or parts and direct investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has already provided two billion yuan in export loans
to such Chinese companies as Haier Group Co. for investment
overseas since late last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the Chinese investment in Latin America, Africa and
north America will create jobs for those areas, provide cheaper
products for local consumers and help export Chinese-made
machinery and electrical equipment.

<HEADLINE> Abducted University Personnel Freed in South Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Two university personnel who
were abducted by an armed group in a southern Philippine province
four days ago were freed Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The police recovered a professor and an employee of the
Mindanao State University at a place in the province of Lanao Del
Sur along the boundary of the province of Lanao Del Norte, the ABS-
CBN new channel reported.
</P>
<P>
It didn't say whether there was a firefight between the police
and the armed group, but said that pursuit operations were going
on against the abductors.
</P>
<P>
The freed professor was quoted as saying that the kidnappers
only demanded that the university in the city of Marawi, Lanao Del
Sur, pay salaries for the services rendered by its security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The local police had said in its initial probe that the
abduction was related to the termination of the university's
security personnel. The relieved security guards were reportedly
disgruntled for not receiving their salaries.

<HEADLINE> African Civil Society Urged to Be Self-Sustainable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The General Congress for
African-Arab Non-Governmental Organization Sunday called on the
civil society in Africa to desist from depending too much on donor
support in their activities.
</P>
<P>
In an interview by Zambia News Agency, southern Africa regional
representative of the non-government organization Edwin Sakala
said there is need for the civil society to be self-sustainable if
it is to make a constructive impact on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The congress, an umbrella body of all non-governmental
organizations in Africa, would work to reduce their dependence on
the donors for survival, Sakala said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the international community of being agents of
globalization whose main aim is to regain total control of
independent nations through hostile conditionalities they attach
to their support.
</P>
<P>
African countries have the capacity to develop hence the need
to work together to improve the living standards in the continent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on African leaders and all other stakeholders to
support Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's idea of a United States of
Africa, saying it is one sure way of keeping the continent's
sovereignty intact.
</P>
<P>
The General Congress for African-Arab Non-Governmental
Organization is a 34-member organization created by the
Organization of African Unity to group all non-governmental
organizations across the continent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of
Cooperation and Integration in Africa Chief Dapo Sarumi has urged
African countries to focus on their areas of comparative advantage
as a strategy for survival in a globalized world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media forum in the capital Abuja at the weekend,
Sarumi said globalization is a phase Africans can not avoid but
must evolve appropriate strategies to deal with.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization can not be avoided. What we need is an
appropriate response," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization means integration, therefore Africa
should pool its resources to create a competitive situation to
avoid being marginalized in the current fast-growing trend of
globalization if it could be better integrated.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a country having an important political and economic
influence in Africa, has been campaigning for the regional
integration to meet the challenge of globalization.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pledges Commitment to Regional Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
said its commitment of human and financial resources to
peacekeeping operations in the west African sub-region is to
ensure the prevalence of the necessary atmosphere for growth and
development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the media in the capital Abuja at the weekend,
Nigerian Minister of Cooperation and Integration in Africa Chief
Dapo Sarumi said Nigeria has a common destiny with its African
brothers suffering from lingering conflicts and civil wars in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
He said a timely intervention in the social and political
problems of the countries concerned would prevent a possible spill-
over of such problems into Nigeria and ensure that Nigerians have
the opportunity to move freely across frontiers of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"It is our interest to have economic prosperity, to be able to
move about freely in Africa to transact business rather than choke
ourselves in one place," he said.
</P>
<P>
But all this would not be possible in a war-ravaged environment,
he said, noting that Nigeria's security is linked to that of their
brothers in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, as a political and military power in the region, has
been playing a vital role in peacekeeping operations in west
African war-torn countries, such as Liberia and Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Sign Protocol of African Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved the country's bid to sign the protocol of African Union,
a replacement of the current Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Nigerian Minister of Cooperation and Integration in Africa Chief
Dapo Sarumi has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media forum in the capital Abuja at the weekend,
Sarumi said the union would integrate the political and economic
units in Africa and become a transformation of the very limited
OAU charter that brings Africans together.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, established in 1963 mainly as a political unit, would
have to be the forerunner for creating economic prosperity in the
African continent, the minister said. "That is why African Union
has to be put in place."
</P>
<P>
He said African leaders, following the discovery of limitation
of the OAU as a pure political union, set up the Economic
Community of Africa and African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is time to integrate all these units into the union, he said.
</P>
<P>
The concept of the union, the ideal of pioneer African leaders
such as late Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah and Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere, was officially approved by the OAU
summit in July this year in Lome, capital of Togo.

as a"good draw" in the Olympic Games' taekwondo competition in

</P>
<P>
"Good enough," said Petron Philippine team leader Hong Sung

<P>
Cruz and Ditan will take the first crack at the medals on
Wednesday, the opening day of the event.
</P>
<P>

"Our boys and girls are ready to fight up to the end," Hong

prepared long enough to stand the rigors of the tourney, marking
taekwondo's debut as an Olympic medal sport.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Acting FM to Visit Egypt for Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami is due in Egypt on Monday for talks on the peace
negotiations with the Palestinians, the state-run Middle East News
Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, Ben-Ami is expected to meet with
President Hosni Mubarak and hold talks with Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on the developments of the negotiations and the efforts
exerted by all parties to help advance the process, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been holding intensive contacts and consultations with
the concerned parties to the Middle East peace process since the
failure of the Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David of the
United States in July.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami's upcoming visit is part of Egypt's continuing efforts
to help bridge gaps between Israel and Palestinians sides over the
key issues including the fate of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said Ben-Ami will further travel to Jordan after
his stay in Cairo to hold talks with King Abdullah II and Foreign
Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the major stumbling block in the peace talks. The
Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as capital of their future
independent state, while Israel insists the whole of the holy city
be its "eternal and undivided capital," a claim not recognized
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries that have made peace
with Israel, play an active role in mediating in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Outer Coffin at Laoshan of Western Beijing Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Decorative patterns of silk
fabrics were found when the outer cofffin in an ancient tomb at
Laoshan in western Beijing was opened today.
</P>
<P>
It took archeologists two hours to open the outer lid of the
coffin in the tomb dating back to the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE.
-24 A.D.). Red lacquer with some decorative patterns were found on
the inside lid of the coffin. They surmised that the patterns were
prints of funerary silk fabrics placed in the coffin.
</P>
<P>
The coffin had collapsed when the outer coffin was opened.
Archaeologists could not distinguish the outer layer of the coffin
from the inner one, said Wang Wuyu, in charge of the excavation
of the ancient tomb at Laoshan.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was accidentally found early this year in the Laoshan
area, western Beijing. Archeological excavations have continued
since then.
</P>
<P>
The 12-meter-tall tomb occupies an area half the size of a
football field. Two doors to the coffin's chamber have been opened.
</P>
<P>
Some of the unearthed objects from the Laoshan Tomb indicate
that the tomb occupant was a king of the Yan. The funerary objects
are priceless treasures.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Ankara's harsh reactions, which came in the wake of the
approval by U.S. Congress of the Armenian Bill, created panic in
the United States as a U.S. spokesman said that "the president and
the administration are very upset about the developments."
</P>
<P>
The anti-Ankara bill regarding the alleged genocide on Armenians
is used as a political tool prior to the presidential elections in
the United States in November.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's first boycott against the U.S. came when it excluded
the U.S. firm Litton from a project. Litton has planned to provide
the computer equipment of King Cobra Ah-1Z helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- After the approval of a bill on the so-called genocide on
Armenians by a U.S. House subcommittee, Turkey is getting prepared
to increase its diplomatic representation level in Iraq to embassy
to intimidate the United States.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been using the appointment of an ambassador to Iraq
as a bargaining chip with the United States for a long time, while
the United States does not positively approach development of
relations between Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- According to the World Economic Forum, Turkey left behind
many countries in economic creativity and ranked the 16th on the
list.
</P>
<P>
The United States comes first in the economic creativity list of
the world, followed by Finland.
</P>
<P>
The economic creativity and technology level in a country is
calculated by considering many criteria, including growth
opportunity of small companies.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is trying to prevent any possible sanctions
Turkey may impose after the bill regarding the so-called genocide
on Armenians was approved by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration is seeking a nice gesture to calm down
Ankara. For this purpose, it will give Arrow anti-ballistic
missiles to Ankara in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, which were developed by the United States and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jewish Leader Questions Ambassador's Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Jewish leader has
questioned whether anti-Semitism is behind the U.S. State
Department's suspension of the security clearance of U.S.
ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
"First of all he is a political appointee. Secondly, he doesn't
come from the community of State Department officials, he comes
from outside. And thirdly, he is a Jew," said Abe Foxman, national
director of the U.S. Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
"And until I see other people in the same situation, I have to
ask the question," Foxman told Israel's Army Radio on Sunday
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department suspended Indyk's security clearance,
requiring him to stay in the United States, pending the findings of
an FBI investigation into alleged security violations.
</P>
<P>
Indyk is being questioned after he was found doing highly
classified work on his unclassified government laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said Indyk had "cooperated fully" with it
and FBI. There was no espionage involved or compromising of
intelligence, but rather a case in which the security procedures
were not followed.
</P>
<P>
Indyk remains as the ambassador to Israel but his position will
be filled temporarily by his charge d'affaires Bob Simons.
</P>
<P>
The FBI investigation reportedly began in April when a State
Department laptop computer containing top-secret information about
arms proliferation disappeared. The computer, though not linked to
Indyk, prompted a probe by the State Department personnel into the
use of such computers.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was said to have reached a critical stage
while Indyk was in Washington this month to help President Bill
Clinton assess the state of negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here have not ruled out the possibility that Indyk
might be a victim of power struggle between the Democrats and
Republicans in the U.S. prior to the presidential election, as the
State Department is the target the Republicans are aiming for.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have defended the 49-year-old London-born and
Australian-reared Jew, who has long been involved in the Middle
East peacemaking. They have expressed concerns that his absence
would affect U.S. efforts to forge a final peace between Israel and
the Palestinians at the critical and sensitive stage of the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it won't make it harder," acting Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami told the army radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Saturday praised Indyk for his
contribution to the peace process and hoped that the investigation
will be completed as quickly as possible, and that Indyk will
continue to actively contribute to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak's spokesman said on Sunday that Israel considered the
investigation "an internal American matter."

<HEADLINE> Barak Does Not Rule out Partial Deal with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that he did not rule out the possibility to seal
a partial deal with the Palestinians, which will leave some
problems for further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, the prime
minister stressed that while Israel would prefer to settle all
disagreements and resolve all of the issues with the Palestinians
in one comprehensive deal, it is still possible to achieve a
partial agreement, according to a statement issued by his office.
</P>
<P>
Such a partial agreement will resolve the disputes between the
two sides over most issues, while defining a mechanism and pre-
determining a timetable for negotiating a settlement on a small
number of remaining issues, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak emphasized, it will be a mistake for the Israeli
side to raise the possibility to extend the interim agreement,
because such an arrangement will only force Israel to continue
transferring assets without receiving anything in return.
</P>
<P>
Barak noted that Israel must continue to exhaust all chances of
reaching a settlement, which will resolve all or "most" of the
issues, rather than accept an extended interim deal.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's remarks echoed those of his acting foreign
minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, who said last Thursday that Israel does
not rule out a partial peace deal with the Palestinians which
excludes a solution of the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue, including the issue of sovereignty over the
Temple Mount, is the bottleneck in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process. It was the deal-breaker at last July's Camp David summit
between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and United States
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed the holy city as its "eternal and undivided"
capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
During and after the Camp David summit, various proposals on
Jerusalem and the Temple Mount had been raised by Egyptian,
American and European officials. However, none of them have been
agreed upon by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak reiterated Sunday that Israel is opposed to the transfer
of sovereignty over the Temple Mount to the Palestinians or any
Islamic body, an idea which has been promoted by Arafat recently.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said that he is considering a summit meeting with
Arafat, which will be an essential confidence-building measure at
this moment of truth for reviving the peace talks, even if concrete
issues are not discussed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that no meeting has yet been determined.
Earlier, senior Palestinian officials reported that Arafat has
refused such a meeting with Barak.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Foreign Ministry announced
Sunday that Ben-Ami will begin his visit to Egypt and Jordan on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the visits, the acting foreign minister will meet
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan King Abdullah Bin
Hussein to discuss the peace negotiations. Both of the Arab
leaders have great influence on the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami may test Mubarak and Abdullah's reaction to a package of
bridging proposals which the Americans are working on in the past
few days. Both sides now are waiting for the proposal package for
continuing their talks.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Consumer Price Index Up 0.5 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's consumer price
index rose by 0.5 percent in August this year over a month ago,
largely on the back of higher housing cost, the Department of
Statistics (SDS) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Food prices edged up 0.2 percent in August mainly due to dearer
leafy vegetables while housing cost rose by 1.5 percent as a
result of higher electricity tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Dearer ready-made garments raised the clothing index by 1.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Costs of transport and communication climbed by 0.2 percent
with dearer petrol more than offsetting lower car prices.
</P>
<P>
Health care cost and prices of miscellaneous items were 0.6
percent and 0.1 percent higher, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Education index remained stable in August.

<HEADLINE> Over 800 Million People Suffering from Hunger: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 million
people, or 13 percent of the world's population, have been living
in a state of hunger due to lack of access to adequate food supply,
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has
said.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said in its latest annual report available here on
Sunday that more than 30 countries around the globe are currently
in need of emergency food and the situations in Africa are of
major concerns.
</P>
<P>
Back to last April, some 18 million people in eight African
countries were in need of urgent international food aid. Of the
hungry population in Africa, over 10 million are found in Ethiopia,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The FAO attributed the massive number of food insecure
population in the developing countries to "adverse climatic
conditions, negative economic impact of the 1997 financial crisis,
declining prices of their major export commodities, and in a
number of cases, political instabilities and conflicts".
</P>
<P>
Armed conflict and civil strife are major sources of food
insecurity inflicting severe losses in the agricultural
productivity of the developing countries, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
It said bloody wars and conflicts have resulted in losses of
some 121 billion U.S. dollars over the past 28 years from 1970 to
1997, an average of 4.3 billion dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Able to Produce Test Tube Babies: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian gynecologists
have now been able to perform test tube baby reproduction process,
saving troubled couples lots of money to travel abroad for
solutions, the official Sunday News reported.
</P>
<P>
Malise Kaisi, a gynecologist from the Muhimbili National
Hospital, was quoted as saying on Saturday that already two babies,
whose parents underwent the Intro-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (
ICSI), a special reproductive assisted technology in the hospital,
were born last month.
</P>
<P>
Another woman of four-month twin embryos is also expected to
deliver sometime next year after undertaking a successful ICSI "
test tube" process, Kaisi said.
</P>
<P>
Before Tanzania grasped such a technology, couples have to
travel to the United Kingdom or South Africa for treatment, which
usually costs a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
According to Kaisi, ICSI is a program couples undertake if
either a woman does not have fallopian tubes or a husband has low
sperm count, which is not enough to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
For the embryo to be created, he said, sperms of the husband
and an ovary from a woman are joined in the test tube and later
the embryo is inserted into the woman's womb.
</P>
<P>
The Muhimbili National Hospital, the largest in Tanzania, has
been trying to find an easy and cheap way of achieving the
conception without doing extra job and other tests that are costly,
Kaisi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the study to have an ICSI program at his hospital
started in 1988 with an assistance from a German professor before
coming up with successful reproduction last month.
</P>
<P>
Although the process is very costly and time-consuming, he
explained, the cost cannot exceed the process of sending couples
outside the country to be assisted to bear children.

<HEADLINE> IFC Increases Investment in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) rose its investment by 10 percent to 5.8 billion
U.S. dollars in the 1999-2000 fiscal year over the previous fiscal
year, according to the IFC annual reported issued here today.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the new investment of IFC, a private sector
investment arm of the World Bank Group, will be placed in
developing nations, said IFC Executive Vice President Peter Woicke.
</P>
<P>
The money will be invested in 259 new projects in 81 countries,
focusing on the financial sector and infrastructure, the report
shows.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Woicke warned that the developing countries are
suffering from serious environmental problems despite economic
improvement.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, globalization has not brought benefits yet to
millions of poor people. Clearly, serious environmental problems
are not being adequately resolved. And it is fully appropriate
that we be held accountable for producing real results on the
ground," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's Tereza Marinova
captured the women's triple jump gold medal at the 27th Olympic
Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Marinova, winner of the World Junior Championships in 1996,
soared to 15.20 meters in her first and only successful attempt.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Lebedeva of Russia, fourth placer in last year's World
Championships in Seville, took the silver with a leap of 15.00
meters. The bronze went to Ukraine's Olena Hovorova with 14.96m,
who was the winner of last year's World University Games and third
finisher in the 1997 World Championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Marinova said after the competition: "Honestly, my plan was to
get in the top eight and then go for a medal. I did want to be an
Olympic champion. I did expect this. I even expected better.
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I confused the other competitors. I tried very
hard. I had an operation last year and I feel good."
</P>
<P>
She added: "After my first jump, I didn't think it was good
enough. I was worried about the Russian. I thought it would take a
bigger jump. I am very happy for Bulgaria. I means so much to
everyone back home."
</P>
<P>
Lebedeva said: "A year ago, a medal would have been out of my
sight. Tonight I was upset I got second, I tried to talk myself
through, saying this is the Olympic Games, this is it, I've got to
do it."
</P>
<P>
The bronze medalist Hovorova said she had made a lot
preparation and worked hard for the Olympic Games. "I would like
to thank everyone who helped me to win a medal -- my coach, my
husband, my mother and father and all my friends."
</P>
<P>
She said: "The rain did not interfere with my jumping. I was
more afraid of it messing up my makeup."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) on Sunday released
further details of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) privatization
share offer.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to sell up to one billion shares, or 20
percent of the issued share capital of MTR Corporation Limited
through the privatization share offer. The underwriters will be
granted with an over-allotment option for up to an additional 150
million shares.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that 20 percent of the shares on offer, or
200 million shares, will initially be allocated to investors in
the Hong Kong public offer. The final split of shares between the
Hong Kong public offer and the international offer will depend on
the demand and will be finalized following the closing of the
offer.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the government's objective of encouraging
retail participation, it is expected that a significant portion of
the total offer will be made available to Hong Kong retail
investors.
</P>
<P>
The maximum offer price to be paid by investors in the Hong
Kong public offer will be 9.38 HK dollars (1.2 U.S. dollars) per
share. Eligible retail investors will be entitled to receive
retail incentives, including a 5.25 percent discount to the final
offer price and loyalty bonus shares.
</P>
<P>
Martin Glass, deputy secretary for treasury, said that the MTR
privatization share offer provides investors with a great
opportunity to secure a stake in a profitable, world-class railway
company, which has a successful track record of developing
properties associated with its railway projects.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong public offer will open from September 25 to 28.
Dealings in the shares on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong are
expected to commence on October 5.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Ban Pollutant Detergents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will soon ban
the manufacture and sale of household industrial detergents
containing toxic chemicals that pollute the country's water bodies.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Eduardo Gullas said both the chambers of
the Congress have already passed a bill to that effect, and it is
now ready to be signed into law by the president, the Philippine
News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, all detergent manufacturers shall be required
to shift from hard surfactants to linear ones that have higher
biodegradability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Once the bill is signed into law, the Philippines would be the
62nd country to ban the use of hard surfactants in detergents,
Gullas said.
</P>
<P>
He said violators of the ban shall face up to five years in
prison plus a fine of up to 1 million pesos (about 22,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Department of Trade and Industry's Bureau
of Product Standards to revise its controls on detergents and
monitor enforcement of the ban.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Americans felt surprised and
overjoyed about the gold medal Laura Wilkinson won in the women's
10m platform diving on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson beat her favored Chinese opponents to win the title
at 543.75 points. China's 16-year-old Li Na finished second at
542.01, followed by Canadian Anne Montminy in the third place at
540.15.
</P>
<P>
"How surprised am I? Actually I knew it was in her, but it's
just nice to have that out there. It's a great surprise." said
Ken Armstrong, coach of Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
"The third dive helped out big time, but the fourth dive was it.
It's the key dive. If we don't get that, we're gone." said
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
The two Chinese divers Sang Xue and Li Na both faltered in the
third dive, collecting poor marks of 47.04 and 53.10 points
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said he didn't expect Wilkinson win the title:"I
don't have expectations like tht. WE go in one dive at a time and
she does her job. She competes against the dives, she does not
compete against anybody else."
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said she thought the gold medal was out of reach:"I
did think at first, and then I thought 'well, I have nothing to
lose. I have everything to put into it',so i didn't hold anything
back."
</P>
<P>
Li Na conceded she didn't do well in the final:"It is not very
satisfactory. I didn't do very well, particularly in the third
dive."

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Sergey Kliugin beat a
field of big names to win the men's high jump gold medal at the 27
th Olympic Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kliugin made a first-up clearance of 2.35 meters, a season's
best, to take the lead. World record holder Javier Sotomayor of
Cuba had only had two jumps up to that point, first-up clearance
at 2.25m and 2.32m. With a first-up miss at 2.35m, he was
instantly on the backfoot.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the light rain got heavier, effectively closing
the door on the other jumpers, although Kliugin's clearance looked
the measure of the field.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor had to settle for silver, adding to his gold from
Barcelona Games in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's Abderrrahmane Hammad took the bronze on countback.
The African champion has made big gains from a best of 2.21m two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky," Kliugin said. "The rain helped me. I am
surprised with my win."
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor said: "I feel happy. I would like to compete a bit
better than this but unfortunately the weather, the win and the
rain were against me -- in the first jump I didn't feel it, but on
the second, I did."
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Cuban said that he will retire the next year. "
I intend to compete for one more year only, as I spent the past
year out and didn't compete (due to the sanctions) and that
affected me psychologically. So this is my last Olympics. I've
been competing for 17 years."
</P>
<P>
He added that he hopes his world record of 2.45m could stand
for a long time. "I hope this record will stay with me a long time,
but not forever. It will eventually be broken."
</P>
<P>
Others to clear 2.32m but miss the medals on countback were
Konstantin Matoussevic of Israel, Mark Boswell of Canada and
Swedish pair Stefan Holm and Steffan Strand.
</P>
<P>
Pre-competition favorite Vyacheslav Voronin of Russia finished
10th after injuring his take-off leg early in the competition.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tereza Marinova of Bulgaria
took the Olympic women's triple jump gold medal with her only
legal jump in the competition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Marinova, the 1996 world junior champion, leapt 15.20 meters to
win the title with her first leap, then fouled the next five as it
began to rain. Her winning distance was a personal best by 30cms.
</P>
<P>
Russian Tatyana Lebedeva finished second at 15.00 and Olena
Hovorova of Ukraine third at 14.96.
</P>
<P>
Lebedeva, struggling in the changing wind and rain, was third
until her penultimate attempt.
</P>
<P>
With 13 wins in 14 competitions, she had looked unbeatable all
season and underlined her superiority two weeks before Sydney when
jumping 15.32 meters in Japan, the third best performance of all
time.
</P>
<P>
Marinova was the one jumper to beat Lebedeva this season.

<HEADLINE> Norway to Meet United States in Women's Football Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Old rivals the United States
will meet Norway in the final of the Sydney Olympic Games women's
football tournament after both brushed aside semi-final opponents
1-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The United States beat Brazil with a 60th minute goal which
Brazilian coach Jose Duarte said should have been disallowed for a
foul on his goalkeeper, Andreia.
</P>
<P>
Norway's win over Germany was down to an own-goal by German
defender Tina Wunderlich. It was a classic misunderstanding,
Wunderlich heading a cross from Norwegian defender Hege Riise over
her goalkeeper's head.
</P>
<P>
It was a devastating setback for the Germans, who dominated the
second half only for striker Inge Grings to miss several chances.
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Brazil did enough against the United States to suggest
it will be a permanent member of the first rank of women's soccer
teams.
</P>
<P>
However, its pace and passion was not enough to undermine a
well-prepared American team, and after striker Katia was taken off
with an injury, what penetration it had up front was largely
blunted.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading British Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The cabinet was at war with itself Saturday night as a new
poll showed the Tory leads over Labor stretching to eight points,
the party's biggest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The government's advisory body on family policy has declared
that the legalization of homosexual marriage is "inevitable." Mary
MacLeod, the chief executive of the National Family and Parenting
Institute, said that it was "hard to argue against" the case for
giving homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair on Sunday calls on Labor to "stand firm" after
the toughest two weeks of his premiership, with a clear signal
that pensioners and fuel protesters can expect more from the
government in the Chancellor's Budget.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair will on Sunday issue his first public expression
of regret over the Dome fiasco at the start of a week during which
he will seek to restore confidence in his battered government.
</P>
<P>
The Mail on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Diana, Princess of Wales, was on Saturday night branded a
cruel, manipulative, and devious woman who delighted in plotting
against her staff and enemies. The unprecedented character
assassination was made by Patrick Jephson, the Princess's former
private secretary, who has written the controversial and
unauthorized book Shadow Of A Princess.

<HEADLINE> Most Swiss Oppose Restricting Number of Foreigners: Opinion Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Opinion polls before Sunday's
referenda have shown that most Swiss are against a proposal to
limit the number of resident foreigners in the country to 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion polls indicated that the move would be
defeated and 50 percent of the electorate would vote against, with
29 percent in favor.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government, big businesses and the main political
parties came out against the measure with the only exception being
the right-wing People's Party, which was divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, launched by a local Radical Party politician
from Aargau, Philipp Muller, seeks to reduce the number of
foreigners to the 1994 level when the initiative was launched. The
number has risen steadily in recent years and now stands at 1.3
million, 19.3 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has aroused considerable controversy. Opponents
said it would harm the Swiss economy, heavily dependent on foreign
labor, and damage Switzerland's image abroad. They said a
reduction in foreigners would also call into question the
bilateral accords that Switzerland has signed with the European
Union which allows the free movement of people.
</P>
<P>
In a series of referenda over the weekend, the Swiss are also
voting on three energy-related proposals. All of them are
proposing a levy on the use of non-renewable energy sources, but
differ on the size of the tax and how the proceeds would be used.
</P>
<P>
The voters will vote on the voting process itself. Another
initiative being considered on Sunday would in future allow the
electorate to accept part of a referendum proposal. At the moment,
the electorate is faced with the choice of accepting all or
nothing.

<HEADLINE> Day-9 Roundup: Europeans Catch Up Americans in Gold Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- As rains dropped onto the
track and field at the Olympic Stadium, both the Europeans and
Asians denied the limelight for the Americans as Japanese Naoko
Takahashi won the first track gold in the women's marathon and
Russian Sergey Kliugin cleared the highest in the men's high jump
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After the United States broke away in the medal tally in the
first half of the Games, both the rowing and gymnastics served as
springboards for others to catch up as the Europeans dominated in
the water, with Romania's Elisabeta Lipa winning her fourth gold
and seventh medal overall through the women's eight.
</P>
<P>
So far, Lipa has been credited as the best rowing athlete with
the most medals in the Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
Italy won its first Olympic sailing gold in 48 years when
Alessandra Sensini triumphed in the women's Mistral sailboard
class, and Christoph Sieber awarded Austria's its second gold
medal in the men's Mistral.
</P>
<P>
Sensini's victory was Italy's first gold since Agostino
Straulino and Niko Rhode won the Star keelboat class in Helsinki
in 1952.
</P>
<P>
When an Olympic marathon gold has eluded the Japanese who had
long been strong in the event, Takahashi eventually met Japan's
expectations for the whole Olympics by striding first onto the 110,
000-capacity Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans won seven gold on the final day of the rowing
regatta, leaving the Americans empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
The Russians overtook the Australians in the gold tally, thanks
to two in gymnastics, one in men's team sabre fencing and Sergei
Kliugin's high-jump triumph.
</P>
<P>
Gymnast darling Svetlana Khorkina salvaged her pride with a
flawless routine on the uneven bars which earned her a 9.862 for
an Olympic gold after she, an unbeaten winner since the 1995 World
Championship, went off the bars twice in the women's team and
individual all-around event.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriot Elena Zamolodtchikova also triumphed in the
vault competitions to add an Olympic gold to her world title
earned last year in Tianjin. Her gold-winning score was 9.731,
followed by Romania's all-around champion Andreea Raducan.
</P>
<P>
Igors Vihrovs of Latvia surprised a star-studded field to take
the men's floor exercise gold with 9.812 points, European pommel
horse champion Marius Urzica of Romania clinched his Olympic gold
in his specialty, with a day-high 9.862 points, and the men's
rings gold went to Szilveszter Csollany of Hungary, who earned a 9.
850 score.
</P>
<P>
Kliugin became the only athlete to clear 2.35 meters at the
men's high jump competitions, and claimed the gold medal in pride,
while world record holder Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, failed three
times against the height, only won a lucky silver after a group of
three athletes successfully beat the 2.32 meters in their first
attempt.
</P>
<P>
However, a fifth athlete was kicked out of the Games as rower
Andris Reinholds tested positive for nandrolone after he finished
ninth in the men's singles sculls. Earlier, three Bulgarian
weightlifters were stripped of medals for a diuretic, and a
Belarus hammer thrower was expelled for steroids in an out-of-
competition test.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, the Americans won a surprise gold from the
women's 10m platform as hot favorites from China Sang Xue and Li
Na committed fatal mistakes in the third round of the diving final.

SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Sergey Kliugin of Russia
defeated world record holder Javier Sotomayor of Cuba to win the
men's high jump gold medal at the Sydney Olympic Games here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian was the only athlete who cleared 2.35 meters in
down-pour while six others managed 2.32 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor had the silver on countback after missing fewer
previous jumps and Algeria's Abderrahmane Hammad took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor was only allowed to compete at Sydney after a two-
year ban for taking cocaine was halved on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
World champion Vyacheslav Voronin of Russia, meanwhile,missed
out on the medals, only clearing 2.29. He finished tenth.
</P>
<P>
Voronin had come to the Games as the man in form after clearing
2.40 at the London grand prix in August, the highest jump for five
years.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Sergey Kliugin beat a
field of big names to win the men's high jump gold medal at the 27
th Olympic Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kliugin made a first-up clearance of 2.35 meters, a season's
best, to take the lead. World record holder Javier Sotomayor of
Cuba had only had two jumps up to that point, first-up clearance
at 2.25m and 2.32m. With a first-up miss at 2.35m, he was
instantly on the backfoot.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the light rain got heavier, effectively closing
the door on the other jumpers, although Kliugin's clearance looked
the measure of the field.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor had to settle for silver, adding to his gold from
Barcelona Games in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's Abderrrahmane Hammad took the bronze on countback.
The African champion has made big gains from a best of 2.21m two

<HEADLINE> Monitoring Committee to be Established for Burundian Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A monitoring committee
in charge of the implementation of the Burundi peace accord signed
last month in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha will be
established soon, according to a report by the independent Sunday
Observer newspaper.
</P>
<P>
All 19 parties to the Burundi peace talks will convene in
Arusha on Monday to map out strategies for the implementation of
the August 28 peace accord and resolve the issue on who will head
the transitional authority and its composition, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The forum will be charged with deliberating on the formation of
a 12-man peace accord implementation monitoring committee, which
will be entrusted with the mandate of monitoring all stages of the
pact's implementation, Mark Bomani, top aid to international
facilitator and former South African President Nelson Mandela, was
quoted as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomani, the forum will elect two representatives
to the committee, each representing one of the two camps in the
talks, the G-10 made of ten pro-Tutsi parties and the G-7 made up
of seven pro-Hutu parties.
</P>
<P>
The forum will also be charged with the role of electing six
committee members from within or outside the parties provided they
support the drive for peace.
</P>
<P>
The six committee members to be voted into the forum will first
be scrutinized, with their contribution to the Burundi society and
their ability to enhance implementation of the peace accord to be
used as criteria by those voting for them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the remaining four members of the committee will be the
United Nations Secretary General's representative, the
Organization of African Unity Chief representative and the Burundi
government and Great Lakes Regional representatives.
</P>
<P>
During the forum, the parties will also discuss the strategic
question of who will head the Burundi transitional authority and
its composition.
</P>
<P>
This question was not included in last month's accord, Bomani
said, but because it is key to the whole peace process, the
parties are going to work on it and reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts by Mandela and the international
community, Burundian President Pierre Buyoya's government, the
army, seven Hutu political parties and ten Tutsi parties agreed in
the August 28 peace deal to an ethnically balanced military and
legislature as well as a transitional government until elections
can be held in three years.
</P>
<P>
But the two major Hutu rebel groups, CNDD-FDD and FNL,
boycotted the talks in Arusha and refused to sign the agreement.
They insist they are political as well as military movements, and
demand the right to negotiate their own political settlement with
the government.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has actually intensified since the accord was signed.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's civil war began in 1993 when paratroopers from the
Tutsi-dominated army assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu. More
than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in attacks
by the army and the rebels.

CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- A British economic mission representing 35 companies arrived
Saturday in Egypt's port city of Alexandria to explore ways of
concluding deals and setting up projects in cooperation with
Egyptian companies.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef
Wali said Egypt is making utmost efforts to protect the ozone layer
by minimizing the use of materials which may cause erosion of the
layer and making available ozone layer friendly materials.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Health and Population Ismail Sallam
Saturday approved a plan to combat Rift Valley Fever which
transfers from animals to human beings. The ministry warned
citizens against approaching animal wastes which bear contagion.
The fever has killed 21 people in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli officials said Saturday night they doubt the
suspension of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk's security
clearance for alleged security lapses will impact on the peace
process, even though he is a key member of the U.S.
Administration's "peace team" that has been shepherding the process
along for years.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I am not sure how long Indyk will be gone," a
source close to the negotiations said. "He is important, but there
are also a number of other U.S. officials involved in the process,
like (Secretary of State Madeleine) Albright, (National Security
Council head Sandy) Berger, and (U.S. special envoy Dennis) Ross."
</P>
<P>
Indyk was informed Thursday night that his security clearance
was suspended. This means he cannot handle classified materials,
must have an escort when he is inside the State Department
building, and cannot now return to Israel, making it impossible for
him to work as ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton has for now opted not to present
the Palestinians and Israelis with an American document containing
recommendations for bridging the differences which have persisted
between the two sides in recent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the United States intends to continue in its
efforts to bring the two sides closer, and will make occasional
verbal recommendations in order to help Israel and the Palestinians
reach a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright informed Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami of the president's decision during phone calls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- It was pedestrians and bicycles only on the streets of
downtown Tel Aviv as residents observed the city's first Car-Free
Day on Friday.
</P>
<P>
City officials expect to find out Sunday whether the day-long
ban on cars in a six-square-kilometer radius in the city center
actually lowered air and noise pollution levels, said Shalom
Elkayam, Tel Aviv's director-general of municipal services.
</P>
<P>
While some annoyed drivers and motorcyclists argued with the
hundreds of policemen and municipal inspectors who informed them
that they could not drive into the center of town, most drivers
took the closure in stride, police said.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Yehuda Amichai, Israel's most beloved poet, who died at age
76 of cancer at Hadassah University Hospital Friday morning, will
be buried Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said that, "
One of the greatest artists of Israel and the Jewish world has gone
from among us."
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, Amichai had been on the short list
for next year's Nobel Prize for Literature. However, the award is
not given posthumously.
</P>
<P>
Amichai wove the longings of the ancient Jewish poets together
with the spare introspection of modern stylists to create an
Israeli poetry.

<HEADLINE> Manila Keeps Contact Open with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it is keeping communication lines open with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in a bid to realize genuine and
lasting peace in Mindanao,
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Edgardo Batenga said in a
statement this was the prime directive of the government's Cabinet
Cluster E,which handles national security and peace and order
concerns, to him during their last meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Their guidance to me was to make sure the lines of
communication are open and make sure that contact with the MILF
central leadership is open so we can pursue the process in
accordance with the comprehensive peace policy," said Batenga.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for the resumption of peace talks with the MILF were
revived, following reports that the MILF has reconstituted its
peace panel.
</P>
<P>
Batenga said this was the result of weeks of backdoor
negotiations with the MILF central leadership. The MILF dissolved
its peace panel some weeks ago after government troops launched a
massive attack against its camps in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this development should accelerate efforts to
ensure that peace negotiations are restarted very soon, adding
that the government is looking forward to attaining the
environment necessary for the process to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF is the country's largest rebel group
which has been fighting for more than two decades for an
independent Muslim state in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges MILF Leader to Recall Jihad Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reiterated Sunday its dare to Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
chairman Hashim Salamat to recall his command for a jihad against
the government.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said in a
statement that the call for jihad has done much harm to residents,
and has not defended the cause of the Islam faith.
</P>
<P>
"Some of his followers have become emotional in heeding his
call, but majority of the Muslims do not support it. Salamat
should recall that order for a jihad now," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
He also said many followers of Salamat in the MILF, in their
over-zealousness, have committed acts of harassment against
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Salamat initially called for a jihad against the government
after military troops overran the MILF's main stronghold in
Mindanao, Camp Abubakar, on July 9.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, many incidents involving the MILF have
resulted in the killing of innocent civilians, and the rise of
Christian vigilantes. The incidents prompted President Joseph
Estrada to reiterate his order to local officials in some areas of
Mindanao to prevent the conflict from degenerating into a
religious war.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada is committed to transform Mindanao into the
country's next food basket as well as to bring genuine and lasting
peace and progress in the island.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF is the country's largest rebel group
which has been fighting for more than two decades for an
independent Muslim state in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Victims Reduced in Northern Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of leprosy
patients in the northern Tigray State of Ethiopia has been lowered
remarkably in the last five years, the Walta Information Center
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There are now only 16 leprosy patients in the area as compared
to 536 five years ago, leprosy expert Ghebrezgi Agua of the
Central Tigray Zonal Health Department was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ghebrezgi attributed the decline in the population of the
debilitating disease to sufficient supply of drugs and continuous
monitoring by medical workers.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy monitoring has been conducted in 15 health institutions
throughout the area, Ghebrezgi said, adding that the effort has
been immensely assisted by the German Leprosy Control Organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, a similar assistance by Dutch leprosy
control organizations in the form of drugs, clothing and other
specialized items has also contributed to the success of the
control program.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Imported Sugar Arrives in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Three ships carrying the
first batch of imported white sugar weighted 24,036 tons have
arrived in Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa to ease the current
sugar shortage in the East African country.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the cargo, which originated from Brazil, have paid
100 percent duty on the sugar according to the new tariff rate,
the Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
One of the three vessels has waited on the high seas for over
20 days since August 30 following a duty row between one of the
importers and the Kenya Revenue Authority.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the sugar importers wanted a favorable
import duty of 40 percent which is charged for raw sugar.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Chris Obure Saturday said that business
people are free to import sugar provided they pay the required 100
percent tax on the commodity.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that with the arrival of imported sugar,
the shortage will disappear and the price go down.
</P>
<P>
Sugar prices in Kenya have soared up by more than 40 percent in
recent months due to an acute shortage of the commodity.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Children Petition Sudanese President Over Kidnapped Ugandan Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 14,000 Belgian
children have signed a petition to Sudanese President Omar el
Bashir to release Ugandan children abducted by the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The children signed the petition in reaction to the facts
written by Belgian writer Els De Temmerman in her new book "The
Children of Aboke", the New Vision daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The book written and published in Belgium exposes how Ugandan
children were kidnapped, taken to Sudan, brutally abused, beaten
and starved to death and also forced to fight the wars over the
borders of Uganda and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels, based in southern Sudan, have been engaged in
activities against the Ugandan government in the northern region.
</P>
<P>
Reports earlier this week said the Sudanese government, in a
communique signed in Canada with the Ugandan government, has
agreed to work towards the release of about 6,000 Ugandan abducted
children.
</P>
<P>
A batch of 16 children were reportedly released from Sudan on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Military Delegation Enters S.Korea for Defense-Ministerial Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A five-member delegation of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) armed forces entered
South Korea through the truce village of Panmumjom Sunday
afternoon for the first inter-Korean defense ministers' talks
scheduled for September 25-26.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation, headed by DPRK People's Armed Forces
Minister Kim Il-chol, will fly to South Korea's southern resort
island of Cheju for the talks with their South Korean counterparts
led by Defense Minister Cho Seong-tae.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be the first between defense ministers from the
two sides since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean delegation reportedly hopes to use the
forthcoming talks as a chance to discuss ways of reducing military
tension on the Korean peninsula and measures to promote military
confidence building between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is expected to seek the establishment of a
military hot line, prior notification of large-scale military
drills and troop movements and military exchanges, and will push
to regularize the defense ministers' talks with a view to having
the DPRK host the second talks in its territory.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPRK has wanted to limit the talks to military
issues related to the reconnection of the severed inter-Korean
railway and road links.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Korean ties have steadily improved since the summit
between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim
Jong Il in Pyongyang on June 13-15, in which the two leaders
agreed to seek reconciliation and eventual unification through
exchanges and cooperation in almost all fields.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Officials Call for Protection of Heritage Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali officials and social
activists Sunday called on both the government and the private
sector to be actively engaged in the preservation of Nepal's
cultural heritage sites.
</P>
<P>
"It is a responsibility of all people, not only the government
or Archaeology Department or the Municipal authority, to protect
the cultural heritage sites," Prithvi Raj Ligal, vice-chairman of
the National Planning Commission told an interaction program on
the protection of Nepal's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
Ligal said the government should take a lead to mobilize all
the people to play an active role on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Sudarshan Tiwari, chief of the Nepali National Heritage Society,
said both the government and people have not been able to
understand the importance of the cultural heritage and inadequate
protections have been put to the heritage sites, which are in
critical condition and can be labeled endangered.
</P>
<P>
As the origin of Buddhism, Nepal boasts of numerous cultural
and religious heritage sites. Among them, the Durbar Squares of
Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur municipalities in the Kathmandu
valley, temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan, stupas of
Swayambhu and Boudha as well as Lumbini (the birthplace of Buddha
) are included in the World Heritage List by the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization.

HAVANA -- About 25,000 Cubans held a rally Saturday in the
eastern province of Holguin in protest against the immigration
policy of the United States.
</P>

They said the policy has caused the death of thousands of
Cubans, who plunged into the sea in expectation of being granted
residence if they would reach the U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
They also condemned the economic blockade against the Caribbean
nation, which the official data say has caused more than 70
billion U.S. dollars in economic loss to the island country. (

SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Christoph Sieber defeated
Argentina's Carlos Espinola in the final two races to win the gold
medal of the men's Mistral sailboard event at the Sydney Olympic
Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the second gold for Austria in sailing in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
His victory came after compatriots Roman Hagara and Hans Peter
Steinacher wrapped up gold in the Tornado catamaran class on
Friday with two races to spare.
</P>
<P>
Sieber came into the regatta without a major international
title and started the final two races of the 11-race series 10
points behind Espinola, who took another silver medal to join the
one he took in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
With competitors able to discard their worst two finishes,the
29-year-old Sieber set up his victory with a fifth placing in race
10.
</P>
<P>
This allowed him to discard 23rd and 24th placings from earlier
races and saw him leapfrog Espinola before the start of the final
race.
</P>
<P>
With sailors enjoying some of the best conditions since the
regatta began on Sydney Harbour a week ago, Sieber then sailed
conservatively in the final race knowing he had only to finish in
the top 10 to secure the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
He finished seventh in the final race, with Espinola's third
place enough to secure his second silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta gold medallist Nikolaos Kaklamankis of Greece won the
final race but finished out of medal contention after a
disappointing start to the series in often flukey winds on
Sydney's picturesque harbour.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Aaron McIntosh finished fourth in the final race
to secure the bronze medal.

<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala promised Saturday to reshuffle the cabinet
next month in order to improve governance, the official Rising
Nepal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, senior leader of the
ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party and former prime minister, that
he would reshuffle the cabinet and the Central Working Committee
of NC after the Dashain festival, the biggest Nepali festival that
will fall on October 4-18, the English daily quoted a party source
as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the 20-minute talks between Koirala and Bhattarai
Saturday morning, Bhattarai asked Koirala to implement as soon as
possible the understandings reached between them last month, said
Narayan Khadka, chief advisor to Bhattarai when he was the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The understandings were reached between the two leaders in
August when some NC members backed by Bhattarai asked Koirala
either to quit the job of prime minister or the presidency of NC
on the ground that one can not hold two posts at the same time.
</P>
<P>
One important part of the understanding was the reshuffle of
the cabinet and the central working committee.
</P>
<P>
As a long-friend-turned-foe of Koirala, Bhattarai wishes to
include more of his supporters in the new cabinet.

The deployment of the U.S. marines to East Timor came days
after three U.N. aid workers were slain in West Timor (Indonesia's
East Nusa Tenggara province), where their local office was
attacked by pro-Jakarta East Timorese militias on September 6 in
the town of Atambua.
</P>
<P>
The general made the instruction on Saturday in Atambua, a city
of East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
Syahnakri had previously said, U.S. warships with 600 marines
on board had arrived at a point near the Indonesian-East Timor
border in East Nusa Tenggara and that U.N. peacekeeping forces
based in East Timor had been trespassing on Indonesian territory.
</P>
<P>
He said on September 22 that the U.N. peacekeeping forces again
violated the border line prompting the TNI to send a protest to
the peacekeeping forces command in Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Syahnakri said several days ago the U.S/ marines infringed on
the border and the TNI then also lodged a protest to the U.N.
peacekeeping forces leadership. In response to the TNI's protest,
the U.N. peacekeeping forces offered an apology.
</P>
<P>
But he said the U.N. peacekeeping forces should not only come
up with an apology but also show it respects the borderline.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. peacekeeping forces had ascribed the U.S.
marines' infringement to their unfamiliarity with the terrain and
the borderline.
</P>
<P>
"They (the U.S. marines) professed to have strayed into
Indonesian territory because they had misread their map when
distributing humanitarian aid in the border areas. But frankly
speaking, I doubt that that was the real reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a border incident involving the
U.S. troops in the days ahead, Syahnakri said the U.S. troops
would take the Indonesian troops' strength into account before
trying anything.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Enhance Coordination With Non-OPEC Oil Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) said Saturday that it will strengthen
coordination with non-OPEC oil producing countries to maintain a
stable international oil market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC current president and Venezuelan Energy Minister Ali
Rodriguez said that the coordination between OPEC and non-OPEC is
vital for stabilizing the international crude prices.
</P>
<P>
So Russia, Oman, Norway, Mexico and Angola have been invited as
independent oil producers to attend the second OPEC summit, which
is slated for September 26-28 here to redefine "its principles and
establish a base for future actions" as Rodriguez put it.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the five countries have made their contribution
to stabilizing crude prices at the international market, which
have been hanging far over the OPEC reference price band of 22-28
U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
In spite of OPEC's promise to raise oil production, analysts
predict that world crude prices are likely to exceed 40 U.S
dollars per barrel by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
But, the OPEC president said Wednesday, leaders at the
gathering will not discuss the issue of rising price and they will
focus on broader issues and principles.
</P>
<P>
"The price of a barrel (of oil) is not on the agenda for the
Caracas meeting because its objective is to adapt the principles
of OPEC to the new global reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Iraq and Kuwait, Rodriguez described
as "deplorable" and the new tension between the two OPEC members
and said that it has been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly denied the allegations that it threatens
Kuwait which accuses the former of stealing oil under the border
areas between them.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that he hopes the forthcoming summit will help
reduce the tension and build peace between the two major middle
East oil producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member OPEC, which holds more than 75 percent of the
world's known crude oil reserves, held its first summit in Algiers
in 1975. Since then, all OPEC meetings have been attended by
energy ministers.

<HEADLINE> Austria Ready to Share EU's Security Responsibility, Austrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister
Benita Ferrero-Waldner said on Saturday that Austria is completely
reliable in sharing the European Union (EU)'s common security and
defense.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner made this remark at the seventh
Ostwestfaelische congress on security policies that is being held
in the western German city Minden.
</P>
<P>
She said Austria is determined to exert its force as other EU
members do in every field concerning the bloc's security and
defense.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should
cooperate more closely and with more trust, the Austrian foreign
minister added.
</P>
<P>
She also promised Austria will take part in the EU's military
actions at convenient times.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Defense Army will contribute 2,000 soldiers in two
battalions and diverse supply, transport and first aid contingents
to a future European force before 2003.
</P>
<P>
The European rapid-deployment force will consist of 60,000 men
capable of responding to a crisis within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Austria declared permanent neutrality in October 1955, which
means it will not participate in any military alliance. It
supported NATO when the later attacked Yugoslavia, but it did not
send soldiers to the war or permit NATO planes to fly over its
airspace.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Embassy to Move out of Luxurious London Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan embassy is
going to move out from its luxurious residence in London as part
of the plan initiated by President Jorge Batlle to reduce public
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan Foreign Minister Didier Opertti said on Saturday that
the government has already sold the usufruct of the embassy
premise in London for 10.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Opertti said that the money will be directed to the Economy
Ministry and other government organs to fund projects including
development work for the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
The residence, located around the Hyde Park and in Central
London, was given by the British government to Uruguay after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Opertti said that the Foreign Ministry is looking for "a
smaller and less costly residence" for its diplomatic
representation in London.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce the bulging budget deficit, Batlle
launched a policy of tightening public spending after assuming
presidency in March.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has saved one million dollars from cutting
traveling allowances, etiquette expenses, air traveling expenses,
and reducing the number of missions abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Alessandra Sensini of Italy
won the women's Mistral sailboard class gold medal at the Sydney
Olympic Games on Sunday after overtaking German Amelie Lux in the
11th and final race.
</P>
<P>
Sensini, who started the race a point behind former world youth
champion and early series leader Lux, sailed aggressively in fresh
southeasterly wind of up to 15 knots before Lux caught a windshift
and took the lead briefly in mid-race.
</P>
<P>
But Sensini, the world champion and bronze medallist in Atlanta
four years ago, made a bold gamble after rounding mark five by
sailing in close to the harbour's northern foreshore in the hope
of finding more wind.
</P>
<P>
The gamble paid off as she found stronger wind which scooped
out of one of the many small bays around the harbour and the
experienced Italian was catapulted back into the lead.
</P>
<P>
No more than 10 seconds separated the pair as Lux fought back
over the next four legs to the finish. Sensini, 30, fell
backwards off her board into the harbour after she crossed the
finish line seven seconds ahead of Lux.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Barbara Kendall finished third in the race to
take the bronze medal.

Takahashi, 28, who won the 1998 Asian Games title with a
stunning time of 2 hours 21 minutes 47 seconds in Bangkok's

</P>
<P>
"I was very confident going into the race," Takahashi said. "I
have spent the last three months training in the United States at
high altitude and training over hills, so I was confident with my
condition."
</P>
<P>
"At the 35km mark, I felt I could win, but as I ran into the
Stadium I had a quick look behind me, and I was scared Lidia Simon
was so close behind me. My breathing was OK, but my legs were
heavy."
</P>
<P>
Simon said: "It was very difficult for such a distance and very
few runners could go all the way. The hills were very difficult."
</P>
<P>
World record holder Tegla Loroupe of Kenya finished a distant
13th in 2:29:45.
</P>
<P>
"I felt sick and was throwing up this morning," Loroupe said. "
I must have eaten something but I don't know what it was. But I
don't like to stop during the race and I am happy I managed to
finish."

<HEADLINE> Great Prospect for Open-ended Funds in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Open-ended funds will become
the main stream in the Chinese stock market in the next five years,
today's "China Daily" quoted officials and experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new type of fund is expected to inject fresh blood into the
institutional investors and push them to upgrade management.
</P>
<P>
Top securities officials have expressed their support for open-
ended funds. Though no official timetable has been announced so
far, there are signs in the securities circle heralding a close
debut of the first open-ended fund in China. Passion for the fund
is high from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
Chinese fund management firms are taking bolder actions. Most
of them have designed their own outlay for open-ended funds after
thorough investigation and analysis.
</P>
<P>
Several of them, including Hua'an and Penghua, have formed
alliances with foreign counterparts to acquire technical support
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move signals that the work to set up open-
ended funds has come into a formal preparation period in China.
</P>
<P>
Presently, China has only closed-end funds and the securities
market is still dominated by retail investors, which have nurtured
more speculation sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Experts said open-ended funds, with more transparent operations
and high requirement for management and risk control, will push
domestic fund managers to improve themselves, which will help them
become better prepared for foreign competition after China joins
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
It will also boost institutional investors and help change the
retail dominated status in the bourses.

<HEADLINE> Internet Helps Reform China's Insurance Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Internet wave, which is
sweeping the world, will dramatically help reform the old business
model of China's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
Internet usage in the insurance business will greatly reduce
the costs of insurance companies and improve transaction
efficiency, "China Daily" quoted John Roglieri, vice-chief
executive of the E-commerce department of the world's largest
insurance group, AXA's US company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the policy management cost will drop by 98
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the infrastructure for developing on-line insurance
services will also mature as China's Internet technology makes
bigger strides and the number of Internet users grows dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The Ping An Insurance Company of China, the country's largest
shareholding insurer, last month launched its website company,
which provides money matter management services, on-line banking,
and on-line insurance to Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
Another major shareholding insurance company in China, the
Taikang Life Insurance Co. Ltd, last week also unveiled its
website offering on-line insurance information and insurance e-
commerce.
</P>
<P>
Although immediate effect has not been shown, insurers are
upbeat about the future. "with the increasing number of Internet
customers, we are optimistic about the prospect of on-line
insurance," said Liang Tao, an official with the Beijing office of
China's insurance industry watchdog, China Insurance Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, experts and officials at home and abroad admit that e-
commerce can not totally replace traditional insurance transaction
methods.

<HEADLINE> Copper Deposit discovered in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China has confirmed a copper
deposit with a probable reserve of 10 million tons on the eastern
part of Tianshan Mountain in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is considered a "breakthrough" in China's copper
exploration. The national bureau for geological survey has listed
prospecting of the deposit on top of its agenda. Tens of millions
of yuan have been poured into the early stage prospecting. More
copper mines are also expected to be found there.
</P>
<P>
The deposit is located at 80 km southwest of Hami city. It is
characterized by a thick deposit and easy exploitation, said Gong
Xiaoping, vice-president of the Xinjiang Regional Geological
Survey Agency.
</P>
<P>
As China lacks copper resources, the country spends huge
amounts of money annually importing copper from abroad. The
discovery of the deposit will alleviate the tense situation of
importing more copper.

<HEADLINE> Living Standards Improving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's per capita gross
domestic production (GDP) is expected to top 800 U.S. dollars by
the end of the year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
After China's GDP increased by three times in 1995 from 1980,
the per capita GDP also jumped three times in 1997, three years
earlier than the Ninth Five-Year plan had predicted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the growth rates of urban and rural citizens'
annual income was 5.6 percent and 5.4 percent respectively. The
urban per capita income hit 5,854 yuan (705.30 US dollars) while
farmers' average per capita net income reached 2,210 yuan (243.49
US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumption rose notably with more money spent on housing and
people owning more savings deposits, foreign exchange deposits,
stocks and other financial assets.
</P>
<P>
The consumption structure changed remarkably with reduced money
on basic daily necessities and increased spending on housing,
communication, medical insurance, education and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The Engel Index in China's urban areas went down from 49.9
percent in 1995 to 41.9 percent in 1999. While the Index in rural
areas decreased from 58.6 percent to 52.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The index, representing the ratio of expenditure on food
against the whole expenditure reflects the changes of people's
consumption patterns. Experts here predict the urban and rural
Engel index will continue to drop respectively to 40 percent and
50 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, living conditions and the consumption of durable
goods has increased as well. For example, owning a car was still
a dream to many families years ago. But not today.
</P>
<P>
Along with the improvement of the living standard of people in
urban areas, their cultural life is also greatly enriched.
Consumption on traveling has been boosted by extended public
holidays such as the Labor Day holiday in May and the week long
National Day holiday which starts on October 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- East Timorese militiamen in
East Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia, have surrendered hundreds
of weapons to local police, the Jakarta Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the first day for the militiamen to surrender
their weapons, the militiamen drove three cars packed with weapons
to a local police station, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In all, seven automatic rifles, nine grenade launchers, 485
homemade guns, four grenades and 687 rounds of ammunition were
handed in by members of the Thunder militia group, one of many
groups went on the rampage after the East Timorese voted for
independence in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of total disarmament of the East Timorese
militiamen in line with a resolution of the United Nations
following the killing of three U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
humanitarian workers in Atambua, East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military and police started a four-day operation
to disarm and disband the militiamen.
</P>
<P>
"More weapons will come in over the next few days," the report
quoted a military officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri was scheduled
to arrive in Atambua on Sunday to witness the disarmament of
militiamen and visit a refugee camp in the area, said the report.
</P>
<P>
There are still about 130,000 East Timorese refugees living in
Indonesia, most of them are in East Nusa Tenggara province
bordering with East Timor.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported a total of 32,
200 tons of rice in the first six months of this year, falling by
16.1 percent from the same period of 1999 when it registered at 38,
400 tons, according to the latest figures of the country's Central
Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Myanmar exported 63,700 tons of rice, a drop also from
111,700 tons in 1998, indicating a trend of down-sliding in the
export.
</P>
<P>
To meet its food demand, Myanmar has since January 1999
reclaimed 467,370 hectares of vacant, virgin, fallow and wetlands
in the country's six divisions and states for cultivation by
private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more reclamation of such lands in two other states
and divisions are also being planned in four years' time beginning
April 2001, the start of the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has abundance of cultivable land stretching 18.22
million hectares, of which only 9.31 million are under cultivation
while 8.91 million remained utilized.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President: Aceh Rebels Must Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid has said that separatist rebels in the restive
province of Aceh must be disarmed if they want to continue peace
negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement during a dialog meeting
Saturday in Bandung, capital of West Java province, the Antara
news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"GAM (Free Aceh Movement) forces are rebellious. We can invite
them for negotiations but they must disarm. there is no other
choice," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he will bring peace to Aceh, promising the oil and
natural resource-rich province will have more autonomy. But he has
refused to bow to the demands for an independence referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Saturday that he disagrees with the
implementation of strict Islam law in Aceh as applied in Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
The province's capital of Banda Aceh has been rocked by several
blasts over the past two days, damaging a military barrack and the
police headquarters, injuring at least one officer.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government officials and Aceh rebel negotiators
were scheduled to meet on September 23 in Switzerland to discuss
extension of a three-month cease-fire that came into force on June
2. The truce has already been extended for two weeks so that the
talks in Switzerland could take place.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire has been marred by at least 132 killings since
it came into effect, many of them over the past two weeks. Each
side has accused the other of violating the agreement, raising
fears that the peace process might collapse.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Indonesian military spokesman Rear Air Marshal
Graito Usodo said the security situation in Aceh was deteriorating
and that the cease-fire had been of little benefit to the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
Aceh has seen more than 25 years of fighting between government
forces and the GAM, which is seeking an independence state.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Ancient Buildings Preserved During Urban Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua)-- Most of the ancient
architecture in Beijing will be kept intact, though mass
reconstruction projects are underway in the national capital,
where recorded history dates back more than 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
There are several dozen ancient buildings along Ping'an Street,
the second longest street in Beijing after Chang'an avenue.
</P>
<P>
Some underground cultural relics of Tang (618-907), Yuan (1271-
1368) and Ming (1368-1644) Dynasties, and a mansion house of a
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) princess, the temporary dwelling place of
Sun Yat-sen, founder of Kuomintang are all well-protected while
the street is being widened, since architects have designed a
special shape for the street.
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding of the 40-year-old Guang'an Street started in August
this year and is scheduled to be finished in September next year.
Running across Beijing from west to east, it will become the city'
s third key street when the project is completed.
</P>
<P>
Project engineers have designed circular routes that head away
from old drugstores and publishing houses along the street. A
square of grassland was also constructed to protect an ancient
church in the area.
</P>
<P>
Protection of ancient buildings is given top priority during
the city's mass construction. Architects sought the best ways to
protect these historic legacies and workers were also taught how
to distinguish between them and protect them.

BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Following are highlights of
major environment news stories Xinhua released during the past
week:
</P>
<P>
More Polluting Enterprises Meet Environmental Standards
</P>
<P>
Approximately 92 percent of China's industrial polluters have
met state environmental standards, up two percent on July's
statistics, according to the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
An environmental protection decision made by the State Council
stipulates that all the Chinese industrial polluters and 46 key
cities for environmental protection must meet the related national
or regional standards by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
So far, 21,900 polluting enterprises have met the standards,
accounting for 91.9 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that China's industrial polluters have been
improving steadily, but gaps between different regions exist.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Stresses Development of Environmental Protection
</P>
<P>
China must adopt a new market system for making better use of
environmental protection facilities and boosting the development
of the environmental protection industry, said Zou Jiahua, vice-
chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zou made the remarks during an investigative trip, September 14-
20, concerning environmental protection in northeast China's
Liaoning Province. He visited an ecological agriculture zone and
some local enterprises that deal with sewage treatment, pollution
control, and high technologies.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Steps Up Environmental Protection
</P>
<P>
A provincial delegation set out on September 18 to look into
enforcement of environmental protection laws in this island
province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
It is a prelude to the province's "century tour" regarding
environmental protection for the year 2000. The tour is initiated
by 14 local organizations including the environment and resources
working committee of Hainan Provincial People's Congress.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Druze Party Leader Calls for "Language of Negotiation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Walid Jumblatt, leader of the
Lebanese Party of Progressive Society (PPS), on Sunday urged the
Lebanese to use the language of negotiation instead of war, the
National News Agency (NNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt, a former warlord of the Shufu mountain area and whose
Druze Muslim party scored a landslide victory in the recent
parliamentary election, said "the period of using the language of
war has ended forever" while the language of negotiation is "the
only way that works."
</P>
<P>
"We should continue in fighting for freedom, democracy and
justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Faced up with the long way ahead and giant challenge, we must
cooperate and realize that only the national dialogue among all
sectarian groups can enhance the consolidation, develop democracy
and increase freedom in our country," the Druze politician added.
</P>
<P>
The PPS, founded in 1945, champions national reconciliation and
stronger ties with Arab countries, particularly with Syria, a
powerful neighbor which positions 35,000 troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt has also repeatedly asked the government to show the
green light for the return of expelled Christian politician Michel
Aoun.
</P>
<P>
Aoun, who opposes Syria's interference and military existence in
Lebanon, was acting as prime minister of the Christian areas in
Lebanon during the late period of the 1975-1990 civil war of the
country while current premier Salim Hoss was holding the
premiership of the Muslim side.
</P>
<P>
He was overthrown in 1990 by combined Syrian and Lebanese Muslim
forces headed by Jumblatt and "banished" for five years. Since
then, he has stayed in Paris and refused to return to Lebanon for
fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt stressed several times that reconciliation is the best
way to heal the wound of the devastating civil war and forge a
broad-based government. "I will go to Paris and hold talks with
Aoun if he wants," he said.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Lebanese government will resign on October 17 and
a new one will be established at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Some Christian groups have called for permitting Aoun and other
former Christian leaders to return to the country, which had been
fettered with sectarian conflicts between various Christian and
Muslim factions.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Aoun hinted that he will think about going back
after the new government is formed if his name is on the list of
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Justice Ministry has not announced if Aoun will be
exonerated from any charge.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Help Kenya Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
disburse 30 billion shillings (about 390 million U.S. dollars) to
help Kenya fight HIV/AIDS, Deputy British High Commissioner to
Kenya Paul Harvey said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the five-year funding will be channeled through the
newly-established National AIDS Control Council.
</P>
<P>
The funding is to assist the Kenyan government to implement the
national strategy for AIDS, which is aimed at reducing the spread
of the disease through the creation of awareness at the grassroots
level by use of constituency committee countrywide, Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the funding used in a transparent and
accountable manner and not in the championing of any political
agenda by those heading the committee," he added.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is rampant in this east African country, killing about 500
Kenyans daily. Since the first AIDS case found in the country in
1984, some 1 million Kenyans have died of the killer disease.

<HEADLINE> IMFC Encourages Oil Dialogue Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary and
Financial Committee (IMFC) Sunday encouraged oil producing and
consuming countries to improve dialogue to promote greater oil
market stability.
</P>
<P>
A communique released after the second meeting of the IMFC said
the committee was concerned over the high price of oil, which
could hamper global growth, add to inflationary pressures, and
adversely affect prospects for many countries, especially the
poorest countries and those highly dependent on oil imports.
</P>
<P>
The committee noted the steps the oil producing countries had
taken this year to increase production, and called upon them to
take further steps to create conditions in oil markets conducive
to healthy global growth.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed on the desirability of stability in oil
markets around reasonable long-term prices.
</P>
<P>
It also noted the recent U.S. decision to mobilize reserves and
that some other industrial countries may be in a position to
examine the possibility of doing so to help achieve greater
stability.
</P>
<P>
On world economic outlook, the communique said global economic
growth this year quickened to the highest rate in 12 years while
inflation remained generally under control.
</P>
<P>
However, there are remaining risks associated with the
continuing economic and financial imbalances in the global economy,
such as imbalances in external accounts, the possible risk from
misalignments in exchange rate and high levels of equity
valuations in the major currency areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee noted the advances in applying the
lessons of recent financial crises to the work of the IMF and the
policies of its members. It called on the IMF, in particular, and
the international community, as a whole, to continue to strengthen
their efforts to reduce vulnerability and to avoid crises.
</P>
<P>
The committee considered that a lasting breakthrough in
combating world poverty could only be achieved if the poorest
countries are able, with the support of the international
community, to build the fundamentals for sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
To help ensure that the fruits of globalization are shared by
all, it will be crucial that access of developing countries,
particularly the poorest, to industrial country markets continues
to improve, it said.
</P>
<P>
While urging the industrial countries to increase their
official development assistance to help the poor countries to
reduce poverty, the committee encouraged developing countries to
follow policies consistent with domestic macroeconomic stability
and competitiveness in international markets.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Ruling Labor Holds Annual Party Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling
Labor Party opened its four-day annual party conference in the
southern seaside city of Brighton Sunday, aiming to using the
event to rally support to win a general election.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, Minister for the Cabinet Office Mo
Mowlam told delegates that her decision to stand down as a member
of the parliament at the next election was one of the hardest she
had ever made.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the party not to lose its nerve and be knocked
off course by attacks from the Conservatives. She said she was "
very proud" to be part of the government and would do everything
she could to secure a second term for the party.
</P>
<P>
In a bitter attack on the Conservatives, the former Northern
Ireland secretary accused them of playing the "despicable cards of
prejudice and racism" to exploit the fears of vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
She warned delegates that in the coming election the
Conservatives would "fight dirty."
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw, in his speech, promised more money
for the police. He pledged to increase police force powers and
resources, and have a great say for victims of crime and a new
focus on bringing more persistent offenders to justice.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson told a
fringe meeting at the Labor Party conference that the Danish euro
vote, scheduled on Thursday, will have no effect on London's
eventual decision whether to adopt the currency.
</P>
<P>
"The British decision will be based on British national
interests, not Danish," Mandelson said. "We will go into the next
election with exactly the same position as we have now." Britain's
official position is that it will wait until a set of key economic
criteria are met before putting the question of joining the euro
zone to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party has been facing great challenges since it took
office in May 1997. The latest opinion poll showed Labor up to
eight points behind the opposition Conservatives for the first
time since the 1997 landslide victory. Political observers said
Blair might hold an early general election in the first half of
next year.
