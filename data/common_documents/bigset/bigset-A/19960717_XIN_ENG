<P>
BANGKOK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand today urged Hong
Kong-based Hopewell Co. to speed up the construction of the
elevated electric train project in downtown Bangkok to help ease
the traffic jam in the city, said a press release from the
government house.
</P>
<P>
The weekly cabinet meeting today asked the Ministry of
Transport and Communications and the State Railway of Thailand to
monitor the project and press Hopewell to accelerate its pace to
meet the planned deadlines, as the city is preparing for the 13th
Asian Games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the two government agencies were
asked to submit progress reports to the cabinet within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier local newspaper reports, only about 10
percent of the project was completed between 1991 and 1994 because
of insufficient funding.
</P>
<P>
The reports had said that the project might be scraped by the
cabinet as its sluggish progress was blamed as one of the causes
responsible for the traffic congestion in Bangkok.

HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's largest banks
on Tuesday said South Africa will provide the engine for economic
growth in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Chartered Bank said in a review released here
that South Africa, which accounts for 78 percent of the region's
Gross National Product, had the capacity to become the engine for
growth.
</P>
<P>
''Given reasonable rains... and relative commodity price
stability, the region should achieve annual growth of at least
five percent, implying a two percent improvement in real living
standards each year,'' the bank said.
</P>
<P>
But, it warned, the expected growth was not enough to solve
the chronic unemployment, nor guarantee political and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
It said South Africa's economic success, after years of
stagnation and political isolation due to apartheid policies,
would determine the future of other weaker countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said, failure by the S. African government
to solve current political problems and address social imbalances
in that country could deter foreign investment in the republic
and the whole region.
</P>
<P>
''A weak, politically unstable South Africa racked by high
levels of criminal violence and militant trade unions, would
deter international foreign investment into the whole region,''
said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the region should follow the example of east
Asian countries, by completely liberalising the economies, and
promoting export-led growth, fuelled by high levels of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The region should also avoid the strategy of aid and
debt-driven development, the bank said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nearly 4,100 Affected in Food Poisoning in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of school children
affected by an outbreak of food poisoning in a western Japanese
city has increased to nearly 4,100. They come from 53 elementary
schools.
</P>
<P>
The local press said about 200 school children were still
hospitalized in the mass poisoning which broke out on Friday in
Sakai, the second largest city in Osaka Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Education authorities in the city today called an emergency
meeting of school principals to discuss measures for preventing
the bacteria responsible from spreading further.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government today set up a special council of
senior officials of the ministries and agencies concerned to
determine the cause and trace the spread of the poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto discussed the problem with
Education Minister Mikio Okuda and officials of the Health and
Welfare Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The food poisoning in Sakai, believed to be caused by the
virulent O-157 colon bacillus which contaminated school lunches,
has affected the largest number of children since the bacillus
triggered an outbreak among schoolchildren across Japan in late
May.
</P>
<P>
Four children were killed in earlier outbreaks in other parts
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Sakai health authorities began sterilizing schools on Monday, a
task that would take at least three days, the reports said. All
the elementary schools were to remain closed until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 0-157 bacterium is also held responsible for a spate of
recent food-poisoning incidents around Japan which left four
people dead.

<HEADLINE> Bern Pleased by EU's Willingness to Speed up Bilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Swiss officials are optimistic over
the European Union's (UE) foreign ministers' decision to push
forward the slow-moving negotiations to establish new economic
ties between the two parties.Union
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers said Monday in Brussels that progress had
been made in the bilateral talks .They urged the European
Commission to keep up the pace of the talks and reach an agreement
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Kellenberger, a Swiss state secretary, told the local
press on Tuesday the EU had sent a clear signal that it had the
will to speed up the talks.
</P>
<P>
But he predicted that negotiations could be more difficult in
the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Switzerland began to establish new economic ties
after the Swiss voted in December 1992 not to join the European
Economic Area (EEA), under which some non-EU countries gain access
to the benefits of the EU single market.
</P>
<P>
Both Switzerland and the EU consider it necessary to find a new
form of bilateral relations since about 60 percent of Swiss
exports go to the EU, and Switzerland is also the EU's second most
important export market.
</P>
<P>
The EU, unhappy with the result of the Swiss referendum, has
tried to bargain with Switzerland, asking it to offer concessions
on some sensitive issues in return for upgraded access to the
single market.
</P>
<P>
Although some concessions had been made from both sides, no
breakthrough had been achieved so far, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government fears that as well as continued limited
access if no agreement is reached, a nationalist sentiment would
be aroused in the country, which would make the already awkward
relationship with the EU more difficult to manage.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Army to Resolutely Carry Out Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac has
again called on the country's military to "resolutely" carry out
the reform of France's national defense system.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in his traditional message addressed to the
armed forces on July 14, which was made public today by the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Chirac also listed "the principal axes" of the
defense policy of France, which are "the adaptation of our nuclear
posture, affirmation of its European identity within a renewed
Atlantic Alliance, and a resolute engagement against the
proliferation of arms of massive destruction and for an increased
control of armaments."
</P>
<P>
"This global reform of our defense system accompanies and
completes the redefinition of our strategic choices that the new
international context has imposed. The end of the Cold War, the
European construction and the evolution of armaments as well as
the forms of conflict have profoundly changed the security needs
of our country," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He called on the French armed forces to maintain the best
capacity for carrying out operations, and the arms industries to
improve their productivity.
</P>
<P>
"I will see to it that you will have the means to fulfill your
new missions and successfully carry out these necessary
transformations on which the future security of our country
depends," said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Papua New Guinea to Take Part in Three Sports at Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea, an island
country in the Pacific, will take part in three sports at the
Centennial Olympic Games scheduled to open here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen athletes in the 32-member Papua New Guinean delegation
who were registered at the Olympic Village today, will compete in
athletics, boxing and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
"We have four boxers for the games," said Steven Kevi, who will
take part in the 63.5-kg category in the rings. Kevi, one of the
two athletes from the island nation to the Barcelona Olympic
Games, was stopped in the first round four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I would go into the second round this time," said Kevi.
</P>
<P>
The other Papua New Guinean athlete who had the Olympic
experience is Henry Kunsi, who managed to reach the quarter-finals
of the 60-kg category in the boxing tournament in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
The Papua New Guineans will have no problem to face the steamy
heat in Atlanta since they are used to living in tropical
conditions. "Hot weather is not a problem for us," said Kevi.
</P>
<P>
According to Caroline Rittenberry, press staff at the Olympic
Village, a total of 3,967 athletes from 97 countries and regions
have registered in the village.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Resolution by EU Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
welcomed a resolution by the European Union (EU) foreign
ministers, calling on members of the EU Trade and Investment Plan
for the Mediterranean (Meda) to respect democracy and promote good
neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told his daily press
briefing that with the resolution, the 15 EU member states
expressed solidarity toward Greece.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU countries also expressed support that
differences, such as the one over the sovereignty of the islet of
Imia, should be solved by the International Court in the
Hague. They also reiterated their support for respecting
international law and conventions.
</P>
<P>
Describing the EU countries' position as positive, Cassoulides
added that since Greece took what it believes as satisfactory,
it went ahead and lifted its veto of the EU Trade and
Investment Plan for the Mediterranean, or Meda.
</P>
<P>
Greece had blocked for months the Meda program due to a
dispute with Turkey over the sovereignty of islets in the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government has set out various preconditions which
we believe were satisfied and we support the handling and
actions of the Greek government in promoting its national issues
as best as it believes," Cassoulides added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that during Monday's debate at the EU
foreign ministers' meeting, the appointment of Irish diplomat
Kester Heaslip as Ireland's special representative on the Cyprus
issue was not discussed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990. The EU has
decided to start membership talks with Cyprus six months after
the end of the ongoing EU Inter-governmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has hoped for more EU involvement in efforts to solve
the protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to be A Leader in Second Echelon in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China will try to remain as a
leader in the second echelon in the Olympic Games, top Chinese
sports official said on his arrival on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese athletes will try to finish as in front as
possible in the second echelon of the gold medal standings," said
Wu Shaozu, China's sports minister and Chef de Mission of the
Chinese delegation, who led 249 officials and athletes to Atlanta
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The sports minister came short of saying that China aims to
repeat the fourth-place finishing in the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
China collected 16 gold medals in the 1992 Olympics to finish
just after the Unified Team led by Russia, the United States and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The United States is expected to cash in on its home-turf
advantage to top the gold medal standings this time, with Russia
and Germany vying for the second place.
</P>
<P>
Among the new arrivals are reigning world table tennis women's
singles champion Deng Yaping, world badminton women's singles
champion Ye Zhaoying, and four-time Olympian basketballer Zheng
Haixia who at 2.04 meters is the tallest woman competitor of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the 495-strong Chinese delegation including
the gymnastics, swimming, weightlifting, diving, men's basketball
and women's handball teams are already in the USA for pre-Olympic
training or competitions.

<HEADLINE> Eight Turkish Deputies Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Eight deputies from the True Path
Party (DYP) resigned here today as in the recent vote of
confidence they voted against the coalition government between the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and the DYP.
</P>
<P>
The resignation reduced the number of the DYP deputies in the
parliament to 120, fewer than those of the RP the Motherland Party
(ANAP).
</P>
<P>
The resignations have created a headache for DYP Chairwoman
Tansu Ciller as she appears for an otherwise unproblematic party
congress scheduled to be held on July 21.
</P>
<P>
They have summited their resignations to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The eight resigned DYP deputies are former Speaker Ismet
Sezgin, former Foreign Minister Emre Gonensay, former State
Minister Cavit Caglar, Koksal Toptan, Mehmet Batalli, Mehmet
Kostepen, Rifat Serdaroglu and Refaiddin Sahin.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who in the past had taken an uncompromising stance
against the dissidents, went out of her way this time in not
taking any move to have the eight deputies expelled, even though
their action in voting against the coalition was an expellable
offence.
</P>
<P>
The dissidents expect more resignations from the DYP in the
wake of the party congress.

<HEADLINE> Nauru: Any Medal Would Be Too Much </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlanta, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the first ever Nauruan
team to an Olympic Games said here today that their goal at the
Atlanta Games is not medals, but participation itself.
</P>
<P>
"Any medal would be too much for us," said Reuben Kun, leader
of the three-athlete Nauruan team. "Participation itself is
important enough."
</P>
<P>
Nauru has sent three weightlifters, the first athletes
representing the island nation, to compete at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
"We are here mainly to show our national flag," Kun said. "We
are happy to be a member of the international Olympic family."
</P>
<P>
Nauru began to participate in international sports competitions
in 1990. That year, it sent a weightlifter to the Commonwealth
Games held in New Zealand. The weightlifter, Marcus Stephen,
brought back one gold and two silver medals to the Pacific island
with an area of only 21 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"We had the best medal hold ratio at the games," said Kun, also
finance minister of the tiny island nation. "One athlete, three
medals. That could be a world record."
</P>
<P>
But Kun said his athletes are not ready to capture medals at
the Atlanta Games. "We only has 10,000 people. It's like a
village in China," he said. "We can not compete with large nations
for medals."
</P>
<P>
Participation in the Olympics would encourage the young people
on the island to get more involved in sports, Kun said. "Sports
is something good for our young people. It will help them stay
healthy and build character."
</P>
<P>
He said Nauru would send a much larger team to the next Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our team to the next games would include a full 10-member
weightlifting team and athletes competing in other sports, such as
badminton, judo and wrestling, depending on what and how many
sports we can qualify," Kun said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Pick up in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- United States consumer prices
inched up 0.1 percent in June, the best showing on inflation since
November, the U.S. Labor Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the small increase of the consumer prices index
(CPI) resulted from a steep drop in energy prices which offset the
biggest increase of food prices in three years.
</P>
<P>
Food prices were up by 1 percent in June, the biggest increase
since May 1993. This reflected price increases of 4.2 percent for
pork, 4.6 percent for fruit and 1 percent for vegetables.
</P>
<P>
But these increases were erased by a 2.2 percent decline in
energy prices in June, the biggest drop in five years. This
decline was led by a 5.2 percent plunge in the cost of home
heating oil and a 3.2 percent drop in gasoline pump prices which
had surged by 18.2 percent from November to last May.
</P>
<P>
The 0.1 percent June increase in the CPI followed worrisome
increases of 0.4 percent in March and April and a 0.3 percent May
advance.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 3.5 percent, a full percentage point higher than the 2.5
percent increase during the whole of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, the
so-called core rate of inflation was up by 0.2 percent. The rate
had been increasing at an annual rate of just 2.8 percent in the
first half of this year, even better than the 3 percent advance
for all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Various U.S. economists have argued that the pickup in
inflation this year was the result of a temporary jump in energy
and food costs.
</P>
<P>
But some economists contend that the U.S. economy at present is
overheating and believe the U.S. Federal Reserve will start
increasing interest rates at its next meeting on August 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The world sports governing body --
International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- will continue to promote
women's participation in sports, a high-ranking IOC official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference four days before the opening
ceremony of the 26th Olympic Games Friday, IOC Director-General
Francois Garrard said women's participation in sports is a global
problems. He said some countries constitutionally prohibited women
from participating in sports.
</P>
<P>
As in the Ancient Olympic Games, women were not allowed to
compete in the first Modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. They
competed in the Olympics only in 1900 in Paris when 19 women took
part in four sports.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Olympic Program for Women has gradurally
increased. At the forthcoming 26th Olympic Games, over 3,700
sportswomen -- by far the largest female showing -- will compete
in 21 sports.
</P>
<P>
Garrard said Canada entered more women athletes than men in the
Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, 20 percent more women will compete
in the Centennial Games than ever before in history.
</P>
<P>
The new disciplines added to the Atlanta Olympic Program
include women's soccer, softball, mountain bike in cycling and
beach volleyball and the events of 5,000 meters and triple jump in
athletics, points race in track cycling, individual and team epee
in fencing, lightweight double sculls in rowing, doubles trap in
shooting and 4 by 200 meters freestyle relay in swimming.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Promises Tit-for-Tat Diplomacy With South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, angry to see the
difficulties Nigerians meet in getting visas from South Africa,
has vowed to apply the principled reciprocity in its diplomatic
dealings with that country, the Punch newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government would not bow to any country nor ''treat
nationals from other countries better than the way they treat
our own people,'' the newspaper said, quoting Nigerian Ambassador
to South Africa Alhaji Shehu Malami.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who arrived in South Africa two weeks ago, told about
100 Nigerian professionals in Johannesburg during a meeting
yesterday that he had applied for visa for one of his staff
that had not been granted.
</P>
<P>
''We will treat South Africans the same way they treat us. They
have been extremely difficult in dealing with Nigerians, especially
in the area of issuing visas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the situation where South African High
Commission in Nigeria requested for police report before issuing
visas to Nigerians, irrespective of their social status, was
''simply ridiculous''.
</P>
<P>
They are not criminals and do not deserve such treatment, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The envoy was reacting to complaints by some Nigerian
consultants that some of their business partners are being
hounded by security officials in the airport in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
''It is a matter of reciprocity,'' he said.  enditem

<HEADLINE> New Mongolian Parliament to Convene This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat has issued a decree that the new parliament
will hold its first session on Thursday, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Ardyn Erh (People's Power) said that top on the
agenda of the three-day parliamentary session will be its
structure. Establishing a new cabinet and approving its platform
will be the main task of the new parliament, known in the country
as the Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament, formed after the June 30 general elections,
will have six committees in charge of economy, society, political
organization, jurisdiction, pasture industry and regional
development and finance, according to the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet will be formed with 10 ministries, three less
than the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's opposition Democratic Union Coalition won 50 seats
whereas the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party lost its
70-seat majority to get just 25 in the elections.
</P>
<P>
A small independent party wrapped up the remaining seats in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections were the second for the Great Hural
after a constitution was adopted in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Britain Needs More Transport Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Britain's transport
infrastructure needs to rise to over 11 billion pounds (16.5
billion U.S. dollars) a year over the next 10 years, Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) repored today.
</P>
<P>
The report was discussed today at a CBI conference on
transport. It says the extra investment will help reduce the
economic and environmental costs of congestion, create jobs,
attract inward investment and stimulate regeneration.
</P>
<P>
The CBI needed ll.25 billion pounds (16.875 billion dollars)
each year. The annual average was only 8.75 billion pounds (13.125
billion dollars) in the past decade. Nearly half the proposed
investment would be devoted to maintenance and renewal of
existing road and rail networks.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, Director-General of the CBI, said a decent
transport network is vital to the life of all people as well as to
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Better planning, more efficient use of the existing network,
fiscal reform and a greater emphasis on investment in public
transport are all key elements of an effective transport strategy.
</P>
<P>
But the director warned that transport service and business
competitiveness will not be improved and the environment not
effectively protected without increased investment.
</P>
<P>
The report says that investment in all transport modes needs to
be increased. Strategic and local roads would still account for
most of the investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Private financing would account for one third of future
investment, with the public sector remaining the main source of
most investment in transport infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Infected Cattle Not Allowed to Enter S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Department of
Agriculture has all the necessary measures to prevent cattle
suffering from lung disease from entering the country, the
department's Animal Health Director Louis Kritzinger said today.
</P>
<P>
Kritzinger made the remarks in Pretoaia in a response to
reports that more than 250,000 head of cattle may have to be
slaughtered in Botswana to prevent contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia from spreading.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the disease was reportedly
widespread in the north-western parts of Botswana and more than
180,000 head of cattle had already been killed.
</P>
<P>
South Africa eradicated the disease by 1910, said department
sources.
</P>
<P>
There was no cure for the disease and it was too late to
inoculate the animals, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the disease did not pose any threat to other animals
and beef from infected animals was safe for human consumption, he
added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Mossad Head Warns of New Hezbollah Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military intelligence
(Mossad) head Moshe Ayalon warned today that the Iran-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, was returning to villages in south
Lebanon in an attempt to renew rocket attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon briefed the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee on the situation in south Lebanon, Iran's
support of terrorism and Israel's ties with Syria, Egypt and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
He accused Hezbollah of violating a cease-fire agreement by
having set up commands and stored up ammunitions inside homes in
south Lebanon, in an apparent attempt to use the civilian cover for
its attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the ceasefire agreement reached in April after Israel's
military Operation Grapes of Wrath in south Lebanon, Israel and
Lebanon agreed not to use civilian cover for attacks or strike the
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon pointed out that the increasing Hezbollah attacks in
the past two weeks were tied to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Metanyahu's visit to the U.S. and "a way for the Syrians to make
diplomatic statements."
</P>
<P>
The intelligence head warned that the recent operations by
Hezbollah in south Lebanon showed that they were likely to renew
Katyusha rocket attacks against northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ayalon blasted Iran for supporting Hezbollah by
providing tens of millions of U.S. dollars, as well as arms and
military training.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed European countries for refusing to cooperate in
implementing the trade embargo against Tehran imposed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Egyptian ties, Ayalon said Cairo officially was
leaving an opening for Netanyahu's to make provocations, although
the media was strongly against his policies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Jordanian media was equally critical of
Netanyahu, while the opposition was using the opportunity to
increase attacks against King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Syria, Ayalon denied that the previous Israeli
government led by the Labor Party had any secret agreement with
Damascus on withdrawal from the Golan Heights, "otherwise (Syrian)
President al-Assad would have moved forward the peace talks with
Israel."
</P>
<P>
On the PNA's reaction to Netanyahu's new policies, Ayalon said
that the Palestinians were disappointed with Netanyahu's tough
rhetoric, but were waiting to see the results of his forthcoming
visits to Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence head also warned against the possibility of
resurgence of the intifada, or Arab uprising against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is visiting Egypt Thursday to hold his first
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss the
peace process and bilateral ties. He is also expected to visit
Jordan soon.
</P>
<P>
The hardline Israeli leader has pledged to resume peace talks
with all Arab neighbors without preconditions. He did not mention
the land-for-peace principle, on which the peace process has been
based, and ruled out any compromise on the critical issues, such
as the status of Jerusalem, establishment of an independent
Palestinian state and return of Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
He also conditioned the progress of the peace process on
Arab's efforts to fight terrorism, a move widely criticized by
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the U.S. last week, Netanyahu even
toughened his line on peace talks by creating the so-called three
pillars of his policies: security, reciprocity and democratization
of Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Capital Grows Steadily in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment grew slowly but
steadily in Croatia during 1992 to 1994 despite an unfavorable
climate, with over 2,100 new foreign investment enterprises (FIEs)
being registered per year.
</P>
<P>
At the start of 1995, FIEs in the country totaled 6,840, and
the value of committed FI stock had reached 933 million U.S.
dollars by the end of 1994, the United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe (UN/ECE) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The European Union represented 59 percent of committed capital
from abroad in Croatia, while Western Europe as a whole had a 66
percent share.
</P>
<P>
During 1992 to 1994, Germany topped the list of major investor
countries, accounting for nearly 36 percent of the total FI stock.
It was followed by Austria, 14 percent, and Switzerland and Italy,
each with 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The successor states of the former Yugoslavia together
represented 5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the number of FIEs, the top five investors
accounted for about 79 percent of the total number of
registrations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. companies accounted for about 4 percent of committed
foreign investment in Croatia, and 3 percent of the total number
of FIE registrations. Other countries, including developing and
transition economies (excluding ex-Yugoslav republics),
represented 22 percent of FI stock and 13 percent of FIEs.
</P>
<P>
In its summer issue of East-West Investment News, the UN/ECE
also reported continued growth in recent months in foreign direct
investment (FDI) stock in Eastern Europe despite political and
economic uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
In the Russian Federation, for example, this stock increased by
14.5 percent between October 1, 1995 and January 1, 1996,
indicating a growth of 71 percent per annum compared with a 51
percent increase in 1995 and a 50 percent increase in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The latest data for Ukraine also showed a 52 percent increase
between october 1, 1995 and April 1, 1996, said the UN/ECE.
</P>
<P>
The commission reported that Hungary so far remained the
country that received the most FDI in the region. It was followed
by the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's southwestern Sichuan
Province today opened a five-day trade fair in Nairobi, Kenya, to
boost bilateral trade with the East African country.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of commodities including electronics, machinery,

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Reserves Right to Challenge US Over Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said today it
would reserve the right to pursue a complaint at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) against the U.S. punitive tariffs on European
food and drink exports imposed in retaliation for a EU ban on
hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision was announced after the surprise U.S.
announcement Monday that it had lifted the punitive tariffs
imposed in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The EU Monday requested a 24-hour suspension of a meeting of
the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) hearing its complaint,
while it sought official confirmation of the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
At a reconvened DSB meeting this afternoon, EU trade diplomats
said that although it was confirmed the U.S. sanctions had been
terminated, the EU would like to reserve the right to "reconvene
the DSB meeting."
</P>
<P>
Experts here said earlier that the EU might pursue the case to
try to obtain compensation for lost exports.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Washington, the WTO agreed in May to set up a
independent panel to investigate a U.S. complaint that the EU
hormone ban violated WTO rules. The EU counteracted by lodging a
complaint against the U.S. itself, arguing that it is illegal for
the U.S. to retaliate by doubling tariffs on European food and
drink exports worth about 100 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision to remove sanctions on European exports was
seen as a tactical move intended to strengthen its attempt to have
the EU hormone ban declared illegal by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether farmers should be allowed to use hormone to
improve the growth rates of animals and reduce the fat content of
meat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. argues that the EU ban, introduced in 1988, violates
the WTO rules because it is not backed by scientific evidence. The
EU, however, insists on the ban, saying it is essential to
maintain consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The WTO panel set up in May is supposed to report its findings
on the dispute in November.

<HEADLINE> South Africa's Opposition NP Denies Party Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
National Party (NP) today denied President Nelson Mandela's claim
that a split was looming with a new party under construction by
former NP cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to business leaders in Paris during his four-day
visit to France, Mandela said earlier that NP's former foreign
minister and energy minister, Pik Botha, was to set up a new
political party.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said NP leader F. W. de Klerk had been forced to pull
out of the South African government because his party's cabinet
members were increasingly showing support for the ideas of the
African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Botha was one of the two senior NP members who had resigned
from the party after its withdrawal from the government.
</P>
<P>
The NP withdrew from the government on June 30 to become an
official opposition party, saying that South Africa's newly
adopted constitution did not provide a power-sharing mechanism in
the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, NP spokesman Patrick Mckenzie said in the South
African capital of Pretoria that there was no evidence that Botha
did not act in line with the NP party policy.
</P>
<P>
Mckenzie said the party's decision to withdraw from the
government was unanimous and suggestions to the contrary were
"mischievous".

JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle is to undergo a medical operation at a South African
hospital on Wednesday, a Lesotho official said today.
</P>
<P>
Tom Thabane, special advisor to the 78-year-old prime
minister, said in Lesotho's capital of Maseru that the operation,
to be undergone at Bloemfontein Hydromed Hospital in
Johannesburg, is a "routine medical procedure".
</P>

assess the performance of the prime minister's recently inserted
pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday the official said Mokhehle was admitted to
hospital on July 6 after being affected by flu.
</P>
<P>
There had also been speculation that the prime minister was
suffering from cardiac problems.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was admitted to the same hospital last year
for heart problems.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Makes Late Olympic Bid, IOC Hesitant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) - East Africa's tiny nation of
Eritrea has made a last-minute appeal to join the rest of the
world at the Atlanta Olympic Games to be started on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Eritrea,
the only United Nations member outside the Olympic movement, did
not fulfill IOC's entry requirements.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea became the 182nd U.N. member in 1993 after gaining
independence from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Eritrea's exclusion leaves Atlanta short of
its desire for being the first host to welcome the entire world
to the games. All 197 IOC members accepted the invitation to
come.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 30 years Eritrea was at war and it did not have
time to take part in sport. It is very important for them to take
part in the Olympics," said a supporter of Eritrea's bid.

<HEADLINE> US Bank Finances Diamond Mining Equipment Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
today approved financing in support of a 60 million dollar sale of
equipment for mining diamonds in Russia's Eastern Siberia region.
</P>
<P>
The bank will provide a 54.4 million dollar loan guarantee to
back the export of mining equipment by Caterpillar and some other
U.S. companies to Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS), located in Eastern
Siberia and the largest producer of diamonds in Russia. The ARS
will use the equipment to help modernize and increase production
in its diamond mines.
</P>
<P>
This is the first transaction approved under the bank's General
Project Incentive Agreement with the Ministry of Finance and the
Central Bank of Russia signed in December 1993. The agreement
supports transactions where repayment is based on the revenues
generated from the production of the borrower instead of a
sovereign guarantee of repayment.
</P>
<P>
Russia is one of the largest diamond producing countries, which
accounts at least 20 percent of the world's total output. The
Export-Import Bank is a government agency of the United States
that finances and promotes the sale of U.S. goods and services
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Syria Criticizes Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Syria has criticized the Israeli
policy of constructing new settlements and expanding the old ones
in the occupied territories, saying that this policy is
"tantamount to a declaration of war against the peace process."
</P>
<P>
In its political commentary today, Radio Damascus said the aim
of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to
intensify Jewish settlement in the occupied territories is to
change the landmarks of the occupied Arab lands as well as
their Arab demographic structure, with the object of driving the
Arab inhabitants away and Judaizing their homes.
</P>
<P>
The radio called upon the U.S., co-sponsor of the peace
process, to shoulder its responsibility particularly in preventing
the collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is not sufficient that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
Administration expresses its firm stance and commitment to the
principles of the peace process, Radio Damascus said, adding that
it should follow the example of former President George Bush'
Administration and openly condemn the new Israeli government's
settlement policy on the grounds that expanding settlement in the
occupied territories is contradictory to peace.
</P>
<P>
The verification of Israel's sincere adherence to peace lies in
its commitment to the principles of the peace process rather than
beating around the bush in an attempt to walk out from it, the
radio said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Enjoys Juicy Marketing Programs for Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- While many records are to be set
for the centennial Olympic Games, the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) is proud of its revenue-generating marketing
programs.
</P>
<P>
Michael Payne, IOC marketing director, said here on Tuesday
that "revenues for the 1993-1996 quadrennium are likely to exceed
three billion US dollars to be distributed to the Games Organizing
Committees, the National Olympic Committees and International
Sports Federations."
</P>
<P>
"It's probable that athletes and coaches will be free-charged
when they attend the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney," said Payne, a
former two-time British professional ski champion in 1978 and
1979.
</P>
<P>
As for the budget of 1.7 billion US dollars for the Atlanta
Games, worldwide television rights and 445 sponsors contributed
nearly each half with the US TV rights generating some 900 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming centennial games will be televised free of
advertising during the competitions and at the medal-awarding
ceremonies whereas it is the worldwide sponsors that make the
Games possible, the director said.
</P>
<P>
However, three advertising of McDonald, Coca Cola and John
Hancock in Life Insurance, each in about 60 seconds, will be aired
at the opening ceremony on July 19.
</P>
<P>
"IOC has and will decline high offers for Games TV rights
because the broadcaster can only reach a limited part of the
population," Payne explained.
</P>
<P>
During the inpending 17 competition days, over four billion
people, nearly two thirds of the whole population in the world,
will witness the excellent performance of athletes in Atlanta, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Olympic Games covered 195 countries and
regions, while the Atlanta Games will be viewed in 45 more
countries and regions for an estimated average of 25 hours per
viewer.
</P>
<P>
Most TV stations will enlarge their coverage, with BBC from 220
to 300 hours, Japan from 380 to 970 hours, and South Africa more
than double their televising timing compared to the Barcelona
Games, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract more people towards the Olympic movement,
most African countries will be free of charge for their TV
coverage of the Games, and the IOC will further finance them in
Olympic programs and training projects, the director added.

<HEADLINE> Georgia in Olympics for First Time as Independent Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Georgia is appearing in the
upcoming 26th Olympic Games here as an independent team for the
first time, hoping to win gold medals in judo and shooting events.
</P>
<P>
"It's great to take part in the Olympic Games as an independent
country," said Press Attache of the Georgian Sports Delegation
Merab Ratishvili here today."I never thought that I could take
part in the Olympics as a Georgian."
</P>
<P>
Although Georgia became independent in 1991, it joined a
unified team led by the Russian Federation at the previous
Olympics in Barcelona four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six athletes from Georgia are in Atlanta to compete in
in 13 sports including judo, wrestling, shooting, boxing and
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
According to Ratishvili, the Georgian government offers big
prizes for medal winners, with 50,000 U.S. dollars to the gold
medalist, 30,000 dollars to the silver medalist and 20,000 dollars
to the bronze medalist.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say it is a huge sum of money," said Ratishvili, who
earns 300 dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
He singled out judoist Khakhaleishvili Davit as having the
biggest chance to win the first prize in the Georgian delegation.
Davit, who will compete in the over 95kg category, won the gold
medal in the event in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
"I think he may take one gold, but anything may happen at
competition," said Ratishvili.
</P>
<P>
Another gold medal hopeful is 22-year-old Vazagashvili Giorgi,
who won the 60kg category event at the World Judo Championships in
Chiba, Japan, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Women sharpshooter Salukvadze Nino may pose a threat to her
rivals, he said. When representing the former Soviet Union at the Seoul
Ol;ympic Games in 1988, she claimed the 10m air pistol crown.

<HEADLINE> EU Reserves Right to Challenge US Over Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said today it
would reserve the right to pursue a complaint at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) against the U.S. punitive tariffs on European
food and drink exports imposed in retaliation for a EU ban on
hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision was announced after the surprise U.S.
announcement Monday that it had lifted the punitive tariffs
imposed in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The EU Monday requested a 24-hour suspension of a meeting of
the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) hearing its complaint,
while it sought official confirmation of the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
At a reconvened DSB meeting this afternoon, EU trade diplomats
said that although it was confirmed the U.S. sanctions had been
terminated, the EU would like to reserve the right to "reconvene
the DSB meeting."
</P>
<P>
Experts here said earlier that the EU might pursue the case to
try to obtain compensation for lost exports.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Washington, the WTO agreed in May to set up a
independent panel to investigate a U.S. complaint that the EU
hormone ban violated WTO rules. The EU counteracted by lodging a
complaint against the U.S. itself, arguing that it is illegal for
the U.S. to retaliate by doubling tariffs on European food and
drink exports worth about 100 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision to remove sanctions on European exports was
seen as a tactical move intended to strengthen its attempt to have
the EU hormone ban declared illegal by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether farmers should be allowed to use hormone to
improve the growth rates of animals and reduce the fat content of
meat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. argues that the EU ban, introduced in 1988, violates
the WTO rules because it is not backed by scientific evidence. The
EU, however, insists on the ban, saying it is essential to
maintain consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The WTO panel set up in May is supposed to report its findings
on the dispute in November.

The Mexican delegation, which includs 104 athletes, are

Guillermo Munoz, a Mexican paddler who will make his Olympic

"The Chinese male players are also superb and they are

<HEADLINE> Global Gap Between Rich and Poor Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The global income gap
between the rich and poor has widened and the world has become
more economically polarized, both between countries and within
countries, according to an official of the United Nations
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement for the release of the Human Development Report,
UNDP Associate Administrator Rafeeuddin Ahmed said that over 100
countries with a combined population of 1.5 billion experienced a
total failure of growth during the 1980-95 period.
</P>
<P>
Most of the countries showed a slow or more rapid phase of
growth in the 1960s and much of the 1970s, followed by a severe
decline beginning around 1980, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 of these countries have achieved modest recovery in the
late 1980s or early 1990s, but some 60 countries are still in
decline or at the bottom of a trough. These countries are largely
in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
For three-quarters of humanity, however, economic growth did
take place -- sometimes at a spectacular pace, as in China and
East Asian industrializing tigers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But this growth was often unevenly distributed, within nations
and between nations, so that the world became far more polarized
and the gap between the rich and poor increased further," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The income disparity between the richest 20 percent and the
poorest 20 percent of the world's people doubled from 30:1 to 61:1
over the last three decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1965-80 and 1980-93, the number of people in countries
with negative growth had a five-hold increase from 200 million to
almost 1 billion, he said.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Tours Kenya's Largest Port Of Mombasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
today underscored the importance of Kenya's Port of Mombasa for
his country during his tour of the port city.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan leader is on his second day of the Kenya tour which
was boosted by his recent electoral success and aimed at
enhancing economic ties among Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said the volume of the cargo should be increased to
full capacity to fully explore the potential of the port, noting
that the Kenyan port is currently handling 1.1 million tonnes of
Ugandan transit cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president also lauded the move by the Kenyan
government to commercialise the port, saying it would improve its
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a half of the foreign cargos handled in Mombasa
belonged to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also toured Kenya's pipeline installations in
Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Transport and Communication Wilson Ndolo
Ayah said feasibility studies were at an advanced stage to have
the pipeline extended to Uganda from Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
And a jetty will be built at Kisumu to ease transportation of
oil products on Lake Victoria to parts of Uganda and Tanzania,
said the minister, adding that oil companies had raised 85
million U.S. Dollars to improve the oil refineries in Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
This effort made by the Kenyan government was praised by the
Ugandan president.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay in Kenya, Museveni is expected to
hold talks with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to speed up the
East African Cooperation Accord signed last March.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say the Ugandan leader wants Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania to harmonise their tax regimes as a matter of priority
to discourage smuggling and to counter competition brought forth
by cheaper goods from beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
Eager to attract foreign investors and boost the regional
economy, he also wants joint strategies on investment policies,
banking and currency rules.
</P>
<P>
Further down the agenda of the summit talks will be regional
trouble spots such as the central African states of Burundi and
Rwanda on which both Uganda and Kenya could exert their
influences.

delegation to the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta, it was
announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian sports officials, Nigerian athletes

4X200 relay and according to the Nigerian athletics officials
they are even capable of taking the titles of the two events.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian boxers took two silver medals at the 1992 Barcelona

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coalition Partners Pledge Free Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The rift between Turkey's
coalition partners of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and the
center-right True Path Party (DYP) was eliminated here today
after three days of fluctuations in the country's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and his coalition partner
deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller met to discuss the issue and
worked out a new agreement on the coalition's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to let the free market function without
intervention. They also agreed that to create new resources some
land belonging to the Treasury Undersecretariat should be sold
immediately, along with certain civil servants' lodgings.
</P>
<P>
An "economic coordination meeting" was held today after
Finance Minister Abdullatif Sener announced that a ceiling could
be imposed on interest rates. Sener's statement has caused havoc
in the financial markets in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ciller and Erbakan decided that the DYP
should play a more effective role in regard to economic policy.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ciller declared that there would be "no
intervention in the rules of free market economy."
</P>
<P>
She told the meeting of the DYP deputies in the
parliament: "There will be no intervention at all either in the
prices or interest rates or exchange rates."

<HEADLINE> Minister: Egypt Drawing up Privatization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Public Sector Minister Atef
Obeid said today that a privatization plan for 1996, 1997 and 1998
is being drawn up.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conditions of some state-run companies which
have been run at a loss could be rectified through privatization.
</P>
<P>
Such companies should improve management, rationalize
expenditure and sell inventory through better marketing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is in charge of the country's privatization
program, added that the government could not continue to support
the companies which make little profit or suffer losses.
</P>
<P>
"Buyers have to be found for such companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been determined to quicken the pace of privatizing
state-owned enterprises since Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri
took office and formed a new cabinet in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Privatization is part of the second stage of Egypt's economic
reform program, which kicked off in 1991. The second stage started
in the second half of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The state-run enterprises which suffer great losses have been a
heavy burden on the country's faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
But privatization is still facing opposition, especially from
trade unions which fear that many workers may lose their jobs
after the enterprises where they work are privatized.

<HEADLINE> US Official Discusses Cyprus Issue With Greek Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Madeleine Albright declared here today that the
purpose of her two-day visit to Athens was to explore the
possibilities for attaining an overall and lasting settlement of
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official was speaking to reporters after talks with
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
She said President Bill Clinton was convinced there was an
opportunity for a settlement following recent talks in Washington
with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Cyprus President
Glafkos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic goal of the U.S., Albright said, was to help the
parties "seize this opportunity as long as it exists."
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the time had come for practical solutions
and a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem "for the
sake of the people who live there and to prevent the outbreak of a
wider war."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the joint defense doctrine between Greece and
Cyprus, Albright said she understood the interest of the Greek
government in security in the region of Cyprus, but she expressed
concern about the excessive concentration of military forces.
</P>
<P>
On Greek-Turkish relations, Albright said Washington's position
was that disputes in the Aegean should be referred to the
international court at the Hague or some other arbitration body or
third party for settlement.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she had been encouraged by the recent
Greek-Turkish decision to refrain from holding military exercises
in the Aegean in July and August. The U.S. was ready to assist
"those who are prepared to take the risks for peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived Tuesday, had an hour-long meeting with
Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis at the start of her
two-day visit. She is accompanied by U.S. special envoy on Cyprus
Richard Beattie.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to meet Greek Prime Minister Simitis later
today before flying to Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Promote Cross-Straits Relations After 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Hong Kong and
Taiwan regions will have a bearing on relations across the Taiwan
Straits after China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, a
scholar from Fujian Province says.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait in Beijing, Li Jianmin, deputy director of the Fujian
Provincial Asia-Pacific Studies Institute, said that after 1997,
Hong Kong will play a more important role in political contacts
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
When Hong Kong-based Taiwanese groups and people experience the
"one country, two systems" policy first-hand, it will be helpful
in helping in getting rid of doubts Taiwan authorities have for
developing practical policy toward Hong Kong, Macao and inland
areas, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will also give impetus to economic co-operation
across the straits and to common prosperity, he noted, and that
Hong Kong's return will be helpful for establishing direct postal
service, trade, air, and shipping services between the two sides
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Taiwan authorities stick to indirect air links with
inland areas via Hong Kong and Macao, they will have to expand the
air link, and eventually have to open direct air service, he
noted. And unofficial contacts, and cultural and technical
exchanges are also expected to be further developed through Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke in Belgrade to Press Karadzic Out of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am here just to convey a message of my government to the
Serbian leaders concerning the implementation of the Dayton peace
accords," he told reporters upon his arrival in Belgrade from
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dissatisfaction with the Bosnian Serbs in regard
to compliance with the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke went into talks with Milosevic immediately after his
arrival around noon. He was summoned from Wall Street by the
Clinton administration to save the peace process in Bosnia which
is in crisis again due to the Serb leaders' intransigence in fully
complying with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy, a key architect of the Bosnian peace plan, was
expected to deliver a tough warning to Milosevic, who has strong
influence on Bosnian Serbs, and ask him to put Karadzic and Serb
army chief Ratko Mladic out of political life and send them to the
Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Karadzic and Mladic, both indicted
as war criminals by the international war crimes tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia, must step down from leadership and stand
trials.
</P>
<P>
Though Karadzic transferred his presidential duties to his
deputy, Biljana Plavsic, last month, he still clings to the
chairmanship of the ruling Serbian Democratic Party. Mladic,
meanwhile, still holds a top position of in the Serb army.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World's No.2 Master Card User </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China has become the biggest
master card market in Asia and second in the world after the
United States, Warren Liu, China Regional Manager of Master Card
International, said in Shanghai today.
</P>
<P>
Liu said he believes Chinese card holders will increase with
the rapid development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Master Card was the first international charge card to enter
the Chinese market in 1988. Liu noted that, out of some 300
million Master Cards issued by the international organization in
1995, Asia and the Pacific have 55.4 million card holders, and
China, more than 10 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the total volume of business done by Master Card in
China was 53.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 26 percent from the
previous year, and accounting for 46.9 percent of the Asia-Pacific
regional market.
</P>
<P>
At present, Master Cards are issued in China by the Bank of
China, Construction Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Merchants Commercial
Bank, and Guangdong Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
There are 144,000 department stores and shops that accept
Master Cards and 260,000 automatic teller machines in China's
major cities, and the card accounts for 70 percent of China's
foreign credit card business.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Master Card International opened an office in
Beijing in 1988 and expects to open its second office in Shanghai
within the year.

<HEADLINE> Birds Disappoint Farmers in Somali Jalalaqsi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU,July 17 (Xinhua)--As the harvest season for maize
and sorgbum draws to a close in many regions of the southern
regions of Somalia, disappointment and despair hits hundreds of
famalies along Shabelle River and around JaJalawsi District.
</P>
<P>
According to community leader, Mohamed Sheikh Qasim, more than
480 hectares of sorghum crop is now being deserted as a result of
waves of hungry quail and partridge birds attack. Qasim said
another 700 hectares of the crop is likely to be abandoned soon.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit villages include Rahale, Gumarreym,Sibay and
Qura Jafle, all around Jalalaqsi District. The hope for more than
300 families seem to have died down after all attempts to stop
the quail and partridge birds failed.
</P>
<P>
Abduooahi Farah Barre, one of the major sorghum growers in the
region said that such a large number of birds were not seen for
the past two years, " They make enough shade when flying atop
your farm,"said barre.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the traditional way of bird prevernting
systems in Somalia, the farmers launch kites, build dressed human
size structures and use all possible rowdy materials including
vehicles horns and loud whistles in their efforts to prevent the
birds from devastating their premature crops.
</P>
<P>
In the history of Somalia, the heaviest bird attack on the
sorghum farms took place at the villages around Baidoa Town in
1994. The attack, attracted international intervention as the
United Nations Operation in Somalia had allocated a fund for the
bird prevention efforts. Spraying helicopters were among the
technology used for the bird plight control. The birds were
sprayed during their resting hours in their nests at night time.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers said that the best solution to the problem would
be to grow maize and beans instead of the easily attacked crops
of rice and sorghum. The farmers would of course choose maize or
beans if they had running water or enough water from irrigation
system, but with the rain fed farms sorghum is inevitable as the
only way to survive. Rice is the only crop that needs a plenty of
water and serious protection from the birds.
</P>
<P>
Quail and Partridge birds come at this time of the year, but
so far nobody seem to know from where they are coming or how to
stop them. Apart from Jalalaqsi Town, Jowhar District, 90 km
north of Mogadishu, other areas are also facing threat of the
birds. More than 150 hectares of rice is theatened by bird attack
in Jowhar which is the only district where rice grows in somalia.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Asks for Official Correction from UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today asked
the United Nations to issue an official statement correcting a
title used by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who
had addressed Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash as "President".
</P>
<P>
In what has been described by U.N. officials as "a slip
of the tongue", the U.N. chief told reporters Tuesday that "a
very constructive meeting with the Security Council where I
discussed the problem of Cyprus and the contact I have had
with President Clerides and President Denktash."
</P>
<P>
Ghali was referring to the separate meetings he had last
month with President of Cyprus Glafcos Clerides in Geneva
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktash is head of the Turkish Cypriot regime, which has been
branded "legally invalid" by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. officials have rushed to inform us that it was a slip of
the tongue," government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said. He
stressed, however, that the Cyprus government believes that an
official statement should be issued by the U.N. on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and seized
the northern third of the island following an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the
establishment of a breakaway state -- "the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by Turkey.

peace talks on the basis of Madrid Peace Conference, the
land-for-peace formula and the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> One China Principle Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Participants in a seminar on
relations across the Taiwan Straits say that if the two sides fail
to reach a consensus on sticking to the 'One China' principle it
will be impossible to break the deadlock in relations.
</P>
<P>
The scholars said that the "One China" principle is the
foundation and prerequisite for the peaceful reunification of
China, and that violating this principle will bring tremendous
harm to the development of relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yizhou, who is from a research office of the All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, said that the principle is not
only a universal reality recognized by the world community, but is
also a basic pattern of the world community.
</P>
<P>
China's reunification is legitimate only on the basis of one
China, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jiashu, a professor at the People's University of China,
said that the two sides badly need to establish a relationship of
mutual trust, and that the state's most urgent task is to abide by
the vital principle, namely the 'One China' principle.
</P>
<P>
One professor from Taiwan said that if Taiwan's political goal
is in the direction of independence or departure from the "One
China" principle, it will be more possible for Beijing to use
armed force to deal with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taipei should be clear about not taking the road toward Taiwan
independence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another professor from Taiwan quoted Premier Li Peng as saying
that state sovereignty belongs to the people of the whole country
and the whole Chinese sovereignty includes Taiwan, the Penghu
Islands, Jinmen, and Mazu and belongs to more than 1.2 billion
Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Scholars urged the two sides to find a way to settle this issue
and take the 'One China' principle as the basis of talks in order
to bring relations across the Taiwan Straits to a new period of
peaceful reunification.

Talking to journalists after inaugurating the newly installed

corruption are vital issues of national concern.

"In my view, the best forum which can tackle these problems is

He rejected the opposition's proposal for the creation of a

</P>
<P>
"We have a constitution and a democratic order, which is
functioning effectively and there are a lot of debates going on in
the press on the corruption issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has its own view that the establishment of such
a commission will not help in eliminating corruption but will
divert attention," he added.
</P>

The president urged the opposition to cooperate with the

<P>
Huang Jiashu, a professor from People's University of China,
said the two sides have different understandings of the 'one
China' principle, but that high-level talks would be helpful in
closing this gap.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the stable development of relations across the
strait, it is necessary for leaders of the two sides to exchange
views, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The participants also urged the two sides to hold talks to end
the state of hostility with common understanding and to lay a
foundation for reunification.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zaixi, from the Institute for International Strategic
Studies, said that putting an end to the state of hostility will
help break the political deadlock and make for healthy development
of relations.
</P>
<P>
From a more distant point of view, this move is also helpful
for avoiding tensions related to some accidents, and to remove the
Taiwan compatriots' worry about the armed forces, he added.

ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- To the cheers and applause of some
22,000 fans who paid for their seats in the Georgia Dome within
the Olympic Ring here, the US women's Olympic gymnastic team made
a practics Tuesday, three days before the centennial Games start.
</P>
<P>
And this is the first time in Olympic history that podium
training - practice on the raised equipment - became a ticket
event. Admission fees ranged from 11 to 22 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the the seven members of the women's team were Shannon
Miller, a five-time Olympic medal-winner and 14-year-old prodigy
Dominique Moceanu, who are coming back from injuries.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu is a new medal hope of famed coach Bela Karolyi who has

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Gold Sweep in Olympic Table Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to go one up
from the three-title haul at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games
although the world table tennis powerhouse says it will be happy
with two gold medals from the upcoming Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua told Xinhua last month that the
Chinese had set their sights on a four-title sweep in Atlanta but
he tuned down on his arrival here last Sunday, saying that the
team aimed to bag two gold medals.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's paddlers face serious challenges from
hard-hitting opponents from Sweden, Belgium, France and Germany
while the women still enjoy an apparant edge over the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Kong Linghui, Wang Tao and Liu Guoliang form a three-pronged
hunt of the Olympic men's singles title, which have eluded the
Chinese since the sport made its debut as medal event in the 1988
Seoul Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Looming large before the Chinese trio are defending Olympic
champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden, former world number one
Jean-Michael Saive and former world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien
of France.
</P>
<P>
Poker-face Waldner, hailed as Mr. Cool of table tennis, has
regained his form after a waterloo defeat to Chinese youngster Liu
in the world championships last year, winning the Sweden Open,
European Top 12 and England Open.
</P>
<P>
"I have a fifty-fifty chance if I meet Waldner in the
Olympics," said world number one Kong, reigning world champion and
World Cup holder.
</P>
<P>
Should he win the Olympic singles event, the 20-year-old Kong
will become the second player after Waldner to complete a Grand
Slam of the Olympic, world and World Cup titles and join the Swede
as the sport's all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
"We rate Waldner as our top threat," said Chinese head coach
Cai. "Following him on the 'blacklist' are Saive, Gatien, Jorg
Rosskopf of Germany, Kim Taek Soo of South Korea and Zoran
Primorac of Croatia."
</P>
<P>
A recent report said that Waldner had picked up a thumb injury
in a warm-up competition and it might affect his performance. But
the Chinese coach regarded it as a ploy to relax Chinese
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the report," said Chinese coach Lu Yuansheng.
</P>
<P>
China stands a fair chance to win the men's doubles crown with
world and Olympic champions Wang Tao/Lu Lin as vanguards and new
combination Kong/Liu as backup team.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles event, it's not a question of trying to
predict which players will battle it out in the final, rather a
question of who will be playing seemingly invincible Deng Yaping.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese world number one, known for lightning initiatives
in the first three rallies, is heavily favored for a successful
defense of the women's singles top honor.
</P>
<P>
Deng is also tipped as a title-hopeful in the women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
She and her partner Qiao Hong, who combined to lift the women's
doubles title in the Barcelona Games four years ago, have only
their compatriot duo -- 1991 world champions Liu Wei/Qiao Yunping
-- to beat before they step onto the top of the podium.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Seven Organizations have registered
for the coming Legislative Assembly (LA) election in September in
Macao, the Macao Regional Election Committee (MREC) said today.
</P>
<P>
An executive of the MREC told reporters today that five
organizations have registered for the direct election to be held
on September 22, and two other organizations have registered for
indirect elections.
</P>
<P>
The name of candidates and organizations will not be released
until August 9, said the executive.
</P>
<P>
The Macao LA now has 23 seats, with eight members directly
elected and eight indirectly elected, and the remaining appointed
by the Macao Governor.
</P>
<P>
Many social organizations have expressed willingness to
participate in the election. The new LA, which will take office in
October, will probably pass through 1999 and be the first LA of the
Macao Special Administration Region after China resumes its
sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The MREC said that it will enhance publicity of the election
campaign, by setting up a telephone hotline for consultation and
establishing a homepage on the Internet service for inquiries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has printed thousands of posters and pamphlets
on the election. Registered voters will receive those pamphlets
soon, which will inform them the place of voting and other relevant
information.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Government Reveals Past Deals with Muslim Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government negotiators
today released details of the agreements reached with the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) in the past three years to refute
accusations of a secret deal between the government and the Muslim
group.
</P>
<P>
The major points of the agreements, which were reached by the
two sides in 1994, 1995 and last month, include consensus on the
national defense, a regional security force and the establishment
of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, MNLF forces will be integrated into the
army, a security force will be established in the autonomous
region and a special zone of peace and development covering 14
provinces and 10 cities will be set up in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos today published a statement on his secret
trip in February 1992 to Libya, during which he discussed the
peace process in the southern Philippines with Libyan leader
Muammar al-Qathafi.
</P>
<P>
Since the government announced the latest peace deal with the
Muslim group last month, opposition forces in the country have
accused the Ramos administration of betraying interests of the
nation by making a secret deal with the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
Christian residents in the southern Philippines staged several
demonstrations against the deal, under which, the head of the MNLF
would become chairman of the Council for Peace and Development.

<HEADLINE> Human Development Report Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program's "Human Development Report 1996" was made public here
today, giving China good marks for sustained economic growth over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The report identifies China's relatively high initial
investment in education and social services as key factors in the
present high growth rates.
</P>
<P>
China has helped employment opportunities by shifting its
policy of investment in capital-intensive industries to
labor-intensive production, especially for the export market, and
by expanding township enterprises and small-scale farming, the
report notes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is also praised for its steady development, but warned
that the number of people living below the poverty line is rising.
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, inequality of income and wealth seem to
be increasing," says Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in
economics, in the report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S should focus attention on social services, health care,
and the environment; if not, inadequate government action in these
areas will hold back the economy in the long run, the report
states.
</P>
<P>
Attention to growth rates alone is not enough, it says. "Policy
makers are often mesmerized by the quality of growth. They need to
be more concerned with its quality and take timely action to
prevent growth that is lopsided and flawed," Richard Jolly, chief
author of the report, says.
</P>
<P>
The report also informs us that 358 billionaires own more assets
than the combined annual incomes of the developing countries with
45 percent of the world's population, and refutes economic
theories that argue that inequality is necessary for growth, and
warns that the economic is unsustainable without attention being
paid to inequality.
</P>
<P>
"Many people are concerned that human development is
anti-growth. However, human development, and sustained successful
economic growth do go hand-in-hand," Jolly says.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Workers Strike Again to Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli economy grounded to
a halt Wednesday as over 400,000 workers nationwide staged an
one-day strike to protest the government's new economic program.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by Israel's general trade union
Histadrut last Sunday, as part of its intensified campaign
against the government's plan to cut the budget and accelerate
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Today's strike affected mainly the public sector, closing all
government ministries, local authorities, banks, public hospitals,
 post offices and other public companies. Israel Radio also cut
off broadcasting today.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Tel Aviv Regional Labor Court issued an
injunction forbidding the Ports and Railway Authority, the
Airports Authority, and Israel Airline EL Al from striking. In
Jerusalem, the Regional Labor Court also restricted the
industrial sector's strike to only two hours.
</P>
<P>
However, Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz, convening a meeting
of union leaders to coordinate the strike Tuesday night, warned
that the more the government assaulted the workers with decrees
and draconian measures, the more they would fight back to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to be partners in the economic policy, but
they refused to negotiate with us on a responsible plan. We say to
the government, don't make the workers the sole victims of all
your cutbacks, don't run the state on the backs of the workers,"
said Peretz.
</P>
<P>
This morning, thousands of labor activists from across the
country held a mass rally outside the Knesset (parliament), some
holding placards reading "We demand just distribution of the
Burden."
</P>
<P>
The Likud-led government announced on July 7 plans to cut 1.5
billion U.S.dollars from next year's budget to curb the
increasing budget deficit and spiraling inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan immediately aroused strong protest from the
labor camp, which charged the cuts in education, health, pensions
and other social welfare budget would only harm the lower and
middle income earners.
</P>
<P>
Workers in the public sector also feel threatened by
government's plan to speed up privatization, which will
inevitably lead to mass lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut has declared a long fight against the government's
new economic program. Today's strike is the second this month
since an one-hour warning strike called by the Histadrut on July
1.

<HEADLINE> Syria to Abolish Dual Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian government is
quickening steps to abolish the existing dual exchange rate, with
an aim of boosting national economy and attracting foreign
investments, reliable sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Salim Yassin said
recently that there was a problem that hinders attracting foreign
investors, namely, the dual currency exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian government will do away with this problem and its
negative effects, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted the Syrian deputy prime minister as saying
that every investor -- Syrian, Arab or foreign -- is entitled to
open a foreign currency account at a Syrian bank, and that
investors are entitled to take their foreign currency profits out
of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Yassin stressed that an investor is entitled to import all the
equipment and materials needed by these enterprises, which are
completely exempted from taxes and customs duties for five
years. The exemption can be further extended to seven years if the
manufacturer exports 50 percent of their products, and two more
years of tax exemption will be offered if the enterprise is
established outside Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Yassin said that there are no ceilings for the amount of
foreign currency amounts to be brought into Syria or taken out of
the country by investors.

XI'AN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China is making great
progress to improve its natural environment, after years of
suffering heavy industrial pollution and relatively bad ecological
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 small rivers in this region have been cleaned up
during recent years, covering a total area of 55 thousand square
kilometers, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Millions of trees have been planted to contribute to better
environmental conditions. In the desert area of Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, the planting area of the diversiform-leaved
poplar has reached 233,000 hectares, 2.5 times higher than several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In arid Gansu Province, the vegetation rate has reached 8.5
percent, much higher than previously recorded.
</P>
<P>
Fighting pollution has long been a focus of the local
governments. In Xianyang, a city in Shaanxi Province, 340 small
oil refineries have been closed in order to improve air quality.
</P>
<P>
Legislation has played an active role in this regard. Many
codes and regulations have been formulated and strictly carried
out; in Qinghai Province, 12 basic codes regarding environmental
protection have been issued.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that during the last three years, 377
cases regarding environmental pollution have been handled in

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President Attacks US Policy, Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today bitterly attacked the policy of the United States by
accusing it of continuing its conspiracy against Iraq and the
Cairo Arab Summit held last month with the exclusion of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam was delivering a nationwide television speech
marking the 28th anniversary of July 17 Revolution which brought
Iraq's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party to power in 1968.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. is using U.N. resolutions to boost its
hegemony in the Middle East region, but adding that the world has
been witnessing an upsurge in the spirit of independence with the
aim of getting rid of the U.S. hegemony.
</P>
<P>
"This was clear in the activities, policies and slogans in
Europe, Asia and Latin America expressing concern and disgust
against the whims of American policy and its hegemonist and evil
tendencies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the leader of the multinational allies which
drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in 1991, has maintained tough
against Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been blaming the U.S. for impeding the lifting of
U.N. sanctions and the implementation of the oil-for-food deal
agreed on May 20 by Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, President Saddam rejected that Iraq constitutes
a threat to its Arab neighbors as stated in the final communique
issued at the end of the Arab summit held in Cairo on June
22-23. He accused some Arab nations of allowing their "masters" to
launch aggression against Iraq and violate Iraqi airspace using
foreign bases set up inside the Arab homeland.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that tens of thousands of Iraqi women, children,
and the elderly have fallen victims to the U.N. imposed sanctions
"which was decided and adopted by those 'clever' Arab rulers."
</P>
<P>
The president said that the summit also made a mistake in
calling for a peaceful settlement between the Arab nations and
Israel. He called on the Arabs to stand firm against "capitulation
and surrender."
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit in Cairo was aimed at unifying the fractured
ranks of the Arab world as a result of Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990 and coordinating Arab stance toward the new Israeli
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was the sole Arab nation which was not invited to the
summit because of the "existing sensitivity" as stated by the
summit host Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Iraq has repeatedly
voiced its strong objection to its absence from the summit.

<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank has
worked out specific measures to support major state enterprises in
their reforms.
</P>
<P>
A bank official said today in Beijing that the bank will grant

<HEADLINE> China Produces 50 Million Electric Fans Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China turns out 50 million
electric fans a year, against an annual market demand of 35
million, China Light Industry News has reported.
</P>
<P>
However, brisk exports and increasing demand in the vast rural
areas, will ensure the smooth development of the national electric
fan market, the paper quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although air conditioners are becoming increasingly popular,
they will not have great impact on the domestic electric fan
market because they are more energy-consuming and expensive,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, electric fans which are able to give both
cool and hot air seem to be favored on the market, and tend to
seize a larger market share than conventional models.
</P>
<P>
Metal and floor electric fans sell much better than plastic and
ceiling types.
</P>
<P>
Experts report that luxurious, multi-functional,
remote-controlled, and big-name electric fans, are more popular
with urbanites, while durable and cheaper versions dominate the
rural market.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Asks U.S. to Take Rubbish Back From Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace has demanded the
United States to take back its plastic wastes now rotting on board
a cargo ship in Hong Kong harbor.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has uncovered a trail of the paper and plastic,
indicating the wastes have come from Atlanta, host of the 1996
Olympics. The 200-ton shipment of wastes, including thousands of
shopping bags from the giant Winn-Dixie supermarket chain, is part
of a trend to use Asia as a dumping site for U.S. wastes disguised
as "recycling".
</P>
<P>
"In Atlanta they want to break world records. Instead they are
breaking environmental law," said Clement Lam Hau Keen of
Greenpeace in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Winn-Dixie wastes were shipped from Los Angeles through
Hong Kong to China. Officials in the port of Fuzhou in
southeastern China refused to allow it to be unloaded because
attempted import of wastes covered by China's national ban are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
China is clamping down on waste trade since the country passed
tough new environmental laws in support of the international Basel
Convention, which restricts waste shipments from developed to
developing countries.
The U.S. has failed to become a party to the convention.
</P>
<P>
Winn-Dixie in Atlanta tried to dispose thousands of plastic
bags returned by customers who were promised the plastic would be
recycled. A shipment of the bags and other plastic products were
brokered by ICP Industries, a New York waste trading company. The
consignment of plastic was contaminated by household wastes
including dirty soft drink cans, metal fittings and rotting food.
</P>
<P>
The ship is now in Hong Kong where it was also refused to
unload. It has been languishing in the harbor since July 2 with
the crew surrounded by the stench of rotting wastes.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace contacted Winn-Dixie headquarters and called on the
company to take the trash back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped Winn-Dixie, as a leading supermarket chain in the
U.S., would be a responsible corporate citizen," Lam said.
"Instead they are shirking their moral obligation to take back
their rubbish."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Adopt Measures to Curb Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Interior Ministry
pledged to take strict measures to fight the rampant crimes which
have seriously affected the peoples' normal life, said a Kuwaiti
official Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali al-Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah said that the
parliament Tuesday night discussed the security situation in the
country and concluded that "the security situation in Kuwait was
different from what it used to be."
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, frequently reported murder, rape,
personal attack as well as robbery and theft cases in Kuwait made
many Kuwaiti citizens worry, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The local media attributed Kuwait's deteriorating security
situation mainly to the stateless people which number more than
100,000 in the country and the large number of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
At present, it is reported that nearly one million people from
150 nations live in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the parliament to issue a law prohibiting the
possession of weapons that still scattered in the hands of many
citizens since the Gulf War, prostitution rings and rampant
trading in drugs in Kuwait may also add up to the serious security
situation, some parliamentarians said.
</P>
<P>
They also accused the Interior Ministry of being busy trying to
influence the forth-coming election rather than implementing
strict measures to curb crimes.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister called for cooperation of the whole
society to fight against crimes while declaring that his ministry
was adopting some measures for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a self-protection bill for commercial
establishments will be presented in helping fight crimes against
business in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some measures to protect banks against crimes were already
agreed upon between the Interior Ministry and the bank sector, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on collection of arms which is still under
consideration by the parliament's interior and defense committee
is expected to be passed soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has been coordinating with
the Ministry of Education to introduce a new course on security
which will be taught starting the next school year.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti parliament recently passed a bill which would punish
drug trafficker with death sentence.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the rising crimes, Kuwait, whose crime rate
now stands at 966 for every 100,000, is still believed as one of
the countries in the world which has the lowest crime rate.

TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Finance Minister Wataru
Kubo said Wednesday that the pace of Japan's economic recovery is
"still gradual."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a speech at a lunchon meeting of the

</P>
<P>
The economy has entered a self-sustainable recovery phase, and
there are some brighter signs in consumer spending and corporate
business sentiment while investment in plant and equipment is
heading for gradual recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the recovery pace is still gradual due to factors such as
the continued severity of the nation's employment situation, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Bakassi: Nigeria Waving Olive Branch Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria yesterday held out once
again the olive branch to Cameroun over the border row in the
oil-rich Bakassi peninsula, calling for Cameroun to return to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
But Nigerian Chief of General Staff Oladipo Diya accused
unnamed powerful nations of fuelling discord between Nigeria and
its ''cherished neighbors''.
</P>
<P>
At a joint meeting of officials and comimissioners responsible
for boundary matters in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, yesterday,
Diya said the current dispute between Nigeria and Cameroun over
Bakassi is an African problem that could only be resolved by
Africans without external interference.
</P>
<P>
Diya attributed border problems in Africa to the bad job of
former colonial masters.
</P>
<P>
''They sat in far away European capitals and arbitrarily
partitioned Africa, without consulting its people, thereby
creating the numerous boundary problems that have persisted to
the present,'' Diya said, quoted by locall press reports today.
</P>
<P>
As mature sovereign nations, it is now the responsibility of
African countries to find satisfying solution and advance means
of effectively managing border problems, he told participants at
the parley organized by the National Bounddary Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to Diya, Nigeria has continued to follow the path of
peace in all its dealings with its neighbors and has initiated a
number of trans-border cooperation activities with Chad, Niger,
Benin, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
Work has reached an advance stage in various sectors of the
nation's international borders to identify and demarcate the
boundaries under joint cooperation with the neighbors, Diya said.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Keep An Eye on Quake-hit Tangshan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- For survivors of one of the
world's deadliest earthquakes, July 28 is a day they will never
forget.
</P>
<P>
And on that day in the Chinese city of Tangshan, north China,
people flock to the eight big suburban cemeteries to mourn and
remember the 240,000 victims killed in the deadly quake in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Among the regular visitors to the cemeteries are a special
group of people who focus their attention on the soil, underground
water and plants around the fields of tombs, busy collecting
samples.
</P>
<P>
They are researchers from the anti-epidemic departments of
Hebei Province, who have continually monitored the environment of
the cemeteries for two decades.
</P>
<P>
On the early morning of July 28, 1976, a quake measuring 7.8 on
the Richter Scale struck Tangshan, a 100-year-old coal mining and
industrial center in North China's Hebei Province. It claimed
240,000 lives in the city, 30,000 in Tianjin, and 500 in Beijing,
and killed more than 450,000 livestock.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government immediately sent 100,000 People's
Liberation Army (PLA) troops right to the the city to carry out
rescue work.
</P>
<P>
"It was harder than clearing the battlefield after a
large-scale war," recalled Liu Bin, who took part in the rescue
work as a PLA serviceman at the time.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims' bodies could not be dealt with right after
they were dug from the ruins. The task of saving survivors buried
under the rubble was much more important, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The summer heat and rainstorms speeded up the deterioration of
the bodies, which began to decompose and smell badly within a
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
A week after the quake the majority of rescue forces turned to
the grim task of burying the dead. The soldiers had to wear gas
masks, rubber aprons, gloves, waders and tie their sleeves and
trousers tightly to prevent the polluted air and the strong smell
of the victims from affecting them.
</P>
<P>
"Many of us fainted away either because of the disgusting smell
or exhaustion." said the middle-aged veteran, who is now working
in an enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Each time a body was dug out, a shower of deodorant and
disinfectant would be sprayed on the body and the spot where the
victim was found. There were so many dead that some of the bodies
were just wrapped with clothes and quilts from the ruins and put
into the plastic bags to be carried away.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters divided the soldiers into several groups, one
shift for half an hour, to shorten the time each person was
exposed to contact with the bodies.
</P>
<P>
Local residents volunteered to hand-feed water and food to the
soldiers, to help keep them from the risk of infection.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Purchasing Successful in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China has purchased 3.5 million
tons of cotton so far this year, about 350,000 tons more than last
year's total purchasing volume, according to sources of All-China
Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
With the remarkable efforts of local supply and marketing
cooperatives, which are the grassroot cotton purchasing centers,
and the cooperation of relevant departments, the country's cotton
purchasing, which began on September 1, 1995, is well under way,
the federation said.
</P>
<P>
In the nationwide cotton purchasing campaign, no IOU notes have
been issued to farmers this year, thanks to a sufficient money
supply by central government.
</P>
<P>
The cotton purchasing of the fiscal year 1995 is expected to be
completed at the end of August.

<HEADLINE> Protect Environment, Achieve Sustained Growth: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- In an editorial to be published
tomorrow, "the People's Daily" states that only by effectively
protecting the environment will China be able to achieve sustained
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We must understand that in essence, environmental protection
means protecting productive forces," quotes the editorial in
China's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The editorial marks the conclusion of the 4th National
Conference on Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
"We must make a success of environmental protection from the
point of view of safeguarding the overall and long-term interests
of the Chinese nation," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
It asks governments at all levels to do their utmost to fulfill
the Ninth Five-Year Plan for Environmental Protection approved in
principle by the State Council, China's highest administrative
body.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises and individuals that create serious pollution,
thereby breaking laws and regulations, must be punished according
to law, it says.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to introduce a system under which township
heads, county magistrates, mayors and provincial governors will be
held responsible for the quality of environment in the areas
governed by them.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and leaders of various industrial departments must be
held responsible for environmental protection in their workplaces,
according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also emphasizes the importance of controlling
pollution by relying on scientific and technological progress.
</P>
<P>
Various localities and departments must concentrate on
developing and spreading the use of environmental protection
techniques.
</P>
<P>
"They must also rely on scientific and technological progress
to increase the utilization ratio of natural resources, and to
improve their capability and management on pollution control," it
says.
</P>
<P>
It urges manufacturers to make vigorous efforts to carry out
technological upgrading and innovations and step up clean
production.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels must take effective measures to
increase spending on environmental protection, and to raise the
ratio of environmental protection spending to the gross domestic
product (the value of goods and services produced).
</P>
<P>
The editorial also stresses the need to publicize the
importance of environmental protection, and brings into play the
role of public opinion and media organizations in connection with
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Auction Law Brings China Nearer to International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Going ... going ... gone! Poor
practices at auctions in China are on the way out thanks to
a new international-standard law.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the Ministry of Internal Trade in Beijing said
today that the newly promulgated Auction Law is designed to bring
practices in China in line with the world auction market.
</P>
<P>
"We referred a lot to relevant laws and regulations of advanced
countries when formulating our own auction law", said Ding Jun of
the Ministry, which is designated by the State Council to
supervise China's auction market.
</P>
<P>
Ding told a press conference that China's Auction Law,
promulgated earlier this month, is aimed at bringing auction
market practices under the jurisdiction of law, enhancing the
State supervision over the market, maintaining market order and
protecting the rights and interests of the involved parties.
</P>
<P>
This first auction law in China was compiled by reference to
foreign laws in many respects, including stressing the role of
specialized auction industry associations, the general procedures
of auction activities, and payments of commission.
</P>
<P>
"The new law is not only applicable to the Chinese auction
market, but also to foreigners, foreign enterprises and
organizations who are involved in auction dealing in the country",
Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, almost all of China's provinces and
municipalities have set up auction businesses, or become engaged
in auction activities.
</P>
<P>
Auctions have been extended to over a dozen fields including
commodities, materials, cultural products, relics, land, and
property.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese auction industry is enhancing exchanges
with its foreign counterparts. London-based Christie's and
Sotherby's, two of the world's leading auction firms, have set up
offices respectively in Beijing and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Play Important Role in Scientific Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China's colleges and universities
have won half of all the nation's natural science prizes given in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
One out of every three invention awards was given to colleges
and universities during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities also won 550, or one fourth of the
national awards for Science and Technology Progress, during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
According to a national conference on college science and
technology research, which opened this week in Beijing, over
600,000 people are actively involved in the fields of science,
engineering, agriculture, and medical science on campuses, and
197,000 people in humane studies and social sciences. About
140,000 students seeking master's or doctor's degrees are
participants in college science and technology research.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities undertook 90,000 research tasks from
1991 to 1995. Research expenses almost quadrupled during the
Eighth Five-Year Plan. Colleges and universities received 4.7
billion yuan (about 566 million US dollars) for scientific
research in 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
The government has invested about 250 million yuan and 90
million US dollars in establishing 101 national key
laboratories. Departments and local governments have jointly
established a group of open laboratories and provincial key
laboratories, which became bases of training high-level science
and technology researchers, and conducting high-level scientific
studies.
</P>
<P>
Currently another 27 national engineering and engineering
technology research centers have been established, or are under
construction in colleges and universities.

The work in rush burying the dead and carefully disinfecting
their final resting places, avoided the breakout of epidemic
diseases.
</P>
<P>
During the winter of that year, from November 20 to December
30, The city government organized another burial, persuading those
who had quietly buried their loved ones in urban areas to rebury
them in suburban cemeteries. Some 55,000 bodies were exhumed
within a month.
</P>
<P>
An anti-epidemic study group, composed of researchers from
Hebei Medical University, the Provincial Sanitary and
Disease-Control Station, the Provincial Medical Institute, the
Provincial Soil and Fertilizer Institute, and other departments
have been working on disease-control and environmental protection
in Tangshan since the burial work began.
</P>
<P>
They closely studied the possibilities of the bodies causing
disease by several means, including germs, viruses, biochemicals
and pathology. Even the soil and vegetation was carefully
examined. The team used statistics from the medical tests, and
analysis of the soil and plants.
</P>
<P>
Each year, they analyze over 300 samples of soil, air,
underground water and some vegetables that are growing near the
cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
The surveys show that the bodies have not spread any diseases,
and the natural environment of the burial grounds have remained
literarily intact, despite such a large number of bodies buried
beneath.
</P>
<P>
Green grass and colorful flowers around the graves have
relieved the visitors from the chilling memory of thinking about
the hundreds of thousands of people died. It has also freed the
survivors and their offspring in Tangshan from the fear of
pollution and any epidemic diseases that the bodies of their
tragic family members who died could have unwittingly
inflicted. The peaceful and clean environment of the burial
grounds, with its colorful flowers, is a reminder for ever of the
day that shook the world - and shattered the lives of so many
families.

<HEADLINE> How Far is Lhasa? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- How far is Lhasa? It depends on how
you get there.
</P>
<P>
For 63-year-old Awang, the former deputy director of Xinhua
News Agency's Tibet Branch, Lhasa is a place that takes months to
reach. Forty-five years ago, he was among the 300 soldiers sent to
peacefully liberate the Tibet region.
</P>
<P>
The group left from Changdu, a city bordering Tibet and Sichuan
Province, and arrived in Lhasa three months later.
</P>
<P>
"All the roads were rugged and rough, and we had to pass the
snow-covered mountains and muddy grasslands. I cannot remember how
many rubber-soled shoes I used during the trip, and many of us
died of cold, hunger, or lack of oxygen," Awang said.
</P>
<P>
In 1952, Tibet's first highway was built. After two years of
labor from thousands of workers and soldiers, the highway, now
named Qing-Zang Highway, was put into use in 1954.
</P>
<P>
When Ning Shiqun, the current deputy director of Xinhua News
Agency's Tibet Branch, first went to Lhasa from Xining, the
capital city of neighboring Qinghai Province, he traveled along
the Qing-Zang Highway.
</P>
<P>
"For safety purposes, the truck could cover only less than 180
kilometers a day, so it took us a whole month to get to Lhasa,"
Ning said.
</P>
<P>
Though Awang and Ning's stories are familiar to their
colleagues, they seem unbelievable to Shen Lutao, a young
university graduate working for the Xinhua Tibet Branch. Last
year, he traveled to Lhasa by air.
</P>
<P>
The plane left at seven a.m. from Chengdu Airport in Sichuan
Province, and arrived at Gongga Airport in Lhasa at 8:30
a.m. After an hour's drive, he arrived in the center of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"It took me only a few hours, and I even had time for lunch,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
China's Southwest Airlines now has up to three flights to Lhasa
daily. A new air route from Xi'an to Lhasa opened in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
According to Awang, it is much more convenient for people to
travel in Tibet now than in the old days. When he was a young
reporter, he used to travel on horseback, taking solid food with
him, but today's generation uses cars.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only because we have advanced means of
transportation, but more importantly because the region now has a
much better road network," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the total length of highway in Tibet
reached 21,000 kilometers in 1995, and links all of the counties
together.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Workers Strike Again to Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli economy grounded to
a halt Wednesday as over 400,000 workers nationwide staged an
one-day strike to protest the government's new economic program.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by Israel's general trade union
Histadrut last Sunday, as part of its intensified campaign
against the government's plan to cut the budget and accelerate
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Today's strike affected mainly the public sector, closing all
government ministries, local authorities, banks, public hospitals,
 post offices and other public companies. Israel Radio also cut
off broadcasting today.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Tel Aviv Regional Labor Court issued an
injunction forbidding the Ports and Railway Authority, the
Airports Authority, and Israel Airline EL Al from striking. In
Jerusalem, the Regional Labor Court also restricted the
industrial sector's strike to only two hours.
</P>
<P>
However, Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz, convening a meeting
of union leaders to coordinate the strike Tuesday night, warned
that the more the government assaulted the workers with decrees
and draconian measures, the more they would fight back to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to be partners in the economic policy, but
they refused to negotiate with us on a responsible plan. We say to
the government, don't make the workers the sole victims of all
your cutbacks, don't run the state on the backs of the workers,"
said Peretz.
</P>
<P>
This morning, thousands of labor activists from across the
country held a mass rally outside the Knesset (parliament), some
holding placards reading "We demand just distribution of the
Burden."
</P>
<P>
The Likud-led government announced on July 7 plans to cut 1.5
billion U.S.dollars from next year's budget to curb the
increasing budget deficit and spiraling inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan immediately aroused strong protest from the
labor camp, which charged the cuts in education, health, pensions
and other social welfare budget would only harm the lower and
middle income earners.
</P>
<P>
Workers in the public sector also feel threatened by
government's plan to speed up privatization, which will
inevitably lead to mass lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut has declared a long fight against the government's
new economic program. Today's strike is the second this month
since an one-hour warning strike called by the Histadrut on July
1.

CHENGDU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Remains of a city that stood 5,000
years ago have been found in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province, proving that the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River is an origin of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Old city remains have been found separately in Xinjin, Pixian

<P>
At the sites experts have unearthed gold, silver and bronze
ware dating back to the Xia Dynasty (21st-16th Century BC), the
first dynasty in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Stoneware from the Neolithic Age, some 7,000 years ago, was

</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the find breaks the traditional
view that the Yellow River in the northern part of the country was
the only cradle of Chinese civilization.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Beef up Efforts to Enforce Environmental Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China's top environmental
protection official said China is to step up efforts to enforce
laws and regulations on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Song Jian, also director of the State
Council's Environmental Protection Committee, said the efforts are
necessary to ensure the implementation of environmental protection
laws and regulations, and the country's sustainable social and
economic development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of a three-day national
conference on environmental protection, Song said China has
formulated a complete set of policies, laws and regulations on
environmental protection during the past two decades and more.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the legal system has played a great role in
protecting and improving the environment, and laid the foundation
for implementing a sustainable development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made in the coming five years to improve and
strictly enforce the laws and regulations, a must for the country
to realize its 1996-2000 environmental protection targets, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The targets strive to basically curb the trend of aggravating
environmental pollution and biological damage, and to improve the
environmental situations in some cities and regions by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a number of measures in its efforts to
realize the targets, with priority given to the prevention and
control of water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures are the "Program to Curb the Total Amount of
Discharged Pollutants" and the "Green Project Program through
2010".
</P>
<P>
China has launched campaigns to clean up three major polluted
rivers and three polluted lakes by the year 2000, and to reduce
acid rain or sulphur dioxide in heavily polluted areas.
</P>
<P>
The rivers are the Huaihe River in central and east China, the
Haihe River in north China, and the Liaohe River in northeast
China. The lakes are Taihu and Chaohu in east China's Jiangsu and
Anhui provinces, and the Dianchi in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
"We must be firmly opposed to practises of seeking quick
benefits, by paying attention to short-term interests at the
expense of long-term ones," Song pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"In order to protect the fundamental interests and sustain
economic development, it is better to slow down the economic
growth rate for the time being, than harm the environment and
natural resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, the top legislature in China, told the
meeting that the congress will make efforts to improve the
existing laws and regulations on environmental protection in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the congress will also pay more attention to
law enforcement to make sure that governments at all levels
fulfill their commitments to environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Province Attracts More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of China's
Yunnan province said here today that thanks to its rich resources
in hydropower, minerals, tourism and improved infrastructure,
Yunnan is becoming ever more attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the 3-day second greater Mekong
subregion business workshop, Du Kaitan, deputy secretary general
of the Yunnan provincial government, said the province has now
1,383 overseas-funded enterprises with a total contracted
investment of 3.46 billion US dollars, including 1.6 billion
dollars of imput from overseas.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, 23 projects involving more than 10 million
dollars of investment were approved.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government gives priority to projects in
infrastructure such as roads, bridges, power stations, railways,
docks and land port facilities; mineral exploitation and raw
material production; utilization of non-ferrous metals and
phosphates; agro-businesses; tourism development; and high
technology.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Yunnan's trade with countries of the greater Mekong
subregion, such as Myanmar and Thailand, has witnessed rapid
growth. Last year, Yunnan's trade with Myanmar and Thailand
reached 490 million and 30 million dollars respectively, a
substantial growth over 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province has air links with Thailand, Myanmar, Laos,
Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong; a rail link with Vietnam; and a
waterway -- the lancang river, which is the upper reach of the
Mekong river, connects Yunnan with Myanmar, Laos, Thailand,
Cambodia and Vietnam. The river offers enormous potentials for
navigation, irrigation and power generation.
</P>
<P>
In order to further promote relations of the province, and
those of other southwestern Chinese provinces, with Southeast
Asian countries, the province is hosting the '96 Kunming fair on
August 8-15.
</P>
<P>
Du expressed confidence that with economic development in the
greater Mekong subregion, economic relations among Mekong revering
countries will further develop.

</P>
<P>
One group of guerrillas infiltrated into the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" and launched the assault, which
drew backfire from the Israeli troops, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters flew to the venue in order "to lift the
killed and wounded soldiers," according to the security sources.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, no guerrilla group had claimed responsibility for
the operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli forces this morning bombarded Iglim
Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a mountain area some 60
kilometers south of Beirut. The area is often used by Lebanese
Shiite Moslem guerrillas as a springboard for attacks at the
Israeli forces in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery also shelled vicinities of the south
Lebanese villages of Loueizeh, Rihan and the farms of Sejoud and
Aqmata.
</P>
<P>
The 850-square-kilometer buffer zone, which was set up by
Israel in 1985, is patrolled by some 1,000 Israeli troops and
2,500 militiamen of the Israeli client South Lebanon Army (SLA),
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 16 Israeli soldiers have been killed and 56
others wounded in south Lebanon since this year, including nine
killed and 25 wounded after Lebanon and the Jewish state reached a
cease-fire understanding on April 26.

<HEADLINE> China, US Cooperate in Training High-Level Managers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The training program, approved by the State Education
Commission (SEC) last year, has caught the attention of both
countries. Business giants from the United States, including IBM,
GE and Boeing, expressed their willingness to offer financial
support to the program, provide practice opportunities for the
students, and even employ them.
</P>
<P>
When a lecture introducing the program was given in the
Beijing-based People's University of China on June 17, more than
1,000 people crowded in for further information.
</P>
<P>
The 24 chosen students, almost without exception, have all been
successful in their respective careers. Some of them are managers
of China's big state-run companies, some are owners of big private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We are different from others who have been to the United
States for study," said Wang Hui, a senior manager from China
International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), explaining
that she and the other 23 students will focus more on receiving
systematic education of management in the States, and learning
more about the culture, rather than the diploma itself.
</P>
<P>
"Our working experience at home has helped make clear what we
are going to get out of our future study in the United States,"
Wang said. She has received her master's degree at home, and has
been working with trade, investments and stock for several years.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the institute has never expected so much out of this
training program before, but has become more confident about
continuing the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Institute is working on cooperating with Nankai University
in Tianjin, a neighboring municipality of Beijing, and with
Tianjin Economic and Technology Development Zone. Once an
agreement is reached, the Institute will start a training course
for senior managers.

<P>
TIANJIN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four Chinese students will
leave for New York tomorrow to attend a 15-month business
administration training course.
</P>
<P>
They are the first group of students selected from nearly 100
candidates by a Sino-US MBA (Master of Business Administration)
training program, conducted by east China's Zhejiang University
and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"High-level managers with a Chinese background, who also have
received training in the United States, are badly needed as more
and more US companies begin to have trade or investment relations
with China," said Xu Shubai, director of the Sino-US MBA Training
Program.
</P>
<P>
Those trained people are not only needed by US companies, but
by Chinese companies that do business with US companies, added Xu.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who is also a professor with the Institute, said the most
distinguished aspect of the program was that students learn
knowledge through bilateral exchanges, as they keep in touch with
China while receiving US MBA training.
</P>
<P>
They will continue four months of study in China after the
15-month training in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some of the students already obtained master's or doctor's
degrees. They have all been involved in management for at least
two years.
</P>
<P>
Those who pass the examination will get diplomas from both
Zhejiang University and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Hashimoto has indicated that it would be difficult for Japan to

The speculation was triggered by a newspaper report Sunday that
the central bank may raise the rate it charges on loans to
commercial banks from the present record low of 0.5 percent per
annum to 1 percent as early as this month.
</P>

Hashimoto also said the government will compile an austere

<HEADLINE> Israel May Have 600,000 Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel may have as many as
600,000 illegal foreign workers, today's Hebrew daily Yediot
Ahronot quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Batya Carmon, Head of the Interior Ministry's Visa Department,
said that the ministry has no accurate figures on the
number of illegal foreign workers, but it could be six times higher
than the official estimate of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Israel has become a magnet for foreign workers, who either
enter on forged documents or by posing as tourists, Carmon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Eli Suissa said that since there were
no accurate figures, it was irresponsible to throw out
"unrealistic" numbers like 600,000.
</P>
<P>
However, Suissa did agree that illegal foreign workers were a
serious problem, and noted that an inter-ministerial committee had
already been set up to look for ways to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which includes representatives from the
ministries of the Interior, Finance, Internal Security and Labor
and Social Affairs, is supposed to submit its conclusion next
month.
</P>
<P>
State Comptroller Miriam Ben-Porat told the committee that
legislation could help in several areas, saying one possibility
would be to require foreign workers to be paid as much as their
Israeli counterparts, which would eliminate the incentive for
using foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
She explained that another way would be to provide incentives
for contractors who switch from labor-intensive to
technology-intensive methods.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party's member of the Knesset Yossi Katz suggested
that one government body be set up to handle the problem of foreign
workers, saying the current division of labor among four
different ministries creates confusion and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ran Cohen, Chairman of the State Control Committee,
promised that the committee would initiate legislation on foreign
workers, and he suggested a law be enforced to bar anyone from
hiring foreign workers illegally.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 17 (Xinhua)-- The Ugandan government issued a
statement yesterday, blaming the Sudanese government for
supporting Ugandan rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in

"The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Ugandan Defence Ministry said the
LRA rebels' attack on the Sudanese refugee camps in Achol-Pii
near northern Ugandan town of Kitgum was instigated by the
Sudanese government. The July 14 attack led to more than 100
Sudanese refugees killed.
</P>
<P>
It said," It is clear that they (rebels) were executing a
mission on behalf of the Sudanese government which has in the
recent past stepped up its support for the distablization of
northern Uganda with particular emphasis on disorganising and
putting in disarray refugee camps inside Uganda."
</P>
<P>
Achol-Pii was home to 16,000 refugees, out of the total of
210,000 Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda who fled the civil
war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Ugandan government "unreservedly condemns
this act of barbarism by the bandits". "These bandits who always
kill Ugandans have now turned on the Sudanese refugees who
they are killing on bahalf of the Sudan government," the statement
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhangjiagang, a rising port city
in east China's Jiangsu Province, has become a pace-setter for
smaller cities that are expanding their export-oriented economies.
</P>
<P>
Gu Zefen, deputy secretary of the Zhangjiagang City Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party, said that to date, the city has
approved 1,437 foreign-funded companies involving 3.5 billion US
dollars in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
She said that Zhangjiagang ranks first in smaller cities
throughout the country in terms of the number of foreign-funded
enterprises and the amount of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Lying along the Yangtze River, Zhangjiagang is just some 100 km
west of Shanghai, the largest manufacturing and business center in
China.
</P>
<P>
Work has been underway to build a modern port in Zhangjiagang
along the 37-km-long wharf line of the Yangtze River, Gu said. The
city has become an international port on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze, she added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan, US Launch Joint Investment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A trilateral pilot program
aimed at supporting industrial research and development is being
launched by Israel, Jordan and the US, with the goal of
introducing new products and technologies into the market.
</P>
<P>
According to a Jerusalem Post report today, the program, known
as Project Tride for Trilateral Industrial Development, is meant
to demonstrate that public-private partnership can efficiently
generate new jobs, markets, and income for all three countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifa'i pointed out that
this effort is directly connected to the peace process. "Peace
must be cemented with economic realities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rifa'i's US counterpart Martin Indyk said: " It is essential
for all sides to improve material circumstances of people of each
region in order to ensure lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
"This is an example of how the private sector can be the
engine of the peace train, creating a more interactive, integrate
Middle East market," the US ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The three governments will contribute a total of one million
US dollars, or 50 percent of the costs of the program, and the
other half will come from three private companies chosen to
participate in the venture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, professional and technical support will be provided
by the Israel-US Binational Industrial Research and Development
Foundation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the Jordanian side, the project is to be run by the Jordan
Investment Promotion Corp. (JIPC)which became operational last
January following the passing of legislation that entrusts the
corporation with giving direct financial assistance to business
ventures.
</P>
<P>
According to JIPC director-general Taleb Risai, this law was
part of Jordan's continuing effort to improve its economy by
emphasizing government investment rather than relying on foreign
funding.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post revealed that the suggested areas of
trilateral investment include communication technologies, tourism,
 agriculture, education and health.
</P>
<P>
"The complementary between what the advanced Israeli society
has to offer and the reasonably priced cost of production and the
educated workforce we can have to offer can put together a good
package," said Risai.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Doje's My Dearest Workmate" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- On a rainy summer night several
years ago, Samding started home from a business trip and lost his
way in the dark.
</P>
<P>
His horse "Doje" carried him home the next morning, over
mountains and through rivers, uninhabited grasslands and forests.
</P>
<P>
In addition to saving Samding's life, Doje is also the closest
colleague of the 54-year-old magistrate from Chunpa Township in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Doje's my dearest workmate," Samding said. "I spend two-thirds
of time going from village to village every year, and half of the
business time has been spent on the back of Doje."
</P>
<P>
In this Himalaya region, in Lhunze County in Tibet's southern
Shannan prefecture, where the mountains are steep, the rivers roar
fiercely, and roads are unfit for automobile travel, horses are
the best means of transportation for almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
"Because cars and trucks cannot reach us, the work of the local
government and people's lives here is unimaginably difficult,"
Samding said. All of the fertilizer, daily necessities and even
salt has to be carried here either by horse or man, he added.
</P>
<P>
Doje, which means "Buddha's warrior attendant" in the Tibetan
language, would "hint" to his master to dismount when they came to
a swinging wooden bridge. Doje knows to avoid tree branches when
walking through forests, to prevent Samding from being scratched
or hurt.
</P>
<P>
In return, Samding provides the best feed he can get for his
workmate, and combs his horse's hair when they take a rest from
their travels.
</P>
<P>
There are four villages under the jurisdiction of Chunpa, and
all are on mountains. It takes at least one clear day for Samding
to go from one village to another. When the mountains are frozen
with ice, and the temperature hits 20 to 30 degrees below zero,
transportation is even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
But Samding does not complain.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly one thousand residents in the town have lived here
generation to generation this way, and I have no other choice," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To his delight, the central government and the Tibet Autonomous
Region are investing more to build roads in this
sparsely-populated region. He hopes the day will soon come when
"the natives of my Chunpa town can see what trucks and cars are
like."
</P>
<P>
The average annual income of Chunpa residents reached 1,068
yuan (128.67 US dollars) last year, more than the average earning
level in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city Shanghai is
growing -- and so are its people.
</P>
<P>
One in eight of the coastal city's inhabitants are described as
fat. The rate of overweight people has reached 12.6 percent, close
to that of the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey, carried in the local Xinmin
Evening News, among 14,000 people surveyed in the city, 4,895
were adults and 9,093 children, with the rate of fat children
said to be 11.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present the city has a population of 14 million, the largest
among Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that differences in age, sex and education
had an impact on the fatness rate. There are more fat men than fat
women.
</P>
<P>
The rate for adult fat men was 15 percent, while that for women
was 10.68 percent. The rate for fat boys was 14.7 percent,
almost double that of the fat girls at 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the age groups most likely to be
overweight were 7 to 12 years and people in the 60 to 70 age group.
</P>
<P>
Better educated people, especially educated women, were less
likely to be fat, the survey disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Children's Village To Be Set up in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A children's village, home for
street kids and orphans, is to be set up in Zambia's capital of
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed on Tuesday by
Sos-Kinderdorf, an Austrian-based non-governmental organization,
and the Zambian government, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
''Zambia is committed to the improvement of the living
conditions of the youth who are the majority of the population
and very vulnerable,'' said Samuel Miyanda, Zambian Minister of
Sports, Youth and Child Development at the signing ceremony of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, ''The polulation growth rate of our
children has not matched the development and provision of basic
services for the homeless and orphaned children.''
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that with the help of Sos-Kinderdorf,
the plight of Zambian children may change for the better.
</P>
<P>
The children's village will have about 15 houses and schools
once it starts operation after about one year of its
construction, according to Rainer Krugar, Regional Director of
Sos-Kinderdorf.
</P>
<P>
Street children and orphans are a social problem in zambia.
With some 45 percent of its 8.1 million population in urban
areas, street children and jobless youth may be found wandering
here and there in cities and towns in the country.

<HEADLINE> No More Strong Quakes to Hit Tangshan: Seismologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years after a disastrous
earthquake leveled the north China city of Tangshan, seismologists
have told 1.4 million Tangshan residents that the rebuilt city
will be quake-free for the next 300 years.
</P>
<P>
Results from various forecasting systems show no major
earthquakes measuring over 7.0 on the Richter Scale will hit the
city during the three-century period, according to Zhang Jianhua,
director of the Tangshan Seismology Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Any aftershocks that occur in Tangshan in the next 50 years
will not be stronger than 6.0 points on the Richter Scale, Zhang
predicted.
</P>
<P>
"Great energy accumulated underground for more than 1,000 years
has been almost wholly released through that strong quake and more
than 20,000 aftershocks in the past 20 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sudden quake that hit Tangshan in the early hours of July
28, 1976, destroyed the 100-year-old city, killing 240,000 people
and injuring another 160,000.
</P>
<P>
"It will take a very long period of time before such energy on
the same scale stores up again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of deformation and replacement of the earth's crust in
Tangshan indicates that the deformation rate has returned to
normal over recent years, and the number of aftershocks has
dropped.
</P>
<P>
Chinese seismologists have analyzed some 200 earthquakes
measuring over 7.0 points which occured in China in recent years,
and found no evidence that repeated strong quakes hit the same
area over a relatively short period. They held that Tangshan would
be no exception, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with other areas in the world which have the same
geological structure but have not been hit by quakes, Tangshan is
now the safest area," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has effectively conducted methods for medium- and
long-term earthquake forecasts, and inferred the possibility that
a strong quake hits an area over a long period of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang acknowledged that short-term seismological forecasts and
pre-earthquake forecasts still remain a big problem, not only for
Chinese seismologists, but also their counterparts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan adopted standards for resisting quakes stronger than
8.0 points during its reconstruction over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
"These standards can help guarantee life and property safety of
Tangshan residents for at least 300 years," Zhang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The tide has turned in Ningde
region, in the eastern part of China's Fujian province, for the
large yellow croaker.
</P>
<P>
The fish is famous for its delicate flesh, delicious taste and
high protein content.
</P>
<P>
But because of excessive fishing, China's croaker resources
rapidly decreased over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The region started to carry out research on the breeding of the
fish in the early 1980s and in 1985, a breakthrough was made. Now
the province has become a major breeding base for the large yellow
croaker.
</P>
<P>
In the following years the State and the province spent several
million yuan constructing a breeding base in the region, covering
an area of ten hectares
</P>
<P>
At present, the output of large yellow croaker in the region is
150 tons, worth 30 million yuan-worth each year.
</P>
<P>
The region will take advantage of its geographic position to
pace up the development of the sector in the next five years,
according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Under an ambitious plan, by the year 2000, the output of the
fish in the region will reach 400 million yuan-worth.

<HEADLINE> China Is Important to Slovenia, Says Senior FM Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Slovenian Foreign
Ministry official has expressed his satisfaction with the growth
of Slovenia-China relations in the past four years, while calling
for an equal two-way trade that will continue the political
friendship and economic strength shared by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Slovenia and China have been
good and their cooperation fruitful over the entire four years
they were diplomatically linked, said Ignac Golob, state secretary
of the Slovenian Foreign Ministry, during an interview today.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia appreciated and valued China's past recognition of
Slovenia's independence, and from then on the two countries have
had "rather well-developed relations between the levels of
politicians, parliamentarians and diplomacy," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and China, both developing countries, have had no
differences in fundamental issues, and both need domestic
stability and economic development to benefit their people.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also share similar views in regard to
international issues. "We not only want to have a good
relationship with neighbors and get integrated with the European
Union, but also keenly wish to develop relations with the South
countries, China in particular," Golob said.
</P>
<P>
"In this world, China is so important as an international
player that you cannot operate unless you have a good dialogue and
good relationship with China," he added.
</P>
<P>
As for economic ties, the state secretary called for joint
efforts to readdress the status quo of the two-way trade, which he
said is conspicuously in favor of China. Slovenia has exported to
Japan six times more than it has to China, and to Thailand three
times more than to China.
</P>
<P>
This situation "is not in proportion to the general friendship
between the two countries, nor to the economic strength of the two
countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Slovenian Embassy statistics, Slovenia's
imports from China totalled 52 million U.S. dollars last year, as
against the country's exports to China of 5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia has its own technological advantage and advanced
equipment to meet China's needs, Golob said, citing agricultural
technology and food-processing machinery for China's small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
With a political push from both sides, Golob expressed his
belief that Slovenian-Chinese relations will continue to grow, and
closer cooperation in international affairs will be registered.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Measures to Ensure Fishing Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Safety measures for Chinese
fishermen is to be stepped up after hundreds lost their lives
bringing sea food to the tables of families in China.
</P>
<P>
Just under 600 fishermen died and 742 fishing boats sank
during sea tragedies in 1995 alone. The incidents caused direct
losses of 270 billion yuan. The deaths were 38 percent higher than
the previous year and the number of boats lost was virtually
double the 1994 toll.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the sea disasters China has announced it is to
adopt a series of measures to guarantee fishing safety, according
to an official at the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The measures will include education of fishermen in fishery
safety, paying more attention to checks on fishing boats and at
fishery ports, and on the manufacture of fishing boats, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
China will also encourage the owners of the boats to carry out
mutual help, and join insurance services, to set up a complete
fishery social security system.
</P>
<P>
He noted that fishing is a industry of high risk, adding that
the current circumstances of fish safety is not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Most of incidents in which men died, and boats sank, were
caused by natural disasters, collisions with larger boats and
incorrect operation, said the official. He added that fishermen's
poor awareness of security, and an inadequate fishery social
security system also posed problems for the industry.
</P>
<P>
An insurance association of boat owners, set up in 1994, has
played an important role in helping fishermen to deal with
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Last year the association provided 230,000 yuan in compensation
for fishermen.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Flowers have been sent to a unique
violin-shaped grave to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the
death of Nie Er, the composer of the Chinese national anthem.
</P>
<P>
Nie Er, who was born in southwest China's Yunnan Province, died
at the age of 24, on July 17, 1935, near the shores of Kugenuma in
Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, a museum was set up near his grave in Kunming, to
display some of Nie's photos and personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
As a "people's musician," he used his songs to illustrate the
image of the Chinese working class.
</P>
<P>
Nie's musical works were very popular in 1930s and 1940s,
especially during the war of resistance against Japanese
aggressors, which has encouraged numerous Chinese people to fight
for the country's independence and freedom.
</P>
<P>
He left 41 outstanding songs, all with themes that showed him
to be a patriot and a revolutionary fighter.
</P>
<P>
His works include "March of the Volunteers," "The Great Road,"
"New Women" and "The Graduation Song."
</P>
<P>
"March of the Volunteers," the theme song of a patriotic movie
made in 1934 with words by writer Tian Han, has served as China's
national anthem ever since the People's Republic was founded in
1949.

Personal computers are still far from popular in China, while
TV sets are very common in most households: up to 98 percent of
the people in large and medium-sized cities have TVs, which can
play a greater role in forming China's advanced information
network, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 30 percent of China's townships
and villages have set up cable TV networks. The country has about
40 million cable TV network subscribers, and about five million
people will sign up for cable services every year.
</P>

WUHAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province has
given energetic support to the development of export-oriented
township-run enterprises, and turned them into a guiding force for
developing the rural economy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> India to Sell Wheat, Flour to Turkmenistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- India is to sell 20,000 to
30,000 metric tons of wheat and 40,000 metric tons of wheat flour
to Turkmenistan this year, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries made the deal during the visit to India of
Turkmenistan's Deputy Prime Minister Boris O. Shikhmuradov, which
concluded on July 14.
</P>
<P>
This is the fist time that India is to sell foodgrains to
Turkmenistan. The sale will be made on a barter basis.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan earlier bought wheat and wheat flour from Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of wheat exports in 1996-97 is bright with India
expecting another bumper harvest of around 65 million tons of
wheat this year against the target of 60 million tons set by the
Ministry of Agriculture. The Indian government allotted 3 million
tons of wheat in 1995-96 for export.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Economy Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's industrial output
grew 2.3 percent in June from that of May, showing for the first
time the economy is recovering after the lifting of international
sanctions on the country at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the corresponding period of 1995, the industrial
output in the first six months of this year increased 2.2 percent,
according to the official figures released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports in June rose by 21 percent from that of the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
The country exported goods worth of 773 million U.S. dollars in
the first half of 1996 and imports accounted for nearly 1.59
billion U.S. dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Among the imports two-thirds are raw materials required by the
industries, which have ensured the continued growth of the
industrial production.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices and foreign exchange rate had remained stable so
far this year following various measures taken by the government.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices recorded a minor 3.3 percent increase in June
over that of May. The inflation has declined to 50 percent in 1996
from 120.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The recovering trend of economy demonstrates that basic
economic policy the government adopted for this year has borne
fruits.

<HEADLINE> Separate Law for Private Schools Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the Private and Boarding Schools' Organization of
Nepal (PABSON) Tuesday told a press conference here that the
government's decision to incorporate private schools under the
company act early this year was not justifiable.
</P>
<P>
Private schools which were working for the quality of education
in the country should not be brought into the tax net under the
company act, they said.
</P>
<P>
Private schools began to appear in Nepal nearly 20 years ago
and it was estimated that about 2,500 such schools were currently
running in the country especially in urban areas, constituting
more than 30 percent of the country's primary and high school
system.
</P>
<P>
Most Nepali parents who could afford the often exorbitant
school fees send their children to private schools because of the
relatively high educational standard of such schools.
</P>
<P>
Public schools in Nepal provide free education but their
students' academic performance is far behind of that of private
schools.

<HEADLINE> Indian Capital Seriously Polluted: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- With its increasing slums and
polluting industries, the Indian capital New Delhi is plagued by
all sorts of environmental degradation, said a report.
</P>
<P>
Continuous migration of people into Delhi, whose population has
already crossed the 9-million mark, has strained the existing
infrastructure within the city to the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100 slum clusters, 94,000 industrial units, over 2.2
million vehicles and 4,400 metric tons of municipal solid wastes
have thrown the city's environmental health out of gear, said the
report, which was written by A.K. Lal, planning engineer at the
Environmental Planning Division of the Town and Country Planning
Organization here.
</P>
<P>
The most serious problem is air pollution. An estimated 1,280
tons of pollutants are emitted by 2.2 million vehicles and
vehicular pollution accounts for more than two-thirds of Delhi's
total air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The next major contributor to the city's air pollution is the
industries, with the Central Pollution Control Board having
already identified five major and 22,000 significantly polluting
industries in the capital, the report further said.
</P>
<P>
Delhi is facing formidable problems of water pollution and
sewage disposal too. The river Yamuna picks up nearly 1,800
million liters daily of domestic and industrial waste waters,
while only three-quarters of the city are covered by sewage
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the city's problems are the huge piles of municipal
solid wastes containing paper, plastic, glass, metals and
vegetables, fly ash from thermal power plants, hazardous wastes
from hospitals and nursing homes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of Thai wildlife
environmentalists have condemned the killing of bears by five
South Korean tourists.
</P>
<P>
In a letter written to the South Korean embassy here on
Tuesday, the wildlife protection activists denounced
bear-slaughtering and asked the South Korean government to
initiate a public relations campaign against the senseless belief
that bear body parts have magical medicinal property.
</P>
<P>
The belief has led to special organized tours to Thailand for
Korean wild meat connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
Koreans are the biggest group who takes part in consuming bear
parts, including paws, meat and bile, in Thailand, according to
Dr. Rangsarit Kanchanawanich, from the Hornbill Research
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Asiatic black bear and the Malaya Sun bear were formerly
widely found in Asia but have been hunted to near extinction and
both are now endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Last week in Ayutthaya province, central Thailand, police found
six bear carcasses, with six cut-off heads and 24 paws, in a
vehicle and arrested five South Korean tourists suspected to be
involved in the slaughtering of the bears.
</P>
<P>
Two Thai men who allegedly killed the animals for the South
Koreans were also arrested.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Yeltsin-Gore Meeting Better Late Than Never  (by Sheng Shiliang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A sudden change of schedule and a
strategic declination of comment somewhat mystified the meeting
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. Vice-president Al
Gore, which took place one day behind schedule in a sanatorium
instead of the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first between a high-ranking foreign visitor
and Yeltsin after his reelection on July 3, was described by
Russian commentators as a "reconnaisance" on the part of the
visitors and a "show-off" on the part of the hosts.
</P>
<P>
But it turned out neither as tentative nor as showy as so
termed by local pundits, in that it had touched upon such tough
topics as Chechnya, START II, NATO enlargement and still more
U.S. investment.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been pressing Moscow to reach a peaceful
settlement in Chechnya where more than 30,000 people have been
killed since Russia sent troops there in December 1994 to crush a
separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
But Gore termed as confidential his talks with Yeltsin on the
breakaway republic at a post-meeting press conference though he
said that he had told Yeltsin the Chechen crisis can only be
solved through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Though U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and Russian Acting
Defense Minister Mikhail Kolesnikov said that their START II talks
had reached a comprehensive understanding, the Russian side
insisted that the Americans should pronounce in the first place
and in concrete terms it will abide by the 1972 anti-ballistic
missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-U.S. deadlock concerning the issue of NATO
enlargement seemed not ready to be broken as Gore told the press
that there will be no surprise at all in the approach of either
side.
</P>
<P>
Gore's two-day visit, part and parcel of the seventh session of
the economic, scientific and technological cooperation between the
Russian and U.S. governments, did bear some fruit as a total of 27
documents were signed, including a cooperation memorendum
concerning disaster forecast and relief about industrial and
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also voiced intention to jointly reduce the
emission of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
Whatelse was made clear was Yeltsin's aspiration to solicit
more foreign investment, especially from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president told the U.S. vice-president that his
country is now in urgent need of investment while Gore promised
Yeltsin that his government will urge individual Americans to
invest directly in Russia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investment in Russia has amounted to 2.5 billion dollars,
accounting for one third of the foreign investment total. The
United States invested 360 million dollars in the first half of
this year, representing 41 percent of the new investment sum.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin described the current conditions for the development
of bilateral relations as more favorable than ever before,
U.S. entrepreneurs are still afraid of investing their money in
Russia, at least in the energy industry which is levying as many
as 23 types of tax with the total tax rate reaching 50 to 60
percent.

</P>
<P>
Along with Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia

</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil has a 320 million U.S dollars trade deficit

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Concerned About Foreign Poaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign fishing fleets have been
poaching in the Sri Lankan waters and catch 60,000 to 70,000 tons
of fish from the Indian Ocean annually, according to official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
National Aquatic Resources Agency Chairman M. H. Gunawardene
was quoted as saying that high-powered fishing boats from
developed countries enter the coastal waters of Sri Lanka
illegally but prevention is difficult since Sri Lanka does not
have the required surveillance equipment.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a large number of unlicensed fishing
fleets enter the Sri Lankan waters and exploit fishing resources.
Even when detected they are able to get away to the open seas
quickly as they use high-powered boats.
</P>
<P>
For Sri Lanka, exploring the offshore and deep sea fishing
resources is an expensive procedure since high-powered equipment
is necessary to yield good results.
</P>
<P>
The other problem faced by the fishermen is that most of the
resources found in the deep sea are migratory so there is a lot of
competition, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka consumes about 250,000 tons of fish annually, out of
which 70 percent is obtained from the sea while the rest is from
lagoons, rivers and farms.

<HEADLINE> State Views Leasing as Lucrative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
facilitate the development of financial leasing, an important form
of introducing foreign capital, today's China Daily quoted a
senior foreign trade official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Financial leasing has become a very important channel for
utilizing overseas funds and renovating State-owned enterprises,"
Sun Zhenyu. vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation said at the '96 meeting of the Leasing Commission of
the China Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment.
</P>
<P>
"Although still and infant today, the industry is developing
with good potential," he said.
</P>
<P>
Financial leasing is where a company buys products at the
request of a customer, and then leases the products to the
customer for a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
The practice is regarded as the third largest method of
introducing overseas funds, following direct overseas
investment and overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, China has approved more than 30 Sino-foreign
leasing companies, introducing five billion US dollars of overseas
capital, supporting renovation of more than 4,300 enterprises, Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, these companies bought and leased equipment
worth 460 million US dollars for 220 projects.
</P>
<P>
And around 41 percent of the capital was injected into
telecommunications, transportation and energy, and 21 percent was
used by the chemical and building material industries.

in a bank scandal, the banking sector here has threatened to stop
all operations from today, the local press said.
</P>
<P>
The Special Police Department Tuesday arrested five Nepal Arab
Bank staff allegedly involved in the recently exposed case of a
series of bank frauds in which a huge amount foreign currency was
deflected.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about 36 million US dollars worth of

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Reduces Poverty Rate By 35 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia managed to reduce
its poverty rate from 49 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 1993, a
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Human Development Report 1996, published by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) and available here today, said
this was achieved through Malaysia's redistribution of assets as
well as the utilization of both skill and labor intensive
employment.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the UNDP acknowledged Malaysia's
investments in human capital mainly through education and access
to social services had paid big dividends.
</P>
<P>
This created a "virtuous circle" in which worker productivity
has risen and triggered an increase in real wages, which in turn
attracted more investments in human capital, the report analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which boosted its income by over 7 percent annually
over the past 35 years, had also raised the life expectancy of its
people from 53 years to 71 through investment in basic health
facilities, and enrolled almost every child in primary school by
1993.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes Some Countries' Activities in Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today criticized some countries' activities in former
Yugoslavia as "imprudent", which he said could hamper the
implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He made the criticism at a news conference after meeting his
Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini, who arrived earlier today for a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that these obstacles should be removed as soon as
possible. But he did not indicate which countries his criticism
was directed at.
</P>
<P>
He warned that their activities will add obstacles to the
implementation of the peace accord and render a free election in
Bosnia questionable.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in the Middle East after the Israeli
election, Primakov said the international community should try its
best to prevent "a long pause" in the peace process, because such
a pause could result in extremist actions by both sides of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Lamberto Dini expressed his satisfaction with the economic
relations between Italy and Russia. The two countries have more
than 700 joint ventures with a total investment of 150 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Russia would strengthen dialogues with Italy and NATO,
and said Italy is looking forward to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's visit.

Tuesday asked the presidential palace to justify the creation of

The court, after a full deliberation, asked the palace to
comment in 10 days on a petition that challenged the
constitutionality of the council.
</P>
<P>
However, the high court refused to issue a temporary
restraining order to stop the implementation of an agreement
creating the council, which was reached by the government and the

The petition said the executive branch was acting beyond its

the creation of the council.

At the same day, Philippine President Fidel Ramos stepped up
his efforts in the peace process, claiming Nur Misuari, the Moro
rebel leader, can head both the council and the autonomous region
in Muslim Mindanao.
</P>

He also called on Jose Maria Sison, chairman of the Communist

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hungary's Economy Recovers Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's economy has shown signs
of prosperity with its political situation being stable, and a
number of monetary and economic indexes almost reaching the
average levels of the European Union members, Prime Minister Horn
Gyula has said.
</P>
<P>
It is evident that Hungary's international economic partners
have resumed confidence in it, as shown by a credit agreement with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and its participation in
the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
Gyula said when evaluating the government's work.
</P>
<P>
Gyula has been heading the coalition government since July
1994, when the Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats
won a majority in the National Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the IMF approved a credit of 387 million
U.S. dollars to back the country's economic program through the
end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Also in March, the country was accepted as the 27th member of
the OECD, becoming the second in Central and East European
countries to have joined the club following the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The most successful part of the government's work is in its
foreign policy and privatization program, Gyula said, claiming
that the country's economic reform has tided over the most
difficult period.
</P>
<P>
The Gyula government adopted an austerity economic policy in
early 1995, eight months after he assumed the premiership, which
has produced positive results.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Hungary absorbed 4.5 billion dollars in foreign
investment, mostly going to privatizing the energy sector, while
its gross domestic production (GDP) increased by 1.5 percent, with
the industrial output rising 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, the country attracted
0.514 billion dollars in foreign investment, 38 percent up from
that of the same period last year, bringing the total foreign
investment in the country to 13 billion dollars since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The country had an unfavorable foreign trade balance of 2.6
billion U.S. dollars last year, while its current international
payments suffered a deficit of 2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, during the first four months of this year, the deficit
of its current international payments account dropped 1 billion
dollars to 0.748 billion dollars compared with the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's exports rose 5.2 percent to 5 billion dollars in the
first five months this year, and its imports increased 3.3 percent
to 6.2 billion dollars, resulting in a trade deficit of 1.2
billion dollars, 0.5 billion dollars less than that of the
corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government had a budget deficit of 92 billion
forints (about 0.6 billion dollars), a drop of 47.4 percent from
the five-month period last year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of April this year, Hungary enjoyed a foreign
exchange reserve of 9.4 billion dollars after repaying 2.7 billion
dollars of its foreign debt, which fell to 28.7 billion dollars,
9.4 percent less than that at the end of April last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the macro-economic situation has greatly improved, the
ruling Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats admit
that ordinary citizens still can't feel the improvement of their
daily life, with an average monthly income of 30,000 forints (196
dollars).
</P>
<P>
For those retired, they get only about 10,000 forints (65
dollars) a month, while the lowest monthly living expenses are
12,900 forints (84 dollars), according to the Central Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
At present, 490,000 people, or 10.7 percent, of the country's
workforce, are jobless.
</P>
<P>
While the government hailed its achievements over the past two
years, the country's opposition parties accused the government of
exaggerating, attacked its economic and social welfare policies,
and claimed residents' health worsening and living standards
dropping.
</P>
<P>
Torgyan Jozsef, chairman of the opposition Small Holder's
Party, told local press recently that the government had not laid
a foundation for its social and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
A report from Hungary's Kopint-Datorg economic research company
estimated that the country would have an international payments
deficit of 2-2.5 billion dollars this year, with the inflation
rate standing at 24-25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's budget deficit would account for 4-5 percent
of the GDP, and the economy would rise by only 1-1.45 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's economic growth lagged behind other East European
countries, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, in terms of
industrial production and inflation, it added.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denies Rumours of Mass Summer Exodus to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today denied speculation
it is planning to allow another mass exodus of Cubans to the
United States this summer and said it continued to abide by the
1994 bilateral immigration agreement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Foreign Ministry accused Cuban anti-Castro exiles
living in Miami of stirring up rumours of an exodus to create
tensions and a climate of greater hostility towards Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In a communique in the official newspaper Granma, the ministry
accused the activists of waging a campaign of hostility toward the
island, saying "the counter-revolutionary mafia in Miami is trying
-- in every possible way -- to have these agreements violated."
</P>
<P>
It said, "Cuba has been consistent with the policy of safe,
ordered and legal emigration, in contrast with the irresponsible
position taken by those who want to promote and use illegal
emigration as a political, subversive and destabilizing tool"
against the island.
</P>
<P>
A total of 529 illegal emigrants have been returned to Cuba in
compliance with the agreement with the United States and other
Caribbean countries, 369 of whom were handed over by U.S.
authorities, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Bahamas, Grand Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Belize and other
Caribbean countries have turned over 160 illegal emigrants who
were trying to use their territories as a transit point to
continue their journey to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, some 30,000 Cubans emigrated after the
government announced it was allowing anyone who wanted to leave
the country. Most ended up in the United States.

MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
agreed in its talks with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
to pay for the property damage at the height of the war in
Mindanao from the late 1960s to 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today the government and the MNLF
panels also agreed that firearms belonging to the MNLF will be
documented but will be returned to their owners.
</P>
<P>
A report said these are just two of the so-called 123 points of
agreements reached at the 8th government-MNLF meeting held in
Davao last month.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos has ordered the release of
these agreements on Tuesday, saying there was nothing "secret"
between the government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
Abet Iribani, secretary general of the MNLF secretariat, denied
there is such a thing as "war damage" compensation. But at the
same time, he admitted both parties had agreed that there will be
a rehabilitation of the areas damaged during the war.

<HEADLINE> Rare Wild Animals Discovered in Mt.Kunlun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A large number of rare wild animals
have been spotted by a wild animal inspection team in the central
part of Kunlun Mountain.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey made by the Xinjiang wild animal scientific
inspection team in Qiemo showed that 67 kinds of wild vertebrate
animals live in the 30,000-square-kilometer Kunlun Mountain areas
in the county. The mountain is in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The animals include 23 species of wild beasts and 44 types of
birds, which often move in groups.
</P>
<P>
Of those wild animals, six species, including wild asses, wild
yaks, Tibetan antelopes and snow leopards, have been given
first-priority state protection. Another eight kinds, including
argali sheep, pseudois nayaurs and brown bears are on the list for
second-priority state protection.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team believed that about 55,000 Tibetan
antelopes, about 10,000 wild asses and 6,600 wild yaks are living
in Qiemo County.
</P>
<P>
However, the team could not give the total number of wild
animals in the central part of Kunlun Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Scientists held that the central part of Kunlun Mountain is of
great value for scientific research and tourism, and it could
become China's second wild animal nature reserve in the plateau,
after the Altun Mountain Nature Reserve in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Protect Its Economic Interests in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia will act to protect its
interests in Cuba if they are damaged by U.S. legislation aimed at
discouraging foreign investment in the Caribbean island, the
foreign ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to the U.S. Helms-Burton Act which
punishes foreign companies doing business in Cuba, the ministry's
spokesman Vladimir Andrev said Russia had the right to protect its
economic interests in Cuba and would take measures if they were
damaged due to the implementation of the law aimed at tightening
the U.S.' long-standing embargo against the communist country.
</P>
<P>
The comments came in the wake of a meeting between Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and United States'
Vice-President Al Gore in Moscow today. The two signed a raft of
27 documents on economic and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the documents show the cooperation between
Russia and the United States is "becoming increasingly smooth and
rich in substance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress passed the Helms-Burton Act, named after its
sponsors, to pressure Cuba into economic and political
reform. U.S. President Bill Clinton signed it into law in March
after Cuba shot down two civilian planes it claimed invaded its
airspace, killing the four Cuban-Americans on board.
</P>
<P>
The law allows lawsuits to be filed in U.S. courts against
foreign firms that buy or sell the properties of U.S. citizens
seized by the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro after the
1959 Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
However, today President Clinton announced he was freezing the
implementation of this provision in the law for six months in what
is seen as a response to protests and threats of retaliation by
its major trading allies such as Canada and European countries.

SHANGHAI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade of Shanghai's
overseas-funded enterprises in the first six months of this year
has, for the first time, topped half of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Their imports and exports amounted to 6.083 billion US dollars
in the January-June period, up 39 percent over the same period
last year, and accounted for 55.1 percent of the city's total
foreign trade volume.

Included were imports of 3.943 billion US dollars, up 36.3
percent, and exports of 2.14 billion US dollars, up 44.1 percent.
</P>

Experts here attributed the increase in overseas-funded
enterprises' imports and exports to the influence of China's
regulation of tax exemption and reduction, and the implementation
of the export tax refund system.

<P>
At present, about 10,000 out of more than 14,000

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Arrives in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Richard Holbrooke, who brokered
the Dayton peace accord which ended the Bosnian war, arrived here
today in a bid to resolve the controversy over Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic's refusal to quit the political scene.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, a former American assistant secretary of state and
now a New York investment banker, returned to the Balkans at the
request of the Clinton adminisration.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, he said, "We're here because we're not satisfied
with the degree of compliance on the part of the parties in the
region with the Dayton (peace) agreement, above all with attitudes
of non-compliance by the Bosnian Serbs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke later met Bosnian President Aljia Izetbegovic,
Commander of the NATO-led Implementation Force(IFOR) Admiral
Leighton Smith and other officials involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said after the meeting that although the military
aspects of the Dayton peace agreement have been successful, the
implementation of the political and civilian aspects has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslim side, led by Izetbegovic, has threatened to
boycott September's Bosnia-wide elections if Karadzic remains as
head of the Serb ruling party, the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS).
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Karadzic, as an indicted war
criminal, is not allowed to hold any public office.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's cling to power has delayed the election campaign
which is being organized by the Organization of Cooperation and
Security In Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to American press reports, the main purpose of
Holbrooke's current mission is to force Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic into delivering his promise of removing Karadzic from
power.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will meet Milosevic in Belgrade on Wednesday and go
to Zagreb for talks with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Spain Welcomes Clinton's Freeze on Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Spain today welcomed U.S. President
Bill Clinton's decision to impose a six-month moratorium on
lawsuits against foreign companies that do business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called Title III provision of the Helms-Burton
Act, lawsuits could be filed in U.S. courts against foreign
companies that buy or sell U.S. properties confiscated by the
Cuban communist government after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton, under pressure from major trading allies such as
Canada and the European Union which had threatened retaliation
against U.S. companies, today decided to postpone until next year
the right of U.S. nationals to file lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said Clinton's decision
is a "positive reaction" to the position of the European Union
(EU) and will allow the countries involved to continue
negotiations with Washington so as to avert a conflict that will
most likely harm both sides.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister expressed the hope that a satisfactory
solution can be found during the six month moratorium.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision came after EU foreign ministers agreed Monday
on retaliatory measures that include taking the dispute to the
World Trade Organization, introducing legislation to allow EU
companies to counter-sue the U.S., establishing a watch list of
U.S. companies filing court actions against EU companies and
requiring visas for U.S. businessmen visiting EU states.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said the 15 member
countries of the EU were also considering individual responses to the
the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
Spain, which has heavy investments in Cuba, has expressed strong
opposition since the inception of the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Even before the EU's announcement of counter measures,
Madrid said it would retaliate against U.S. companies in Spain
if the law was implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton bill, passed by the U.S. Congress and signed
into law by Clinton in March, is aimed at tightening its
long-standing economic embargo against Cuba and was seen as a
retaliation for Cuba's downing of two civilian U.S. planes in
March in which four Cuban-Americans were killed.
</P>
<P>
But the law has provoked worldwide criticism, especially from
Europe, Canada and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Trade Deficit Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will have to cough
up about 5 billion US dollars to pay off a widening trade deficit
as imports in the first five months this year exceeded exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office, the country
exported 7.79 billion US dollars worth of goods and services in
the period. Though it was a 19.8 percent increase from the
year-ago level, it was offset by a 28.4 percent growth in imports.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in a trade deficit of about 5 billion US dollars,
44.4 percent higher than the 3.5 billion US dollar deficit
recorded in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Shoring up State-owned firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC), one of
China's leading financial institutions, extended loans of 1.23
billion US dollars in the second quarter of this year to support
300 major state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the specialized bank, whose key functions
are to raise, utilize, accumulate and manage foreign exchange
funds, had already channelled 4.5 billion yuan (about 500 million
dollars) into state-owned firms, the "Economic Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The recipients include large enterprises such as Air China, the
Pingshuo Coal Mine in Shanxi Province and the Qingdao Beer Brewery
in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said the BOC will also offer loans to beef up
development of giant conglomerates as the Daqing Oilfield, the
No.1 Automobile Corp., Qilu Petrochemicals, and the Yangtze
Ethylene Corp.
</P>
<P>
The BOC is not alone in flexing its lending arm to state-owned
firms, which are the backbone of the national economy. Other
financial institutions in China, including the State Development
Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the
Construction Bank of China, are increasing loans to shore up the
state firms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Recommends Troop Withdrawal From Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress has
recommended that the U.S. Defense Department shut down the
Palmerola base in Honduras because it is no longer needed for the
new strategic interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
A report from the U.S. Congressional General Accounting Office
(GAO) said that with the military conflicts solved and the
political stability improving in Central America, the interest of
the United States has shifted to the economic improvement and
democratic consolidation.
</P>
<P>
The GAO recommends that U.S. military presence at the Palmerola
Air Base which has 500 officers and soldiers and 11 helicopters be
reduced to a level necessary to back up anti-drug activities.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests that the commissioner of U.S. services, the
administrators of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the
Defense and State Departments and the National Drug Control Office
work out a plan to conduct anti-drug operations without the
participation of the military personnel in Palmerola.
</P>
<P>
The GAO also suggests that the Defense Department pull out all
500 U.S. servicemen from the base.
</P>
<P>
One Chinook and two Black Hawk helicopters would be enough for
the anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
The report said the costs at the Palmerola base which set up in
1982 have exceeded the benefits and the funds could be used for
the other needs of the U.S. armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is trying to save 150 million U.S. dollars
in the next five years by closing the base which costs 30 million
dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Xiaolangdi Villagers' Past and Today (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Until recently, few parents in
Xiaolangdi would allow their daughters to marry men from the
impoverished mountain village, where people lived in hundreds of
cave dwellings and thatched shacks.
</P>
<P>
But a new, large-scale water project brought prosperity to the
village, and now dozens of thirtysomething bachelors have tied the
knot, and women from other villages are swarming there to find
husbands.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, the largest water
conservation effort along the Yellow River, is under construction
in and around the old Xiaolangdi Village in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The 11-year project is expected to be completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi villagers are the first group of people to be
resettled because of the water conservancy program. To make way
for the massive hydro-electric project, second only to China's
Three Gorges Project, more than 1,000 villagers had to leave their
ancestral homeland.
</P>
<P>
They resettled in a place 10 kilometers away, and now live in
rows of two-story buildings. The new village kept its former name,
but the outlook of Xiaolangdi is quite different.
</P>
<P>
The elderly are unaccustomed to the orderly buildings, equipped
with water, heating and gas facilities.
</P>
<P>
A new dancing hall that can hold 100 people often has a full
house at night. Villagers have sauna rooms as well as bathrooms.
Most water closets are marked with the letters W.C.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, when we held a meeting, we stood at the top of
hills and sent messages to each other by shouting," recalled Jing
Daomin, the village chief. "Now our village has 30
program-controlled telephone sets."
</P>
<P>
Pupils used to walk two kilometers to get to school: now it's
less than 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
More than 1000 villagers were living in over 10 valleys that
covered nearly six square kilometers on the mountain. Now, they
are together in a 0.25-sq-km new village.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Finally Meets Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin met
U.S. Vice President Al Gore today at a health resort outside
Moscow where he is taking a two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
The talks took place amid the latest round of speculation about
Yeltsin's health, which was further fueled by his abrupt
last-minute cancellation of a meeting with Gore on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that Yeltsin, who was
re-elected president for a new four-year term on July 3, admitted
he felt tired after a three-and-half-month election campaign which
took him to 30 regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
After a 45-minute meeting with Yeltsin, Gore said that the
Russian president seemed to be in good health, strong and relaxed.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed the conflict in Russia's rebel republic of
Chechnya, disarmament and other bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
On Chechnya, where separatist rebels have been fighting Russian
government troops for nearly two years, Yeltsin told Gore that any
provocation from the rebels must be crushed. But he said peace
could only be achieved through negotiation with the separatists
and that remains the main thrust of Russia's Chechnya policy.
</P>
<P>
On the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty banning nuclear testing
which is currently being negotiated by 61 countries, Yeltsin
pledged that Russia would work towards an early agreement on the
treaty by persuading the so far reluctant parties to act
positively in the negotiations which resume later this month.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said that his country must approve the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) on strategic ballistic
missile reduction signed by the U.S. and Russia in 1993 as soon as
possible, since the U.S. side has already done so.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia's economic reforms have entered their third
stage, a stage for investment. He will do whatever possible to
attract foreign investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his hope that efforts will be made to strengthen
the equal and mutually beneficial partnership between Russia and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO to Help China Stamp Out Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 78 million rural people
have received technical training and 4.76 million illiterates have
become literate so far, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that China now has 150 million illiterates above
age the age of 15, of which 35 million are young and middle-aged
people. Most of the illiterates live in rural and underdeveloped
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the UNESCO International Research and
Training Center for Rural Education will make more efforts to
promote literacy and adult education in rural areas to speed up
China's goal of eliminating young and middle-aged illiteracy by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the center under the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization will set up a
network gathering advanced farming techniques and those from
agricultural colleges nationwide. Leaders at provincial, city and
county levels will be regularly informed of the latest farming
techniques.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed to promote international co-operation in exploring
human resources in China's rural areas, exchange rural education
experiences of different countries and accelerate the literacy and
adult education in the country's rural areas.

The village has even built satellite ground stations and a
closed-circuit TV system, and is trying to broadcast village news.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government set aside 12 million yuan (about 1.5
million US dollars) for displacement of the Xiaolangdi villagers.
</P>
<P>
"Our ancestral homes are situated at the bottom of the dam,"
Jing said. "You see, there is lots of foreign equipment."
</P>
<P>
Many villagers have been hired by foreign contractors at the
project's construction site.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, Chinese and Soviet experts made the first geological
prospecting at Xiaolangdi. In September of 1990, the preliminary
preparations for Xiaolangdi project started.
</P>
<P>
"After we moved here, we have less farmland and have built
factories," Jing said. The village has offered 240 hectares of
land to be used for the project construction.
</P>
<P>
"Our lives depend on the project," said villager Li Zhenhe.
</P>
<P>
Li was the owner of a wood processing mill in the former
village. After resettling, he took up a new trade -- managing an
engineering company to serve the construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Li, who moved to the village at 7 a.m on August 31, 1994, was
the first person from his village to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
The village has also established the Xiaolangdi Group, which
has 10 subsidiary companies that are trying to get the
"Xiaolangdi" trademark registered.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new village has won support from the World
Bank, whose officials have visited ten times.
</P>
<P>
James David Wolfensohn, president of the bank, inspected the
village last September. After seeing the farmers' new homes, and
the Spring Bud Kindergarten and Spring Bud Primary School, the
president wrote a congratulatory message for the village.

<HEADLINE> More Women Participate in Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A record number of over 3,700 women
athletes are expected to compete in the Atlanta Olympic Games, a
demonstration of the fast growing evolvement of women in various
sports activities.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the organizing committee of the
Atlanta Games, over 3,700 women athletes will compete in 21 of the
games' 26 sports, from athletics to judo and from table tennis to
soccer.
</P>
<P>
The American team has the largest number of women athletes.
Among their 660 athletes, 280 are women. The Chinese team came
with the second largest number of women athletes -- 200 of them.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team has the highest percentage of women athletes,
with female athletes nearly twice the number of male athletes.
And in the U.S. team, the number of male athletes is more than
double the number of female athletes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to China and the United States, there are six more
nations who are also sending over 100 women athletes to the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
The German team has 193 female athletes, followed by the
Canadian team with 155 female athletes and the Japanese team, with
150. The Australians, French and Britons are also sending over 100
female athletes each to the games.
</P>
<P>
Women were not allowed into the competitions in the first
Modern Olympic Games a century ago. But the rule did not stop two
Greek women from unofficially running the marathon race. It was
not untill 1990 that women joined in the Olympic games. That year
19 female athletes officially competed in the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
Since then more and more women got involved in the games and
the number of sports that opened to women also increased. In
1992, table tennis and badminton entered the games.
</P>
<P>
This year, new to the Olympic Program for women are the sports
of football and softball, the disciplines of mountain bike in
cycling and beach volleyball in volleyball and eight other events
in six displines, like 5,000 meter race and tripple jump in
athletics.
</P>
<P>
With more and more new sports opened to women, the number of
female athletes competing in future Olympic games is bound to
further increase.

KIEV, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has landed a 650 million
U.S.-dollar deal to supply Pakistan with 300 T-80UD tanks, the
Independent News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will also train Pakistani personnel to drive and

<P>
The deal could signal the start of expanded military
cooperation between Ukraine and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's defense budget this year amounts to 4.2 billion
dollars, about a third of its federal budget. This deal will add
to the already wide range of tanks used by the Pakistani army.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, with a solid military and industrial base, has made
the production and export of conventional weapons one of its main
priorities in economic development. Weapons exporting is a big
foreign currency earner, which Ukraine hopes can help solve its
current financial problems.

delegation to the Atlanta Games will try to take home at lease
five gold medals, two more than they did four years ago at the
Barcelona Games, head of the Japanese delegation said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hironoshin Furuhashi, president of the Japanese Olympic
Committee, said the Japanese Olympic team, also including 189
officials, was the largest sports delegation Japan had ever sent
abroad.

22 medals, including three gold, eight silver and 11 bronze
medals.

In women's judo, Ryoko Tamura is the top favorite, who won both
1993 and 1995 world championships. Wrestler Hiroshi Kado will
also have a shot at the medal.
</P>
<P>
Furuhashi said about 100 Japanese athletes have arrived at the
Olympic Village. Other athletes are either still training at home
or in other parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said eight Japanese swimmers are now doing high altitude
training in Arizona, the United States, because Japan dosen't have
such training camps that could also prepare the athletes for the
heat in Atlanta. He said his marathon runners are training on a
northern island in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tight security at Olympic venues here, including
the Olympic Village, Furuhashi said his athletes were not
concerned about their safety in Atlanta at all. "They are only
worry about that Atlanta's heat and humidity might prevent them
from doing their best during the Olympic games," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Software Development
Company, one of China's major computer software distributors, has
put laser hologram labels on all software products in its chain
stores.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to keep counterfeit software out of the market
and strengthen after-sales services for customers.
</P>
<P>
About 300 computer software-developing companies have joint the
move, promising quality guarantee and upgrade service for their
customers.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 3,000 kinds of software being sold in 46 major
Chinese cities have been marked with the laser hologram labels.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government is stepping up its crackdown on
illegal software products, experts said, more and more Chinese are
becoming aware of the importance of intellectual property rights
protection, and the demand for legal software products is on the
rise.

<HEADLINE> China May Shock World Again in Olympic Athletics (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to bounce a big
leap in the track and field if everything goes right on the
course, predicted the Chinese athletics team leader here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopefully to win two or three gold medals in the
women's long distance running and walk events plus several minor
medals at Olympics," said Shang Xiutang this afternoon, 24 hours
after the 24-member Chinese track and field team flew in here.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China also has medal hopes in the women's
shotput, javenlin, discus and marathon as well as in the men's
long jump and walk events.
</P>
<P>
"At least we can pin our medal hopes on eight to ten events.
That would put us in a situation much better than at the previous
Games and last year's world championships," Shang added.
</P>
<P>
China won one gold and one bronze medals through the women's
10-kilometer walk, and one silver from the women's shotput at the
previous Olympics in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese athletes became a world power in the following year
when Wang Junxia and other "Ma Family Army" runners shocked the
world at the Stuttgart world championships by winning four golds.
More than a dozen Chinese athletes elbowed their ways into the
world top three at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
But with the collapse of the "Ma Family Army", China went home
almost empty-handed from the Goteborg Worlds last year except for
a mere silver medal through Olympic silver medalist Huang Zhihong
in the women's shotput.
</P>
<P>
This year, the re-emergence of Wang Junxia and a number of good
performances at China's Olympic trials lit the hopes of Chinese
athletics.
</P>
<P>
Shang singled out Wang Junxia as the woman to beat both in the
5,000 and 10,000 meters at the upcoming Atlanta Olympics. Wang,
the world record holder for the 3,000 and 10,000 meters, recovered
her brilliant form this season by chalking up the year's fastest
time of the 25-lap event last May in the Nanjing trials. Her
31:01.76 is nearly three seconds faster than the gold winning run
of Portugal's Fernanda Ribeiro at the world championships last
year.
</P>
<P>
Since the 10,000m was not featured among the European circuit
this season, it is hard to say how fast Ribeiro and Olympic
champion Deratu Tulu of Ethiopia are able to run.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of other runners," Shang said. "Wang is
surely able to run a sub-31-minute time here, and I don't think
anyone else can match her."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Wang went to a training camp on the Duoba
Plateau last June and had a very satisfactory training under the
guide of her new coach Mao Dezhen. The 23-year-old girl shunned
from every social function and entertainment, concentrating on
training.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang may meet some challenges in the 5,000 meters in
which world record holder Ribeiro and world champion Sonia
O'Sullivan of Ireland are two hard nuts for her to crack.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Oil Revenue to Rise in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela is likely to see the
highest oil revenue since 1982 this year, the Venezuela
State-Owned Petroleum Company (PDVSA) says in its annual report
today.
</P>
<P>
The report says the country will be able to earn 15-16 billion
dollars from petroleum in 1996, 0.5 percent up from last year's
15.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
PDVSA President Luis Giusti estimated that oil revenue for
Venezuela could reach 16 billion dollars this year, depending on
how prices behave in the international market.
</P>
<P>
If his estimate turns out to be true, Venezuela will receive
its highest annual petroleum revenue since 1982 when it earned
15.581 billion dollars in the midst of a general hike in
international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The president also estimated that Venezuela will be able to
earn 20 billion dollars in hard currency this year, including
about 4.5 billion dollars from other sources.
</P>
<P>
"The country does not have any problem with its balance of
payments," he said in reference to the country's general economic
situation.

World Cup winner Gao Hongmiao is a favourite to win the women's
10-kilometer walk. The 22-year-old Chinese led the way toward
victory at the world championships last year, but with two
kilometers to go, she was disqualified with a red card.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Gao won't make that error again this time. Now, her
technique has improved a lot," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese walker Wang Yan, winner of the 1993 World Cup,
also improved her personal best by eight seconds this year. She
will team up with Gao to fight against Larisa Ramazanova and Irina
Stankina, both from Russia.
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Han Yongnian revealed that Ren Xiujuan is
likely to turn out a "dark horse" in the women's marathon. Ren,
who ran the year's second fastest time of the 10,000 meters last
May, is the national marathon winner over the past two years. Her
best time last year was 2 hours and 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, Ren is the best marathoner in the world. She is
able to beat any runners if she can follow the leader up to the
30-kilometer point. That is why we let her run marathon instead of
10,000 meters," Han explained.
</P>
<P>
In the women's shotput, Olympic runner-up Huang Zhihong and
Asian record holder Li Meisu should have the strength to net a
medal. The gold is most likely to be won by German's world
champion Astrid Kumbernuss.
</P>
<P>
Li Lei, a 23-year-old girl who flung the javelin to a 68-plus
distance this May, is ranking second in the world this season, but
she has to prove that big throw is not a fluke.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yongsheng and Li Zewen, last year's World Cup winners in
the men's 50km and 20km walk events, are two medal hopefuls for
the Chinese men. Asian record holder Huang Geng also has a chance
to shoot a medal in the men's long jump.
</P>
<P>
In order to get rid of the rumors that Chinese athletes are
taking drugs, the Chinese Athletics Association has beefed up the
doping tests on its star athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Wang has received eight tests including six flying checks this
season," Han said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer
today hinted that his bank may further cut the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank lowered the discount rate, the floor for
short-term intereat rates, and the Lombard emergency financing
rate for banks by half a percentage point each to 2.50 percent and
4.50 percent in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer said that next Thursday the central bank board will
examine whether the present levels of interest rates are
suitable. The board will meet for the last time before a
four-week summer break.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer has repeatedly stressed that the possibility of a
further rate cut could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The central banker said, however, that the Bundesbank will try
to keep the lending rate level "stable for as long as possible or
to even ease it further provided that the monetary conditions
allow this."
</P>
<P>
The main money market rate, the repo, has been unchanged at
3.30 percent since February.
</P>
<P>
The bank decided to keep the rates on hold last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Australia Hit by Doping Scandal, Sampras and Graf Out of  Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia was hit by a second big
doping scandal this year as the opening of the Atlanta Olympics is
only three days away.
</P>
<P>
And besides of the Games' first doping controvercy, Tuesday
witnessed the Games lose the world's top tennis players - Steffi
Graf of Germany and Pete Sampras from United States.
</P>
<P>
Australian sprinter Dean Capobianco faced a four-year ban after
being tested positive for the steroid stanozolol, the very same
drug used by Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson in a scandal that
shocked and stained the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
After being stripped of his 100 meters gold medal, Johnson left
the South Korean capital in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
The latest dope scandal was a double embarrassment for
Australia, as Sydney is to host the Olympics in 2000 and its
sports chiefs have been campaigning vociferously against the use
of drugs.
</P>
<P>
In another blow to the Games three days before the opening
ceremony, Germany's Graf and American Sampras withdrew with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Graf, celebrating her seventh Wimbledon singles title, pulled
out with a persistent knee injury while Sampras suffered a
sprained right achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
But doping dominated the day's news in Atlanta. Athletics
sources said Italy was in danger of being banned from
international athletics if it failed to throw high jumper
Antonella Bevilacqua off its Olympic team after a positive dope
test in May.
</P>
<P>
Olympic medical chiefs claimed of having assembled
sophistigated equipment and doping experts for the centennial
Games trace anabolic steroids taken up to 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee medical commissioner Jordi
Segura revealed that 500 out of 39,000 dope tests the IOC carried
out last year were positive.
</P>
<P>
Romania's all-conquering women's gymnastic team, winners of the
last two world championships, also suffered a bitter blow after a
serious injury to Anamaria Bican left them one short.
</P>
<P>
Athletes arriving from all over the world had to wait up to six
hours to get their accreditation and the Hungarians asked for a
69,000 US dollars refund, claiming their Olympic village rooms
sub-standard.

</P>
<P>
The commission's co-chairmen, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore, signed four of
the documents, focusing on economic and technological cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the documents, the two countries agreed to cooperate in the
prevention of industrial and natural disasters while taking joint
steps to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also said they will implement a special
ecological initiative and will start the initial assembly of an
international space station which entails a schedule of stages in
the creation of the proposed Alpha space station.
</P>
<P>
The documents include a joint Russian-U.S. statement on
monitoring, guarding and transporting nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Moscow's President Hotel
following the meeting, Chernomyrdin said that the session had
disproved the skeptical forecasts and the outlook for bilateral
cooperation had never been better.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to lay emphasis on the expansion of investments in
the Russian economy," said Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Gore told the conference that the two countries were on the
threshold of a new period in which large investments would pour
into Russia.
</P>
<P>
At a business lunch for Russian and U.S. entrepreneurs in
Moscow's Metropol Hotel with Gore's attendance, Chernomyrdin said
the U.S. is now in the lead as concerns the volume of direct
investments in the Russian economy, with some 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars, or slightly less than one-third of all foreign
investments in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Russia and the U.S. "is becoming
increasingly smooth and rich in substance," added the Russian
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is taking a
rest, met with Gore, who arrived here last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Vice-President today also met with other high-ranking
officials including powerful Security Council Secretary Alexander
Lebed.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM Unhurt in Car Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, Ukraine, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian security services
have launched an investigation into a bomb which exploded under
the car of Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko as he was travelling to
Kiev airport early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko escaped unhurt when the remote-control bomb hit his
car as it approached a bridge over the Dnieper river on the way to
the airport at around 7:10 local time (3:10 GMT), security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which left a two-meter wide and 1.5-meter deep crater
in the road, was hidden in a roadside gutter and damaged the cars
of the prime minister and his security staff, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko was transferred into another vehicle and continued on
to the airport for a scheduled visit to Donetsk where 200,000 coal
miners have been on strike for back pay.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government has promised to pay arrears of up to
600 million U.S. dollars to miners by mid September.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko, 43, was appointed by Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma last month and approved by parliament on July 11, to
succeed his predecessor, Yevgeny Marchuk who was sacked for
failing to carry out economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The president promoted Lazarenko, a big Kuchma supporter, from
governor of Dnepropetrovsk to first deputy prime minister last
September.
</P>
<P>
Various theories have been offered for the bombing, including
rivalry between regional bosses fighting for influence in the
government and opposition to the closure of uneconomic mines. Some
suggested the bomb attack might have been a warning aimed at the
president.

<HEADLINE> 18 Olympic Squads Without Women Athletes: IOC Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- While a record number of 197 IOC
(International Olympic Committee) members will attend the
Centennial Olympic Games to be opened Friday, 18 delegations are
composed exclusively of men athletes, an IOC woman official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
These all-men teams are from Gabon, Mauritius, Uganda, Sierra
Leone, Swaziland, Bhutan, Cambodia, Mongolia, Macao, Singapore,
Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Pakistan, Iran and
Malaysia, said Anita DeFrantz, member of the IOC executive board.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure, based on the registration sheet, will be
changed as each team is enpowered to dispatch one woman and one
man to the athletics events without necessarily going through the
qualification process, she explained.
</P>
<P>
Besides, both Liechtenstein and Lebanon are represented solely
by women athletes with two from Liechtenstein and one from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
When women were first allowed into the Olympic Games in 1900 to
play golf and tennis, about 3,000 women took part in the Barcelona
Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the Atlanta Games, the figure will be one fourth higher,
with women taking part in 100 events of 20 sports.
</P>
<P>
"To promote women's sport, the IOC has decided that in future,
sports seeking to be included on the Olympic program must include
women's events," said DeFrantz.

ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United States,
the world's top-ranked tennis player, withdrew from the Atlanta
Olympic Games Tuesday due to an Achilles tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the women's No. 1, Steffi Graf of Germany,

</P>
<P>
Sampras was in Florida filming a TV commercial when the U.S.

The American ace has had a difficult season. His coach, Tim

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Meets with Jordanian PM in Tel Aviv </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu held an unexpected meeting with his Jordanian
counterpart Abdul Karim Kabariti late tonight in Tel Aviv to
discuss the peace process and Netanyahu's scheduled visit to Egypt
Thursday,
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian side initially asked the talks to be kept
secret, Israeli Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti is in an unannounced stopover visit on his way back
home from a trip to Egypt, where he held meetings with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
have stepped up coordination ahead of Netanyahu's visit to Egypt,
the first to any Arab country since he took office in June.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, PNA President Yasser Arafat also visited Cairo to
hold consultations with President Mubarak on the peace process and
Netanyahu's trip.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said after his meeting with al-Shara today that Arab
countries wanted to hear from Netanyahu, instead of judging him
and his politics through his statements.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister added that everything was
negotiable, and both sides of the negotiation wanted to see how
many concessions can be made to reach "a balanced peace."
</P>
<P>
However, al-Shara stressed the Arab world would reject any
attempt to change the ground rules in peace talks, reaffirming
Syria's "fixed" position that Israel must return the Golan
Heights it seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, the hardline Likud leader, has pledged to resume
peace talks with all Arab neighbors without preconditions, but he
did not mention the principle of land-for-peace on which the peace
process is based and ruled out any compromise on all critical
issues: the status of Jerusalem, establishment of an independent
Palestinian state and return of Golan Heights.

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The 8th International
Congress of the World Federation of the Public Health
Associations (WFPHA) is scheduled to be held in Arusha, Northern
Tanzania, on October 12-16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the National Congress Organizing Committee
(NCOC) of Tanzania, who is also Chairman of the Tanzania Public
Health Association (TPHA), Professor Wenceslaus Kilama told a
press conference at the TPHA's office in the city this evening
that the world conference, which is being held every three years,
would be held in Africa for the first time.
</P>
<P>
He said over 800 people were expected to attend the
conference, and Tanzania would be represented by over 200
participants.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Kilama, President-elect of WFPHA, said that currently,
the national conference organising committee was calling for
papers on the theme of the conference, which is "Health in
Transition: Opportunities and Challenges".
</P>
<P>
The sub-themes of the conference include issues of
epidemiological transition, population trends, health sector
reforms, nutrition, medical education, environment and drug
abuse, according to Prof. Kilama.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, Diane Kuntz, the WFPHA
Executive Secretary, who is now in the country to discuss with
the NCOC of Tanzanian preparations for the conference, said that
the world conference would be co-sponsored by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
She said that WFPHA, with a membership of 55 associations, one
from each country throughout the world, was dedicated to
promotion of public health in the world.
</P>
<P>
Kuntz said, during the Arusha conference WFPHA would come up
with recommendations to be forwarded to the WHO, which she said
despite a number of gains, had failed to meet its target of
health for all by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of new challenges which have emerged since
1978 when WHO set its targets, namely, AIDS, tuberculosis ebola
and malaria.

Tanzanian health Minister Zakia Meghji told the National

drug quality control lab in Dar es Salaam as soon as possible,
which had been stalled for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The minister said during the fiscal year of 1995/96,
inspection was done on more than 5.3 million tonnes of imported
foodstuffs, where 17,000 tonnes found to be unfit for human
consumption were condemned and destroyed.

<HEADLINE> US Cuts Aid to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States has cut its aid
to Zambia following the signing of its Constitution Amendment
Bill which bars former President Kenneth Kaunda from contesting
in the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stepanek, Director of the U.S. Agency of International
Development (UNAID) in Zambia, announced here today that the U.S.
has cut its aid by more than 10 percent, or one million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendment bill limits Zambians' right to choose
their president freely and seriously threatens the integrity and
credibility of the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Stepanek also said the Cliton administration will further
reduce its 1996 fiscal year bilateral aid program to Zambia from
19 million U.S. Dollars to 17.5 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> ANC Speaks On Shell House Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's largest
party, the African National Congress (ANC), said here today that
it is confident the police could handle the blast outside its
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"We called on all our communities to assist the police in
tracking down these criminals," said ANC in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A local-made hand-grenade went off Monday night outside the
Shell House in central Johannesburg, injuring a man and damaging
the building's glass doors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a press conference, ANC Deputy Secretary-general
Cheryl Carolus said there was a "strong possibility that third
force elements could be linked to the attack."
</P>
<P>
Carolus was referring to claims by several policemen that the
ANC was not giving its full cooperation in the police
investigation into the "Shell House shooting" on March 28, 1994,
in which eight Zulu marchers were shot dead outside the building.
</P>
<P>
However, the motive for the blast was still unknown and there
were no clear suspects at this stage, but a police spokesman said
the police had interviewed four witnesses and were following up
their statements.
</P>
<P>
The ANC statement also said that the blast could have been
aimed at deterring the party from pursuing those behind the 1994
attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Party, the Inkatha Freedom Party and
the Democratic Party all condemned the blast and called for those
responsible to be brought to justice.

ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- While a record number of 197 IOC
(International Olympic Committee) members will attend the
Centennial Olympic Games to be opened Friday, 19 delegations are
composed exclusively of men athletes, an IOC woman official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
These all-men teams are from Gabon, Mauritius, Uganda, Sierra
Leone, Swaziland, Bhutan, Cambodia, Mongolia, Macao, Singapore,
Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Lebanon, Pakistan,
Iran and Malaysia, said Anita DeFrantz, member of the IOC
executive board.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure, based on the registration sheet, will be
changed as each team is enpowered to dispatch one woman and one
man to the athletics events without necessarily going through the
qualification process, she explained.
</P>
<P>
Besides, both Liechtenstein and Lebanon are represented solely
by women athletes with two from Liechtenstein and one from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
When women were first allowed into the Olympic Games in 1900 to
play golf and tennis, about 3,000 women took part in the Barcelona
Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the Atlanta Games, the figure will be one fourth higher,
with women taking part in 100 events of 20 sports.
</P>
<P>
"To promote women's sport, the IOC has decided that in future,
sports seeking to be included on the Olympic program must include
women's events," said DeFrantz.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Undergo Ups and Downs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rocketed
back today from another ferocious round of selling as this month's
steep market correction in a most active trading.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.25 to 5,358.76.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where its volume totaled 680.31
million shares, making it the exchange's busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.87 to 336.80, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.42 to 628.38.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.60 to 1,051.59, less than 2
points above its starting point for the year, and the American
Stock Exchange's market value index fell 7.83 to 526.60.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq market was hit by another disappointing earnings
report from a leading computer-related business weighed down the
battered technology sector. Today's Nasdaq slid as much as 51
points this afternoon before rebounding its way back.
</P>
<P>
Today's Nasdaq slide erased all that was left of a stunning
18.7 percent rally in that index from January through early June.
</P>
<P>
Today, technology shares slid again after chipmaker Texas
Instruments reported that continued downward pressure on memory
chip prices pushed its second-quarter profit down 73 percent
compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The government reported this morning that consumer prices edged
up just 0.1 percent last month, the best inflation performance
since November, while industrial production posted a solid 0.5
percent increase. But the report seemed had little effect on the
market's performance.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Return of More Refugees to Bosnia, Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The return of Serb refugees to
Croatia's Krajina region has not even started and the amnesty law
issued by Croatian government has not led to mass repatriation of
refugees, a UNHCR official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Belgrade, U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) special envoy to the former
Yugoslavia Soren Jessen-Petersen said U.N. Security Council and
UNHCR are concerned about the situation in Croatia and hoped
Croatian government would do its best to allow more Serb refugees
to go back home.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 Serbs in Krajina fled their home in summer of
1995 after the Croatian government troops launched attacks on the
Serb-held areas in Croatia. Most of them flooded into Yugoslavia
to seek refugee asylum.
</P>
<P>
Since the Dayton agreement was signed Seven months ago, 100,000
refugees and displaced persons have returned home, Jessen-Petersen
said. But meanwhile, 90,000 people have been force to leave their
home and become new refugees, most of whom are Sarajevo Serbs who
fled before the capital city was reunited in March.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR figure, 25,000 people have so far returned
to the formerly Serb Sarajevo suburbs, including 10,000 Muslims
and croats.
</P>
<P>
"People are fleeing again mainly because groups and individuals
who had started the war and initiated ethnic divisions remain in
power in Bosnia, and also due to large-scale destruction which
makes it impossible to find accommodation for those who wish to
return," said Jessen-Petersen, who is in Yugoslavia on a
several-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"Political will of all sides is necessary to overcome
separatist aspirations and attempts to continue dividing people,"
the UNHCR official said, adding that the forthcoming elections in
Bosnia should bring about radical changes, otherwise the situation
with regard to refugees cannot improve.
</P>
<P>
The first post-war elections in Bosnia will be held on
September 14. The elections are believed to be crucial for the
future peace of the war-torn country and for reconciliation among
the three ethnic groups that fought a four-year war.

<HEADLINE> France Dispatches Vaccines to Balkans Fighting Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- France has dispatched 600,000 doses
of vaccine to the Balkans to fight the resurging epidemic foot and
mouth disease, said Le Monde daily for its Wednesday edition.
</P>
<P>
The Le Monde report said that the new resurgence of foot and
mouth disease, dreaded for a long time in Europe, has aroused deep
concern of the European Commission, which is taking measures to
stem the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the epidemic was first reported among
an old state-owned cattle firm in Drithas, southern Albania in
May, and it rapidly infected cows and pigs in neighboring areas
within several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Albania has not reported any case of foot and mouth disease
since 1960, and so it was unprepared when the epidemic virus began
to circulate very quickly, said the report.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, similar cases were reported by Macedonia in
its Skopje and Titov Veles regions, and a British laboratory
confirmed through studying the viruses submitted by Albania and
Macedonia that the epidemic belongs to the same type.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia immediately slaughtered 3,000 cattles diagnosed with
the disease and banned sale and transport of cattle around the
country. Meanwhile, the epidemic was also reported in Kosovo in
the Yugoslav Federation, and Northeast Greece bordering Turkey.
</P>
<P>
After finding 30 new cases of the disease among cattles, the
Greek government ordered on Monday the slaughtering of 7,000
cattles in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Commission has banned Greece from
exporting cattles until a lift is made on the ban.
</P>
<P>
"Several elements could explain the resurgence of this
disease," Francois Moutou of the French National Center of
Veterinarian and Food Studies said in an interview with Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the split of the USSR,
the circuit of cattle trade has been completely disrupted. While
the former southern states of the USSR sell their cattles to
Russia, they are re-sold to the further west countries to get
money," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the virus of the epidemic follows the cattle
as well as the dead bodies of the cattle, especially when the
cattles are newly slaughtered and frozen.
</P>
<P>
"Albania has recently imported large quantities of beef and
frozen buffalos. One can imagine that the leftouts of the beef
were eaten by pigs which were infected before contaminating in
their turn the cows," said Moutou.

<HEADLINE> UK Welcomes Clinton's Decision on Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government welcomed
today U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to suspend suing
foreign companies with trade links with Cuba, saying that it was a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said in a statement
issued this evening that Clinton's six-month suspension of the
right to sue foreign companies under the controversial
Helms-Burton Act was a good thing.
</P>
<P>
"This means that there will be no court proceedings this year.
We are glad that the U.S. Administration have pulled back from the
brink in this way," Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary noted, "we hope to use this opportunity
to encourage genuine international dialogue on how best to promote
democratic change in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
However, Rifkind stressed that he regretted Washinton's
decision not to waive provisions that threaten to punish those
foreign companies, which have business links with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a British government official said that Britain
would consider applying tougher restrictions on certain categories
of U.S. citizens if Washington went ahead with their actions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Washington announced that the first punitive
sanctions against a foreign company under the law, saying some
executives of the Canadian mining firm Sherritt International
Corp, including former deputy governor of the Bank of England
Rupert Pennant-Rea, would not be allowed to travel in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> WFUNA Issues First Day Cover for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Federation of
United Nations Associations (WFUNA) announced here that Nina Kung
Wang, a noted Hong Kong woman entrepreneur, has created for WFUNA
a painting for the limited edition silk-screen print and first day
cover for Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The silk-screen prints and first day covers will accompany the
July 19 United Nations stamp issue, designed by Leroy Neiman,
commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The painting for the first day cover, entitled "Nina Tower," is
truly a testament to Nina Kung Wang's creativity and secret
passion for painting, WFUNA said.
</P>
<P>
"She displays instinctive use of line, form and shape in
creation of this magnificent Chinese brush painting -- revealing
her compassion and aspiration with every brush stroke," WFUNA
said.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic ideal permeates throughout the painting: "Nina
Tower" soars towards the sun, depicting Nina's ambition to
"compete with the universe," the sun itself symbolizes peace,
happiness and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Born in Shanghai, Nina Kung Wang was a student of design in her
early years at the New York School of Interior Design and attained
the skill of painting from Professor Zhao Shao-ang and late
Professor Lu Shou-kun. She is chairlady of the Chinachem Group,
one of the largest private real estate corporation in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Carl Bildt Submits to UN Second Report on Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The second report of Carl
Bildt, the High Representative in Bosnia, has been sent to U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, U.N. spokesman Sylvana
Foa said today.
</P>
<P>
She said the report which has been transmitted to the Security
Council covers the period from March to June and is a quite
lengthy report.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Bildt described the records of compliance by the
parties to the Bosnian peace agreement, and called it a mix bag.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress in the daily life of ordinary people, the
political tension that caused and drove the war is much evident,
Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
He says economy is gradually coming back to life. However out
of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars U.N. asked for reconstruction, only
one billion U.S. dollars have been pledged so far.
</P>
<P>
On refugee and displaced, Bildt said while some of them are
coming back, practically all of them who are returning are
returning to areas where their own ethnic group is a majority.
People are not going back to the areas where their group has not
been a majority.
</P>
<P>
He said further more a large number of new refugees and
displaced persons have been generated as a result of transfers of
territories. So we have more new refugees and we have people going
back, he said.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Bildt reports that parties are not
implementing commitments to respect them. Of particular concern is
the pattern of either encouragement or tolerance of ethnic
harassment. He says this causes the country to continue to drift
apart contrary to declared aim to reestablishing a multi ethnic
society.
</P>
<P>
He said none of the parties has cooperated fully with the
international criminal tribunal and handed over the indicted
persons. He listed those who are still indicted and said that 50
are likely to be found in the Republika Srpska, 15 on the
territory of the federation, with some also seen in Croatia, and 3
on the territory in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They has
not turned over the indicted in spite of promises.
</P>
<P>
On the nations-wide elections now scheduled for the 14th
September, he said organizing the election is really very hard.
More than half of the electorate is still displaced. Freedom of
movement and communication inside the country are still seriously
restricted. However, he said the election is the key.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all the problems, Bildt said he is
convinced the goal of the peace agreement can be achieved, even
though this may take more than just one year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Action on Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday told governors that if Congress fails to quickly approve
welfare reform legislation he would give them the power to end
benefits if recipients did not take jobs within two years.
</P>
<P>
"One way or another, we will make work and responsibility the
law of the land," Clinton said in a speech via satellite to the
National Governors Association conference in Fajardo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Congress already has "taken long strides in the
right direction" on welfare reform and should finish the job.
</P>
<P>
He called on Congress to approve welfare legislation before its
August recess, and said if that failed to happen, he would issue
an executive order allowing states to cut off welfare benefits
after two years if able-bodied recipients refused to take jobs.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Clinton praised the Wisconsin plan, for having a
tough work requirement while also guaranteeing health and child
care.
</P>
<P>
Progress on welfare reform is considered possible because
Republican leaders have agreed to separate welfare legislation
from a more controversial plan to turn Medicaid into a block grant
program. Clinton had vetoed an earlier Republican measure that
included the Medicaid changes.

<HEADLINE> Three Big American Auto Makers Shed White Collars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The three big American auto
makers--Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and the
General Motors Corporation--are planning to shed employees from
their auto operations with a view to reducing costs and bringing
in employees with new skills.
</P>
<P>
The Ford Motor Company will offer early retirement packages to
white-collar workers in an effort to shed 2,000 employees around
the world by the end of the year, New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move is Ford's first in five years for administrators and
middle managers. Ford focused on well-paid mangers and executives
in its packages over the last two years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ford's goal is to shrink its global work force to 78,000. The
company has restructured during the last 18 months into five
vehicle development centers and plans to combine two of them by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Chrysler Corporation started offering
early retirement packages to 1,200 of its 20,400 salaried staff in
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The General Motors Corporation is also offering voluntary
separation plans to a "small number" of people.

<HEADLINE> Economic and Human Development Must Move Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth and human
development must move together in the long run. "Human development
cannot be sustained without economic growth nor growth without
human development," an official of the United Nations Development
Program said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement for the release of the Human Development Report
1996, the seventh of this pathbreaking series, Rafeeuddin Ahmed,
Associate Administrator of UNDP, said that the record of economic
growth and human development over the past three decades shows
that no country can follow a course of lop-sided development for
too long -- where economic growth is not matched by advances in
human development or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
For example, Brazil, Egypt, and Lesotho experienced relatively
high economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s with below-average
human development. Since they were unable to fully translate their
growth into better education and health, their lack of a broad
base of human capital started acting as a strong brake on their
economic growth in the 1980s, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China and Indonesia started in 1960-70 with
fast human development and slow growth. As human capital
accumulated, both these countries managed a very rapid advance
both in growth and human development, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There is hardly any instance where advances in economic growth
and human development have remained divorced from each other for
too long a period," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the links between economic growth and human
development are not automatic. They must be deliberately forged
and regularly fortified through skillful and intelligent policy
management.
</P>
<P>
The great contribution that human capital makes to economic
growth is being increasingly recognized now. According to a recent
World Bank study of 192 countries, physical capital accounts for
only 16 percent of total wealth of nations, natural capital for
another 20 percent, human and social capital for as much as 64
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Education, particularly of females, plays a major role in
advancing economic growth and human development. Skill training
and judicious investment in research and development can further
enlarge development opportunities, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government says Economy to Grow Faster This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said today
that the economy will grow more quickly than it had been expected
and more budget deficit will be cut in this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In a revised government economic forecast released here today,
the Clinton administration predicted that the overall U.S.
economy, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), will
rise by 2.6 percent this year when measured from the fourth
quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government had forecast in last March that the GDP would
grow only 2.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
On inflation, the administration predicted consumer prices
would climb by 3.2 percent this year, only slightly worse than its
March forecast of a 3.1 percent rise in consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
Through the first six months of this year, consumer inflation
has been rising at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, the U.S. Labor
Department reported today. That marks a sharp increase from last
year's 2.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In the latest economic forecast, the White House predicted that
the government budget deficit of fiscal 1996, which ends on
September 30, will shrink to 116.8 billion dollars this year, 29
billion lower than administration forecasts of last March.
</P>
<P>
The new estimate for the deficit of fiscal 1996 would be
another cut from a deficit estimate of 146 billion dollars in the
year when Clinton submitted his budget proposal of fiscal 1997 to
the U.S. Congress in March.
</P>
<P>
It also would reflect a big decline from an actual deficit of
164 billion dollars for the 1995 budget year and would mark the
fourth straight year of declining deficits.
</P>
<P>
The White House has been boasting it as one of its major
economic success that the budget deficit has been cut by about
half since Clinton took office in 1993. And President Clinton has
made it a key talking point in his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"This is a victory not only for the president and those who
work for him, but more importantly for the American people," said
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta today.
</P>
<P>
The administration's mid-session review of the economy was
being released in the same week that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan will deliver to Congress the Fed's revised estimates of
how the economy is performing.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe Greenspan will signal in his appearance
Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed is
poised to start raising interest rates to cool the economy and
make sure inflation does not become a problem.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decides to Impose Six-month Moratorium on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today decided to impose a six-month moratorium on lawsuits against
foreign firms while pledging to implement a tough anti-Cuba law he
signed in March under strong pressure from the
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, named after its
sponsors, lawsuits could be filed in U.S. courts against any
foreign firms that buy or sell the properties of U.S. citizens
seized by the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro after the
1959 Cuba revolution.
</P>
<P>
The law has provoked bitter criticism from America's European
allies as well as Canada and Mexico. European Commission President
Jacques Santer Monday threatened to make a swift and decisive
response if Washington decided to allow the law to come into force
today.
</P>
<P>
"The president (Clinton) has decided today to use the authority
provided by Congress to maximize Title III's effectiveness in
encouraging our allies to work with us to promote democracy in
Cuba. He will allow Title III to come into force," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry told a special press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said that at the same time Clinton "will
suspend the right to file suit for six months."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration's inconclusiveness of the decision
was sharply criticized by Clinton's Republican rival, Bob Dole and
the Cuban-American community.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Stresses Job Creation in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Job creation serves as the
essential bridge between economic growth and human development, an
official of the United Nations Development Program said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Rafeeuddin Ahmed, Associate Administrator of UNDP, said that
economic growth becomes real to people only when they can find
productive and well-paid jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, economic growth does not always create more
jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent study of 69 countries over the last decade showed that
of 46 countries experiencing economic growth, only 27 countries
saw their employment grow while 19 countries experienced jobless
growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rates have reached unprecedented levels in the
last decade, both in industrial and in developing countries. Such
high unemployment particularly hits youth the hardest -- youth
unemployment reached over 20 percent in quite a few countries, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Women often face more hurdles in the job market than men do.
Globally, some 70 percent of the world's 1.3 billion poor are
females. Women's earnings average 75 percent those of men, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to formulate comprehensive employment
strategies in all countries, focusing both on overall job
creation and on protecting the most vulnerable groups in society,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Such strategy should include at least five specific components
as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- a political commitment to full employment;
</P>
<P>
-- sustained investments in human capabilities;
</P>
<P>
-- broader access to land credit;
</P>
<P>
-- encouragement of the informal sector; and
</P>
<P>
-- labor-intensive strategies.

PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- France and Russia will sign an
agreement Wednesday in Moscow on commonly exploiting the Russian
Soyuz space launcher, French Minister of Space Francois Fillon
said in an interview with the Les Echo daily in its Wednesday
edition.
</P>
<P>
Fillon said that the action is "a reaction by Europe to the
alliance built by Americans between the Lockheed-Martin group and
(the Russian space launcher) Proton".
</P>
<P>
France and Russia will set up a joint company of space
technology Starsem with the objective of better competing in the
world space market for both countries, according to Fillon.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Parliament Adopts Law on Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav parliament passed a
law today on citizenship which will disqualify most of the 700,000
refugees from obtaining permanent Yugoslav citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Yugoslav citizenship is acquired on the basis of
descent, birth, application or international agreements and it
ceases if revoked, renounced or on the basis of international
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Individuals who had the citizenships of the Yugoslav republics
of Serbia and Montenegro on April 27, 1992, when the constitution
was promulgated, and their children born thereafter will
automatically be considered Yugoslav citizens," Yugoslav Tanjug
news agency quoted Yugoslav Interior Minister Vukasin Jokanovic as
explaining.
</P>
<P>
Dual citizenship is envisaged only as an exception and
applications for it will be decided by the Yugoslav government,
according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates that citizens of other republics of the
former Yugoslavia will get Yugoslav citizenship only if they had
permanent residence on Yugoslav territory before April 27, 1992,
have no other citizenship and apply for Yugoslav citizenship
within a year's time.
</P>
<P>
Although Jokanovic said the law allows citizens of other former
Yugoslav republics to apply for Yugoslav citizenship, local
observers say such regulation will make the refugees, who flooded
into Yugoslavia from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia over the past
five years, difficult to get Yugoslav citizenship and force them
to return to the places of their origin.

<HEADLINE> Canada Encouraged by Clinton's Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said today
that it is encouraged by U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to
suspend the right of U.S. companies to sue under the claims
provisions of the Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
However, Canada will move ahead with changes to the Foreign
Extraterritorial Measures Act so that it can be used by Canadian
companies should Clinton's decision be reversed in the future.
</P>
<P>
As to its request for a North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) dispute settlement panel, Canada will be reassessing the
situation in light of this decision, according to a statement
issued by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade shortly after Clinton's announcement.
</P>
<P>
While encouraged by the decision, Canadian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Lloyd Axworthy, International Trade Minister Art Eggleton
and Minister for International Cooperation and for la Francophonie
Pierre Pettigrew also reiterated their concerns about the
continuing threat posed by the U.S. Act to Canadian interests.
</P>
<P>
"The president's decision to suspend the filing of legal claims
is a move in the right direction," Axworthy noted.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's strong leadership on this issue has built an
international consensus that the United States cannot ignore. We
will continue our work with other countries to convince the
Americans to uphold the principles of international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision reduces, for the time being, a significant
threat to Canadian companies, said Eggleton, adding that this
mitigates the impact of the Act but does not dispose of the issue.
</P>
<P>
"It still leaves a climate of uncertainty regarding future U.S.
intentions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We need to maintain our concerted efforts with the
international community, including with respect to other
provisions in the Act, such as the continuing entry restrictions,"
Eggleton added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision means that the claims provisions of the
Helms-Burton Act will come into effect on August 1, but a
claimant's right to sue under these same provisions will be
suspended for a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
While this removes the immediate threat of lawsuits against
Canadian and other foreign companies, it will allow potential
claimants to notify alleged "traffickers," and will also allow
claimants to file claims without the normal 90-day waiting period
should the U.S. president reverse his decision.
</P>
<P>
Canada has objected strongly to Helms-Burton Act. In addition
to pursuing the matter through NAFTA channels, Canada has been
working vigorously with other countries to oppose the U.S. law in
regional, hemispheric and multilateral forums, including the G-7
Summit in France.

<HEADLINE> White House Aide Denies Obstructing IRS Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- White House deputy counsel
Bruce Lindsey Tuesday denied that he asked an Arkansas banker to
keep Bill Clinton's 1990 campaign cash transactions secret from
the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, an unindicted co-conspirator in the Whitewater trial
of Perry County Bank co-owners Herby Branscum Jr. and Robert M.
Hill, contradicted testimony from a key prosecution witness,
former bank president Neal Ainley, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Branscum and Hill are accused of conspiring with Lindsey, the
1990 campaign treasurer, to keep the bank from reporting to the
Internal Revenue Service two large cash withdrawals made by
Clinton's 1990 re-election campaign for governor, 30,000 dollars
just before the May 1990 primary and 22,500 dollars prior to the
November general election. The IRS required reports on deposits
and withdrawal of 10,000 dollars and more.
</P>
<P>
Ainley, who has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors for failing
to file Cash Transaction Reports, alleged Branscum instructed him
to do what Lindsey wanted, and Lindsey told him not to file the
reports.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Takes Measures against Foot-and-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav authorities are taking
extensive measures to halt the outbreak of the foot-and-mouth
disease that was recently found in the southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The task force in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo
announced today that infected cattle had been registered in the
Gora border municipality towards Albania and the municipality has
been proclaimed emergency area, Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav health authorities have so far slaughtered 250
infected cattle in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Some other towns in Kosovo where the disease have been found
have also been proclaimed emergency areas.
</P>
<P>
"All necessary measures have been taken in the emergency areas,
checkpoints have been set up and entry into these places is not
possible without a special permit," Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The infectious disease, which can also affect humans, was first
founded last week in Kosovo, which is bordering Macedonia and
Albania. Foot-and-mouth disease broke out in these two countries
last month.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug quoted an official of Serbia's Agriculture Ministry,
Sinisa Bradonjih, as saying today that "stiffer inspection
measures have been taken in central and northern part of
Yugoslavia to prevent any possibility of the disease from
spreading from the south."

<HEADLINE> Chirac Justifies Africa's Bid to Obtain Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today said Africa "is on the good lane" and that it is
justifiable to help it move on on this lane.
</P>
<P>
In a speech addressed to the French community in Libreville,
Gabon, Chirac said that there is a general trend of
"disengagement" in the provision of aid to Africa among the most
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in Libreville today to start a three-day visit
to Gabon and Congo, his third tour to Africa since he became
president.
</P>
<P>
"The morale, and also political interests, justify a special
effort (to help Africa)," Agence France Presse quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He praised the French enterprises in Gabon for helping develop
local economy while making profits from it.
</P>
<P>
"You naturally and legitimately have the ambition of finding
here the success of your enterprises, and hoping to draw profits
from them," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, you have created a movement, an impulsion. You are
going in the direction of this development that Africa, which we
all love, needs so much. You are one of the forces (of Africa),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on African countries to strengthen law in their
state system in order to win confidence from its own people as
well as from abroad.

BELGRADE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The police arrested three persons
today in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo on charges of
possessing a large quantity of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency said the three persons were found to possess
20 automatic rifles, two snipers, three pistols, four
walkie-talkies, a modern radio unit and a large quantity of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with 90 percent of the 2 million population as ethnic
Albanians, has for decades been the stage of the activity of a
strong Albanian separatist movement, which has illegally
proclaimed "the Republic of Kosovo." The separatists have been
trying to break away from Yugoslavia to join neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Seven persons have been killed in terrorist attacks in Kosovo
since April, of whom Six were Serbs, including three policemen.
